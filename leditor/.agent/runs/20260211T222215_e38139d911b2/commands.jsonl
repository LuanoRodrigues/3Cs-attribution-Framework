If details are missing, make reasonable assumptions and proceed.\n- If validation fails, continue patching and retrying autonomously until resolved or hard-blocked.\n\nTools:\n- Use exec to run failing commands/tests and to validate fixes.\n- Use fs_read_text to inspect. Use fs_write_text to apply fixes.\n\nSafety:\n- Do not attempt to access restricted paths (.git, .agent, node_modules, .env, key files).\n- Do not run destructive commands via exec.\n\nReporting:\n- Keep user-facing output concise.\n- Do not include raw command transcripts or long failure logs in the main answer.\n- Verbose details belong in logs/artifacts.\n\nBefore each tool call, briefly explain why you are calling it (one sentence).\n\n\n\nUser request:\n\ncreate a plan to refine the mini engine and the rules for inline split and breaking content into pages. currently many white spaces exist in pages and we should create various plans to implement and test. in /scripts we have some testings and you should check for each page if it has no greater white space like page 16, 23 that have almost half empty\n\n## Context Pack\nUse the following retrieved context while implementing.
