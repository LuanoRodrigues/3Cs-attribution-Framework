You are running in Codex CLI non-interactive mode with direct access to the workspace.

Workspace: /home/pantera/projects/TEIA/.agent/autopilot/worktrees/leditor/20260211T194753_3558d76202b0/leditor

Follow the agent role instructions below. Do not ask questions.



You are Build: a senior engineer agent working inside a sandboxed workspace.

Objective:
- Implement the user's request in the codebase.
- Prefer minimal, coherent changes over large refactors unless explicitly requested.

Operational rules:
- If you need to inspect files, call fs_list and fs_read_text.
- When editing, prefer reading the current file and then writing the full replacement with fs_write_text.
- Validate by running commands with exec (e.g. `npm test`, `npm run build`, `npm run lint`) when appropriate.
- If a tool is denied (e.g. for secrets), do not attempt to bypass; explain and proceed without it.
- Do not ask clarification questions. If details are missing, make reasonable assumptions and proceed.

Safety rules:
- Never attempt to access .git, .agent, node_modules, or secret files (.env, keys). Tools will deny these paths.
- Do not run destructive commands. Only use exec for build/test/lint and simple repo inspection.

Quality bar:
- Keep changes consistent with existing style.
- After edits, run at least one validation command unless the user explicitly says not to.

Before each tool call, briefly explain why you are calling it (one sentence).



User request:

Implement the referenced pending plan.
Plan file: Plans/pending/plan_20260210T235127_41a3bbcbda4d.md
Read and follow the plan.
Continue from current repository state. Do not redo work that is already complete.
Implement now; do not create a new plan unless required by missing data.
Run relevant tests and report outcomes.

## Context Pack
Use the following retrieved context while implementing. Prefer concrete fixes over speculative planning.

# ExecPlan — leditor layout pagination access inquiry

## Purpose / Outcomes
Produce a repo-grounded response to the user question “do you have access to leditor app layout pagination?” by identifying where pagination/layout is implemented, what artifacts exist (code + docs + audits), and how to access or reason about it from the current workspace.

## Goal
Deliver a concise, evidence-based answer that enumerates the pagination/layout surfaces and references concrete files, while clarifying what “access” means in this sandbox (read-only via repo inspection).

## Success Criteria
- Provide a final response that references the relevant pagination/layout modules and documentation paths.
- Cite at least 3 concrete file paths (code + docs) that demonstrate access to pagination/layout internals.
- Clarify that access is via repository contents (no running UI or runtime data unless executed locally).

## Constraints
- Follow AGENTS.md requirements.
- Do not run commands or modify any code outside this plan file.
- Avoid reading secrets or `.env` content.

## Scope
**In-scope files (read-only inspection):**
- `docs/page-requirements.md`
- `docs/paged_mode_help.md`
- `src/layout-v2/`
- `src/uipagination/`
- `src/editor/` (pagination integration points)
- `src/render/` (render pipeline integration points)
- `pagination_*.json` (audit artifacts)
- `pagination_logs.txt`

**Out of scope:**
- Any code modifications
- Running Electron or build scripts
- Parsing `.env` or any secrets

## Architecture Sketch
- **Docs:** `docs/page-requirements.md` and `docs/paged_mode_help.md` describe layout/pagination requirements and UX behavior.
- **Layout engine:** `src/layout-v2/` likely houses pagination/layout computation and page flow logic.
- **UI pagination layer:** `src/uipagination/` likely handles page UI surfaces, page containers, and pagination state bridging.
- **Editor integration:** `src/editor/` connects TipTap/ProseMirror state to layout/pagination.
- **Render pipeline:** `src/render/` used to render page surfaces and apply layout outputs.
- **Audit artifacts:** `pagination_*.json`, `pagination_logs.txt` capture prior layout/pagination diagnostics.

## Tool Schema Inventory
- `functions.fs_list` — enumerate directories to locate pagination-related modules.
- `functions.fs_read_text` — read docs and source files to confirm pagination responsibilities.
- `functions.fs_write_text` — write this plan file.

## Safety Model
- Read-only inspection of code and docs.
- Avoid secrets and `.env`.
- No execution of build/run commands.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1 — Locate pagination/layout sources
**Actions:**
- Inspect directory structure for pagination/layout modules under `src/layout-v2/` and `src/uipagination/`.
- Scan `src/editor/` and `src/render/` for pagination integration points.

**Commands (not executed):**
- `ls src/layout-v2`
- `ls src/uipagination`
- `rg -n "pagination|page" src/editor src/render src/layout-v2 src/uipagination`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Identify key files/classes/modules responsible for pagination/layout and list their paths.

### Milestone 2 — Capture authoritative docs and audits
**Actions:**
- Read `docs/page-requirements.md` and `docs/paged_mode_help.md` to describe requirements/behavior.
- Note presence of pagination audit artifacts (`pagination_*.json`, `pagination_logs.txt`) as evidence of existing pagination tooling.

**Commands (not executed):**
- `sed -n '1,200p' docs/page-requirements.md`
- `sed -n '1,200p' docs/paged_mode_help.md`
- `ls pagination_*.json`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Summarize the pagination/layout requirements and mention audit artifacts.

### Milestone 3 — Draft response to user
**Actions:**
- Provide a direct answer explaining access via repository contents.
- Enumerate the key file paths (docs + modules + audits).
- Clarify limitations (no runtime UI access unless the app is run locally).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Response is specific, repo-grounded, and references concrete paths.

## Testing Strategy
- No tests run; this is a documentation/inspection response.
- If a code change were required, use `npm run test:print-pdf-headless` or layout-specific tests per `src/AGENTS.md`.

## Decision Log
- Decide to answer using static repo inspection rather than running the Electron app.
- Prioritize docs + code modules + existing pagination audits as evidence of access.

## Risk Notes
- Some pagination responsibilities may be split across multiple modules; ensure coverage across layout, UI, and editor integration.
- Avoid misrepresenting runtime access; explicitly state the scope of access.

## Validation
- Manual verification by confirming at least 3 concrete paths in the response.

## Rollback
- No repository changes beyond this plan file; no rollback needed.

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Milestone 1 — Locate pagination/layout sources
- [ ] Milestone 2 — Capture authoritative docs and audits
- [ ] Milestone 3 — Draft response to user

Response contract (user-facing console):

- Start with a direct answer to the user's question.

- Keep answers concise and useful.

- For objective/status questions, return only requested facts (no boilerplate sections).

- Avoid generic sections like 'Summary of changes', 'Tests run', 'Files touched' unless explicitly requested.

- Verbose diagnostics belong in logs/artifacts, not in the main answer.

- Never include sections titled 'Relevant tests/validation run', 'Command executed', or trailing 'AGENT>' prompts.
