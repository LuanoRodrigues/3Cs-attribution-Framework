Tests were run, and the targeted validations for this run are passing.
I added deterministic tests at `scripts/layout_v2_ts_runtime.test.mjs` and `scripts/pagination_page_cases_eval.test.cjs` (with a minimal testability refactor in `scripts/pagination_page_cases.cjs` to lazy-load Electron and export helpers).
Executed successfully: `node --test scripts/layout_v2_ts_runtime.test.mjs scripts/pagination_page_cases_eval.test.cjs`, `npm run test:layout-v2`, and `npm run test:layout-v2:compare` (`snapshot OK`).
Electron-based pagination integration tests could not run in this sandbox because `electron`/full app dependencies are not available offline.
