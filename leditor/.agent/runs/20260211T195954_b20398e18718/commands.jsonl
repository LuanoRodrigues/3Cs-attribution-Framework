If details are missing, make reasonable assumptions and proceed.\n\nSafety rules:\n- Never attempt to access .git, .agent, node_modules, or secret files (.env, keys). Tools will deny these paths.\n- Do not run destructive commands. Only use exec for build/test/lint and simple repo inspection.\n\nQuality bar:\n- Keep changes consistent with existing style.\n- After edits, run at least one validation command unless the user explicitly says not to.\n\nBefore each tool call, briefly explain why you are calling it (one sentence).\n\n\n\nUser request:\n\nImplement the referenced pending plan.\nPlan file: Plans/pending/plan_20260211T081515_227acb861877.md\nRead and follow the plan.\nContinue from current repository state. Do not redo work that is already complete.\nImplement now; do not create a new plan unless required by missing data.\nRun relevant tests and report outcomes.\n\n## Context Pack\nUse the following retrieved context while implementing.
