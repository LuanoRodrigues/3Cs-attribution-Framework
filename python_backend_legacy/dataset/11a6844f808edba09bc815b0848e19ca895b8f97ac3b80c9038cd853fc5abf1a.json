Despite its vast benefits, however, it has also been used to cause severe damage to states. Hostile cyber activities seem to have occurred more frequently over the past years. It is already recognised that international law – thus also the law on state responsibility – is applicable to cyber-related issues. However, particularly in the context of inter-state relations, the question of how states are able to seek reparation in front of the International Court of Justice for damage caused by a cyber-attack conducted by a state remains open to debate. This is primarily due to the fact that the cyber sphere enjoys a considerable amount of anonymity, which makes it hard to establish the main perpetrator behind an act. Therefore, calls have been made to shift the burden of proof or to lower the evidentiary standard required by the Court. In this article, the present authors will assess the relevant case law of the Court and apply it to two scenarios: a cyber-attack violating the prohibition of use of force and the non-intervention principle. The aim is to display the Court's line of reasoning and assess whether the scholarly demands to ease evidentiary issues, by shifting the burden or lowering the standard of proof, are justified or not. Additionally, the present authors will address a yet in the cyber-context unexplored, but nevertheless, important tool in collecting sufficient evidence: the power of the Court to appoint experts.\n\nKEYWORDS: cyber-attack, attribution, state responsibility, evidence, International Court of Justice, burden of proof, standard of proof\n\n* Isabella Brunner works in the Office of the Legal Adviser (Department of Public International Law) at the Austrian Federal Ministry for Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs.

Introduction\n\nSince the emergence of the Internet in the 1980s, various actors – both private and governmental – became the target of foreign cyber operations.¹ While thus being a ‘relatively’ new phenomenon in our society, it is unquestionable that their frequency and impact is rising with each year. This is owed to the fact that nowadays, individuals, private companies and governments increasingly and more intensely operate online.²\n\nCyber operations targeted against states themselves generally aim to bring down governmental infrastructures, such as computer systems of institutions and governmental web pages. This has occurred, for instance, in Estonia and Georgia, where several facilities were brought down through so-called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.³ Another operation that has created widespread interest among international lawyers and remains heavily debated is the cyber hack into the emails of the US Democratic National Committee during the 2016 US presidential elections. One of the most recent large-scale cyber operations was the so-called NotPetya attack on 27 June 2017, targeting primarily Ukraine.⁴ However, the most consequential cyber operation so far remains the 2010 attack on Iran's Natanz nuclear facility plant, which is believed to have been carried out by Israel and the US. Through an infected USB device, it allegedly led to the physical damage of a significant number of centrifuges.⁵\n\nAs demonstrated above, the methods of launching a cyber-attack may vary in many ways (be it a DDoS attack or infiltration of malicious software). Nevertheless, all cyber-attacks so far have had one thing in common: the attacker was and remains fairly difficult to determine. As a consequence, it appears\n\n1.

These factual difficulties, however, have significant legal consequences, especially because they will most certainly prevent state responsibility from being triggered, which thus gradually undermines the international legal order. Thus, although victim states often have at least an educated guess on the identity of the actual perpetrator, they remain reluctant to point fingers. And while some states have publicly accused other states for cyber operations in the past,⁸ so far none has resorted to international litigation in an attempt to pursue reparation. In fact, to date there has not been a single dispute on this issue brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ).\n\nThis contribution therefore explores how far the past case law of the ICJ gives guidance on how it might deal with a case concerning state responsibility for an injury arising out of a cyber-attack.⁹\n\nFor the purpose of this article, cyber-attacks shall be considered to constitute any state-operated hostile intrusion into the cyber facilities of another state.¹⁰ Thus, the focus lies solely on cyber activities conducted by a state\n\n6.

Thereafter, in section 3, the contribution provides a general overview over the ICJ’s past jurisprudence on its evidentiary standards and clarifies the standards the Court has required in the past for the establishment of certain breaches of international law. In particular, two possible breaches, the violation of the use of force principle and the prohibition of non-intervention and their attribution to a state are of interest in the case of cyber-attacks. In this context, the present authors will also address the newest large-scale cyber operations and conclude if they could be considered a violation of these two principles (section 4). Thereafter, the specific standard of proof required by the Court when examining the violation of the prohibition of the threat or use of force and non-intervention principle, as well as the burden of proof, will be addressed in more detail. Finally, in section 5, already suggested solutions by legal scholars to overcome evidentiary difficulties related to cyber-attacks will be analysed: shifting the burden of proof and lowering the evidentiary standard used by the Court (sections 5.1 and 5.2). The present authors will additionally address a significant topic that has been disregarded so far, namely the extremely difficult task to collect sufficient evidence in the cyber-context. Thus, without the Court’s involvement, it is the authors’ contention that it would be almost impossible for states to meet the required evidentiary standard (section 5.3).\n\n## 2.

Burden of proof means that the party who asserts a fact in the proceeding is also the party who bears the burden of proving it,⁴⁵ namely ‘to convince the Court of the truthfulness of its claim’.⁴⁶ Only after it becomes clear which party bears the burden of proof, the Court is called upon to decide on the necessary standard.⁴⁷ In this sense, the standard of proof stipulates which degree of probability has to be provided by the party to convince the Court⁴⁸ or more specifically, the quantum of proof that has to be shown in order to ‘[...] discharge the burden of proof when that burden rests upon [that party]’.⁴⁹ Looking at the rare amount of cases where the ICJ has touched upon the question of evidentiary standards, it becomes evident that there is not a single standard for all disputes arising before it.⁵⁰ In cases concerning state responsibility,⁵¹ the actual standard of proof in a given case is determined by the substantive nature of the obligation, which was breached and is claimed by a party.⁵²\n\n⁴⁴.

Accordingly, Judge Greenwood pointed out that if cases exist where a state claims charges of exceptional gravity against another state, there have to be cases where a party claims less serious breaches and in those disputes, a lower standard of proof would be appropriate.⁵⁷ While the Bosnian Genocide case clearly shows that the ICJ requires a higher degree of certainty for serious charges, it is more difficult to perceive the exact difference between – in what seems like – a variety of evidentiary standards mentioned in the Court’s other case law.

To establish international responsibility, one must have clear and indisputable facts.’⁶⁵\n\nIn the authors’ opinion, this seems plausible. The application of a balance of probabilities standard essentially means that the truthfulness of an allegation has to be ‘more probable than not’⁶⁶ compared to the evidence submitted by the alleged perpetrator. This, however, cannot suffice to establish international responsibility convincingly. Such a low standard might very easily lead to a false attribution of internationally wrongful acts, which ultimately were not committed by the state, although it might indeed seem this way.⁶⁷ Accordingly, it is important to highlight that the Court itself never used a balance of probabilities standard with regard to a state responsibility case.\n\nThe *Corfu Channel* case also indicates that proof beyond reasonable doubt, a standard applied in national and international cases concerning the criminal responsibility of individuals,⁶⁸ is not an appropriate standard before\n\n⁶². Benzing (n 39) 1265; see also *Oil Platforms* (n 50) 270, Separate Opinion of Judge Buergenthal, para 41: ‘One might ask, moreover, where the test of “insufficient” evidence comes from … and by reference to what standards the Court applies it? What is meant by “insufficient” evidence? Does the evidence have to be “convincing”, “preponderant”, “overwhelming” or “beyond a reasonable doubt” to be sufficient? The Court never spells out what the here relevant standard of proof is.’; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 129–30.\n\n⁶³. See *Corfu Channel* (n 25) 14, 16, 17, 18; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 126–27.\n\n⁶⁴.

Consequently, in Corfu Channel, the Court has not found that the UK met this high standard when claiming that the minefield was laid with the connivance of Albania.⁷⁰ This finding was later confirmed in Bosnian Genocide, where the Court equally refrained from applying the proof beyond reasonable doubt standard.⁷¹\n\nHowever, the foregoing only applies to claims for which direct proof is available.⁷² Where mere circumstantial evidence is submitted by a party, the ICJ did require that proof must leave no room for reasonable doubt.⁷³ Again, the ICJ determined the exact parameters in Corfu Channel, when it noted with regards to the claim brought forward by the UK that Albania knew about the minefield in its territorial waters:\n\n[...] the fact of this exclusive territorial control exercised by a State within its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the knowledge of that State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence.

It was initially thought to be a ransomware attack,¹¹³ but then later qualified as being more than that, as the generation of revenue did not seem to be the primary goal of its operation.¹¹⁴ It also led to chaos on a large scale, with Ukraine seeming to be the main target.¹¹⁵ Despite the fact that physical damage did not occur, the NotPetya operation may nevertheless open up the discussion as to whether non-destructive cyber operations, which still massively disrupt the apparatus of the state, might be considered a violation of Article 2(4) in the future.¹¹⁶\n\nTo conclude, there seems to be a relatively high threshold of invoking the violation of Article 2(4), since the damage must be so severe it can be equated to a use of force in the traditional sense. Thus, in the case of less than forceful cyber-attacks or general lack of evidence, a state might have more success in claiming that the cyber intrusion constituted an unlawful intervention.¹¹⁷\n\n¹¹¹.

Thus, according to Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility,¹³⁴ the conduct of private individuals may still be attributable to a state if they are either acting under the instructions of that state or under their direction or control.¹³⁵ In the Nicaragua judgment, the ICJ determined the degree of control to be one of effective control ‘in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred’.¹³⁶ The ICTY’s Appeals Chamber argued in Tadić that its ‘overall control’ test, which was a test to establish the internationality of a conflict, would be equally applicable to questions of state responsibility.¹³⁷ This, however, was rejected by the ICJ in Bosnian Genocide, which considered the test to be too broad to apply it to the context of Article 8 and upheld its reasoning from Nicaragua.¹³⁸ This stricter test, however, poses another difficulty for an injured state, since proving effective control is a much higher threshold than claiming overall control of a state over the activities of a non-state actor.¹³⁹\n\nTherefore, in order to attribute an act to a state, the ‘victim’ state would need to prove that the cyber-attack was launched from a device that belonged to someone who was either completely dependent on that state or his/her activities were somehow conducted under effective control of that state.\n\nSetting aside this high threshold of proving an individual’s affiliation with the state, the attribution to a specific territory itself proves already extremely difficult. To start with, one may have to identify the exact location of the device. In the simplest cases, this could be achieved by tracing back the IP address from which the attack was launched.¹⁴⁰ Thus, if the IP address reveals a government-owned facility, the device can be identified as a government computer and thus, state responsibility may arise.¹⁴¹ However, as explained in section 2 in more detail, there are many ways to obscure the identity of the actual perpetrator, eg through IP spoofing, or computer hijacking.

Proving a State’s Breach of the Prohibition of Non-Intervention and Article 2(4)\n\nHaving demonstrated the various hurdles of applying the principle of non-intervention and Article 2(4) to the cyber context, the question now remains whether the current regime of proving a state’s breach of these principles remains applicable. For the purpose of this article, it is assumed that the material elements of a breach (such as coercion or severe damage) are sufficiently proven. Of particular interest is the question of proving the *attribution* of the attack to a state. For that as well, however, two main elements of proof need to be considered: the burden and the standard of proof.\n\n## 4.4.1. Burden of Proof\n\nIt is important to note that the formal status of the parties in the proceedings, whether applicant or respondent, has no bearing on the allocation of the burden.¹⁴⁴ When asserting which party carries the burden of proof, the Court generally applies the *onus probandi incumbit actori* principle: It is the party asserting a fact that is responsible for providing the Court with proof thereof.¹⁴⁵ The allocation of the burden of proof is of fundamental importance since there can only be a decision in favour of a party that has to prove a certain fact when it has successfully discharged the burden.¹⁴⁶ Thus, if a state wants to successfully claim reparations for a state’s violations of the threat or use of force and non-intervention principle, it is up to the victim state to collect enough evidence to discharge the burden. The *onus probandi* rule, however, is not an absolute one,\n\nthe determination of the burden of proof is in reality dependent on the subject-matter and nature of each dispute brought before the Court; it varies according to\n\n¹⁴².

Even if a state could successfully trace back IP addresses to another government's computer infrastructures, it would not have access to these computers in the same way as the perpetrator state. While some argue for the general notion that states need to act in good faith when participating in a judicial procedure,¹⁴⁸ with regard to the wording of Article 49 of the Court's Statute ('formal note shall be taken of any refusal'), this provision for the production of evidence does not seem to imply a binding legal obligation for states to comply with Article 49 requests.¹⁴⁹ While the Court might be allowed to draw adverse inferences from not complying with such a request (even though it has been reluctant to do so in the past), this does not mean it could compel a party to produce evidence.¹⁵⁰ It can therefore be assumed that an argument for the non-binding nature of Article 49 requests stands on stronger footing.\n\n## 4.4.2.

Thus, since the standard of proof varies with the violation, the standard of reasonable certainty does not apply to all cases.\n\nIn *Armed Activities* and *Oil Platforms*, the ICJ set the threshold of alleging an unlawful use of force to clear and convincing evidence.¹⁵⁴ As noted in section 3, the Court demands the higher standard of fully conclusive evidence only in charges of exceptional gravity. This suggests that the violation of Article 2(4) is not considered to be of such grave nature, which – given that a non-forceful intervention is considered less harmful, must hold true for the principle of non-intervention as well. Consequently, the clear and convincing standard would most likely equally apply to prove an intervention.\n\nHowever, especially when alleging a cyber-attack that violated the prohibition of use of force or non-intervention, direct proof will often be missing and thus the only type of evidence the parties may be able to offer is circumstantial evidence.¹⁵⁵ In that case, as we have seen before, the proof provided ‘must leave no room for reasonable doubt’.¹⁵⁶ However, with current techniques, it is almost impossible to attribute an attack to a state beyond reasonable doubt, especially without giving away specific know-how that might be too delicate to share with the rest of the world.¹⁵⁷ Therefore, without lowering the standard to give credit to the special circumstances of cyber-attacks, it will be almost impossible for states to prove the affiliation of a state to the attack.

One of them makes a case for not applying the ICJ’s findings in *Corfu Channel*, arguing that by their very nature computers are different to sea-mines.¹⁶⁰ Therefore, the same standards cannot be applied in the cyber context; hence a reversal of the burden of proof is appropriate.¹⁶¹ For authors dealing with problems like identification or attribution, fairness and efficiency seem to be their focal point for arguing for a reversal of the burden, assuming that the party whose territory the attack has emanated from, has superior access to information.¹⁶² Consequently, the onus should be on the country where the attack had been launched from (allegedly).¹⁶³ Proponents of this approach also put forward that, with a reversal of the burden, states would take their due diligence obligations of preventing cyber-attacks more seriously.¹⁶⁴ This is closely linked to the claim that the precautionary principle originating from environmental law can be applied to cyberspace, which then automatically shifts the burden of proof.¹⁶⁵ While the application of the precautionary principle might well\n\n¹⁵⁹.

When looking at the ICJ’s case law, ever since its first decision, the Court has not been inclined to shift the burden, even when evidence was exclusively located in the territory of one state.¹⁶⁸ This finding in *Corfu Channel* has so far not been overruled in any way.¹⁶⁹ What is more, the Court reaffirmed its findings in the *Nicaragua* case, acknowledging that even in times of ongoing armed conflicts (as was the case in *eg Georgia* in 2008), where evidence might be hard to come by, this might affect the standard of proof, not however the burden.¹⁷⁰ Even Judge Owada’s Separate Opinion to the *Oil Platforms* case dealt with difficulties arising from evidentiary imbalances between the applicant and the respondent in a self-defence scenario, as it was the US’s duty to establish that Iran had launched an armed attack against them, against which they defended themselves.

What may however be considered, might be lowering the evidentiary standard to facilitate the discharge of the burden.¹⁷⁴\n\n## 5.2. Lowering the Evidentiary Standard – The Indirect Evidence Dilemma\n\nAs was already explained above, the ICJ seems to have a case-to-case approach for the evidentiary standard to be applied. This makes it incredibly difficult for the parties to assess how much evidence is needed to successfully discharge the burden. However, there are certain signpost judgments shining light on an expected standard to be met (such as Armed Activities or Oil Platforms in the case of claiming use of force).¹⁷⁵ As was already mentioned in section 4.4.b), it only seems logical to assume that the party alleging such violations in the form of a cyber-attack would need to meet the same clear and convincing evidentiary standard.¹⁷⁶ Some authors regard this standard as still too high, deeming it as too strict and advocating for the lower balance of probabilities standard.¹⁷⁷\n\nHowever, looking at the ICJ’s previous case law, it is very unlikely that the Court would apply a lower standard than clear and convincing. In fact, as noted above, the ICJ might even set the standard to proof beyond reasonable doubt, since direct proof will often be missing.¹⁷⁸ This, however, would set\n\n172.

On the other hand, it would do away with concerns that a lower evidentiary standard would make it easier to blame a state for conduct it had nothing to do with. Protecting the respondent from false attribution, be it through IP spoofing, botnets or onion routing,¹⁷⁹ is an argument that should not be left out of the debate concerning a lower evidentiary standard.¹⁸⁰\n\nHowever, applying a beyond reasonable doubt standard in the cyber context might also be too far reaching: With regard to cyber-attacks, collecting evidence will always remain extremely hard and it would be (at least at the moment) impossible to collect information that reaches a higher level than clear and convincing.¹⁸¹ The victim state would be left with the impossible task to meet a standard which is ‘unreachable’, which could potentially result in perpetrator states evading their responsibility under international law. As Judge Owada held in his Separate Opinion to *Oil Platforms*:\n\nAs a court of justice whose primary function is the proper administration of justice, should see to it that this problem relating to evidence be dealt with in such a way that utmost justice is brought to bear on the final finding of the Court [...] It would seem to me that the only way to achieve this would have been for the Court to take a more proactive stance on the issue of evidence and that of fact-finding in the present case. This brings me to the standard of proof to be required for discharging the burden of proof in a case where the party who carries the burden of proof, though responsible for discharging that burden, finds itself in an extremely difficult situation as seen from an objective point of view.¹⁸²\n\nThese opinions, however, clearly show that the ICJ itself would not be interested in applying a standard that would be impossible to meet for the parties involved and that the paramount principle underlying the ICJ’s assessment of evidence is the proper administration of justice.¹⁸³ Such is unlikely when the Court would require parties to prove their allegations beyond reasonable doubt, even when direct proof is not available.\n\n---\n\n¹⁷⁹.

This, particularly due to the fact that evidence is often located in the exclusive territory of the alleged perpetrator and obtaining said evidence one-sidedly would constitute a violation of that state's sovereignty.¹⁸⁵ The present authors therefore suggest combining the clear and convincing standard with a more enhanced use of the Court's inherent fact-finding powers. This new approach will be discussed below.\n\n## 5.3. The Court’s Powers for the Production of Evidence\n\nAs discussed above, the present authors propose that the clear and convincing standard would be the best way to aptly deal with the evidentiary difficulties relating to cyber-attacks. Authors such as Roscini and Schmitt have already illustrated quite convincingly why this standard, being still significantly high, would be appropriate.¹⁸⁶ However, little has been said so far on how exactly the Court could be furnished with evidence that would satisfy the demands of a clear and convincing standard. Therefore, this section seeks to shine light on how to overcome certain evidentiary hurdles through the Court's more active usage of its powers to produce evidence. More specifically, it will do so by focusing on the evidentiary power that might become indispensable in these highly scientific and technical matters: the use of court-appointed experts. Before analysing those in detail, however, this section will start with a more general overview on ways to collect evidence in an ICJ proceeding.\n\nFirst, in theory, the Court has the inherent power to request additional documents, call its own witnesses, appoint own experts, or make on site visits. This has rarely happened in the past, as the Court has always been of the opinion that parties to the dispute should first and foremost furnish the Court with evidence themselves.¹⁸⁷ However, the extremely cautious approach as an intermediary not making use of its powers has been widely criticised.¹⁸⁸\n\n---\n\n¹⁸⁴.

Gaining that kind of knowledge through court-appointed experts seems to be one of the best ways to establish those facts.²⁰⁵\n\nLegal scholar Roscini proposes that the ICJ should use the fact-finding powers mentioned above to counterbalance evidentiary difficulties in cases where an exceptionally high standard has to be met (such as for example 'fully conclusive' in the case of genocide).²⁰⁶ However, the present authors argue that – in the cyber context – not even a more proactive stance on fact-finding could produce evidence that meets the requirements of a fully conclusive or beyond reasonable doubt standard. These evidentiary difficulties in the cyber context become clear when comparing a typical cyber scenario to a state responsibility case, where the Court made use of its fact-finding powers. In Corfu Channel, the Court concluded that the exceptionally high standard of beyond reasonable doubt to decide on Albania's international responsibility was met due to the tests run by court-appointed experts. It might thus be possible for experts to arrive at a single logical conclusion on whether an Albanian coastguard would have been able to see a ship passing through in the dark.²⁰⁷ This, however, cannot be said for experts having to determine whether an attack, which was routed through multiple countries, was caused\n\n203.

Not even the biggest team of experts could furnish the Court with evidence that simply does not exist. This is why the present authors propose that the best way to overcome evidentiary problems in the cyber context would be a more active use of the Court's fact-finding powers to reach the lower, but still satisfying clear and convincing standard. The fact that the Court has recently appointed experts in the Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean case between Costa Rica and Nicaragua – the first appointment in over 30 years – might be an indicator that the Court is about to change its reluctant stance on Article 50.²⁰⁸\n\n## 6. Conclusion\n\nIt is probably only a matter of time until a state lodges an application before the ICJ, claiming that it suffered damage arising out of a cyber-attack. It is almost certain that the Court will then be faced with several new questions, starting with whether a specific cyber-attack amounts to a violation of international law, to whether the current regime of evidentiary standards employed by the Court so far gives credit to the specific technical difficulties of proving cyber-attacks. As demonstrated by Estonia and Georgia, this contribution displayed the severe evidentiary troubles victim states have faced so far when trying to prove a state's involvement and thus, arguably, a reluctance to address international tribunals in this matter.\n\nFirst, the present authors started with analysing the current evidentiary regime of the Court to shine light on this delicate topic. It became clear that when dealing with state responsibility, the Court has applied three different standards. These vary according to the seriousness of the claim. Thus, for charges of exceptional gravity, for example, it found that it must be convinced by fully conclusive evidence.\n\nTherefore, there must be a breach of an international obligation first, in order to assess what standard of proof the Court will most likely apply in the cyber context. Consequently, the present authors analysed two principles of international law that are most probable to be violated in the case of a cyber-attack against a state: the prohibition of the threat or use of force and the non-intervention principle: two principles, that by their very nature want to protect a state's territorial integrity.\n\n²⁰⁸.

Nowadays, where technical difficulties hinder states to gather evidence linking a state directly to a cyber-attack, only indirect evidence can be submitted. In such a case, however, the Court established that it will require proof beyond reasonable doubt to let international responsibility arise. It is very likely that the ICJ will face various problems with this standard. Above all, a victim state would be left having to prove beyond reasonable doubt that a state is the originator of an attack. This is something that is obviously impossible with our current technical expertise.\n\nThus, scholars have proposed to shift the burden of proof to the perpetrator state, which now has to prove that it had not been involved in a cyberattack. This seems to be an unsatisfying solution: Not only did the Court itself refuse such an approach in the past; a shift would also put too much responsibility on the respondent state. Therefore, a more plausible approach would be to lower the evidentiary standard to clear and convincing, even in cases where direct proof is missing. Additionally, the present authors have pointed out how the inability of the parties to produce sufficient evidence can be overcome through the usage of the Court's power to appoint experts. This makes it possible to meet the clear and convincing standard and thus establish international responsibility.\n\nTo conclude, the relevant case law so far suggests that the Court will remain flexible in its application of evidentiary standards. It will be seen whether it may be open to lowering the standard in cases of exceptional difficulty. In this way, it could ensure that in each individual case, the appropriate standard to enable attribution is applied, but still protects states from wrongful conviction.",

Despite its vast benefits, however, it has also been used to cause severe damage to states. Hostile cyber activities seem to have occurred more frequently over the past years. It is already recognised that international law – thus also the law on state responsibility – is applicable to cyber-related issues. However, particularly in the context of inter-state relations, the question of how states are able to seek reparation in front of the International Court of Justice for damage caused by a cyber-attack conducted by a state remains open to debate. This is primarily due to the fact that the cyber sphere enjoys a considerable amount of anonymity, which makes it hard to establish the main perpetrator behind an act. Therefore, calls have been made to shift the burden of proof or to lower the evidentiary standard required by the Court. In this article, the present authors will assess the relevant case law of the Court and apply it to two scenarios: a cyber-attack violating the prohibition of use of force and the non-intervention principle. The aim is to display the Court's line of reasoning and assess whether the scholarly demands to ease evidentiary issues, by shifting the burden or lowering the standard of proof, are justified or not. Additionally, the present authors will address a yet in the cyber-context unexplored, but nevertheless, important tool in collecting sufficient evidence: the power of the Court to appoint experts.\nKEYWORDS: cyber-attack, attribution, state responsibility, evidence, International Court of Justice, burden of proof, standard of proof\n* Isabella Brunner works in the Office of the Legal Adviser (Department of Public International Law) at the Austrian Federal Ministry for Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs.

Introduction\nSince the emergence of the Internet in the 1980s, various actors – both private and governmental – became the target of foreign cyber operations.¹ While thus being a ‘relatively’ new phenomenon in our society, it is unquestionable that their frequency and impact is rising with each year. This is owed to the fact that nowadays, individuals, private companies and governments increasingly and more intensely operate online.²\nCyber operations targeted against states themselves generally aim to bring down governmental infrastructures, such as computer systems of institutions and governmental web pages. This has occurred, for instance, in Estonia and Georgia, where several facilities were brought down through so-called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.³ Another operation that has created widespread interest among international lawyers and remains heavily debated is the cyber hack into the emails of the US Democratic National Committee during the 2016 US presidential elections. One of the most recent large-scale cyber operations was the so-called NotPetya attack on 27 June 2017, targeting primarily Ukraine.⁴ However, the most consequential cyber operation so far remains the 2010 attack on Iran's Natanz nuclear facility plant, which is believed to have been carried out by Israel and the US. Through an infected USB device, it allegedly led to the physical damage of a significant number of centrifuges.⁵\nAs demonstrated above, the methods of launching a cyber-attack may vary in many ways (be it a DDoS attack or infiltration of malicious software). Nevertheless, all cyber-attacks so far have had one thing in common: the attacker was and remains fairly difficult to determine. As a consequence, it appears\n1.

One of the first cyber operations was the attack on the Trans-Siberian Pipeline in 1982, see Dinniss, *ibid*, 6.\n2.

These factual difficulties, however, have significant legal consequences, especially because they will most certainly prevent state responsibility from being triggered, which thus gradually undermines the international legal order. Thus, although victim states often have at least an educated guess on the identity of the actual perpetrator, they remain reluctant to point fingers. And while some states have publicly accused other states for cyber operations in the past,⁸ so far none has resorted to international litigation in an attempt to pursue reparation. In fact, to date there has not been a single dispute on this issue brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ).\nThis contribution therefore explores how far the past case law of the ICJ gives guidance on how it might deal with a case concerning state responsibility for an injury arising out of a cyber-attack.⁹\nFor the purpose of this article, cyber-attacks shall be considered to constitute any state-operated hostile intrusion into the cyber facilities of another state.¹⁰ Thus, the focus lies solely on cyber activities conducted by a state\n6.

Thereafter, in section 3, the contribution provides a general overview over the ICJ’s past jurisprudence on its evidentiary standards and clarifies the standards the Court has required in the past for the establishment of certain breaches of international law. In particular, two possible breaches, the violation of the use of force principle and the prohibition of non-intervention and their attribution to a state are of interest in the case of cyber-attacks. In this context, the present authors will also address the newest large-scale cyber operations and conclude if they could be considered a violation of these two principles (section 4). Thereafter, the specific standard of proof required by the Court when examining the violation of the prohibition of the threat or use of force and non-intervention principle, as well as the burden of proof, will be addressed in more detail. Finally, in section 5, already suggested solutions by legal scholars to overcome evidentiary difficulties related to cyber-attacks will be analysed: shifting the burden of proof and lowering the evidentiary standard used by the Court (sections 5.1 and 5.2). The present authors will additionally address a significant topic that has been disregarded so far, namely the extremely difficult task to collect sufficient evidence in the cyber-context. Thus, without the Court’s involvement, it is the authors’ contention that it would be almost impossible for states to meet the required evidentiary standard (section 5.3).\n## 2. Cyber-Attacks and Evidentiary Difficulties: Estonia and Georgia\nIn the current cyberspace era, where societies are more and more reliant on computer networks, cyber-attacks are becoming an ever-growing threat.¹³ As Roscini rightly pointed out: ‘The more digitally reliant a state is, the more\n11. Non-state actors are omitted, unless they can be attributed to a specific state. The authors will, accordingly, focus on attribution pursuant to Articles 4-11 ILC Articles on State Responsibility.

In this case, the victim state would have to provide evidence in support of its claim, namely that a specific state was behind the cyber-attack which is consequently obligated to make reparation under the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. Despite the fact that the Court has not dealt with a dispute concerning cyber-attacks yet, it was nevertheless already confronted with difficult fact-finding. Therefore, the next section will deal with a general analysis on the standard of proof which the ICJ will require in a proceeding to successfully attribute an internationally wrongful act to the perpetrator.\n# 3. Evidentiary Standards before the International Court of Justice\nIn order to invoke state responsibility, a victim state needs evidence to 1) establish the material elements of the wrongful act, as well as 2) attribute this act to the alleged perpetrator.³⁸ In general, such evidence needs to be persuasive in order to satisfy the court/tribunal of the truthfulness of its allegation.\n33.

See section 4 for a specific analysis on internationally wrongful acts and their attribution to states under the ILC Articles on State Responsibility in the special context of cyber-attacks.\n38. See accordingly, Article 2 ILC Articles on State Responsibility: ‘There is an internationally wrongful act of a State when conduct consisting of an action or omission: (a) is attributable to the State under international law; and (b) constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.’; Roscini (n 6) 220.\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015)\nThis section will show that, concerning the responsibility of states, the ICJ’s case law indicates that three different types of standards can be distinguished. All of them will be explained below.\nBefore examining the evidentiary standards, it is important to highlight that the Court generally enjoys wide discretion in matters of evidence.³⁹ Neither the Statute nor the Rules of Court contain formal rules regarding the Court’s handling of evidence and in particular, the evaluation of the probative value of evidence submitted by the parties.⁴⁰ Accordingly, Article 58(2) Rules of Court only stipulates that ‘[…] the method of handling the evidence […] shall be settled by the Court after the views of the parties have been ascertained […].’⁴¹ The Rules of the Court, equally, do not mention which standard of proof has to be applied by the Court nor which methods of proof (eg documentary evidence) are persuasive enough to the ICJ to meet a certain standard.⁴² This wide discretionary power, therefore, not only applies to fact-finding in general, but also to the Court’s choice of the appropriate evidentiary standard in a given case.⁴³\n39.

Article 58(2), ICJ, Rules of Court, 14 April 1978, 17 ILM 1286 (Rules of Court). For instance, the Court itself has confirmed numerous times that ‘within the limits of its Statute and Rules, [it has] freedom in estimating the value of the various elements of evidence’.

Roscini (n 6) 227.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack\nWhen discussing the standard of proof, however, it is inevitable to discuss the issue of burden of proof beforehand.⁴⁴ Most importantly, the two should not be confused. Burden of proof means that the party who asserts a fact in the proceeding is also the party who bears the burden of proving it,⁴⁵ namely ‘to convince the Court of the truthfulness of its claim’.⁴⁶ Only after it becomes clear which party bears the burden of proof, the Court is called upon to decide on the necessary standard.⁴⁷ In this sense, the standard of proof stipulates which degree of probability has to be provided by the party to convince the Court⁴⁸ or more specifically, the quantum of proof that has to be shown in order to ‘[...] discharge the burden of proof when that burden rests upon [that party]’.⁴⁹ Looking at the rare amount of cases where the ICJ has touched upon the question of evidentiary standards, it becomes evident that there is not a single standard for all disputes arising before it.⁵⁰ In cases concerning state responsibility,⁵¹ the actual standard of proof in a given case is determined by the substantive nature of the obligation, which was breached and is claimed by a party.⁵²\n⁴⁴.

Accordingly, Judge Greenwood pointed out that if cases exist where a state claims charges of exceptional gravity against another state, there have to be cases where a party claims less serious breaches and in those disputes, a lower standard of proof would be appropriate.⁵⁷ While the Bosnian Genocide case clearly shows that the ICJ requires a higher degree of certainty for serious charges, it is more difficult to perceive the exact difference between – in what seems like – a variety of evidentiary standards mentioned in the Court’s other case law. This is exemplified by the Court’s approach to use terms such as ‘convincing/convinced’,⁵⁸ ‘conclusive’,⁵⁹ ‘sufficient’⁶⁰ and ‘insufficient/not sufficient evidence’⁶¹ rather confusable so far instead of explaining which\n⁵³.

To establish international responsibility, one must have clear and indisputable facts.’⁶⁵\nIn the authors’ opinion, this seems plausible. The application of a balance of probabilities standard essentially means that the truthfulness of an allegation has to be ‘more probable than not’⁶⁶ compared to the evidence submitted by the alleged perpetrator. This, however, cannot suffice to establish international responsibility convincingly. Such a low standard might very easily lead to a false attribution of internationally wrongful acts, which ultimately were not committed by the state, although it might indeed seem this way.⁶⁷ Accordingly, it is important to highlight that the Court itself never used a balance of probabilities standard with regard to a state responsibility case.\nThe *Corfu Channel* case also indicates that proof beyond reasonable doubt, a standard applied in national and international cases concerning the criminal responsibility of individuals,⁶⁸ is not an appropriate standard before\n⁶². Benzing (n 39) 1265; see also *Oil Platforms* (n 50) 270, Separate Opinion of Judge Buergenthal, para 41: ‘One might ask, moreover, where the test of “insufficient” evidence comes from … and by reference to what standards the Court applies it? What is meant by “insufficient” evidence? Does the evidence have to be “convincing”, “preponderant”, “overwhelming” or “beyond a reasonable doubt” to be sufficient? The Court never spells out what the here relevant standard of proof is.’; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 129–30.\n⁶³. See *Corfu Channel* (n 25) 14, 16, 17, 18; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 126–27.\n⁶⁴. The preponderance of evidence standard is also known as balance of probabilities. “Preponderance of evidence” generally means that there is evidence greater in weight in comparison with the evidence adduced by the other party on the basis of reasonable probability rather than possibility.’ See Amerasinghe (n 25) 242.\n⁶⁵. *Corfu Channel* (n 25) 68, Dissenting Opinion of Judge Krylov, 72; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 133.\n⁶⁶.

Consequently, in Corfu Channel, the Court has not found that the UK met this high standard when claiming that the minefield was laid with the connivance of Albania.⁷⁰ This finding was later confirmed in Bosnian Genocide, where the Court equally refrained from applying the proof beyond reasonable doubt standard.⁷¹\nHowever, the foregoing only applies to claims for which direct proof is available.⁷² Where mere circumstantial evidence is submitted by a party, the ICJ did require that proof must leave no room for reasonable doubt.⁷³ Again, the ICJ determined the exact parameters in Corfu Channel, when it noted with regards to the claim brought forward by the UK that Albania knew about the minefield in its territorial waters:\n[...] the fact of this exclusive territorial control exercised by a State within its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the knowledge of that State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. [...] The proof may be drawn from inferences of fact, provided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt.⁷⁴\nEssentially, the ICJ held on the basis of circumstantial evidence – meaning facts which considered together lead ‘logically to a single conclusion’ – that\n⁶⁹. Corfu Channel (n 25) 17; Benzing (n 39) 1265; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 134–36; see also Amerasinghe (n 25) 235, who pointed out that the proof beyond reasonable doubt standard is too severe to be applied to non-criminal cases. One reason for this might be the fact that inter-state disputes are not criminal cases and in their very nature resemble civil cases, where parties stand on an equal footing. Cf Roscini (n 6) 227.\n⁷⁰. This was the second alternative argument of the UK Government. See Corfu Channel (n 25) 16–17. See also reference to Corfu Channel in Bosnian Genocide (n 50) para 209.\n⁷¹. See Bosnian Genocide (n 50) para 209; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 135. At one point, however, the Court did apply a standard of proof close to the standard beyond reasonable doubt, when it required proof beyond any doubt in respect of the allegation that there was aid and assistance between the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and VRS leaders, who carried out the acts of genocide. See Bosnian Genocide (n 50) para 422; Teitelbaum (n 39) 128.\n⁷². Quintana (n 47) 407.\n⁷³. Corfu Channel (n 25) 18. For a definition on circumstantial evidence, see at n 26.\n⁷⁴. Corfu Channel (n 25) 18. Note that ‘[...] inferences are a tool of judicial reasoning employed to aid a court in determining whether the burden of proof has been met in cases where direct proof is not available on a particular fact.’; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 113.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack\nAlbania must have known about the mines in the Corfu Channel.75 Where the Court allows recourse to indirect evidence, this only being the case where direct evidence is under the exclusive territorial control of the other party and circumstantial evidence does not ‘contradict’ any existing direct proof,76 the standard will be elevated to proof beyond reasonable doubt.77 In two other cases, *Oil Platforms* and *Armed Activities*, where the violation of the prohibition of the use of force was claimed respectively, the ICJ applied a clear and convincing standard.78 Additionally, the Court also mentioned several times that the submitted evidence was either sufficient79 or insufficient.80 In Nicaragua, the Court merely noted that there was insufficient evidence to prove ‘various points’ but abstained from establishing a certain standard of proof, which needed to be met by the parties.81\nIt is not clear, however, how the evidentiary standards mentioned by the ICJ in those cases exactly differ from each other and how, in the end, they are decisive for the Court in the determination of the amount of proof the party has to provide in order to discharge its burden.82\nConsequently, commentators have tried to highlight the differences between those standards by, inter alia, referring to their ordinary meaning as referred to in the Oxford English Dictionary.83 In doing so, they established a hierarchy between the terms conclusive, convincing and sufficient, with conclusive being the highest of the three standards.84 What is more, the lack of precise definitions for the different evidentiary standards, and especially the reluctance of international courts from discussing the standards they use85\n75.

The restraint of international courts and tribunals to discuss evidentiary standards has also been criticised by international judges, see Markus Benzing, Das Beweisrecht vor\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015)\nmay also be ascribed to the influence of the civil/continental law – as opposed to common law – tradition on inter-state dispute settlement.⁸⁶ In the civil law system, judges determine the probative value of submitted evidence in both civil, and criminal law cases based on their internal conviction and are thus not required to apply a specific standard.⁸⁷ In common law jurisdictions, however, judges generally apply the preponderance of evidence or reasonable degree of probability standard with regard to civil law cases, whereas in criminal law cases, a higher standard, namely proof beyond reasonable doubt, has to be met.⁸⁸ Above all, many difficulties when determining evidentiary standards arise due to the simple fact that the evaluation of evidence is a subjective matter – ultimately leading to contradictions between judges on what kind of evidence suffices to be convincing to discharge the burden.⁸⁹\nHowever, it would still be important to know for parties what the ICJ itself exactly means by conclusive, convincing and sufficient evidence.⁹⁰ What is more, the parties appearing before the Court should, already during the proceedings, have at least some clue as to which evidentiary standard will be applied to the case and not be taken by surprise by the Court's final judgment.⁹¹ Particularly in Bosnian Genocide, however, the Court already went a step further by giving more detailed answers than in previous cases and hopefully will continue to develop the case law more consistently with regard to the question of evidentiary standards.⁹²\nIn conclusion, legal scholars have identified three types of state responsibility cases before the ICJ when it comes to determining the relevant standard of proof.⁹³ First, in regular cases, the ICJ demands proof at a high level of certainty appropriate to the seriousness of the allegation.⁹⁴ The amount of\n⁸⁶.

This makes it then possible to explore the level of seriousness of the alleged breach in order to determine the evidentiary standard which has to be met by the parties in the dispute.\n## 4. Cyber-Attacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts\nCyber-attacks may vary greatly in scale and form. However, only when these ‘hostile uses of cyberspace’¹⁰¹ amount to a violation of international law, the question of international adjudication arises.¹⁰² In the authors’ opinion, the international obligations most relevant for a cyber-attack to constitute an internationally wrongful act are those that most severely infringe a state’s sovereignty. Thus, the prohibition of the threat or use of force and the principle of non-intervention and their applicability to cyber operations are of special interest. Based on these two principles, the question of how to attribute these\n⁹⁵. Teitelbaum (n 39) 125–26; Roscini (n 6) 228.\n⁹⁶. Quintana (n 47) 408; cf Riddell and Plant (n 39) 132–36.\n⁹⁷.

More specifically, when they occur ‘in the “international relations” of member states’ and do not merely constitute a private act without a state’s involvement, Dinniss (n 1) 40.\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015)\n'attacks' to a state will be examined and the necessary standard of proof to be applied in those cases will be determined. It is also important to note that the term cyber-'attack', being a non-legal term, is not to be equated to the term 'armed attack', triggering the right of self-defence under Article 51 UN Charter.¹⁰³\n## 4.1. The Threat or Use of Force\nDue to its severity, the first international obligation to be discussed here is the prohibition of the threat or use of force, enshrined in Article 2(4) UN Charter.¹⁰⁴ This prohibition is considered to be a norm of customary international law¹⁰⁵ and the overall consensus is that it is also applicable to cyber operations.¹⁰⁶ This is in line with the ICJ's Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion, where it noted that the prohibition to use force applies 'regardless of the weapons employed'.¹⁰⁷ It is more the effect of a weapon upon which a breach of Article 2(4) is determined.¹⁰⁸ Traditionally, only physical damage to property, loss of life or injury of persons were thought to meet this requirement.¹⁰⁹ Moreover, a state would need to prove that the cyber-attack has caused a severe effect, meaning that 'its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force'.¹¹⁰ Given the virtual (rather than physical) nature of cyber-attacks, this seems to be\n¹⁰³. Article 51 UN Charter, 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS 16: 'Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.'\n¹⁰⁴.

Schmitt (ed) (n 101) Rule 11, 45.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack\nthe most difficult part.¹¹¹ To give an example of such severity, the Stuxnet virus launched at the Iranian Natanz nuclear plant, supposedly leading to the physical damage of the plant's centrifuges could be considered, if proven, to be of such gravity that it would constitute a use of force.¹¹² Another attack worth mentioning in this regard is the recent NotPetya operation at the end of June this year. It was initially thought to be a ransomware attack,¹¹³ but then later qualified as being more than that, as the generation of revenue did not seem to be the primary goal of its operation.¹¹⁴ It also led to chaos on a large scale, with Ukraine seeming to be the main target.¹¹⁵ Despite the fact that physical damage did not occur, the NotPetya operation may nevertheless open up the discussion as to whether non-destructive cyber operations, which still massively disrupt the apparatus of the state, might be considered a violation of Article 2(4) in the future.¹¹⁶\nTo conclude, there seems to be a relatively high threshold of invoking the violation of Article 2(4), since the damage must be so severe it can be equated to a use of force in the traditional sense. Thus, in the case of less than forceful cyber-attacks or general lack of evidence, a state might have more success in claiming that the cyber intrusion constituted an unlawful intervention.¹¹⁷\n¹¹¹. On a side note, as the ICJ held in Nicaragua, the 'most grave forms' of the use of force amount to an 'armed attack', which would trigger the right of self-defence under Article 51 UN Charter, see Nicaragua (Merits) (n 41) para 191; Thus, by acknowledging that Article 51 UN Charter is also applicable in the cyber context, a cyber-attack of the 'most grave form' must also be one that enables the victim state to defend itself effectively.\n¹¹².

Non-Intervention\nThe principle of non-intervention derived out of the principle of the sovereign equality of states, which is enshrined in Article 2(1) UN Charter.¹¹⁸ It also reflects customary international law.¹¹⁹ It is widely seen to be equally applicable to cyber-attacks.¹²⁰ According to the ICJ, a state’s coercive interference in another state’s internal affairs constitutes an unlawful intervention.¹²¹ The Court noted in the Nicaragua judgment, that the requirement of coercion is fulfilled, when a state is deprived of its free ‘choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy’.¹²² The most obvious form of such coercion, according to the ICJ, is an intervention that uses force.¹²³ Being a much broader obligation than the prohibition of threat or use of force, it thus prohibits both forceful and less than forceful operations.¹²⁴\nHaving determined previously that severe damage is needed to establish a use of force, less than forceful – but still coercive – cyber operations might thus still be unlawful. To give an example, the cyber-attack against Estonia in 2007 (if it is assumed that it was conducted by Russia) could be seen as an unlawful intervention in Estonia’s affairs, as it was a coercive attempt to influence Estonia not to relocate the Second World War memorial.¹²⁵\nMore recently, the hack and release of a vast amount of internal emails of the US Democratic National Committee to WikiLeaks right before the US elections has sparked widespread media attention. It primarily led to the increased negative portrayal of candidate Clinton in the media and is widely believed to have been conducted by the Russian Government in order to help candidate Trump win the presidency.¹²⁶ Another consequential hack was the attack against President Macron’s election campaign, which led to the\n¹¹⁸.

Attribution\nEventually, for state responsibility to arise, the wrongful conduct must be attributable to a state. The ILC Articles on State Responsibility set out in Articles 4 to 11 the different activities by individuals which are attributable to a state. These include first and foremost the conduct of de jure and de facto state organs as well as persons/entities ‘exercising elements of governmental authority’.¹³²\nParticular notice shall be made to private hackers, whose expertise might be used by states to conduct a cyber-attack. Two provisions of the ILC Articles might be of relevance in this regard. First, the ICJ noted in Bosnian Genocide that Article 4 ILC Articles might enable the attribution of acts of private individuals that are not formally recognised as state organs to the state, if they are ‘in a relationship of complete dependence on the State’.¹³³\n¹²⁷.

Bosnian Genocide (n 50) para 391.\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015)\nProving a complete dependence, however, might be very difficult. Thus, according to Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility,¹³⁴ the conduct of private individuals may still be attributable to a state if they are either acting under the instructions of that state or under their direction or control.¹³⁵ In the Nicaragua judgment, the ICJ determined the degree of control to be one of effective control ‘in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred’.¹³⁶ The ICTY’s Appeals Chamber argued in Tadić that its ‘overall control’ test, which was a test to establish the internationality of a conflict, would be equally applicable to questions of state responsibility.¹³⁷ This, however, was rejected by the ICJ in Bosnian Genocide, which considered the test to be too broad to apply it to the context of Article 8 and upheld its reasoning from Nicaragua.¹³⁸ This stricter test, however, poses another difficulty for an injured state, since proving effective control is a much higher threshold than claiming overall control of a state over the activities of a non-state actor.¹³⁹\nTherefore, in order to attribute an act to a state, the ‘victim’ state would need to prove that the cyber-attack was launched from a device that belonged to someone who was either completely dependent on that state or his/her activities were somehow conducted under effective control of that state.\nSetting aside this high threshold of proving an individual’s affiliation with the state, the attribution to a specific territory itself proves already extremely difficult. To start with, one may have to identify the exact location of the device. In the simplest cases, this could be achieved by tracing back the IP address from which the attack was launched.¹⁴⁰ Thus, if the IP address reveals a government-owned facility, the device can be identified as a government computer and thus, state responsibility may arise.¹⁴¹ However, as explained in section 2 in more detail, there are many ways to obscure the identity of the actual perpetrator, eg through IP spoofing, or computer hijacking. Moreover, the Tallinn Manual notes that ‘the fact that a cyber operation has been routed via the cyber infrastructure located in a State’ does not constitute ‘sufficient evidence’ that the cyber activity is attributable to\n¹³⁴.

Proving a State’s Breach of the Prohibition of Non-Intervention and Article 2(4)\nHaving demonstrated the various hurdles of applying the principle of non-intervention and Article 2(4) to the cyber context, the question now remains whether the current regime of proving a state’s breach of these principles remains applicable. For the purpose of this article, it is assumed that the material elements of a breach (such as coercion or severe damage) are sufficiently proven. Of particular interest is the question of proving the *attribution* of the attack to a state. For that as well, however, two main elements of proof need to be considered: the burden and the standard of proof.\n## 4.4.1. Burden of Proof\nIt is important to note that the formal status of the parties in the proceedings, whether applicant or respondent, has no bearing on the allocation of the burden.¹⁴⁴ When asserting which party carries the burden of proof, the Court generally applies the *onus probandi incumbit actori* principle: It is the party asserting a fact that is responsible for providing the Court with proof thereof.¹⁴⁵ The allocation of the burden of proof is of fundamental importance since there can only be a decision in favour of a party that has to prove a certain fact when it has successfully discharged the burden.¹⁴⁶ Thus, if a state wants to successfully claim reparations for a state’s violations of the threat or use of force and non-intervention principle, it is up to the victim state to collect enough evidence to discharge the burden. The *onus probandi* rule, however, is not an absolute one,\nthe determination of the burden of proof is in reality dependent on the subject-matter and nature of each dispute brought before the Court; it varies according to\n¹⁴².

Even if a state could successfully trace back IP addresses to another government's computer infrastructures, it would not have access to these computers in the same way as the perpetrator state. While some argue for the general notion that states need to act in good faith when participating in a judicial procedure,¹⁴⁸ with regard to the wording of Article 49 of the Court's Statute ('formal note shall be taken of any refusal'), this provision for the production of evidence does not seem to imply a binding legal obligation for states to comply with Article 49 requests.¹⁴⁹ While the Court might be allowed to draw adverse inferences from not complying with such a request (even though it has been reluctant to do so in the past), this does not mean it could compel a party to produce evidence.¹⁵⁰ It can therefore be assumed that an argument for the non-binding nature of Article 49 requests stands on stronger footing.\n## 4.4.2. Standard of Proof\nDue to the technical difficulty of attributing a cyber-attack, it might be argued that different standards of proof shall apply for the attribution on the one hand and claiming the substantive violation on the other. For attribution, certain scholars refer to the Yeager arbitration.¹⁵¹ There, the Iran-US Claims\n¹⁴⁷.

See however Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Salvador v Honduras; Nicaragua intervening), ICJ Reports (1992) 351, para 63, where the Court stated that it 'cannot however apply a presumption that evidence which is unavailable would, if produced, have supported a particular party's case; still less a presumption of the existence of evidence which has not been produced'. Riddell and Plant (n 39) 116.\n¹⁵¹. See, eg Schmitt and Vihul (n 5) 65–66.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack\nTribunal noted that the attribution of a wrongful conduct to a state must be proven with reasonable certainty.¹⁵² However, the ICJ noted in *Bosnian Genocide* that the same standard of proof applies to both the violation of the substantive rule as well as the attribution for such acts.¹⁵³ In other words, rather than separating attribution and violation, both of them require the same standard of proof. Thus, since the standard of proof varies with the violation, the standard of reasonable certainty does not apply to all cases.\nIn *Armed Activities* and *Oil Platforms*, the ICJ set the threshold of alleging an unlawful use of force to clear and convincing evidence.¹⁵⁴ As noted in section 3, the Court demands the higher standard of fully conclusive evidence only in charges of exceptional gravity. This suggests that the violation of Article 2(4) is not considered to be of such grave nature, which – given that a non-forceful intervention is considered less harmful, must hold true for the principle of non-intervention as well. Consequently, the clear and convincing standard would most likely equally apply to prove an intervention.\nHowever, especially when alleging a cyber-attack that violated the prohibition of use of force or non-intervention, direct proof will often be missing and thus the only type of evidence the parties may be able to offer is circumstantial evidence.¹⁵⁵ In that case, as we have seen before, the proof provided ‘must leave no room for reasonable doubt’.¹⁵⁶ However, with current techniques, it is almost impossible to attribute an attack to a state beyond reasonable doubt, especially without giving away specific know-how that might be too delicate to share with the rest of the world.¹⁵⁷ Therefore, without lowering the standard to give credit to the special circumstances of cyber-attacks, it will be almost impossible for states to prove the affiliation of a state to the attack. See section 5.2 on this issue.\n# 5. Possible Means to Address the Evidentiary Dilemma in Cyberspace\nCyber-attacks might to some extent be considered textbook examples of a scenario where one party has exclusive control over the evidence required and where direct proof is often not available.¹⁵⁸ Section 5.1 thus seeks to\n¹⁵².

Next, the question whether the ICJ might depart from its strict approach concerning circumstantial evidence will be addressed in section 5.2.¹⁵⁹ For both questions, opinions of different legal scholars will be analysed. Finally, as a new way forward to resolve some of the evidentiary issues in the cyber context, the present authors suggest that – as an alternative solution – the Court should make more use of its inherent powers regarding the production of evidence (section 5.3).\n## 5.1. Reversing the Burden of Proof\nAs attribution poses one of the biggest problems in the cyber context, some authors have called for a reversal of the burden of proof, even though the reasons for arriving at this conclusion are very different. One of them makes a case for not applying the ICJ’s findings in *Corfu Channel*, arguing that by their very nature computers are different to sea-mines.¹⁶⁰ Therefore, the same standards cannot be applied in the cyber context; hence a reversal of the burden of proof is appropriate.¹⁶¹ For authors dealing with problems like identification or attribution, fairness and efficiency seem to be their focal point for arguing for a reversal of the burden, assuming that the party whose territory the attack has emanated from, has superior access to information.¹⁶² Consequently, the onus should be on the country where the attack had been launched from (allegedly).¹⁶³ Proponents of this approach also put forward that, with a reversal of the burden, states would take their due diligence obligations of preventing cyber-attacks more seriously.¹⁶⁴ This is closely linked to the claim that the precautionary principle originating from environmental law can be applied to cyberspace, which then automatically shifts the burden of proof.¹⁶⁵ While the application of the precautionary principle might well\n¹⁵⁹.

When looking at the ICJ’s case law, ever since its first decision, the Court has not been inclined to shift the burden, even when evidence was exclusively located in the territory of one state.¹⁶⁸ This finding in *Corfu Channel* has so far not been overruled in any way.¹⁶⁹ What is more, the Court reaffirmed its findings in the *Nicaragua* case, acknowledging that even in times of ongoing armed conflicts (as was the case in *eg Georgia* in 2008), where evidence might be hard to come by, this might affect the standard of proof, not however the burden.¹⁷⁰ Even Judge Owada’s Separate Opinion to the *Oil Platforms* case dealt with difficulties arising from evidentiary imbalances between the applicant and the respondent in a self-defence scenario, as it was the US’s duty to establish that Iran had launched an armed attack against them, against which they defended themselves. While not wholeheartedly content with the situation, he stated that:\nNevertheless, there is no denying the fact that there undoubtedly exists an asymmetry in the situation surrounding the case [...]. I am prepared to accept that this asymmetry is inherent in the circumstances of the present case and there is little the Court can do under the circumstances. It is primarily the task incumbent upon the party which claims certain facts as the basis of its contention to establish them by producing sufficient evidence in accordance with the principle *actori incumbit onus probandi*.¹⁷¹\nIn light of the discussion above, it can be therefore concluded that it is highly unlikely that the ICJ would shift the burden of proof in the cyber context, not only because of the established case law but also because of certain\n---\n¹⁶⁶.

Cyber operations are often routed through numerous countries,¹⁷² thus a reversal could place the burden of proof on a wholly uninvolved party.¹⁷³\nIt is, however, important to note that the Court has always been concerned with a level playing field for the parties, which could not be facilitated by a reversal of the burden. What may however be considered, might be lowering the evidentiary standard to facilitate the discharge of the burden.¹⁷⁴\n## 5.2. Lowering the Evidentiary Standard – The Indirect Evidence Dilemma\nAs was already explained above, the ICJ seems to have a case-to-case approach for the evidentiary standard to be applied. This makes it incredibly difficult for the parties to assess how much evidence is needed to successfully discharge the burden. However, there are certain signpost judgments shining light on an expected standard to be met (such as Armed Activities or Oil Platforms in the case of claiming use of force).¹⁷⁵ As was already mentioned in section 4.4.b), it only seems logical to assume that the party alleging such violations in the form of a cyber-attack would need to meet the same clear and convincing evidentiary standard.¹⁷⁶ Some authors regard this standard as still too high, deeming it as too strict and advocating for the lower balance of probabilities standard.¹⁷⁷\nHowever, looking at the ICJ’s previous case law, it is very unlikely that the Court would apply a lower standard than clear and convincing. In fact, as noted above, the ICJ might even set the standard to proof beyond reasonable doubt, since direct proof will often be missing.¹⁷⁸ This, however, would set\n172.

See section 3.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack\nthe standard for cyber-attacks incredibly high. On the other hand, it would do away with concerns that a lower evidentiary standard would make it easier to blame a state for conduct it had nothing to do with. Protecting the respondent from false attribution, be it through IP spoofing, botnets or onion routing,¹⁷⁹ is an argument that should not be left out of the debate concerning a lower evidentiary standard.¹⁸⁰\nHowever, applying a beyond reasonable doubt standard in the cyber context might also be too far reaching: With regard to cyber-attacks, collecting evidence will always remain extremely hard and it would be (at least at the moment) impossible to collect information that reaches a higher level than clear and convincing.¹⁸¹ The victim state would be left with the impossible task to meet a standard which is ‘unreachable’, which could potentially result in perpetrator states evading their responsibility under international law. As Judge Owada held in his Separate Opinion to *Oil Platforms*:\nAs a court of justice whose primary function is the proper administration of justice, should see to it that this problem relating to evidence be dealt with in such a way that utmost justice is brought to bear on the final finding of the Court [...] It would seem to me that the only way to achieve this would have been for the Court to take a more proactive stance on the issue of evidence and that of fact-finding in the present case. This brings me to the standard of proof to be required for discharging the burden of proof in a case where the party who carries the burden of proof, though responsible for discharging that burden, finds itself in an extremely difficult situation as seen from an objective point of view.¹⁸²\nThese opinions, however, clearly show that the ICJ itself would not be interested in applying a standard that would be impossible to meet for the parties involved and that the paramount principle underlying the ICJ’s assessment of evidence is the proper administration of justice.¹⁸³ Such is unlikely when the Court would require parties to prove their allegations beyond reasonable doubt, even when direct proof is not available.\n---\n¹⁷⁹.

This, particularly due to the fact that evidence is often located in the exclusive territory of the alleged perpetrator and obtaining said evidence one-sidedly would constitute a violation of that state's sovereignty.¹⁸⁵ The present authors therefore suggest combining the clear and convincing standard with a more enhanced use of the Court's inherent fact-finding powers. This new approach will be discussed below.\n## 5.3. The Court’s Powers for the Production of Evidence\nAs discussed above, the present authors propose that the clear and convincing standard would be the best way to aptly deal with the evidentiary difficulties relating to cyber-attacks. Authors such as Roscini and Schmitt have already illustrated quite convincingly why this standard, being still significantly high, would be appropriate.¹⁸⁶ However, little has been said so far on how exactly the Court could be furnished with evidence that would satisfy the demands of a clear and convincing standard. Therefore, this section seeks to shine light on how to overcome certain evidentiary hurdles through the Court's more active usage of its powers to produce evidence. More specifically, it will do so by focusing on the evidentiary power that might become indispensable in these highly scientific and technical matters: the use of court-appointed experts. Before analysing those in detail, however, this section will start with a more general overview on ways to collect evidence in an ICJ proceeding.\nFirst, in theory, the Court has the inherent power to request additional documents, call its own witnesses, appoint own experts, or make on site visits. This has rarely happened in the past, as the Court has always been of the opinion that parties to the dispute should first and foremost furnish the Court with evidence themselves.¹⁸⁷ However, the extremely cautious approach as an intermediary not making use of its powers has been widely criticised.¹⁸⁸\n---\n¹⁸⁴.

Regarding the power of the Court to call experts, see, eg, Benzing (n 39) 1256–57.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack\nFor example, in Bosnian Genocide, the Court did not grant an evidentiary request by Bosnia (as according to the Court, they already had extensive evidence in their possession) but then ultimately found that it had not successfully discharged its burden.¹⁸⁹ The backlash created by this finding might open up the road to a more proactive stance in the future, particularly in the cyber context.\nSecond, the parties can appoint experts according to Articles 57 and 64 Rules of the Court.¹⁹⁰ It happened before that scientific experts appeared as counsel for one of the parties, which, however, due to not having been appointed as experts according to the ICJ’s Statute, barred the other party to the proceeding from cross-examining this counsel.¹⁹¹ The Court criticised this approach in *Pulp Mills* of having limited value.¹⁹² This critique seems to have been successful, as in recent cases, such as *Whaling*, the parties appointed experts according to the Rules, that could be cross-examined by both the Court and other parties.¹⁹³\nLastly, the Court may appoint experts itself. Pursuant to Article 50 of the Statute, ‘[t]he Court may, at any time, entrust any individual, body, bureau, commission, or other organization that it may select, with the task of carrying out an enquiry or giving an expert opinion’.¹⁹⁴ The advantages of using court-appointed experts are manifold, aside from the fact that a potential bias plays less of a role as opposed to party-appointed experts.¹⁹⁵ Therefore, the present authors argue that making better usage of the Court’s own powers to appoint experts under Article 50 would help resolve attribution issues in the cyber context.\n¹⁸⁹.

Only in the Chorzow Factory case in front of the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ), as well as the Corfu Channel and the Gulf of Maine case in front of the ICJ, experts have been appointed under this procedure.¹⁹⁸ This reluctance has been widely criticised not only by doctrine¹⁹⁹ but also within the Court.²⁰⁰\nOne explanation for the neglect of Article 50 might be the fact that court-appointed experts almost exclusively appear in civil law jurisdictions and that to jurists from common law backgrounds, this appointment might seem like an undue interference, especially with regard to the burden of proof of the parties.²⁰¹ It has also been the Court's contention that the use of experts was just not necessary, as the parties involved in the proceedings seldom disagreed on matters of fact but rather on matters of law.²⁰² This, however,\n196.

Gaining that kind of knowledge through court-appointed experts seems to be one of the best ways to establish those facts.²⁰⁵\nLegal scholar Roscini proposes that the ICJ should use the fact-finding powers mentioned above to counterbalance evidentiary difficulties in cases where an exceptionally high standard has to be met (such as for example 'fully conclusive' in the case of genocide).²⁰⁶ However, the present authors argue that – in the cyber context – not even a more proactive stance on fact-finding could produce evidence that meets the requirements of a fully conclusive or beyond reasonable doubt standard. These evidentiary difficulties in the cyber context become clear when comparing a typical cyber scenario to a state responsibility case, where the Court made use of its fact-finding powers. In Corfu Channel, the Court concluded that the exceptionally high standard of beyond reasonable doubt to decide on Albania's international responsibility was met due to the tests run by court-appointed experts. It might thus be possible for experts to arrive at a single logical conclusion on whether an Albanian coastguard would have been able to see a ship passing through in the dark.²⁰⁷ This, however, cannot be said for experts having to determine whether an attack, which was routed through multiple countries, was caused\n203.

Not even the biggest team of experts could furnish the Court with evidence that simply does not exist. This is why the present authors propose that the best way to overcome evidentiary problems in the cyber context would be a more active use of the Court's fact-finding powers to reach the lower, but still satisfying clear and convincing standard. The fact that the Court has recently appointed experts in the Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean case between Costa Rica and Nicaragua – the first appointment in over 30 years – might be an indicator that the Court is about to change its reluctant stance on Article 50.²⁰⁸\n## 6. Conclusion\nIt is probably only a matter of time until a state lodges an application before the ICJ, claiming that it suffered damage arising out of a cyber-attack. It is almost certain that the Court will then be faced with several new questions, starting with whether a specific cyber-attack amounts to a violation of international law, to whether the current regime of evidentiary standards employed by the Court so far gives credit to the specific technical difficulties of proving cyber-attacks. As demonstrated by Estonia and Georgia, this contribution displayed the severe evidentiary troubles victim states have faced so far when trying to prove a state's involvement and thus, arguably, a reluctance to address international tribunals in this matter.\nFirst, the present authors started with analysing the current evidentiary regime of the Court to shine light on this delicate topic. It became clear that when dealing with state responsibility, the Court has applied three different standards. These vary according to the seriousness of the claim. Thus, for charges of exceptional gravity, for example, it found that it must be convinced by fully conclusive evidence.\nTherefore, there must be a breach of an international obligation first, in order to assess what standard of proof the Court will most likely apply in the cyber context. Consequently, the present authors analysed two principles of international law that are most probable to be violated in the case of a cyber-attack against a state: the prohibition of the threat or use of force and the non-intervention principle: two principles, that by their very nature want to protect a state's territorial integrity.\n²⁰⁸. Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean (Costa Rica v Nicaragua), ICJ Order (31 May 2016); see Order of 16 June 2016; Gaja (n 195) 416–17.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack\nAlthough the Court already held that it will require clear and convincing evidence when a breach of Article 2(4) – and most likely also an unlawful intervention – is claimed, this only applies when direct proof is available. Nowadays, where technical difficulties hinder states to gather evidence linking a state directly to a cyber-attack, only indirect evidence can be submitted. In such a case, however, the Court established that it will require proof beyond reasonable doubt to let international responsibility arise. It is very likely that the ICJ will face various problems with this standard. Above all, a victim state would be left having to prove beyond reasonable doubt that a state is the originator of an attack. This is something that is obviously impossible with our current technical expertise.\nThus, scholars have proposed to shift the burden of proof to the perpetrator state, which now has to prove that it had not been involved in a cyberattack. This seems to be an unsatisfying solution: Not only did the Court itself refuse such an approach in the past; a shift would also put too much responsibility on the respondent state. Therefore, a more plausible approach would be to lower the evidentiary standard to clear and convincing, even in cases where direct proof is missing. Additionally, the present authors have pointed out how the inability of the parties to produce sufficient evidence can be overcome through the usage of the Court's power to appoint experts. This makes it possible to meet the clear and convincing standard and thus establish international responsibility.\nTo conclude, the relevant case law so far suggests that the Court will remain flexible in its application of evidentiary standards. It will be seen whether it may be open to lowering the standard in cases of exceptional difficulty. In this way, it could ensure that in each individual case, the appropriate standard to enable attribution is applied, but still protects states from wrongful conviction.\n^{}[]",

Despite its vast benefits, however, it has also been used to cause severe damage to states. Hostile cyber activities seem to have occurred more frequently over the past years. It is already recognised that international law – thus also the law on state responsibility – is applicable to cyber-related issues. However, particularly in the context of inter-state relations, the question of how states are able to seek reparation in front of the International Court of Justice for damage caused by a cyber-attack conducted by a state remains open to debate. This is primarily due to the fact that the cyber sphere enjoys a considerable amount of anonymity, which makes it hard to establish the main perpetrator behind an act. Therefore, calls have been made to shift the burden of proof or to lower the evidentiary standard required by the Court. In this article, the present authors will assess the relevant case law of the Court and apply it to two scenarios: a cyber-attack violating the prohibition of use of force and the non-intervention principle. The aim is to display the Court's line of reasoning and assess whether the scholarly demands to ease evidentiary issues, by shifting the burden or lowering the standard of proof, are justified or not. Additionally, the present authors will address a yet in the cyber-context unexplored, but nevertheless, important tool in collecting sufficient evidence: the power of the Court to appoint experts.\nKEYWORDS: cyber-attack, attribution, state responsibility, evidence, International Court of Justice, burden of proof, standard of proof * Isabella Brunner works in the Office of the Legal Adviser (Department of Public International Law) at the Austrian Federal Ministry for Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs.

Introduction Since the emergence of the Internet in the 1980s, various actors – both private and governmental – became the target of foreign cyber operations.¹ While thus being a ‘relatively’ new phenomenon in our society, it is unquestionable that their frequency and impact is rising with each year. This is owed to the fact that nowadays, individuals, private companies and governments increasingly and more intensely operate online.² Cyber operations targeted against states themselves generally aim to bring down governmental infrastructures, such as computer systems of institutions and governmental web pages. This has occurred, for instance, in Estonia and Georgia, where several facilities were brought down through so-called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.³ Another operation that has created widespread interest among international lawyers and remains heavily debated is the cyber hack into the emails of the US Democratic National Committee during the 2016 US presidential elections. One of the most recent large-scale cyber operations was the so-called NotPetya attack on 27 June 2017, targeting primarily Ukraine.⁴ However, the most consequential cyber operation so far remains the 2010 attack on Iran's Natanz nuclear facility plant, which is believed to have been carried out by Israel and the US. Through an infected USB device, it allegedly led to the physical damage of a significant number of centrifuges.⁵ As demonstrated above, the methods of launching a cyber-attack may vary in many ways (be it a DDoS attack or infiltration of malicious software). Nevertheless, all cyber-attacks so far have had one thing in common: the attacker was and remains fairly difficult to determine. As a consequence, it appears Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack that cyber operations may gradually be seen as a new and viable method through which states are able to inflict harm upon other states, enabling them to ‘hide behind their proxy servers’ while reaching their objectives.⁶ This results from the immense technical difficulties in attributing cyber operations to other states – also due to the possibility to conceal traces by methods such as IP spoofing – essentially giving states ‘impunity in cyberspace’.⁷ Therefore, victim states are often left unable to evince the origins of the act, making it impossible to persuasively attribute a wrongful act to another state. These factual difficulties, however, have significant legal consequences, especially because they will most certainly prevent state responsibility from being triggered, which thus gradually undermines the international legal order. Thus, although victim states often have at least an educated guess on the identity of the actual perpetrator, they remain reluctant to point fingers. And while some states have publicly accused other states for cyber operations in the past,⁸ so far none has resorted to international litigation in an attempt to pursue reparation. In fact, to date there has not been a single dispute on this issue brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ).\nThis contribution therefore explores how far the past case law of the ICJ gives guidance on how it might deal with a case concerning state responsibility for an injury arising out of a cyber-attack.⁹ For the purpose of this article, cyber-attacks shall be considered to constitute any state-operated hostile intrusion into the cyber facilities of another state.¹⁰ Thus, the focus lies solely on cyber activities conducted by a state Finnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) targeting another state.¹¹ This contribution, however, will not delve into issues that might arise out of the law of armed conflict.¹² In section 2, this article starts with illustrating evidentiary difficulties relating to cyber operations exemplified by Estonia and Georgia – two states that have been suffering under relatively harmful DDoS attacks. Thereafter, in section 3, the contribution provides a general overview over the ICJ’s past jurisprudence on its evidentiary standards and clarifies the standards the Court has required in the past for the establishment of certain breaches of international law. In particular, two possible breaches, the violation of the use of force principle and the prohibition of non-intervention and their attribution to a state are of interest in the case of cyber-attacks. In this context, the present authors will also address the newest large-scale cyber operations and conclude if they could be considered a violation of these two principles (section 4). Thereafter, the specific standard of proof required by the Court when examining the violation of the prohibition of the threat or use of force and non-intervention principle, as well as the burden of proof, will be addressed in more detail. Finally, in section 5, already suggested solutions by legal scholars to overcome evidentiary difficulties related to cyber-attacks will be analysed: shifting the burden of proof and lowering the evidentiary standard used by the Court (sections 5.1 and 5.2). The present authors will additionally address a significant topic that has been disregarded so far, namely the extremely difficult task to collect sufficient evidence in the cyber-context. Thus, without the Court’s involvement, it is the authors’ contention that it would be almost impossible for states to meet the required evidentiary standard (section 5.3).\n## 2. Cyber-Attacks and Evidentiary Difficulties: Estonia and Georgia In the current cyberspace era, where societies are more and more reliant on computer networks, cyber-attacks are becoming an ever-growing threat.¹³ As Roscini rightly pointed out: ‘The more digitally reliant a state is, the more Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack vulnerable to cyber attacks: if computer systems become the society's 'nerve system', incapacitating them may mean paralyzing the country.¹⁴ The weakness of a state, which is highly dependent on computer networks and electronic information, was best observed in Estonia, when it was the target of several DDoS attacks¹⁵ in 2007.¹⁶ In what was one of the most prominent cyber-attacks in history to date, several Estonian governmental web pages and services became victims of DDoS attacks.¹⁷ The series of attacks, which lasted about three weeks, also targeted the Estonian banking system and media, including newspapers and TV stations, as well as other companies.¹⁸ Interestingly, the operation occurred closely after the Estonian Government decided to remove a Soviet Second World War memorial from the Tallinn city centre, which led to protests of Russian youth groups and vocal opposition by the Russian Government itself.¹⁹ Due to the political circumstances and the fact that some of the attacks could be traced back to IP addresses of Russian state institutions, Estonia accused Russia of the operation.²⁰ Russia, however, denied any involvement and responsibility for the attacks and eventually, Estonia backed away from its accusations.²¹ Similarly, the DDoS attacks conducted against Georgia in 2008 could, to some extent, be traced back to IP addresses belonging to Russian state-operated companies.²² The attacks happened at the time where Georgia was already involved in an armed conflict with Russia over South Ossetia.²³ Finnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) While Georgia tried to hold on to the region, Russia supported it in its aim to become independent.²⁴ Both attacks were merely accompanied by circumstantial evidence.²⁵ In order to successfully claim Russia's involvement, the tense political climate between both Georgia and Russia as well as Estonia and Russia was brought forward in combination with the fact that the attack could be tracked back to Russian IP addresses.²⁶ However, neither Estonia nor Georgia could provide essential evidence in order to attribute those cyber operations to Russia.²⁷ What is more, many experts do not believe that Russian authorities were behind the Georgian attacks, but want to attribute them rather to Russian patriotic hackers.²⁸ While technical attribution is very helpful in the determination of the originator of an attack, it cannot provide perfect accuracy.²⁹ First, the actual attacker can make attribution³⁰ very difficult and conceal his/her paths and traces through tactics like IP spoofing, botnets³¹ or 'onion routing'.³² Through IP spoofing, for instance, individual hackers might try to feign Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack their identity and erroneously attribute cyber-attacks to an innocent state.³³ Hackers can also use computer networks over the whole world to launch an attack, and as data goes through various countries, it is even more difficult to identify one single state as responsible for the cyber operation.³⁴ For instance, 85,000 computers from 178 different countries carried out the DDoS attacks against Estonia.³⁵ If a state suffers damage from a cyber-attack like Estonia, where damage amounted to tens of millions of euros,³⁶ and if it can be established that the attack constitutes an internationally wrongful act (eg an unlawful intervention),³⁷ one would think that it might have an interest in invoking state responsibility for its injury before the ICJ. In this case, the victim state would have to provide evidence in support of its claim, namely that a specific state was behind the cyber-attack which is consequently obligated to make reparation under the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. Despite the fact that the Court has not dealt with a dispute concerning cyber-attacks yet, it was nevertheless already confronted with difficult fact-finding. Therefore, the next section will deal with a general analysis on the standard of proof which the ICJ will require in a proceeding to successfully attribute an internationally wrongful act to the perpetrator.\n# 3. Evidentiary Standards before the International Court of Justice In order to invoke state responsibility, a victim state needs evidence to 1) establish the material elements of the wrongful act, as well as 2) attribute this act to the alleged perpetrator.³⁸ In general, such evidence needs to be persuasive in order to satisfy the court/tribunal of the truthfulness of its allegation.\n\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) This section will show that, concerning the responsibility of states, the ICJ’s case law indicates that three different types of standards can be distinguished. All of them will be explained below.\nBefore examining the evidentiary standards, it is important to highlight that the Court generally enjoys wide discretion in matters of evidence.³⁹ Neither the Statute nor the Rules of Court contain formal rules regarding the Court’s handling of evidence and in particular, the evaluation of the probative value of evidence submitted by the parties.⁴⁰ Accordingly, Article 58(2) Rules of Court only stipulates that ‘[…] the method of handling the evidence […] shall be settled by the Court after the views of the parties have been ascertained […].’⁴¹ The Rules of the Court, equally, do not mention which standard of proof has to be applied by the Court nor which methods of proof (eg documentary evidence) are persuasive enough to the ICJ to meet a certain standard.⁴² This wide discretionary power, therefore, not only applies to fact-finding in general, but also to the Court’s choice of the appropriate evidentiary standard in a given case.⁴³ Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack When discussing the standard of proof, however, it is inevitable to discuss the issue of burden of proof beforehand.⁴⁴ Most importantly, the two should not be confused. Burden of proof means that the party who asserts a fact in the proceeding is also the party who bears the burden of proving it,⁴⁵ namely ‘to convince the Court of the truthfulness of its claim’.⁴⁶ Only after it becomes clear which party bears the burden of proof, the Court is called upon to decide on the necessary standard.⁴⁷ In this sense, the standard of proof stipulates which degree of probability has to be provided by the party to convince the Court⁴⁸ or more specifically, the quantum of proof that has to be shown in order to ‘[...] discharge the burden of proof when that burden rests upon [that party]’.⁴⁹ Looking at the rare amount of cases where the ICJ has touched upon the question of evidentiary standards, it becomes evident that there is not a single standard for all disputes arising before it.⁵⁰ In cases concerning state responsibility,⁵¹ the actual standard of proof in a given case is determined by the substantive nature of the obligation, which was breached and is claimed by a party.⁵² ⁴⁴.

Accordingly, Judge Greenwood pointed out that if cases exist where a state claims charges of exceptional gravity against another state, there have to be cases where a party claims less serious breaches and in those disputes, a lower standard of proof would be appropriate.⁵⁷ While the Bosnian Genocide case clearly shows that the ICJ requires a higher degree of certainty for serious charges, it is more difficult to perceive the exact difference between – in what seems like – a variety of evidentiary standards mentioned in the Court’s other case law. This is exemplified by the Court’s approach to use terms such as ‘convincing/convinced’,⁵⁸ ‘conclusive’,⁵⁹ ‘sufficient’⁶⁰ and ‘insufficient/not sufficient evidence’⁶¹ rather confusable so far instead of explaining which ⁵³.

To establish international responsibility, one must have clear and indisputable facts.’⁶⁵ In the authors’ opinion, this seems plausible. The application of a balance of probabilities standard essentially means that the truthfulness of an allegation has to be ‘more probable than not’⁶⁶ compared to the evidence submitted by the alleged perpetrator. This, however, cannot suffice to establish international responsibility convincingly. Such a low standard might very easily lead to a false attribution of internationally wrongful acts, which ultimately were not committed by the state, although it might indeed seem this way.⁶⁷ Accordingly, it is important to highlight that the Court itself never used a balance of probabilities standard with regard to a state responsibility case.\nThe *Corfu Channel* case also indicates that proof beyond reasonable doubt, a standard applied in national and international cases concerning the criminal responsibility of individuals,⁶⁸ is not an appropriate standard before ⁶². Benzing (n 39) 1265; see also *Oil Platforms* (n 50) 270, Separate Opinion of Judge Buergenthal, para 41: ‘One might ask, moreover, where the test of “insufficient” evidence comes from … and by reference to what standards the Court applies it? What is meant by “insufficient” evidence? Does the evidence have to be “convincing”, “preponderant”, “overwhelming” or “beyond a reasonable doubt” to be sufficient? The Court never spells out what the here relevant standard of proof is.’; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 129–30.\n⁶³. See *Corfu Channel* (n 25) 14, 16, 17, 18; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 126–27.\n⁶⁴. The preponderance of evidence standard is also known as balance of probabilities. “Preponderance of evidence” generally means that there is evidence greater in weight in comparison with the evidence adduced by the other party on the basis of reasonable probability rather than possibility.’ See Amerasinghe (n 25) 242.\n⁶⁵. *Corfu Channel* (n 25) 68, Dissenting Opinion of Judge Krylov, 72; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 133.\n⁶⁶.

For further details, see at n 88.\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) the ICJ, even if charges against a state are of exceptional gravity.⁶⁹ However, where such a grave breach is alleged, the Court does require a relatively high degree of certainty, namely fully conclusive evidence. Consequently, in Corfu Channel, the Court has not found that the UK met this high standard when claiming that the minefield was laid with the connivance of Albania.⁷⁰ This finding was later confirmed in Bosnian Genocide, where the Court equally refrained from applying the proof beyond reasonable doubt standard.⁷¹ However, the foregoing only applies to claims for which direct proof is available.⁷² Where mere circumstantial evidence is submitted by a party, the ICJ did require that proof must leave no room for reasonable doubt.⁷³ Again, the ICJ determined the exact parameters in Corfu Channel, when it noted with regards to the claim brought forward by the UK that Albania knew about the minefield in its territorial waters: [...] the fact of this exclusive territorial control exercised by a State within its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the knowledge of that State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. [...] The proof may be drawn from inferences of fact, provided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt.⁷⁴ Essentially, the ICJ held on the basis of circumstantial evidence – meaning facts which considered together lead ‘logically to a single conclusion’ – that ⁶⁹. Corfu Channel (n 25) 17; Benzing (n 39) 1265; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 134–36; see also Amerasinghe (n 25) 235, who pointed out that the proof beyond reasonable doubt standard is too severe to be applied to non-criminal cases. One reason for this might be the fact that inter-state disputes are not criminal cases and in their very nature resemble civil cases, where parties stand on an equal footing. Cf Roscini (n 6) 227.\n⁷⁰. This was the second alternative argument of the UK Government. See Corfu Channel (n 25) 16–17. See also reference to Corfu Channel in Bosnian Genocide (n 50) para 209.\n⁷¹. See Bosnian Genocide (n 50) para 209; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 135. At one point, however, the Court did apply a standard of proof close to the standard beyond reasonable doubt, when it required proof beyond any doubt in respect of the allegation that there was aid and assistance between the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and VRS leaders, who carried out the acts of genocide. See Bosnian Genocide (n 50) para 422; Teitelbaum (n 39) 128.\n⁷². Quintana (n 47) 407.\n⁷³. Corfu Channel (n 25) 18. For a definition on circumstantial evidence, see at n 26.\n⁷⁴. Corfu Channel (n 25) 18. Note that ‘[...] inferences are a tool of judicial reasoning employed to aid a court in determining whether the burden of proof has been met in cases where direct proof is not available on a particular fact.’; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 113.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack Albania must have known about the mines in the Corfu Channel.75 Where the Court allows recourse to indirect evidence, this only being the case where direct evidence is under the exclusive territorial control of the other party and circumstantial evidence does not ‘contradict’ any existing direct proof,76 the standard will be elevated to proof beyond reasonable doubt.77 In two other cases, *Oil Platforms* and *Armed Activities*, where the violation of the prohibition of the use of force was claimed respectively, the ICJ applied a clear and convincing standard.78 Additionally, the Court also mentioned several times that the submitted evidence was either sufficient79 or insufficient.80 In Nicaragua, the Court merely noted that there was insufficient evidence to prove ‘various points’ but abstained from establishing a certain standard of proof, which needed to be met by the parties.81 It is not clear, however, how the evidentiary standards mentioned by the ICJ in those cases exactly differ from each other and how, in the end, they are decisive for the Court in the determination of the amount of proof the party has to provide in order to discharge its burden.82 Consequently, commentators have tried to highlight the differences between those standards by, inter alia, referring to their ordinary meaning as referred to in the Oxford English Dictionary.83 In doing so, they established a hierarchy between the terms conclusive, convincing and sufficient, with conclusive being the highest of the three standards.84 What is more, the lack of precise definitions for the different evidentiary standards, and especially the reluctance of international courts from discussing the standards they use85 Finnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) may also be ascribed to the influence of the civil/continental law – as opposed to common law – tradition on inter-state dispute settlement.⁸⁶ In the civil law system, judges determine the probative value of submitted evidence in both civil, and criminal law cases based on their internal conviction and are thus not required to apply a specific standard.⁸⁷ In common law jurisdictions, however, judges generally apply the preponderance of evidence or reasonable degree of probability standard with regard to civil law cases, whereas in criminal law cases, a higher standard, namely proof beyond reasonable doubt, has to be met.⁸⁸ Above all, many difficulties when determining evidentiary standards arise due to the simple fact that the evaluation of evidence is a subjective matter – ultimately leading to contradictions between judges on what kind of evidence suffices to be convincing to discharge the burden.⁸⁹ However, it would still be important to know for parties what the ICJ itself exactly means by conclusive, convincing and sufficient evidence.⁹⁰ What is more, the parties appearing before the Court should, already during the proceedings, have at least some clue as to which evidentiary standard will be applied to the case and not be taken by surprise by the Court's final judgment.⁹¹ Particularly in Bosnian Genocide, however, the Court already went a step further by giving more detailed answers than in previous cases and hopefully will continue to develop the case law more consistently with regard to the question of evidentiary standards.⁹² In conclusion, legal scholars have identified three types of state responsibility cases before the ICJ when it comes to determining the relevant standard of proof.⁹³ First, in regular cases, the ICJ demands proof at a high level of certainty appropriate to the seriousness of the allegation.⁹⁴ The amount of ⁸⁶.

This makes it then possible to explore the level of seriousness of the alleged breach in order to determine the evidentiary standard which has to be met by the parties in the dispute.\n## 4. Cyber-Attacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts Cyber-attacks may vary greatly in scale and form. However, only when these ‘hostile uses of cyberspace’¹⁰¹ amount to a violation of international law, the question of international adjudication arises.¹⁰² In the authors’ opinion, the international obligations most relevant for a cyber-attack to constitute an internationally wrongful act are those that most severely infringe a state’s sovereignty. Thus, the prohibition of the threat or use of force and the principle of non-intervention and their applicability to cyber operations are of special interest. Based on these two principles, the question of how to attribute these ⁹⁵. Teitelbaum (n 39) 125–26; Roscini (n 6) 228.\n⁹⁶. Quintana (n 47) 408; cf Riddell and Plant (n 39) 132–36.\n⁹⁷.

More specifically, when they occur ‘in the “international relations” of member states’ and do not merely constitute a private act without a state’s involvement, Dinniss (n 1) 40.\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) 'attacks' to a state will be examined and the necessary standard of proof to be applied in those cases will be determined. It is also important to note that the term cyber-'attack', being a non-legal term, is not to be equated to the term 'armed attack', triggering the right of self-defence under Article 51 UN Charter.¹⁰³ ## 4.1. The Threat or Use of Force Due to its severity, the first international obligation to be discussed here is the prohibition of the threat or use of force, enshrined in Article 2(4) UN Charter.¹⁰⁴ This prohibition is considered to be a norm of customary international law¹⁰⁵ and the overall consensus is that it is also applicable to cyber operations.¹⁰⁶ This is in line with the ICJ's Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion, where it noted that the prohibition to use force applies 'regardless of the weapons employed'.¹⁰⁷ It is more the effect of a weapon upon which a breach of Article 2(4) is determined.¹⁰⁸ Traditionally, only physical damage to property, loss of life or injury of persons were thought to meet this requirement.¹⁰⁹ Moreover, a state would need to prove that the cyber-attack has caused a severe effect, meaning that 'its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force'.¹¹⁰ Given the virtual (rather than physical) nature of cyber-attacks, this seems to be ¹⁰³. Article 51 UN Charter, 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS 16: 'Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.'\n¹⁰⁴.

Schmitt (ed) (n 101) Rule 11, 45.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack the most difficult part.¹¹¹ To give an example of such severity, the Stuxnet virus launched at the Iranian Natanz nuclear plant, supposedly leading to the physical damage of the plant's centrifuges could be considered, if proven, to be of such gravity that it would constitute a use of force.¹¹² Another attack worth mentioning in this regard is the recent NotPetya operation at the end of June this year. It was initially thought to be a ransomware attack,¹¹³ but then later qualified as being more than that, as the generation of revenue did not seem to be the primary goal of its operation.¹¹⁴ It also led to chaos on a large scale, with Ukraine seeming to be the main target.¹¹⁵ Despite the fact that physical damage did not occur, the NotPetya operation may nevertheless open up the discussion as to whether non-destructive cyber operations, which still massively disrupt the apparatus of the state, might be considered a violation of Article 2(4) in the future.¹¹⁶ To conclude, there seems to be a relatively high threshold of invoking the violation of Article 2(4), since the damage must be so severe it can be equated to a use of force in the traditional sense. Thus, in the case of less than forceful cyber-attacks or general lack of evidence, a state might have more success in claiming that the cyber intrusion constituted an unlawful intervention.¹¹⁷ ¹¹¹. On a side note, as the ICJ held in Nicaragua, the 'most grave forms' of the use of force amount to an 'armed attack', which would trigger the right of self-defence under Article 51 UN Charter, see Nicaragua (Merits) (n 41) para 191; Thus, by acknowledging that Article 51 UN Charter is also applicable in the cyber context, a cyber-attack of the 'most grave form' must also be one that enables the victim state to defend itself effectively.\n¹¹².

Non-Intervention The principle of non-intervention derived out of the principle of the sovereign equality of states, which is enshrined in Article 2(1) UN Charter.¹¹⁸ It also reflects customary international law.¹¹⁹ It is widely seen to be equally applicable to cyber-attacks.¹²⁰ According to the ICJ, a state’s coercive interference in another state’s internal affairs constitutes an unlawful intervention.¹²¹ The Court noted in the Nicaragua judgment, that the requirement of coercion is fulfilled, when a state is deprived of its free ‘choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy’.¹²² The most obvious form of such coercion, according to the ICJ, is an intervention that uses force.¹²³ Being a much broader obligation than the prohibition of threat or use of force, it thus prohibits both forceful and less than forceful operations.¹²⁴ Having determined previously that severe damage is needed to establish a use of force, less than forceful – but still coercive – cyber operations might thus still be unlawful. To give an example, the cyber-attack against Estonia in 2007 (if it is assumed that it was conducted by Russia) could be seen as an unlawful intervention in Estonia’s affairs, as it was a coercive attempt to influence Estonia not to relocate the Second World War memorial.¹²⁵ More recently, the hack and release of a vast amount of internal emails of the US Democratic National Committee to WikiLeaks right before the US elections has sparked widespread media attention. It primarily led to the increased negative portrayal of candidate Clinton in the media and is widely believed to have been conducted by the Russian Government in order to help candidate Trump win the presidency.¹²⁶ Another consequential hack was the attack against President Macron’s election campaign, which led to the ¹¹⁸.

Attribution Eventually, for state responsibility to arise, the wrongful conduct must be attributable to a state. The ILC Articles on State Responsibility set out in Articles 4 to 11 the different activities by individuals which are attributable to a state. These include first and foremost the conduct of de jure and de facto state organs as well as persons/entities ‘exercising elements of governmental authority’.¹³² Particular notice shall be made to private hackers, whose expertise might be used by states to conduct a cyber-attack. Two provisions of the ILC Articles might be of relevance in this regard. First, the ICJ noted in Bosnian Genocide that Article 4 ILC Articles might enable the attribution of acts of private individuals that are not formally recognised as state organs to the state, if they are ‘in a relationship of complete dependence on the State’.¹³³ ¹²⁷.

Articles 4, 5 ILC Articles on State Responsibility; Tsagourias (n 29) 239.\n¹³³. Bosnian Genocide (n 50) para 391.\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) Proving a complete dependence, however, might be very difficult. Thus, according to Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility,¹³⁴ the conduct of private individuals may still be attributable to a state if they are either acting under the instructions of that state or under their direction or control.¹³⁵ In the Nicaragua judgment, the ICJ determined the degree of control to be one of effective control ‘in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred’.¹³⁶ The ICTY’s Appeals Chamber argued in Tadić that its ‘overall control’ test, which was a test to establish the internationality of a conflict, would be equally applicable to questions of state responsibility.¹³⁷ This, however, was rejected by the ICJ in Bosnian Genocide, which considered the test to be too broad to apply it to the context of Article 8 and upheld its reasoning from Nicaragua.¹³⁸ This stricter test, however, poses another difficulty for an injured state, since proving effective control is a much higher threshold than claiming overall control of a state over the activities of a non-state actor.¹³⁹ Therefore, in order to attribute an act to a state, the ‘victim’ state would need to prove that the cyber-attack was launched from a device that belonged to someone who was either completely dependent on that state or his/her activities were somehow conducted under effective control of that state.\nSetting aside this high threshold of proving an individual’s affiliation with the state, the attribution to a specific territory itself proves already extremely difficult. To start with, one may have to identify the exact location of the device. In the simplest cases, this could be achieved by tracing back the IP address from which the attack was launched.¹⁴⁰ Thus, if the IP address reveals a government-owned facility, the device can be identified as a government computer and thus, state responsibility may arise.¹⁴¹ However, as explained in section 2 in more detail, there are many ways to obscure the identity of the actual perpetrator, eg through IP spoofing, or computer hijacking. Moreover, the Tallinn Manual notes that ‘the fact that a cyber operation has been routed via the cyber infrastructure located in a State’ does not constitute ‘sufficient evidence’ that the cyber activity is attributable to ¹³⁴.

Ibid.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack 95 that state.¹⁴² And, even if an attack could be traced back to a specific governmental computer infrastructure, this is only an *indication* which government was behind the attack.¹⁴³ Thus, attribution in the context of cyberspace proves extremely difficult.\n## 4.4. Proving a State’s Breach of the Prohibition of Non-Intervention and Article 2(4) Having demonstrated the various hurdles of applying the principle of non-intervention and Article 2(4) to the cyber context, the question now remains whether the current regime of proving a state’s breach of these principles remains applicable. For the purpose of this article, it is assumed that the material elements of a breach (such as coercion or severe damage) are sufficiently proven. Of particular interest is the question of proving the *attribution* of the attack to a state. For that as well, however, two main elements of proof need to be considered: the burden and the standard of proof.\n## 4.4.1. Burden of Proof It is important to note that the formal status of the parties in the proceedings, whether applicant or respondent, has no bearing on the allocation of the burden.¹⁴⁴ When asserting which party carries the burden of proof, the Court generally applies the *onus probandi incumbit actori* principle: It is the party asserting a fact that is responsible for providing the Court with proof thereof.¹⁴⁵ The allocation of the burden of proof is of fundamental importance since there can only be a decision in favour of a party that has to prove a certain fact when it has successfully discharged the burden.¹⁴⁶ Thus, if a state wants to successfully claim reparations for a state’s violations of the threat or use of force and non-intervention principle, it is up to the victim state to collect enough evidence to discharge the burden. The *onus probandi* rule, however, is not an absolute one, the determination of the burden of proof is in reality dependent on the subject-matter and nature of each dispute brought before the Court; it varies according to ¹⁴².

Amerasinghe (n 25) 36; Kazazi (n 39) 36.\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) the type of facts which it is necessary to establish for the purpose of the decision of this case.¹⁴⁷ The question whether or not a state is under a general duty to disclose all relevant evidence that may be solely in its possession, is also closely linked to the burden of proof and to this date remains the subject of significant scholarly debate. Even if a state could successfully trace back IP addresses to another government's computer infrastructures, it would not have access to these computers in the same way as the perpetrator state. While some argue for the general notion that states need to act in good faith when participating in a judicial procedure,¹⁴⁸ with regard to the wording of Article 49 of the Court's Statute ('formal note shall be taken of any refusal'), this provision for the production of evidence does not seem to imply a binding legal obligation for states to comply with Article 49 requests.¹⁴⁹ While the Court might be allowed to draw adverse inferences from not complying with such a request (even though it has been reluctant to do so in the past), this does not mean it could compel a party to produce evidence.¹⁵⁰ It can therefore be assumed that an argument for the non-binding nature of Article 49 requests stands on stronger footing.\n## 4.4.2. Standard of Proof Due to the technical difficulty of attributing a cyber-attack, it might be argued that different standards of proof shall apply for the attribution on the one hand and claiming the substantive violation on the other. For attribution, certain scholars refer to the Yeager arbitration.¹⁵¹ There, the Iran-US Claims ¹⁴⁷. Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v Democratic Republic of the Congo), ICJ Reports (2010) 639, para 54; Quintana (n 47) 393.

See however Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Salvador v Honduras; Nicaragua intervening), ICJ Reports (1992) 351, para 63, where the Court stated that it 'cannot however apply a presumption that evidence which is unavailable would, if produced, have supported a particular party's case; still less a presumption of the existence of evidence which has not been produced'. Riddell and Plant (n 39) 116.\n¹⁵¹. See, eg Schmitt and Vihul (n 5) 65–66.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack Tribunal noted that the attribution of a wrongful conduct to a state must be proven with reasonable certainty.¹⁵² However, the ICJ noted in *Bosnian Genocide* that the same standard of proof applies to both the violation of the substantive rule as well as the attribution for such acts.¹⁵³ In other words, rather than separating attribution and violation, both of them require the same standard of proof. Thus, since the standard of proof varies with the violation, the standard of reasonable certainty does not apply to all cases.\nIn *Armed Activities* and *Oil Platforms*, the ICJ set the threshold of alleging an unlawful use of force to clear and convincing evidence.¹⁵⁴ As noted in section 3, the Court demands the higher standard of fully conclusive evidence only in charges of exceptional gravity. This suggests that the violation of Article 2(4) is not considered to be of such grave nature, which – given that a non-forceful intervention is considered less harmful, must hold true for the principle of non-intervention as well. Consequently, the clear and convincing standard would most likely equally apply to prove an intervention.\nHowever, especially when alleging a cyber-attack that violated the prohibition of use of force or non-intervention, direct proof will often be missing and thus the only type of evidence the parties may be able to offer is circumstantial evidence.¹⁵⁵ In that case, as we have seen before, the proof provided ‘must leave no room for reasonable doubt’.¹⁵⁶ However, with current techniques, it is almost impossible to attribute an attack to a state beyond reasonable doubt, especially without giving away specific know-how that might be too delicate to share with the rest of the world.¹⁵⁷ Therefore, without lowering the standard to give credit to the special circumstances of cyber-attacks, it will be almost impossible for states to prove the affiliation of a state to the attack. See section 5.2 on this issue.\n# 5. Possible Means to Address the Evidentiary Dilemma in Cyberspace Cyber-attacks might to some extent be considered textbook examples of a scenario where one party has exclusive control over the evidence required and where direct proof is often not available.¹⁵⁸ Section 5.1 thus seeks to ¹⁵².

Next, the question whether the ICJ might depart from its strict approach concerning circumstantial evidence will be addressed in section 5.2.¹⁵⁹ For both questions, opinions of different legal scholars will be analysed. Finally, as a new way forward to resolve some of the evidentiary issues in the cyber context, the present authors suggest that – as an alternative solution – the Court should make more use of its inherent powers regarding the production of evidence (section 5.3).\n## 5.1. Reversing the Burden of Proof As attribution poses one of the biggest problems in the cyber context, some authors have called for a reversal of the burden of proof, even though the reasons for arriving at this conclusion are very different. One of them makes a case for not applying the ICJ’s findings in *Corfu Channel*, arguing that by their very nature computers are different to sea-mines.¹⁶⁰ Therefore, the same standards cannot be applied in the cyber context; hence a reversal of the burden of proof is appropriate.¹⁶¹ For authors dealing with problems like identification or attribution, fairness and efficiency seem to be their focal point for arguing for a reversal of the burden, assuming that the party whose territory the attack has emanated from, has superior access to information.¹⁶² Consequently, the onus should be on the country where the attack had been launched from (allegedly).¹⁶³ Proponents of this approach also put forward that, with a reversal of the burden, states would take their due diligence obligations of preventing cyber-attacks more seriously.¹⁶⁴ This is closely linked to the claim that the precautionary principle originating from environmental law can be applied to cyberspace, which then automatically shifts the burden of proof.¹⁶⁵ While the application of the precautionary principle might well ¹⁵⁹.

When looking at the ICJ’s case law, ever since its first decision, the Court has not been inclined to shift the burden, even when evidence was exclusively located in the territory of one state.¹⁶⁸ This finding in *Corfu Channel* has so far not been overruled in any way.¹⁶⁹ What is more, the Court reaffirmed its findings in the *Nicaragua* case, acknowledging that even in times of ongoing armed conflicts (as was the case in *eg Georgia* in 2008), where evidence might be hard to come by, this might affect the standard of proof, not however the burden.¹⁷⁰ Even Judge Owada’s Separate Opinion to the *Oil Platforms* case dealt with difficulties arising from evidentiary imbalances between the applicant and the respondent in a self-defence scenario, as it was the US’s duty to establish that Iran had launched an armed attack against them, against which they defended themselves. While not wholeheartedly content with the situation, he stated that: Nevertheless, there is no denying the fact that there undoubtedly exists an asymmetry in the situation surrounding the case [...]. I am prepared to accept that this asymmetry is inherent in the circumstances of the present case and there is little the Court can do under the circumstances. It is primarily the task incumbent upon the party which claims certain facts as the basis of its contention to establish them by producing sufficient evidence in accordance with the principle *actori incumbit onus probandi*.¹⁷¹ In light of the discussion above, it can be therefore concluded that it is highly unlikely that the ICJ would shift the burden of proof in the cyber context, not only because of the established case law but also because of certain --- ¹⁶⁶.

Cyber operations are often routed through numerous countries,¹⁷² thus a reversal could place the burden of proof on a wholly uninvolved party.¹⁷³ It is, however, important to note that the Court has always been concerned with a level playing field for the parties, which could not be facilitated by a reversal of the burden. What may however be considered, might be lowering the evidentiary standard to facilitate the discharge of the burden.¹⁷⁴ ## 5.2. Lowering the Evidentiary Standard – The Indirect Evidence Dilemma As was already explained above, the ICJ seems to have a case-to-case approach for the evidentiary standard to be applied. This makes it incredibly difficult for the parties to assess how much evidence is needed to successfully discharge the burden. However, there are certain signpost judgments shining light on an expected standard to be met (such as Armed Activities or Oil Platforms in the case of claiming use of force).¹⁷⁵ As was already mentioned in section 4.4.b), it only seems logical to assume that the party alleging such violations in the form of a cyber-attack would need to meet the same clear and convincing evidentiary standard.¹⁷⁶ Some authors regard this standard as still too high, deeming it as too strict and advocating for the lower balance of probabilities standard.¹⁷⁷ However, looking at the ICJ’s previous case law, it is very unlikely that the Court would apply a lower standard than clear and convincing. In fact, as noted above, the ICJ might even set the standard to proof beyond reasonable doubt, since direct proof will often be missing.¹⁷⁸ This, however, would set Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack the standard for cyber-attacks incredibly high. On the other hand, it would do away with concerns that a lower evidentiary standard would make it easier to blame a state for conduct it had nothing to do with. Protecting the respondent from false attribution, be it through IP spoofing, botnets or onion routing,¹⁷⁹ is an argument that should not be left out of the debate concerning a lower evidentiary standard.¹⁸⁰ However, applying a beyond reasonable doubt standard in the cyber context might also be too far reaching: With regard to cyber-attacks, collecting evidence will always remain extremely hard and it would be (at least at the moment) impossible to collect information that reaches a higher level than clear and convincing.¹⁸¹ The victim state would be left with the impossible task to meet a standard which is ‘unreachable’, which could potentially result in perpetrator states evading their responsibility under international law. As Judge Owada held in his Separate Opinion to *Oil Platforms*: As a court of justice whose primary function is the proper administration of justice, should see to it that this problem relating to evidence be dealt with in such a way that utmost justice is brought to bear on the final finding of the Court [...] It would seem to me that the only way to achieve this would have been for the Court to take a more proactive stance on the issue of evidence and that of fact-finding in the present case. This brings me to the standard of proof to be required for discharging the burden of proof in a case where the party who carries the burden of proof, though responsible for discharging that burden, finds itself in an extremely difficult situation as seen from an objective point of view.¹⁸² These opinions, however, clearly show that the ICJ itself would not be interested in applying a standard that would be impossible to meet for the parties involved and that the paramount principle underlying the ICJ’s assessment of evidence is the proper administration of justice.¹⁸³ Such is unlikely when the Court would require parties to prove their allegations beyond reasonable doubt, even when direct proof is not available.\n--- ¹⁷⁹.

This, particularly due to the fact that evidence is often located in the exclusive territory of the alleged perpetrator and obtaining said evidence one-sidedly would constitute a violation of that state's sovereignty.¹⁸⁵ The present authors therefore suggest combining the clear and convincing standard with a more enhanced use of the Court's inherent fact-finding powers. This new approach will be discussed below.\n## 5.3. The Court’s Powers for the Production of Evidence As discussed above, the present authors propose that the clear and convincing standard would be the best way to aptly deal with the evidentiary difficulties relating to cyber-attacks. Authors such as Roscini and Schmitt have already illustrated quite convincingly why this standard, being still significantly high, would be appropriate.¹⁸⁶ However, little has been said so far on how exactly the Court could be furnished with evidence that would satisfy the demands of a clear and convincing standard. Therefore, this section seeks to shine light on how to overcome certain evidentiary hurdles through the Court's more active usage of its powers to produce evidence. More specifically, it will do so by focusing on the evidentiary power that might become indispensable in these highly scientific and technical matters: the use of court-appointed experts. Before analysing those in detail, however, this section will start with a more general overview on ways to collect evidence in an ICJ proceeding.\nFirst, in theory, the Court has the inherent power to request additional documents, call its own witnesses, appoint own experts, or make on site visits. This has rarely happened in the past, as the Court has always been of the opinion that parties to the dispute should first and foremost furnish the Court with evidence themselves.¹⁸⁷ However, the extremely cautious approach as an intermediary not making use of its powers has been widely criticised.¹⁸⁸ --- ¹⁸⁴.

Regarding the power of the Court to call experts, see, eg, Benzing (n 39) 1256–57.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack For example, in Bosnian Genocide, the Court did not grant an evidentiary request by Bosnia (as according to the Court, they already had extensive evidence in their possession) but then ultimately found that it had not successfully discharged its burden.¹⁸⁹ The backlash created by this finding might open up the road to a more proactive stance in the future, particularly in the cyber context.\nSecond, the parties can appoint experts according to Articles 57 and 64 Rules of the Court.¹⁹⁰ It happened before that scientific experts appeared as counsel for one of the parties, which, however, due to not having been appointed as experts according to the ICJ’s Statute, barred the other party to the proceeding from cross-examining this counsel.¹⁹¹ The Court criticised this approach in *Pulp Mills* of having limited value.¹⁹² This critique seems to have been successful, as in recent cases, such as *Whaling*, the parties appointed experts according to the Rules, that could be cross-examined by both the Court and other parties.¹⁹³ Lastly, the Court may appoint experts itself. Pursuant to Article 50 of the Statute, ‘[t]he Court may, at any time, entrust any individual, body, bureau, commission, or other organization that it may select, with the task of carrying out an enquiry or giving an expert opinion’.¹⁹⁴ The advantages of using court-appointed experts are manifold, aside from the fact that a potential bias plays less of a role as opposed to party-appointed experts.¹⁹⁵ Therefore, the present authors argue that making better usage of the Court’s own powers to appoint experts under Article 50 would help resolve attribution issues in the cyber context.\n¹⁸⁹.

Only in the Chorzow Factory case in front of the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ), as well as the Corfu Channel and the Gulf of Maine case in front of the ICJ, experts have been appointed under this procedure.¹⁹⁸ This reluctance has been widely criticised not only by doctrine¹⁹⁹ but also within the Court.²⁰⁰ One explanation for the neglect of Article 50 might be the fact that court-appointed experts almost exclusively appear in civil law jurisdictions and that to jurists from common law backgrounds, this appointment might seem like an undue interference, especially with regard to the burden of proof of the parties.²⁰¹ It has also been the Court's contention that the use of experts was just not necessary, as the parties involved in the proceedings seldom disagreed on matters of fact but rather on matters of law.²⁰² This, however, Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack is an outdated notion, as proceedings seem to gradually focus more on scientific and technical questions and the Court is increasingly involved in extensive fact-finding.²⁰³ Consequently, particularly due to the specific technical and scientific knowledge required in cyber-related proceedings, judges will not be able to obtain such expertise easily by themselves and reliance on party-appointed experts will likely not yield a satisfactory outcome due to the uncertainty resulting out of their potential bias.\nAnother argument in favour of court-appointed experts is that particularly in the cyber context, one party may have superior access to information, or might even be the only one able to access specific documents.²⁰⁴ Also, it is hard to imagine that the decision in a proceeding involving cyber-attacks would not to a large part hinge on the establishment of factual circumstances, as traces can be erased so easily, computers hijacked and so forth. Gaining that kind of knowledge through court-appointed experts seems to be one of the best ways to establish those facts.²⁰⁵ Legal scholar Roscini proposes that the ICJ should use the fact-finding powers mentioned above to counterbalance evidentiary difficulties in cases where an exceptionally high standard has to be met (such as for example 'fully conclusive' in the case of genocide).²⁰⁶ However, the present authors argue that – in the cyber context – not even a more proactive stance on fact-finding could produce evidence that meets the requirements of a fully conclusive or beyond reasonable doubt standard. These evidentiary difficulties in the cyber context become clear when comparing a typical cyber scenario to a state responsibility case, where the Court made use of its fact-finding powers. In Corfu Channel, the Court concluded that the exceptionally high standard of beyond reasonable doubt to decide on Albania's international responsibility was met due to the tests run by court-appointed experts. It might thus be possible for experts to arrive at a single logical conclusion on whether an Albanian coastguard would have been able to see a ship passing through in the dark.²⁰⁷ This, however, cannot be said for experts having to determine whether an attack, which was routed through multiple countries, was caused Finnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) by a specific state. Not even the biggest team of experts could furnish the Court with evidence that simply does not exist. This is why the present authors propose that the best way to overcome evidentiary problems in the cyber context would be a more active use of the Court's fact-finding powers to reach the lower, but still satisfying clear and convincing standard. The fact that the Court has recently appointed experts in the Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean case between Costa Rica and Nicaragua – the first appointment in over 30 years – might be an indicator that the Court is about to change its reluctant stance on Article 50.²⁰⁸ ## 6. Conclusion It is probably only a matter of time until a state lodges an application before the ICJ, claiming that it suffered damage arising out of a cyber-attack. It is almost certain that the Court will then be faced with several new questions, starting with whether a specific cyber-attack amounts to a violation of international law, to whether the current regime of evidentiary standards employed by the Court so far gives credit to the specific technical difficulties of proving cyber-attacks. As demonstrated by Estonia and Georgia, this contribution displayed the severe evidentiary troubles victim states have faced so far when trying to prove a state's involvement and thus, arguably, a reluctance to address international tribunals in this matter.\nFirst, the present authors started with analysing the current evidentiary regime of the Court to shine light on this delicate topic. It became clear that when dealing with state responsibility, the Court has applied three different standards. These vary according to the seriousness of the claim. Thus, for charges of exceptional gravity, for example, it found that it must be convinced by fully conclusive evidence.\nTherefore, there must be a breach of an international obligation first, in order to assess what standard of proof the Court will most likely apply in the cyber context. Consequently, the present authors analysed two principles of international law that are most probable to be violated in the case of a cyber-attack against a state: the prohibition of the threat or use of force and the non-intervention principle: two principles, that by their very nature want to protect a state's territorial integrity.\n²⁰⁸. Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean (Costa Rica v Nicaragua), ICJ Order (31 May 2016); see Order of 16 June 2016; Gaja (n 195) 416–17.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack Although the Court already held that it will require clear and convincing evidence when a breach of Article 2(4) – and most likely also an unlawful intervention – is claimed, this only applies when direct proof is available. Nowadays, where technical difficulties hinder states to gather evidence linking a state directly to a cyber-attack, only indirect evidence can be submitted. In such a case, however, the Court established that it will require proof beyond reasonable doubt to let international responsibility arise. It is very likely that the ICJ will face various problems with this standard. Above all, a victim state would be left having to prove beyond reasonable doubt that a state is the originator of an attack. This is something that is obviously impossible with our current technical expertise.\nThus, scholars have proposed to shift the burden of proof to the perpetrator state, which now has to prove that it had not been involved in a cyberattack. This seems to be an unsatisfying solution: Not only did the Court itself refuse such an approach in the past; a shift would also put too much responsibility on the respondent state. Therefore, a more plausible approach would be to lower the evidentiary standard to clear and convincing, even in cases where direct proof is missing. Additionally, the present authors have pointed out how the inability of the parties to produce sufficient evidence can be overcome through the usage of the Court's power to appoint experts. This makes it possible to meet the clear and convincing standard and thus establish international responsibility.\nTo conclude, the relevant case law so far suggests that the Court will remain flexible in its application of evidentiary standards. It will be seen whether it may be open to lowering the standard in cases of exceptional difficulty. In this way, it could ensure that in each individual case, the appropriate standard to enable attribution is applied, but still protects states from wrongful conviction.\n^{}[]",

Despite its vast benefits, however, it has also been used to cause severe damage to states. Hostile cyber activities seem to have occurred more frequently over the past years. It is already recognised that international law – thus also the law on state responsibility – is applicable to cyber-related issues. However, particularly in the context of inter-state relations, the question of how states are able to seek reparation in front of the International Court of Justice for damage caused by a cyber-attack conducted by a state remains open to debate. This is primarily due to the fact that the cyber sphere enjoys a considerable amount of anonymity, which makes it hard to establish the main perpetrator behind an act. Therefore, calls have been made to shift the burden of proof or to lower the evidentiary standard required by the Court. In this article, the present authors will assess the relevant case law of the Court and apply it to two scenarios: a cyber-attack violating the prohibition of use of force and the non-intervention principle. The aim is to display the Court's line of reasoning and assess whether the scholarly demands to ease evidentiary issues, by shifting the burden or lowering the standard of proof, are justified or not. Additionally, the present authors will address a yet in the cyber-context unexplored, but nevertheless, important tool in collecting sufficient evidence: the power of the Court to appoint experts.\nKEYWORDS: cyber-attack, attribution, state responsibility, evidence, International Court of Justice, burden of proof, standard of proof * Isabella Brunner works in the Office of the Legal Adviser (Department of Public International Law) at the Austrian Federal Ministry for Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs.

Introduction Since the emergence of the Internet in the 1980s, various actors – both private and governmental – became the target of foreign cyber operations.¹ While thus being a ‘relatively’ new phenomenon in our society, it is unquestionable that their frequency and impact is rising with each year. This is owed to the fact that nowadays, individuals, private companies and governments increasingly and more intensely operate online.² Cyber operations targeted against states themselves generally aim to bring down governmental infrastructures, such as computer systems of institutions and governmental web pages. This has occurred, for instance, in Estonia and Georgia, where several facilities were brought down through so-called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.³ Another operation that has created widespread interest among international lawyers and remains heavily debated is the cyber hack into the emails of the US Democratic National Committee during the 2016 US presidential elections. One of the most recent large-scale cyber operations was the so-called NotPetya attack on 27 June 2017, targeting primarily Ukraine.⁴ However, the most consequential cyber operation so far remains the 2010 attack on Iran's Natanz nuclear facility plant, which is believed to have been carried out by Israel and the US. Through an infected USB device, it allegedly led to the physical damage of a significant number of centrifuges.⁵ As demonstrated above, the methods of launching a cyber-attack may vary in many ways (be it a DDoS attack or infiltration of malicious software). Nevertheless, all cyber-attacks so far have had one thing in common: the attacker was and remains fairly difficult to determine. As a consequence, it appears Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack that cyber operations may gradually be seen as a new and viable method through which states are able to inflict harm upon other states, enabling them to ‘hide behind their proxy servers’ while reaching their objectives.⁶ This results from the immense technical difficulties in attributing cyber operations to other states – also due to the possibility to conceal traces by methods such as IP spoofing – essentially giving states ‘impunity in cyberspace’.⁷ Therefore, victim states are often left unable to evince the origins of the act, making it impossible to persuasively attribute a wrongful act to another state. These factual difficulties, however, have significant legal consequences, especially because they will most certainly prevent state responsibility from being triggered, which thus gradually undermines the international legal order. Thus, although victim states often have at least an educated guess on the identity of the actual perpetrator, they remain reluctant to point fingers. And while some states have publicly accused other states for cyber operations in the past,⁸ so far none has resorted to international litigation in an attempt to pursue reparation. In fact, to date there has not been a single dispute on this issue brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ).\nThis contribution therefore explores how far the past case law of the ICJ gives guidance on how it might deal with a case concerning state responsibility for an injury arising out of a cyber-attack.⁹ For the purpose of this article, cyber-attacks shall be considered to constitute any state-operated hostile intrusion into the cyber facilities of another state.¹⁰ Thus, the focus lies solely on cyber activities conducted by a state Finnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) targeting another state.¹¹ This contribution, however, will not delve into issues that might arise out of the law of armed conflict.¹² In section 2, this article starts with illustrating evidentiary difficulties relating to cyber operations exemplified by Estonia and Georgia – two states that have been suffering under relatively harmful DDoS attacks. Thereafter, in section 3, the contribution provides a general overview over the ICJ’s past jurisprudence on its evidentiary standards and clarifies the standards the Court has required in the past for the establishment of certain breaches of international law. In particular, two possible breaches, the violation of the use of force principle and the prohibition of non-intervention and their attribution to a state are of interest in the case of cyber-attacks. In this context, the present authors will also address the newest large-scale cyber operations and conclude if they could be considered a violation of these two principles (section 4). Thereafter, the specific standard of proof required by the Court when examining the violation of the prohibition of the threat or use of force and non-intervention principle, as well as the burden of proof, will be addressed in more detail. Finally, in section 5, already suggested solutions by legal scholars to overcome evidentiary difficulties related to cyber-attacks will be analysed: shifting the burden of proof and lowering the evidentiary standard used by the Court (sections 5.1 and 5.2). The present authors will additionally address a significant topic that has been disregarded so far, namely the extremely difficult task to collect sufficient evidence in the cyber-context. Thus, without the Court’s involvement, it is the authors’ contention that it would be almost impossible for states to meet the required evidentiary standard (section 5.3).\n## 2. Cyber-Attacks and Evidentiary Difficulties: Estonia and Georgia In the current cyberspace era, where societies are more and more reliant on computer networks, cyber-attacks are becoming an ever-growing threat.¹³ As Roscini rightly pointed out: ‘The more digitally reliant a state is, the more Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack vulnerable to cyber attacks: if computer systems become the society's 'nerve system', incapacitating them may mean paralyzing the country.¹⁴ The weakness of a state, which is highly dependent on computer networks and electronic information, was best observed in Estonia, when it was the target of several DDoS attacks¹⁵ in 2007.¹⁶ In what was one of the most prominent cyber-attacks in history to date, several Estonian governmental web pages and services became victims of DDoS attacks.¹⁷ The series of attacks, which lasted about three weeks, also targeted the Estonian banking system and media, including newspapers and TV stations, as well as other companies.¹⁸ Interestingly, the operation occurred closely after the Estonian Government decided to remove a Soviet Second World War memorial from the Tallinn city centre, which led to protests of Russian youth groups and vocal opposition by the Russian Government itself.¹⁹ Due to the political circumstances and the fact that some of the attacks could be traced back to IP addresses of Russian state institutions, Estonia accused Russia of the operation.²⁰ Russia, however, denied any involvement and responsibility for the attacks and eventually, Estonia backed away from its accusations.²¹ Similarly, the DDoS attacks conducted against Georgia in 2008 could, to some extent, be traced back to IP addresses belonging to Russian state-operated companies.²² The attacks happened at the time where Georgia was already involved in an armed conflict with Russia over South Ossetia.²³ Finnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) While Georgia tried to hold on to the region, Russia supported it in its aim to become independent.²⁴ Both attacks were merely accompanied by circumstantial evidence.²⁵ In order to successfully claim Russia's involvement, the tense political climate between both Georgia and Russia as well as Estonia and Russia was brought forward in combination with the fact that the attack could be tracked back to Russian IP addresses.²⁶ However, neither Estonia nor Georgia could provide essential evidence in order to attribute those cyber operations to Russia.²⁷ What is more, many experts do not believe that Russian authorities were behind the Georgian attacks, but want to attribute them rather to Russian patriotic hackers.²⁸ While technical attribution is very helpful in the determination of the originator of an attack, it cannot provide perfect accuracy.²⁹ First, the actual attacker can make attribution³⁰ very difficult and conceal his/her paths and traces through tactics like IP spoofing, botnets³¹ or 'onion routing'.³² Through IP spoofing, for instance, individual hackers might try to feign Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack their identity and erroneously attribute cyber-attacks to an innocent state.³³ Hackers can also use computer networks over the whole world to launch an attack, and as data goes through various countries, it is even more difficult to identify one single state as responsible for the cyber operation.³⁴ For instance, 85,000 computers from 178 different countries carried out the DDoS attacks against Estonia.³⁵ If a state suffers damage from a cyber-attack like Estonia, where damage amounted to tens of millions of euros,³⁶ and if it can be established that the attack constitutes an internationally wrongful act (eg an unlawful intervention),³⁷ one would think that it might have an interest in invoking state responsibility for its injury before the ICJ. In this case, the victim state would have to provide evidence in support of its claim, namely that a specific state was behind the cyber-attack which is consequently obligated to make reparation under the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. Despite the fact that the Court has not dealt with a dispute concerning cyber-attacks yet, it was nevertheless already confronted with difficult fact-finding. Therefore, the next section will deal with a general analysis on the standard of proof which the ICJ will require in a proceeding to successfully attribute an internationally wrongful act to the perpetrator.\n# 3. Evidentiary Standards before the International Court of Justice In order to invoke state responsibility, a victim state needs evidence to 1) establish the material elements of the wrongful act, as well as 2) attribute this act to the alleged perpetrator.³⁸ In general, such evidence needs to be persuasive in order to satisfy the court/tribunal of the truthfulness of its allegation.\n\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) This section will show that, concerning the responsibility of states, the ICJ’s case law indicates that three different types of standards can be distinguished. All of them will be explained below.\nBefore examining the evidentiary standards, it is important to highlight that the Court generally enjoys wide discretion in matters of evidence.³⁹ Neither the Statute nor the Rules of Court contain formal rules regarding the Court’s handling of evidence and in particular, the evaluation of the probative value of evidence submitted by the parties.⁴⁰ Accordingly, Article 58(2) Rules of Court only stipulates that ‘[…] the method of handling the evidence […] shall be settled by the Court after the views of the parties have been ascertained […].’⁴¹ The Rules of the Court, equally, do not mention which standard of proof has to be applied by the Court nor which methods of proof (eg documentary evidence) are persuasive enough to the ICJ to meet a certain standard.⁴² This wide discretionary power, therefore, not only applies to fact-finding in general, but also to the Court’s choice of the appropriate evidentiary standard in a given case.⁴³ Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack When discussing the standard of proof, however, it is inevitable to discuss the issue of burden of proof beforehand.⁴⁴ Most importantly, the two should not be confused. Burden of proof means that the party who asserts a fact in the proceeding is also the party who bears the burden of proving it,⁴⁵ namely ‘to convince the Court of the truthfulness of its claim’.⁴⁶ Only after it becomes clear which party bears the burden of proof, the Court is called upon to decide on the necessary standard.⁴⁷ In this sense, the standard of proof stipulates which degree of probability has to be provided by the party to convince the Court⁴⁸ or more specifically, the quantum of proof that has to be shown in order to ‘[...] discharge the burden of proof when that burden rests upon [that party]’.⁴⁹ Looking at the rare amount of cases where the ICJ has touched upon the question of evidentiary standards, it becomes evident that there is not a single standard for all disputes arising before it.⁵⁰ In cases concerning state responsibility,⁵¹ the actual standard of proof in a given case is determined by the substantive nature of the obligation, which was breached and is claimed by a party.⁵² ⁴⁴.

Other cases, such as boundary disputes, will not be discussed here. For a short analysis on the balance of probabilities standard which is applicable to boundary disputes, see Riddell and Plant (n 39) 133.\n⁵². cf *Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Questions between Qatar and Bahrain* (*Qatar v Bahrain*), ICJ Reports (1995) 51, Dissenting Opinion of Judge Shahabuddeen, 63; *Corfu Channel* (n 25) 16–17; Benzing (n 39) 1266; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 132; Roscini (n 6) 232.\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) The fact that the Court requires different evidentiary standards depending on the level of seriousness of the breach became most evident in its Bosnian Genocide judgment.⁵³ In that case, the Court highlighted the difference between proving the commission of genocide and proving the failure to prevent genocide, as well as to punish and extradite persons charged with the crime of genocide.⁵⁴ While the Court stated that it requires fully conclusive evidence for charges of exceptional gravity and has to be fully convinced that the act of genocide was committed by the respondent, it pointed out that it ‘only’ requires proof at a high level of certainty appropriate to the seriousness of the allegation for other charges than of exceptional gravity.⁵⁵ This was the case with proving that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia failed to prevent the commission of genocide,⁵⁶ which is consequently a less severe violation of international law compared to the commission of genocide. Accordingly, Judge Greenwood pointed out that if cases exist where a state claims charges of exceptional gravity against another state, there have to be cases where a party claims less serious breaches and in those disputes, a lower standard of proof would be appropriate.⁵⁷ While the Bosnian Genocide case clearly shows that the ICJ requires a higher degree of certainty for serious charges, it is more difficult to perceive the exact difference between – in what seems like – a variety of evidentiary standards mentioned in the Court’s other case law. This is exemplified by the Court’s approach to use terms such as ‘convincing/convinced’,⁵⁸ ‘conclusive’,⁵⁹ ‘sufficient’⁶⁰ and ‘insufficient/not sufficient evidence’⁶¹ rather confusable so far instead of explaining which ⁵³.

To establish international responsibility, one must have clear and indisputable facts.’⁶⁵ In the authors’ opinion, this seems plausible. The application of a balance of probabilities standard essentially means that the truthfulness of an allegation has to be ‘more probable than not’⁶⁶ compared to the evidence submitted by the alleged perpetrator. This, however, cannot suffice to establish international responsibility convincingly. Such a low standard might very easily lead to a false attribution of internationally wrongful acts, which ultimately were not committed by the state, although it might indeed seem this way.⁶⁷ Accordingly, it is important to highlight that the Court itself never used a balance of probabilities standard with regard to a state responsibility case.\nThe *Corfu Channel* case also indicates that proof beyond reasonable doubt, a standard applied in national and international cases concerning the criminal responsibility of individuals,⁶⁸ is not an appropriate standard before ⁶². Benzing (n 39) 1265; see also *Oil Platforms* (n 50) 270, Separate Opinion of Judge Buergenthal, para 41: ‘One might ask, moreover, where the test of “insufficient” evidence comes from … and by reference to what standards the Court applies it? What is meant by “insufficient” evidence? Does the evidence have to be “convincing”, “preponderant”, “overwhelming” or “beyond a reasonable doubt” to be sufficient? The Court never spells out what the here relevant standard of proof is.’; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 129–30.\n⁶³. See *Corfu Channel* (n 25) 14, 16, 17, 18; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 126–27.\n⁶⁴. The preponderance of evidence standard is also known as balance of probabilities. “Preponderance of evidence” generally means that there is evidence greater in weight in comparison with the evidence adduced by the other party on the basis of reasonable probability rather than possibility.’ See Amerasinghe (n 25) 242.\n⁶⁵. *Corfu Channel* (n 25) 68, Dissenting Opinion of Judge Krylov, 72; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 133.\n⁶⁶.

For further details, see at n 88.\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) the ICJ, even if charges against a state are of exceptional gravity.⁶⁹ However, where such a grave breach is alleged, the Court does require a relatively high degree of certainty, namely fully conclusive evidence. Consequently, in Corfu Channel, the Court has not found that the UK met this high standard when claiming that the minefield was laid with the connivance of Albania.⁷⁰ This finding was later confirmed in Bosnian Genocide, where the Court equally refrained from applying the proof beyond reasonable doubt standard.⁷¹ However, the foregoing only applies to claims for which direct proof is available.⁷² Where mere circumstantial evidence is submitted by a party, the ICJ did require that proof must leave no room for reasonable doubt.⁷³ Again, the ICJ determined the exact parameters in Corfu Channel, when it noted with regards to the claim brought forward by the UK that Albania knew about the minefield in its territorial waters: [...] the fact of this exclusive territorial control exercised by a State within its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the knowledge of that State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. [...] The proof may be drawn from inferences of fact, provided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt.⁷⁴ Essentially, the ICJ held on the basis of circumstantial evidence – meaning facts which considered together lead ‘logically to a single conclusion’ – that ⁶⁹. Corfu Channel (n 25) 17; Benzing (n 39) 1265; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 134–36; see also Amerasinghe (n 25) 235, who pointed out that the proof beyond reasonable doubt standard is too severe to be applied to non-criminal cases. One reason for this might be the fact that inter-state disputes are not criminal cases and in their very nature resemble civil cases, where parties stand on an equal footing. Cf Roscini (n 6) 227.\n⁷⁰. This was the second alternative argument of the UK Government. See Corfu Channel (n 25) 16–17. See also reference to Corfu Channel in Bosnian Genocide (n 50) para 209.\n⁷¹. See Bosnian Genocide (n 50) para 209; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 135. At one point, however, the Court did apply a standard of proof close to the standard beyond reasonable doubt, when it required proof beyond any doubt in respect of the allegation that there was aid and assistance between the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and VRS leaders, who carried out the acts of genocide. See Bosnian Genocide (n 50) para 422; Teitelbaum (n 39) 128.\n⁷². Quintana (n 47) 407.\n⁷³. Corfu Channel (n 25) 18. For a definition on circumstantial evidence, see at n 26.\n⁷⁴. Corfu Channel (n 25) 18. Note that ‘[...] inferences are a tool of judicial reasoning employed to aid a court in determining whether the burden of proof has been met in cases where direct proof is not available on a particular fact.’; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 113.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack Albania must have known about the mines in the Corfu Channel.75 Where the Court allows recourse to indirect evidence, this only being the case where direct evidence is under the exclusive territorial control of the other party and circumstantial evidence does not ‘contradict’ any existing direct proof,76 the standard will be elevated to proof beyond reasonable doubt.77 In two other cases, *Oil Platforms* and *Armed Activities*, where the violation of the prohibition of the use of force was claimed respectively, the ICJ applied a clear and convincing standard.78 Additionally, the Court also mentioned several times that the submitted evidence was either sufficient79 or insufficient.80 In Nicaragua, the Court merely noted that there was insufficient evidence to prove ‘various points’ but abstained from establishing a certain standard of proof, which needed to be met by the parties.81 It is not clear, however, how the evidentiary standards mentioned by the ICJ in those cases exactly differ from each other and how, in the end, they are decisive for the Court in the determination of the amount of proof the party has to provide in order to discharge its burden.82 Consequently, commentators have tried to highlight the differences between those standards by, inter alia, referring to their ordinary meaning as referred to in the Oxford English Dictionary.83 In doing so, they established a hierarchy between the terms conclusive, convincing and sufficient, with conclusive being the highest of the three standards.84 What is more, the lack of precise definitions for the different evidentiary standards, and especially the reluctance of international courts from discussing the standards they use85 Finnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) may also be ascribed to the influence of the civil/continental law – as opposed to common law – tradition on inter-state dispute settlement.⁸⁶ In the civil law system, judges determine the probative value of submitted evidence in both civil, and criminal law cases based on their internal conviction and are thus not required to apply a specific standard.⁸⁷ In common law jurisdictions, however, judges generally apply the preponderance of evidence or reasonable degree of probability standard with regard to civil law cases, whereas in criminal law cases, a higher standard, namely proof beyond reasonable doubt, has to be met.⁸⁸ Above all, many difficulties when determining evidentiary standards arise due to the simple fact that the evaluation of evidence is a subjective matter – ultimately leading to contradictions between judges on what kind of evidence suffices to be convincing to discharge the burden.⁸⁹ However, it would still be important to know for parties what the ICJ itself exactly means by conclusive, convincing and sufficient evidence.⁹⁰ What is more, the parties appearing before the Court should, already during the proceedings, have at least some clue as to which evidentiary standard will be applied to the case and not be taken by surprise by the Court's final judgment.⁹¹ Particularly in Bosnian Genocide, however, the Court already went a step further by giving more detailed answers than in previous cases and hopefully will continue to develop the case law more consistently with regard to the question of evidentiary standards.⁹² In conclusion, legal scholars have identified three types of state responsibility cases before the ICJ when it comes to determining the relevant standard of proof.⁹³ First, in regular cases, the ICJ demands proof at a high level of certainty appropriate to the seriousness of the allegation.⁹⁴ The amount of ⁸⁶. Kazazi (n 39) 325; Roscini (n 6) 227; see also Riddell and Plant (n 39) 123: 'It appears however that the Court prefers not to provide a definitive standard, most probably because the Judges from the different legal traditions cannot agree.'\n⁸⁷.

Quintana (n 47) 408; cf Riddell and Plant (n 39) 132.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack certainty the Court generally requires in those cases seems to be clear and convincing evidence by parties.⁹⁵ Second, the Court requires a higher standard of proof/higher degree of certainty for cases where charges of exceptional gravity are claimed by a party against another state.⁹⁶ Here, the Court needs to be fully convinced that a state has actually committed the breach of an obligation.⁹⁷ In other words, the graver the charge, the more confidence there must be on the truthfulness of the claim.⁹⁸ Third, where states are only able to provide circumstantial evidence, this being the case where direct evidence is absent and the Court draws inferences from facts, it ultimately requires the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt.⁹⁹ The ICJ’s case law so far clearly shows that it adopts the relevant standard of proof on a case-by-case basis, appropriate to the circumstances and seriousness of the allegation.¹⁰⁰ The next step in this contribution is, therefore, to examine which internationally wrongful act states may want to attribute to other states before the ICJ, as far as cyber-attacks are concerned. This makes it then possible to explore the level of seriousness of the alleged breach in order to determine the evidentiary standard which has to be met by the parties in the dispute.\n## 4. Cyber-Attacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts Cyber-attacks may vary greatly in scale and form. However, only when these ‘hostile uses of cyberspace’¹⁰¹ amount to a violation of international law, the question of international adjudication arises.¹⁰² In the authors’ opinion, the international obligations most relevant for a cyber-attack to constitute an internationally wrongful act are those that most severely infringe a state’s sovereignty. Thus, the prohibition of the threat or use of force and the principle of non-intervention and their applicability to cyber operations are of special interest. Based on these two principles, the question of how to attribute these ⁹⁵. Teitelbaum (n 39) 125–26; Roscini (n 6) 228.\n⁹⁶. Quintana (n 47) 408; cf Riddell and Plant (n 39) 132–36.\n⁹⁷.

Cf Michael N Schmitt (ed), Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, 1st edn (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2013) 13.\n¹⁰². More specifically, when they occur ‘in the “international relations” of member states’ and do not merely constitute a private act without a state’s involvement, Dinniss (n 1) 40.\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) 'attacks' to a state will be examined and the necessary standard of proof to be applied in those cases will be determined. It is also important to note that the term cyber-'attack', being a non-legal term, is not to be equated to the term 'armed attack', triggering the right of self-defence under Article 51 UN Charter.¹⁰³ ## 4.1. The Threat or Use of Force Due to its severity, the first international obligation to be discussed here is the prohibition of the threat or use of force, enshrined in Article 2(4) UN Charter.¹⁰⁴ This prohibition is considered to be a norm of customary international law¹⁰⁵ and the overall consensus is that it is also applicable to cyber operations.¹⁰⁶ This is in line with the ICJ's Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion, where it noted that the prohibition to use force applies 'regardless of the weapons employed'.¹⁰⁷ It is more the effect of a weapon upon which a breach of Article 2(4) is determined.¹⁰⁸ Traditionally, only physical damage to property, loss of life or injury of persons were thought to meet this requirement.¹⁰⁹ Moreover, a state would need to prove that the cyber-attack has caused a severe effect, meaning that 'its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force'.¹¹⁰ Given the virtual (rather than physical) nature of cyber-attacks, this seems to be ¹⁰³. Article 51 UN Charter, 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS 16: 'Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.'\n¹⁰⁴.

(2012) 17 Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law 211, 212; Dinniss (n 1) 74; cf Roscini (n 106) 236; Schmitt (ed) (n 106) Rule 69, 331.\n¹⁰⁹. Buchan (n 108) 212; Roscini (n 106) 242; see however Tsagourias (n 29) 231, where it is noted that the destruction of critical state infrastructure, which itself does not cause human injury or physical damage, may also constitute an armed attack.\n¹¹⁰. Schmitt (ed) (n 101) Rule 11, 45.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack the most difficult part.¹¹¹ To give an example of such severity, the Stuxnet virus launched at the Iranian Natanz nuclear plant, supposedly leading to the physical damage of the plant's centrifuges could be considered, if proven, to be of such gravity that it would constitute a use of force.¹¹² Another attack worth mentioning in this regard is the recent NotPetya operation at the end of June this year. It was initially thought to be a ransomware attack,¹¹³ but then later qualified as being more than that, as the generation of revenue did not seem to be the primary goal of its operation.¹¹⁴ It also led to chaos on a large scale, with Ukraine seeming to be the main target.¹¹⁵ Despite the fact that physical damage did not occur, the NotPetya operation may nevertheless open up the discussion as to whether non-destructive cyber operations, which still massively disrupt the apparatus of the state, might be considered a violation of Article 2(4) in the future.¹¹⁶ To conclude, there seems to be a relatively high threshold of invoking the violation of Article 2(4), since the damage must be so severe it can be equated to a use of force in the traditional sense. Thus, in the case of less than forceful cyber-attacks or general lack of evidence, a state might have more success in claiming that the cyber intrusion constituted an unlawful intervention.¹¹⁷ ¹¹¹. On a side note, as the ICJ held in Nicaragua, the 'most grave forms' of the use of force amount to an 'armed attack', which would trigger the right of self-defence under Article 51 UN Charter, see Nicaragua (Merits) (n 41) para 191; Thus, by acknowledging that Article 51 UN Charter is also applicable in the cyber context, a cyber-attack of the 'most grave form' must also be one that enables the victim state to defend itself effectively.\n¹¹².

Non-Intervention The principle of non-intervention derived out of the principle of the sovereign equality of states, which is enshrined in Article 2(1) UN Charter.¹¹⁸ It also reflects customary international law.¹¹⁹ It is widely seen to be equally applicable to cyber-attacks.¹²⁰ According to the ICJ, a state’s coercive interference in another state’s internal affairs constitutes an unlawful intervention.¹²¹ The Court noted in the Nicaragua judgment, that the requirement of coercion is fulfilled, when a state is deprived of its free ‘choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy’.¹²² The most obvious form of such coercion, according to the ICJ, is an intervention that uses force.¹²³ Being a much broader obligation than the prohibition of threat or use of force, it thus prohibits both forceful and less than forceful operations.¹²⁴ Having determined previously that severe damage is needed to establish a use of force, less than forceful – but still coercive – cyber operations might thus still be unlawful. To give an example, the cyber-attack against Estonia in 2007 (if it is assumed that it was conducted by Russia) could be seen as an unlawful intervention in Estonia’s affairs, as it was a coercive attempt to influence Estonia not to relocate the Second World War memorial.¹²⁵ More recently, the hack and release of a vast amount of internal emails of the US Democratic National Committee to WikiLeaks right before the US elections has sparked widespread media attention. It primarily led to the increased negative portrayal of candidate Clinton in the media and is widely believed to have been conducted by the Russian Government in order to help candidate Trump win the presidency.¹²⁶ Another consequential hack was the attack against President Macron’s election campaign, which led to the ¹¹⁸.

Attribution Eventually, for state responsibility to arise, the wrongful conduct must be attributable to a state. The ILC Articles on State Responsibility set out in Articles 4 to 11 the different activities by individuals which are attributable to a state. These include first and foremost the conduct of de jure and de facto state organs as well as persons/entities ‘exercising elements of governmental authority’.¹³² Particular notice shall be made to private hackers, whose expertise might be used by states to conduct a cyber-attack. Two provisions of the ILC Articles might be of relevance in this regard. First, the ICJ noted in Bosnian Genocide that Article 4 ILC Articles might enable the attribution of acts of private individuals that are not formally recognised as state organs to the state, if they are ‘in a relationship of complete dependence on the State’.¹³³ ¹²⁷.

Bosnian Genocide (n 50) para 391.\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) Proving a complete dependence, however, might be very difficult. Thus, according to Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility,¹³⁴ the conduct of private individuals may still be attributable to a state if they are either acting under the instructions of that state or under their direction or control.¹³⁵ In the Nicaragua judgment, the ICJ determined the degree of control to be one of effective control ‘in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred’.¹³⁶ The ICTY’s Appeals Chamber argued in Tadić that its ‘overall control’ test, which was a test to establish the internationality of a conflict, would be equally applicable to questions of state responsibility.¹³⁷ This, however, was rejected by the ICJ in Bosnian Genocide, which considered the test to be too broad to apply it to the context of Article 8 and upheld its reasoning from Nicaragua.¹³⁸ This stricter test, however, poses another difficulty for an injured state, since proving effective control is a much higher threshold than claiming overall control of a state over the activities of a non-state actor.¹³⁹ Therefore, in order to attribute an act to a state, the ‘victim’ state would need to prove that the cyber-attack was launched from a device that belonged to someone who was either completely dependent on that state or his/her activities were somehow conducted under effective control of that state.\nSetting aside this high threshold of proving an individual’s affiliation with the state, the attribution to a specific territory itself proves already extremely difficult. To start with, one may have to identify the exact location of the device. In the simplest cases, this could be achieved by tracing back the IP address from which the attack was launched.¹⁴⁰ Thus, if the IP address reveals a government-owned facility, the device can be identified as a government computer and thus, state responsibility may arise.¹⁴¹ However, as explained in section 2 in more detail, there are many ways to obscure the identity of the actual perpetrator, eg through IP spoofing, or computer hijacking. Moreover, the Tallinn Manual notes that ‘the fact that a cyber operation has been routed via the cyber infrastructure located in a State’ does not constitute ‘sufficient evidence’ that the cyber activity is attributable to ¹³⁴.

Proving a State’s Breach of the Prohibition of Non-Intervention and Article 2(4) Having demonstrated the various hurdles of applying the principle of non-intervention and Article 2(4) to the cyber context, the question now remains whether the current regime of proving a state’s breach of these principles remains applicable. For the purpose of this article, it is assumed that the material elements of a breach (such as coercion or severe damage) are sufficiently proven. Of particular interest is the question of proving the *attribution* of the attack to a state. For that as well, however, two main elements of proof need to be considered: the burden and the standard of proof.\n## 4.4.1. Burden of Proof It is important to note that the formal status of the parties in the proceedings, whether applicant or respondent, has no bearing on the allocation of the burden.¹⁴⁴ When asserting which party carries the burden of proof, the Court generally applies the *onus probandi incumbit actori* principle: It is the party asserting a fact that is responsible for providing the Court with proof thereof.¹⁴⁵ The allocation of the burden of proof is of fundamental importance since there can only be a decision in favour of a party that has to prove a certain fact when it has successfully discharged the burden.¹⁴⁶ Thus, if a state wants to successfully claim reparations for a state’s violations of the threat or use of force and non-intervention principle, it is up to the victim state to collect enough evidence to discharge the burden. The *onus probandi* rule, however, is not an absolute one, the determination of the burden of proof is in reality dependent on the subject-matter and nature of each dispute brought before the Court; it varies according to ¹⁴².

Even if a state could successfully trace back IP addresses to another government's computer infrastructures, it would not have access to these computers in the same way as the perpetrator state. While some argue for the general notion that states need to act in good faith when participating in a judicial procedure,¹⁴⁸ with regard to the wording of Article 49 of the Court's Statute ('formal note shall be taken of any refusal'), this provision for the production of evidence does not seem to imply a binding legal obligation for states to comply with Article 49 requests.¹⁴⁹ While the Court might be allowed to draw adverse inferences from not complying with such a request (even though it has been reluctant to do so in the past), this does not mean it could compel a party to produce evidence.¹⁵⁰ It can therefore be assumed that an argument for the non-binding nature of Article 49 requests stands on stronger footing.\n## 4.4.2. Standard of Proof Due to the technical difficulty of attributing a cyber-attack, it might be argued that different standards of proof shall apply for the attribution on the one hand and claiming the substantive violation on the other. For attribution, certain scholars refer to the Yeager arbitration.¹⁵¹ There, the Iran-US Claims ¹⁴⁷.

See however Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Salvador v Honduras; Nicaragua intervening), ICJ Reports (1992) 351, para 63, where the Court stated that it 'cannot however apply a presumption that evidence which is unavailable would, if produced, have supported a particular party's case; still less a presumption of the existence of evidence which has not been produced'. Riddell and Plant (n 39) 116.\n¹⁵¹. See, eg Schmitt and Vihul (n 5) 65–66.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack Tribunal noted that the attribution of a wrongful conduct to a state must be proven with reasonable certainty.¹⁵² However, the ICJ noted in *Bosnian Genocide* that the same standard of proof applies to both the violation of the substantive rule as well as the attribution for such acts.¹⁵³ In other words, rather than separating attribution and violation, both of them require the same standard of proof. Thus, since the standard of proof varies with the violation, the standard of reasonable certainty does not apply to all cases.\nIn *Armed Activities* and *Oil Platforms*, the ICJ set the threshold of alleging an unlawful use of force to clear and convincing evidence.¹⁵⁴ As noted in section 3, the Court demands the higher standard of fully conclusive evidence only in charges of exceptional gravity. This suggests that the violation of Article 2(4) is not considered to be of such grave nature, which – given that a non-forceful intervention is considered less harmful, must hold true for the principle of non-intervention as well. Consequently, the clear and convincing standard would most likely equally apply to prove an intervention.\nHowever, especially when alleging a cyber-attack that violated the prohibition of use of force or non-intervention, direct proof will often be missing and thus the only type of evidence the parties may be able to offer is circumstantial evidence.¹⁵⁵ In that case, as we have seen before, the proof provided ‘must leave no room for reasonable doubt’.¹⁵⁶ However, with current techniques, it is almost impossible to attribute an attack to a state beyond reasonable doubt, especially without giving away specific know-how that might be too delicate to share with the rest of the world.¹⁵⁷ Therefore, without lowering the standard to give credit to the special circumstances of cyber-attacks, it will be almost impossible for states to prove the affiliation of a state to the attack. See section 5.2 on this issue.\n# 5. Possible Means to Address the Evidentiary Dilemma in Cyberspace Cyber-attacks might to some extent be considered textbook examples of a scenario where one party has exclusive control over the evidence required and where direct proof is often not available.¹⁵⁸ Section 5.1 thus seeks to ¹⁵².

Next, the question whether the ICJ might depart from its strict approach concerning circumstantial evidence will be addressed in section 5.2.¹⁵⁹ For both questions, opinions of different legal scholars will be analysed. Finally, as a new way forward to resolve some of the evidentiary issues in the cyber context, the present authors suggest that – as an alternative solution – the Court should make more use of its inherent powers regarding the production of evidence (section 5.3).\n## 5.1. Reversing the Burden of Proof As attribution poses one of the biggest problems in the cyber context, some authors have called for a reversal of the burden of proof, even though the reasons for arriving at this conclusion are very different. One of them makes a case for not applying the ICJ’s findings in *Corfu Channel*, arguing that by their very nature computers are different to sea-mines.¹⁶⁰ Therefore, the same standards cannot be applied in the cyber context; hence a reversal of the burden of proof is appropriate.¹⁶¹ For authors dealing with problems like identification or attribution, fairness and efficiency seem to be their focal point for arguing for a reversal of the burden, assuming that the party whose territory the attack has emanated from, has superior access to information.¹⁶² Consequently, the onus should be on the country where the attack had been launched from (allegedly).¹⁶³ Proponents of this approach also put forward that, with a reversal of the burden, states would take their due diligence obligations of preventing cyber-attacks more seriously.¹⁶⁴ This is closely linked to the claim that the precautionary principle originating from environmental law can be applied to cyberspace, which then automatically shifts the burden of proof.¹⁶⁵ While the application of the precautionary principle might well ¹⁵⁹.

When looking at the ICJ’s case law, ever since its first decision, the Court has not been inclined to shift the burden, even when evidence was exclusively located in the territory of one state.¹⁶⁸ This finding in *Corfu Channel* has so far not been overruled in any way.¹⁶⁹ What is more, the Court reaffirmed its findings in the *Nicaragua* case, acknowledging that even in times of ongoing armed conflicts (as was the case in *eg Georgia* in 2008), where evidence might be hard to come by, this might affect the standard of proof, not however the burden.¹⁷⁰ Even Judge Owada’s Separate Opinion to the *Oil Platforms* case dealt with difficulties arising from evidentiary imbalances between the applicant and the respondent in a self-defence scenario, as it was the US’s duty to establish that Iran had launched an armed attack against them, against which they defended themselves. While not wholeheartedly content with the situation, he stated that: Nevertheless, there is no denying the fact that there undoubtedly exists an asymmetry in the situation surrounding the case [...]. I am prepared to accept that this asymmetry is inherent in the circumstances of the present case and there is little the Court can do under the circumstances. It is primarily the task incumbent upon the party which claims certain facts as the basis of its contention to establish them by producing sufficient evidence in accordance with the principle *actori incumbit onus probandi*.¹⁷¹ In light of the discussion above, it can be therefore concluded that it is highly unlikely that the ICJ would shift the burden of proof in the cyber context, not only because of the established case law but also because of certain --- ¹⁶⁶.

Cyber operations are often routed through numerous countries,¹⁷² thus a reversal could place the burden of proof on a wholly uninvolved party.¹⁷³ It is, however, important to note that the Court has always been concerned with a level playing field for the parties, which could not be facilitated by a reversal of the burden. What may however be considered, might be lowering the evidentiary standard to facilitate the discharge of the burden.¹⁷⁴ ## 5.2. Lowering the Evidentiary Standard – The Indirect Evidence Dilemma As was already explained above, the ICJ seems to have a case-to-case approach for the evidentiary standard to be applied. This makes it incredibly difficult for the parties to assess how much evidence is needed to successfully discharge the burden. However, there are certain signpost judgments shining light on an expected standard to be met (such as Armed Activities or Oil Platforms in the case of claiming use of force).¹⁷⁵ As was already mentioned in section 4.4.b), it only seems logical to assume that the party alleging such violations in the form of a cyber-attack would need to meet the same clear and convincing evidentiary standard.¹⁷⁶ Some authors regard this standard as still too high, deeming it as too strict and advocating for the lower balance of probabilities standard.¹⁷⁷ However, looking at the ICJ’s previous case law, it is very unlikely that the Court would apply a lower standard than clear and convincing. In fact, as noted above, the ICJ might even set the standard to proof beyond reasonable doubt, since direct proof will often be missing.¹⁷⁸ This, however, would set Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack the standard for cyber-attacks incredibly high. On the other hand, it would do away with concerns that a lower evidentiary standard would make it easier to blame a state for conduct it had nothing to do with. Protecting the respondent from false attribution, be it through IP spoofing, botnets or onion routing,¹⁷⁹ is an argument that should not be left out of the debate concerning a lower evidentiary standard.¹⁸⁰ However, applying a beyond reasonable doubt standard in the cyber context might also be too far reaching: With regard to cyber-attacks, collecting evidence will always remain extremely hard and it would be (at least at the moment) impossible to collect information that reaches a higher level than clear and convincing.¹⁸¹ The victim state would be left with the impossible task to meet a standard which is ‘unreachable’, which could potentially result in perpetrator states evading their responsibility under international law. As Judge Owada held in his Separate Opinion to *Oil Platforms*: As a court of justice whose primary function is the proper administration of justice, should see to it that this problem relating to evidence be dealt with in such a way that utmost justice is brought to bear on the final finding of the Court [...] It would seem to me that the only way to achieve this would have been for the Court to take a more proactive stance on the issue of evidence and that of fact-finding in the present case. This brings me to the standard of proof to be required for discharging the burden of proof in a case where the party who carries the burden of proof, though responsible for discharging that burden, finds itself in an extremely difficult situation as seen from an objective point of view.¹⁸² These opinions, however, clearly show that the ICJ itself would not be interested in applying a standard that would be impossible to meet for the parties involved and that the paramount principle underlying the ICJ’s assessment of evidence is the proper administration of justice.¹⁸³ Such is unlikely when the Court would require parties to prove their allegations beyond reasonable doubt, even when direct proof is not available.\n--- ¹⁷⁹.

Hugh Thirlway, *The Law and Procedure of the International Court of Justice* (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2013) 10; Amerasinghe (n 25) 13–18.\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) This leaves us with the still relatively high clear and convincing standard that effectively protects states from false attribution, while at the same time making it possible to discharge the burden of proof successfully.¹⁸⁴ However, it is nevertheless unrealistic to assume that states themselves are able to collect sufficient evidence in order to meet the clear and convincing standard without the Court's involvement. This, particularly due to the fact that evidence is often located in the exclusive territory of the alleged perpetrator and obtaining said evidence one-sidedly would constitute a violation of that state's sovereignty.¹⁸⁵ The present authors therefore suggest combining the clear and convincing standard with a more enhanced use of the Court's inherent fact-finding powers. This new approach will be discussed below.\n## 5.3. The Court’s Powers for the Production of Evidence As discussed above, the present authors propose that the clear and convincing standard would be the best way to aptly deal with the evidentiary difficulties relating to cyber-attacks. Authors such as Roscini and Schmitt have already illustrated quite convincingly why this standard, being still significantly high, would be appropriate.¹⁸⁶ However, little has been said so far on how exactly the Court could be furnished with evidence that would satisfy the demands of a clear and convincing standard. Therefore, this section seeks to shine light on how to overcome certain evidentiary hurdles through the Court's more active usage of its powers to produce evidence. More specifically, it will do so by focusing on the evidentiary power that might become indispensable in these highly scientific and technical matters: the use of court-appointed experts. Before analysing those in detail, however, this section will start with a more general overview on ways to collect evidence in an ICJ proceeding.\nFirst, in theory, the Court has the inherent power to request additional documents, call its own witnesses, appoint own experts, or make on site visits. This has rarely happened in the past, as the Court has always been of the opinion that parties to the dispute should first and foremost furnish the Court with evidence themselves.¹⁸⁷ However, the extremely cautious approach as an intermediary not making use of its powers has been widely criticised.¹⁸⁸ --- ¹⁸⁴.

Regarding the power of the Court to call experts, see, eg, Benzing (n 39) 1256–57.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack For example, in Bosnian Genocide, the Court did not grant an evidentiary request by Bosnia (as according to the Court, they already had extensive evidence in their possession) but then ultimately found that it had not successfully discharged its burden.¹⁸⁹ The backlash created by this finding might open up the road to a more proactive stance in the future, particularly in the cyber context.\nSecond, the parties can appoint experts according to Articles 57 and 64 Rules of the Court.¹⁹⁰ It happened before that scientific experts appeared as counsel for one of the parties, which, however, due to not having been appointed as experts according to the ICJ’s Statute, barred the other party to the proceeding from cross-examining this counsel.¹⁹¹ The Court criticised this approach in *Pulp Mills* of having limited value.¹⁹² This critique seems to have been successful, as in recent cases, such as *Whaling*, the parties appointed experts according to the Rules, that could be cross-examined by both the Court and other parties.¹⁹³ Lastly, the Court may appoint experts itself. Pursuant to Article 50 of the Statute, ‘[t]he Court may, at any time, entrust any individual, body, bureau, commission, or other organization that it may select, with the task of carrying out an enquiry or giving an expert opinion’.¹⁹⁴ The advantages of using court-appointed experts are manifold, aside from the fact that a potential bias plays less of a role as opposed to party-appointed experts.¹⁹⁵ Therefore, the present authors argue that making better usage of the Court’s own powers to appoint experts under Article 50 would help resolve attribution issues in the cyber context.\n¹⁸⁹.

Only in the Chorzow Factory case in front of the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ), as well as the Corfu Channel and the Gulf of Maine case in front of the ICJ, experts have been appointed under this procedure.¹⁹⁸ This reluctance has been widely criticised not only by doctrine¹⁹⁹ but also within the Court.²⁰⁰ One explanation for the neglect of Article 50 might be the fact that court-appointed experts almost exclusively appear in civil law jurisdictions and that to jurists from common law backgrounds, this appointment might seem like an undue interference, especially with regard to the burden of proof of the parties.²⁰¹ It has also been the Court's contention that the use of experts was just not necessary, as the parties involved in the proceedings seldom disagreed on matters of fact but rather on matters of law.²⁰² This, however, Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack is an outdated notion, as proceedings seem to gradually focus more on scientific and technical questions and the Court is increasingly involved in extensive fact-finding.²⁰³ Consequently, particularly due to the specific technical and scientific knowledge required in cyber-related proceedings, judges will not be able to obtain such expertise easily by themselves and reliance on party-appointed experts will likely not yield a satisfactory outcome due to the uncertainty resulting out of their potential bias.\nAnother argument in favour of court-appointed experts is that particularly in the cyber context, one party may have superior access to information, or might even be the only one able to access specific documents.²⁰⁴ Also, it is hard to imagine that the decision in a proceeding involving cyber-attacks would not to a large part hinge on the establishment of factual circumstances, as traces can be erased so easily, computers hijacked and so forth. Gaining that kind of knowledge through court-appointed experts seems to be one of the best ways to establish those facts.²⁰⁵ Legal scholar Roscini proposes that the ICJ should use the fact-finding powers mentioned above to counterbalance evidentiary difficulties in cases where an exceptionally high standard has to be met (such as for example 'fully conclusive' in the case of genocide).²⁰⁶ However, the present authors argue that – in the cyber context – not even a more proactive stance on fact-finding could produce evidence that meets the requirements of a fully conclusive or beyond reasonable doubt standard. These evidentiary difficulties in the cyber context become clear when comparing a typical cyber scenario to a state responsibility case, where the Court made use of its fact-finding powers. In Corfu Channel, the Court concluded that the exceptionally high standard of beyond reasonable doubt to decide on Albania's international responsibility was met due to the tests run by court-appointed experts. It might thus be possible for experts to arrive at a single logical conclusion on whether an Albanian coastguard would have been able to see a ship passing through in the dark.²⁰⁷ This, however, cannot be said for experts having to determine whether an attack, which was routed through multiple countries, was caused Finnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) by a specific state. Not even the biggest team of experts could furnish the Court with evidence that simply does not exist. This is why the present authors propose that the best way to overcome evidentiary problems in the cyber context would be a more active use of the Court's fact-finding powers to reach the lower, but still satisfying clear and convincing standard. The fact that the Court has recently appointed experts in the Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean case between Costa Rica and Nicaragua – the first appointment in over 30 years – might be an indicator that the Court is about to change its reluctant stance on Article 50.²⁰⁸ ## 6. Conclusion It is probably only a matter of time until a state lodges an application before the ICJ, claiming that it suffered damage arising out of a cyber-attack. It is almost certain that the Court will then be faced with several new questions, starting with whether a specific cyber-attack amounts to a violation of international law, to whether the current regime of evidentiary standards employed by the Court so far gives credit to the specific technical difficulties of proving cyber-attacks. As demonstrated by Estonia and Georgia, this contribution displayed the severe evidentiary troubles victim states have faced so far when trying to prove a state's involvement and thus, arguably, a reluctance to address international tribunals in this matter.\nFirst, the present authors started with analysing the current evidentiary regime of the Court to shine light on this delicate topic. It became clear that when dealing with state responsibility, the Court has applied three different standards. These vary according to the seriousness of the claim. Thus, for charges of exceptional gravity, for example, it found that it must be convinced by fully conclusive evidence.\nTherefore, there must be a breach of an international obligation first, in order to assess what standard of proof the Court will most likely apply in the cyber context. Consequently, the present authors analysed two principles of international law that are most probable to be violated in the case of a cyber-attack against a state: the prohibition of the threat or use of force and the non-intervention principle: two principles, that by their very nature want to protect a state's territorial integrity.\n²⁰⁸. Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean (Costa Rica v Nicaragua), ICJ Order (31 May 2016); see Order of 16 June 2016; Gaja (n 195) 416–17.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack Although the Court already held that it will require clear and convincing evidence when a breach of Article 2(4) – and most likely also an unlawful intervention – is claimed, this only applies when direct proof is available. Nowadays, where technical difficulties hinder states to gather evidence linking a state directly to a cyber-attack, only indirect evidence can be submitted. In such a case, however, the Court established that it will require proof beyond reasonable doubt to let international responsibility arise. It is very likely that the ICJ will face various problems with this standard. Above all, a victim state would be left having to prove beyond reasonable doubt that a state is the originator of an attack. This is something that is obviously impossible with our current technical expertise.\nThus, scholars have proposed to shift the burden of proof to the perpetrator state, which now has to prove that it had not been involved in a cyberattack. This seems to be an unsatisfying solution: Not only did the Court itself refuse such an approach in the past; a shift would also put too much responsibility on the respondent state. Therefore, a more plausible approach would be to lower the evidentiary standard to clear and convincing, even in cases where direct proof is missing. Additionally, the present authors have pointed out how the inability of the parties to produce sufficient evidence can be overcome through the usage of the Court's power to appoint experts. This makes it possible to meet the clear and convincing standard and thus establish international responsibility.\nTo conclude, the relevant case law so far suggests that the Court will remain flexible in its application of evidentiary standards. It will be seen whether it may be open to lowering the standard in cases of exceptional difficulty. In this way, it could ensure that in each individual case, the appropriate standard to enable attribution is applied, but still protects states from wrongful conviction.\n^{}[]",

Despite its vast benefits, however, it has also been used to cause severe damage to states. Hostile cyber activities seem to have occurred more frequently over the past years. It is already recognised that international law – thus also the law on state responsibility – is applicable to cyber-related issues. However, particularly in the context of inter-state relations, the question of how states are able to seek reparation in front of the International Court of Justice for damage caused by a cyber-attack conducted by a state remains open to debate. This is primarily due to the fact that the cyber sphere enjoys a considerable amount of anonymity, which makes it hard to establish the main perpetrator behind an act. Therefore, calls have been made to shift the burden of proof or to lower the evidentiary standard required by the Court. In this article, the present authors will assess the relevant case law of the Court and apply it to two scenarios: a cyber-attack violating the prohibition of use of force and the non-intervention principle. The aim is to display the Court's line of reasoning and assess whether the scholarly demands to ease evidentiary issues, by shifting the burden or lowering the standard of proof, are justified or not. Additionally, the present authors will address a yet in the cyber-context unexplored, but nevertheless, important tool in collecting sufficient evidence: the power of the Court to appoint experts.\nKEYWORDS: cyber-attack, attribution, state responsibility, evidence, International Court of Justice, burden of proof, standard of proof * Isabella Brunner works in the Office of the Legal Adviser (Department of Public International Law) at the Austrian Federal Ministry for Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs.

Introduction Since the emergence of the Internet in the 1980s, various actors – both private and governmental – became the target of foreign cyber operations.¹ While thus being a ‘relatively’ new phenomenon in our society, it is unquestionable that their frequency and impact is rising with each year. This is owed to the fact that nowadays, individuals, private companies and governments increasingly and more intensely operate online.² Cyber operations targeted against states themselves generally aim to bring down governmental infrastructures, such as computer systems of institutions and governmental web pages. This has occurred, for instance, in Estonia and Georgia, where several facilities were brought down through so-called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.³ Another operation that has created widespread interest among international lawyers and remains heavily debated is the cyber hack into the emails of the US Democratic National Committee during the 2016 US presidential elections. One of the most recent large-scale cyber operations was the so-called NotPetya attack on 27 June 2017, targeting primarily Ukraine.⁴ However, the most consequential cyber operation so far remains the 2010 attack on Iran's Natanz nuclear facility plant, which is believed to have been carried out by Israel and the US. Through an infected USB device, it allegedly led to the physical damage of a significant number of centrifuges.⁵ As demonstrated above, the methods of launching a cyber-attack may vary in many ways (be it a DDoS attack or infiltration of malicious software). Nevertheless, all cyber-attacks so far have had one thing in common: the attacker was and remains fairly difficult to determine. As a consequence, it appears Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack that cyber operations may gradually be seen as a new and viable method through which states are able to inflict harm upon other states, enabling them to ‘hide behind their proxy servers’ while reaching their objectives.⁶ This results from the immense technical difficulties in attributing cyber operations to other states – also due to the possibility to conceal traces by methods such as IP spoofing – essentially giving states ‘impunity in cyberspace’.⁷ Therefore, victim states are often left unable to evince the origins of the act, making it impossible to persuasively attribute a wrongful act to another state. These factual difficulties, however, have significant legal consequences, especially because they will most certainly prevent state responsibility from being triggered, which thus gradually undermines the international legal order. Thus, although victim states often have at least an educated guess on the identity of the actual perpetrator, they remain reluctant to point fingers. And while some states have publicly accused other states for cyber operations in the past,⁸ so far none has resorted to international litigation in an attempt to pursue reparation. In fact, to date there has not been a single dispute on this issue brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ).\nThis contribution therefore explores how far the past case law of the ICJ gives guidance on how it might deal with a case concerning state responsibility for an injury arising out of a cyber-attack.⁹ For the purpose of this article, cyber-attacks shall be considered to constitute any state-operated hostile intrusion into the cyber facilities of another state.¹⁰ Thus, the focus lies solely on cyber activities conducted by a state Finnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) targeting another state.¹¹ This contribution, however, will not delve into issues that might arise out of the law of armed conflict.¹² In section 2, this article starts with illustrating evidentiary difficulties relating to cyber operations exemplified by Estonia and Georgia – two states that have been suffering under relatively harmful DDoS attacks. Thereafter, in section 3, the contribution provides a general overview over the ICJ’s past jurisprudence on its evidentiary standards and clarifies the standards the Court has required in the past for the establishment of certain breaches of international law. In particular, two possible breaches, the violation of the use of force principle and the prohibition of non-intervention and their attribution to a state are of interest in the case of cyber-attacks. In this context, the present authors will also address the newest large-scale cyber operations and conclude if they could be considered a violation of these two principles (section 4). Thereafter, the specific standard of proof required by the Court when examining the violation of the prohibition of the threat or use of force and non-intervention principle, as well as the burden of proof, will be addressed in more detail. Finally, in section 5, already suggested solutions by legal scholars to overcome evidentiary difficulties related to cyber-attacks will be analysed: shifting the burden of proof and lowering the evidentiary standard used by the Court (sections 5.1 and 5.2). The present authors will additionally address a significant topic that has been disregarded so far, namely the extremely difficult task to collect sufficient evidence in the cyber-context. Thus, without the Court’s involvement, it is the authors’ contention that it would be almost impossible for states to meet the required evidentiary standard (section 5.3).\n## 2. Cyber-Attacks and Evidentiary Difficulties: Estonia and Georgia In the current cyberspace era, where societies are more and more reliant on computer networks, cyber-attacks are becoming an ever-growing threat.¹³ As Roscini rightly pointed out: ‘The more digitally reliant a state is, the more Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack vulnerable to cyber attacks: if computer systems become the society's 'nerve system', incapacitating them may mean paralyzing the country.¹⁴ The weakness of a state, which is highly dependent on computer networks and electronic information, was best observed in Estonia, when it was the target of several DDoS attacks¹⁵ in 2007.¹⁶ In what was one of the most prominent cyber-attacks in history to date, several Estonian governmental web pages and services became victims of DDoS attacks.¹⁷ The series of attacks, which lasted about three weeks, also targeted the Estonian banking system and media, including newspapers and TV stations, as well as other companies.¹⁸ Interestingly, the operation occurred closely after the Estonian Government decided to remove a Soviet Second World War memorial from the Tallinn city centre, which led to protests of Russian youth groups and vocal opposition by the Russian Government itself.¹⁹ Due to the political circumstances and the fact that some of the attacks could be traced back to IP addresses of Russian state institutions, Estonia accused Russia of the operation.²⁰ Russia, however, denied any involvement and responsibility for the attacks and eventually, Estonia backed away from its accusations.²¹ Similarly, the DDoS attacks conducted against Georgia in 2008 could, to some extent, be traced back to IP addresses belonging to Russian state-operated companies.²² The attacks happened at the time where Georgia was already involved in an armed conflict with Russia over South Ossetia.²³ Finnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) While Georgia tried to hold on to the region, Russia supported it in its aim to become independent.²⁴ Both attacks were merely accompanied by circumstantial evidence.²⁵ In order to successfully claim Russia's involvement, the tense political climate between both Georgia and Russia as well as Estonia and Russia was brought forward in combination with the fact that the attack could be tracked back to Russian IP addresses.²⁶ However, neither Estonia nor Georgia could provide essential evidence in order to attribute those cyber operations to Russia.²⁷ What is more, many experts do not believe that Russian authorities were behind the Georgian attacks, but want to attribute them rather to Russian patriotic hackers.²⁸ While technical attribution is very helpful in the determination of the originator of an attack, it cannot provide perfect accuracy.²⁹ First, the actual attacker can make attribution³⁰ very difficult and conceal his/her paths and traces through tactics like IP spoofing, botnets³¹ or 'onion routing'.³² Through IP spoofing, for instance, individual hackers might try to feign Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack their identity and erroneously attribute cyber-attacks to an innocent state.³³ Hackers can also use computer networks over the whole world to launch an attack, and as data goes through various countries, it is even more difficult to identify one single state as responsible for the cyber operation.³⁴ For instance, 85,000 computers from 178 different countries carried out the DDoS attacks against Estonia.³⁵ If a state suffers damage from a cyber-attack like Estonia, where damage amounted to tens of millions of euros,³⁶ and if it can be established that the attack constitutes an internationally wrongful act (eg an unlawful intervention),³⁷ one would think that it might have an interest in invoking state responsibility for its injury before the ICJ. In this case, the victim state would have to provide evidence in support of its claim, namely that a specific state was behind the cyber-attack which is consequently obligated to make reparation under the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. Despite the fact that the Court has not dealt with a dispute concerning cyber-attacks yet, it was nevertheless already confronted with difficult fact-finding. Therefore, the next section will deal with a general analysis on the standard of proof which the ICJ will require in a proceeding to successfully attribute an internationally wrongful act to the perpetrator.\n# 3. Evidentiary Standards before the International Court of Justice In order to invoke state responsibility, a victim state needs evidence to 1) establish the material elements of the wrongful act, as well as 2) attribute this act to the alleged perpetrator.³⁸ In general, such evidence needs to be persuasive in order to satisfy the court/tribunal of the truthfulness of its allegation.\n\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) This section will show that, concerning the responsibility of states, the ICJ’s case law indicates that three different types of standards can be distinguished. All of them will be explained below.\nBefore examining the evidentiary standards, it is important to highlight that the Court generally enjoys wide discretion in matters of evidence.³⁹ Neither the Statute nor the Rules of Court contain formal rules regarding the Court’s handling of evidence and in particular, the evaluation of the probative value of evidence submitted by the parties.⁴⁰ Accordingly, Article 58(2) Rules of Court only stipulates that ‘[…] the method of handling the evidence […] shall be settled by the Court after the views of the parties have been ascertained […].’⁴¹ The Rules of the Court, equally, do not mention which standard of proof has to be applied by the Court nor which methods of proof (eg documentary evidence) are persuasive enough to the ICJ to meet a certain standard.⁴² This wide discretionary power, therefore, not only applies to fact-finding in general, but also to the Court’s choice of the appropriate evidentiary standard in a given case.⁴³ Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack When discussing the standard of proof, however, it is inevitable to discuss the issue of burden of proof beforehand.⁴⁴ Most importantly, the two should not be confused. Burden of proof means that the party who asserts a fact in the proceeding is also the party who bears the burden of proving it,⁴⁵ namely ‘to convince the Court of the truthfulness of its claim’.⁴⁶ Only after it becomes clear which party bears the burden of proof, the Court is called upon to decide on the necessary standard.⁴⁷ In this sense, the standard of proof stipulates which degree of probability has to be provided by the party to convince the Court⁴⁸ or more specifically, the quantum of proof that has to be shown in order to ‘[...] discharge the burden of proof when that burden rests upon [that party]’.⁴⁹ Looking at the rare amount of cases where the ICJ has touched upon the question of evidentiary standards, it becomes evident that there is not a single standard for all disputes arising before it.⁵⁰ In cases concerning state responsibility,⁵¹ the actual standard of proof in a given case is determined by the substantive nature of the obligation, which was breached and is claimed by a party.⁵² ⁴⁴.

Accordingly, Judge Greenwood pointed out that if cases exist where a state claims charges of exceptional gravity against another state, there have to be cases where a party claims less serious breaches and in those disputes, a lower standard of proof would be appropriate.⁵⁷ While the Bosnian Genocide case clearly shows that the ICJ requires a higher degree of certainty for serious charges, it is more difficult to perceive the exact difference between – in what seems like – a variety of evidentiary standards mentioned in the Court’s other case law. This is exemplified by the Court’s approach to use terms such as ‘convincing/convinced’,⁵⁸ ‘conclusive’,⁵⁹ ‘sufficient’⁶⁰ and ‘insufficient/not sufficient evidence’⁶¹ rather confusable so far instead of explaining which ⁵³.

To establish international responsibility, one must have clear and indisputable facts.’⁶⁵ In the authors’ opinion, this seems plausible. The application of a balance of probabilities standard essentially means that the truthfulness of an allegation has to be ‘more probable than not’⁶⁶ compared to the evidence submitted by the alleged perpetrator. This, however, cannot suffice to establish international responsibility convincingly. Such a low standard might very easily lead to a false attribution of internationally wrongful acts, which ultimately were not committed by the state, although it might indeed seem this way.⁶⁷ Accordingly, it is important to highlight that the Court itself never used a balance of probabilities standard with regard to a state responsibility case.\nThe *Corfu Channel* case also indicates that proof beyond reasonable doubt, a standard applied in national and international cases concerning the criminal responsibility of individuals,⁶⁸ is not an appropriate standard before ⁶². Benzing (n 39) 1265; see also *Oil Platforms* (n 50) 270, Separate Opinion of Judge Buergenthal, para 41: ‘One might ask, moreover, where the test of “insufficient” evidence comes from … and by reference to what standards the Court applies it? What is meant by “insufficient” evidence? Does the evidence have to be “convincing”, “preponderant”, “overwhelming” or “beyond a reasonable doubt” to be sufficient? The Court never spells out what the here relevant standard of proof is.’; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 129–30.\n⁶³. See *Corfu Channel* (n 25) 14, 16, 17, 18; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 126–27.\n⁶⁴. The preponderance of evidence standard is also known as balance of probabilities. “Preponderance of evidence” generally means that there is evidence greater in weight in comparison with the evidence adduced by the other party on the basis of reasonable probability rather than possibility.’ See Amerasinghe (n 25) 242.\n⁶⁵. *Corfu Channel* (n 25) 68, Dissenting Opinion of Judge Krylov, 72; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 133.\n⁶⁶.

For further details, see at n 88.\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) the ICJ, even if charges against a state are of exceptional gravity.⁶⁹ However, where such a grave breach is alleged, the Court does require a relatively high degree of certainty, namely fully conclusive evidence. Consequently, in Corfu Channel, the Court has not found that the UK met this high standard when claiming that the minefield was laid with the connivance of Albania.⁷⁰ This finding was later confirmed in Bosnian Genocide, where the Court equally refrained from applying the proof beyond reasonable doubt standard.⁷¹ However, the foregoing only applies to claims for which direct proof is available.⁷² Where mere circumstantial evidence is submitted by a party, the ICJ did require that proof must leave no room for reasonable doubt.⁷³ Again, the ICJ determined the exact parameters in Corfu Channel, when it noted with regards to the claim brought forward by the UK that Albania knew about the minefield in its territorial waters: [...] the fact of this exclusive territorial control exercised by a State within its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the knowledge of that State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. [...] The proof may be drawn from inferences of fact, provided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt.⁷⁴ Essentially, the ICJ held on the basis of circumstantial evidence – meaning facts which considered together lead ‘logically to a single conclusion’ – that ⁶⁹. Corfu Channel (n 25) 17; Benzing (n 39) 1265; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 134–36; see also Amerasinghe (n 25) 235, who pointed out that the proof beyond reasonable doubt standard is too severe to be applied to non-criminal cases. One reason for this might be the fact that inter-state disputes are not criminal cases and in their very nature resemble civil cases, where parties stand on an equal footing. Cf Roscini (n 6) 227.\n⁷⁰. This was the second alternative argument of the UK Government. See Corfu Channel (n 25) 16–17. See also reference to Corfu Channel in Bosnian Genocide (n 50) para 209.\n⁷¹. See Bosnian Genocide (n 50) para 209; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 135. At one point, however, the Court did apply a standard of proof close to the standard beyond reasonable doubt, when it required proof beyond any doubt in respect of the allegation that there was aid and assistance between the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and VRS leaders, who carried out the acts of genocide. See Bosnian Genocide (n 50) para 422; Teitelbaum (n 39) 128.\n⁷². Quintana (n 47) 407.\n⁷³. Corfu Channel (n 25) 18. For a definition on circumstantial evidence, see at n 26.\n⁷⁴. Corfu Channel (n 25) 18. Note that ‘[...] inferences are a tool of judicial reasoning employed to aid a court in determining whether the burden of proof has been met in cases where direct proof is not available on a particular fact.’; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 113.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack Albania must have known about the mines in the Corfu Channel.75 Where the Court allows recourse to indirect evidence, this only being the case where direct evidence is under the exclusive territorial control of the other party and circumstantial evidence does not ‘contradict’ any existing direct proof,76 the standard will be elevated to proof beyond reasonable doubt.77 In two other cases, *Oil Platforms* and *Armed Activities*, where the violation of the prohibition of the use of force was claimed respectively, the ICJ applied a clear and convincing standard.78 Additionally, the Court also mentioned several times that the submitted evidence was either sufficient79 or insufficient.80 In Nicaragua, the Court merely noted that there was insufficient evidence to prove ‘various points’ but abstained from establishing a certain standard of proof, which needed to be met by the parties.81 It is not clear, however, how the evidentiary standards mentioned by the ICJ in those cases exactly differ from each other and how, in the end, they are decisive for the Court in the determination of the amount of proof the party has to provide in order to discharge its burden.82 Consequently, commentators have tried to highlight the differences between those standards by, inter alia, referring to their ordinary meaning as referred to in the Oxford English Dictionary.83 In doing so, they established a hierarchy between the terms conclusive, convincing and sufficient, with conclusive being the highest of the three standards.84 What is more, the lack of precise definitions for the different evidentiary standards, and especially the reluctance of international courts from discussing the standards they use85 Finnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) may also be ascribed to the influence of the civil/continental law – as opposed to common law – tradition on inter-state dispute settlement.⁸⁶ In the civil law system, judges determine the probative value of submitted evidence in both civil, and criminal law cases based on their internal conviction and are thus not required to apply a specific standard.⁸⁷ In common law jurisdictions, however, judges generally apply the preponderance of evidence or reasonable degree of probability standard with regard to civil law cases, whereas in criminal law cases, a higher standard, namely proof beyond reasonable doubt, has to be met.⁸⁸ Above all, many difficulties when determining evidentiary standards arise due to the simple fact that the evaluation of evidence is a subjective matter – ultimately leading to contradictions between judges on what kind of evidence suffices to be convincing to discharge the burden.⁸⁹ However, it would still be important to know for parties what the ICJ itself exactly means by conclusive, convincing and sufficient evidence.⁹⁰ What is more, the parties appearing before the Court should, already during the proceedings, have at least some clue as to which evidentiary standard will be applied to the case and not be taken by surprise by the Court's final judgment.⁹¹ Particularly in Bosnian Genocide, however, the Court already went a step further by giving more detailed answers than in previous cases and hopefully will continue to develop the case law more consistently with regard to the question of evidentiary standards.⁹² In conclusion, legal scholars have identified three types of state responsibility cases before the ICJ when it comes to determining the relevant standard of proof.⁹³ First, in regular cases, the ICJ demands proof at a high level of certainty appropriate to the seriousness of the allegation.⁹⁴ The amount of ⁸⁶. Kazazi (n 39) 325; Roscini (n 6) 227; see also Riddell and Plant (n 39) 123: 'It appears however that the Court prefers not to provide a definitive standard, most probably because the Judges from the different legal traditions cannot agree.'\n⁸⁷.

Quintana (n 47) 408; cf Riddell and Plant (n 39) 132.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack certainty the Court generally requires in those cases seems to be clear and convincing evidence by parties.⁹⁵ Second, the Court requires a higher standard of proof/higher degree of certainty for cases where charges of exceptional gravity are claimed by a party against another state.⁹⁶ Here, the Court needs to be fully convinced that a state has actually committed the breach of an obligation.⁹⁷ In other words, the graver the charge, the more confidence there must be on the truthfulness of the claim.⁹⁸ Third, where states are only able to provide circumstantial evidence, this being the case where direct evidence is absent and the Court draws inferences from facts, it ultimately requires the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt.⁹⁹ The ICJ’s case law so far clearly shows that it adopts the relevant standard of proof on a case-by-case basis, appropriate to the circumstances and seriousness of the allegation.¹⁰⁰ The next step in this contribution is, therefore, to examine which internationally wrongful act states may want to attribute to other states before the ICJ, as far as cyber-attacks are concerned. This makes it then possible to explore the level of seriousness of the alleged breach in order to determine the evidentiary standard which has to be met by the parties in the dispute.\n## 4. Cyber-Attacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts Cyber-attacks may vary greatly in scale and form. However, only when these ‘hostile uses of cyberspace’¹⁰¹ amount to a violation of international law, the question of international adjudication arises.¹⁰² In the authors’ opinion, the international obligations most relevant for a cyber-attack to constitute an internationally wrongful act are those that most severely infringe a state’s sovereignty. Thus, the prohibition of the threat or use of force and the principle of non-intervention and their applicability to cyber operations are of special interest. Based on these two principles, the question of how to attribute these ⁹⁵. Teitelbaum (n 39) 125–26; Roscini (n 6) 228.\n⁹⁶. Quintana (n 47) 408; cf Riddell and Plant (n 39) 132–36.\n⁹⁷.

More specifically, when they occur ‘in the “international relations” of member states’ and do not merely constitute a private act without a state’s involvement, Dinniss (n 1) 40.\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) 'attacks' to a state will be examined and the necessary standard of proof to be applied in those cases will be determined. It is also important to note that the term cyber-'attack', being a non-legal term, is not to be equated to the term 'armed attack', triggering the right of self-defence under Article 51 UN Charter.¹⁰³ ## 4.1. The Threat or Use of Force Due to its severity, the first international obligation to be discussed here is the prohibition of the threat or use of force, enshrined in Article 2(4) UN Charter.¹⁰⁴ This prohibition is considered to be a norm of customary international law¹⁰⁵ and the overall consensus is that it is also applicable to cyber operations.¹⁰⁶ This is in line with the ICJ's Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion, where it noted that the prohibition to use force applies 'regardless of the weapons employed'.¹⁰⁷ It is more the effect of a weapon upon which a breach of Article 2(4) is determined.¹⁰⁸ Traditionally, only physical damage to property, loss of life or injury of persons were thought to meet this requirement.¹⁰⁹ Moreover, a state would need to prove that the cyber-attack has caused a severe effect, meaning that 'its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force'.¹¹⁰ Given the virtual (rather than physical) nature of cyber-attacks, this seems to be ¹⁰³. Article 51 UN Charter, 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS 16: 'Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.'\n¹⁰⁴.

Schmitt (ed) (n 101) Rule 11, 45.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack the most difficult part.¹¹¹ To give an example of such severity, the Stuxnet virus launched at the Iranian Natanz nuclear plant, supposedly leading to the physical damage of the plant's centrifuges could be considered, if proven, to be of such gravity that it would constitute a use of force.¹¹² Another attack worth mentioning in this regard is the recent NotPetya operation at the end of June this year. It was initially thought to be a ransomware attack,¹¹³ but then later qualified as being more than that, as the generation of revenue did not seem to be the primary goal of its operation.¹¹⁴ It also led to chaos on a large scale, with Ukraine seeming to be the main target.¹¹⁵ Despite the fact that physical damage did not occur, the NotPetya operation may nevertheless open up the discussion as to whether non-destructive cyber operations, which still massively disrupt the apparatus of the state, might be considered a violation of Article 2(4) in the future.¹¹⁶ To conclude, there seems to be a relatively high threshold of invoking the violation of Article 2(4), since the damage must be so severe it can be equated to a use of force in the traditional sense. Thus, in the case of less than forceful cyber-attacks or general lack of evidence, a state might have more success in claiming that the cyber intrusion constituted an unlawful intervention.¹¹⁷ ¹¹¹. On a side note, as the ICJ held in Nicaragua, the 'most grave forms' of the use of force amount to an 'armed attack', which would trigger the right of self-defence under Article 51 UN Charter, see Nicaragua (Merits) (n 41) para 191; Thus, by acknowledging that Article 51 UN Charter is also applicable in the cyber context, a cyber-attack of the 'most grave form' must also be one that enables the victim state to defend itself effectively.\n¹¹².

Non-Intervention The principle of non-intervention derived out of the principle of the sovereign equality of states, which is enshrined in Article 2(1) UN Charter.¹¹⁸ It also reflects customary international law.¹¹⁹ It is widely seen to be equally applicable to cyber-attacks.¹²⁰ According to the ICJ, a state’s coercive interference in another state’s internal affairs constitutes an unlawful intervention.¹²¹ The Court noted in the Nicaragua judgment, that the requirement of coercion is fulfilled, when a state is deprived of its free ‘choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy’.¹²² The most obvious form of such coercion, according to the ICJ, is an intervention that uses force.¹²³ Being a much broader obligation than the prohibition of threat or use of force, it thus prohibits both forceful and less than forceful operations.¹²⁴ Having determined previously that severe damage is needed to establish a use of force, less than forceful – but still coercive – cyber operations might thus still be unlawful. To give an example, the cyber-attack against Estonia in 2007 (if it is assumed that it was conducted by Russia) could be seen as an unlawful intervention in Estonia’s affairs, as it was a coercive attempt to influence Estonia not to relocate the Second World War memorial.¹²⁵ More recently, the hack and release of a vast amount of internal emails of the US Democratic National Committee to WikiLeaks right before the US elections has sparked widespread media attention. It primarily led to the increased negative portrayal of candidate Clinton in the media and is widely believed to have been conducted by the Russian Government in order to help candidate Trump win the presidency.¹²⁶ Another consequential hack was the attack against President Macron’s election campaign, which led to the ¹¹⁸.

Attribution Eventually, for state responsibility to arise, the wrongful conduct must be attributable to a state. The ILC Articles on State Responsibility set out in Articles 4 to 11 the different activities by individuals which are attributable to a state. These include first and foremost the conduct of de jure and de facto state organs as well as persons/entities ‘exercising elements of governmental authority’.¹³² Particular notice shall be made to private hackers, whose expertise might be used by states to conduct a cyber-attack. Two provisions of the ILC Articles might be of relevance in this regard. First, the ICJ noted in Bosnian Genocide that Article 4 ILC Articles might enable the attribution of acts of private individuals that are not formally recognised as state organs to the state, if they are ‘in a relationship of complete dependence on the State’.¹³³ ¹²⁷.

Articles 4, 5 ILC Articles on State Responsibility; Tsagourias (n 29) 239.\n¹³³. Bosnian Genocide (n 50) para 391.\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) Proving a complete dependence, however, might be very difficult. Thus, according to Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility,¹³⁴ the conduct of private individuals may still be attributable to a state if they are either acting under the instructions of that state or under their direction or control.¹³⁵ In the Nicaragua judgment, the ICJ determined the degree of control to be one of effective control ‘in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred’.¹³⁶ The ICTY’s Appeals Chamber argued in Tadić that its ‘overall control’ test, which was a test to establish the internationality of a conflict, would be equally applicable to questions of state responsibility.¹³⁷ This, however, was rejected by the ICJ in Bosnian Genocide, which considered the test to be too broad to apply it to the context of Article 8 and upheld its reasoning from Nicaragua.¹³⁸ This stricter test, however, poses another difficulty for an injured state, since proving effective control is a much higher threshold than claiming overall control of a state over the activities of a non-state actor.¹³⁹ Therefore, in order to attribute an act to a state, the ‘victim’ state would need to prove that the cyber-attack was launched from a device that belonged to someone who was either completely dependent on that state or his/her activities were somehow conducted under effective control of that state.\nSetting aside this high threshold of proving an individual’s affiliation with the state, the attribution to a specific territory itself proves already extremely difficult. To start with, one may have to identify the exact location of the device. In the simplest cases, this could be achieved by tracing back the IP address from which the attack was launched.¹⁴⁰ Thus, if the IP address reveals a government-owned facility, the device can be identified as a government computer and thus, state responsibility may arise.¹⁴¹ However, as explained in section 2 in more detail, there are many ways to obscure the identity of the actual perpetrator, eg through IP spoofing, or computer hijacking. Moreover, the Tallinn Manual notes that ‘the fact that a cyber operation has been routed via the cyber infrastructure located in a State’ does not constitute ‘sufficient evidence’ that the cyber activity is attributable to ¹³⁴.

Ibid.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack 95 that state.¹⁴² And, even if an attack could be traced back to a specific governmental computer infrastructure, this is only an *indication* which government was behind the attack.¹⁴³ Thus, attribution in the context of cyberspace proves extremely difficult.\n## 4.4. Proving a State’s Breach of the Prohibition of Non-Intervention and Article 2(4) Having demonstrated the various hurdles of applying the principle of non-intervention and Article 2(4) to the cyber context, the question now remains whether the current regime of proving a state’s breach of these principles remains applicable. For the purpose of this article, it is assumed that the material elements of a breach (such as coercion or severe damage) are sufficiently proven. Of particular interest is the question of proving the *attribution* of the attack to a state. For that as well, however, two main elements of proof need to be considered: the burden and the standard of proof.\n## 4.4.1. Burden of Proof It is important to note that the formal status of the parties in the proceedings, whether applicant or respondent, has no bearing on the allocation of the burden.¹⁴⁴ When asserting which party carries the burden of proof, the Court generally applies the *onus probandi incumbit actori* principle: It is the party asserting a fact that is responsible for providing the Court with proof thereof.¹⁴⁵ The allocation of the burden of proof is of fundamental importance since there can only be a decision in favour of a party that has to prove a certain fact when it has successfully discharged the burden.¹⁴⁶ Thus, if a state wants to successfully claim reparations for a state’s violations of the threat or use of force and non-intervention principle, it is up to the victim state to collect enough evidence to discharge the burden. The *onus probandi* rule, however, is not an absolute one, the determination of the burden of proof is in reality dependent on the subject-matter and nature of each dispute brought before the Court; it varies according to ¹⁴².

Amerasinghe (n 25) 36; Kazazi (n 39) 36.\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) the type of facts which it is necessary to establish for the purpose of the decision of this case.¹⁴⁷ The question whether or not a state is under a general duty to disclose all relevant evidence that may be solely in its possession, is also closely linked to the burden of proof and to this date remains the subject of significant scholarly debate. Even if a state could successfully trace back IP addresses to another government's computer infrastructures, it would not have access to these computers in the same way as the perpetrator state. While some argue for the general notion that states need to act in good faith when participating in a judicial procedure,¹⁴⁸ with regard to the wording of Article 49 of the Court's Statute ('formal note shall be taken of any refusal'), this provision for the production of evidence does not seem to imply a binding legal obligation for states to comply with Article 49 requests.¹⁴⁹ While the Court might be allowed to draw adverse inferences from not complying with such a request (even though it has been reluctant to do so in the past), this does not mean it could compel a party to produce evidence.¹⁵⁰ It can therefore be assumed that an argument for the non-binding nature of Article 49 requests stands on stronger footing.\n## 4.4.2. Standard of Proof Due to the technical difficulty of attributing a cyber-attack, it might be argued that different standards of proof shall apply for the attribution on the one hand and claiming the substantive violation on the other. For attribution, certain scholars refer to the Yeager arbitration.¹⁵¹ There, the Iran-US Claims ¹⁴⁷. Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v Democratic Republic of the Congo), ICJ Reports (2010) 639, para 54; Quintana (n 47) 393. Whether or not the burden could be potentially shifted when proving a cyber-attack will be discussed in the next section.\n¹⁴⁸.

See however Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Salvador v Honduras; Nicaragua intervening), ICJ Reports (1992) 351, para 63, where the Court stated that it 'cannot however apply a presumption that evidence which is unavailable would, if produced, have supported a particular party's case; still less a presumption of the existence of evidence which has not been produced'. Riddell and Plant (n 39) 116.\n¹⁵¹. See, eg Schmitt and Vihul (n 5) 65–66.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack Tribunal noted that the attribution of a wrongful conduct to a state must be proven with reasonable certainty.¹⁵² However, the ICJ noted in *Bosnian Genocide* that the same standard of proof applies to both the violation of the substantive rule as well as the attribution for such acts.¹⁵³ In other words, rather than separating attribution and violation, both of them require the same standard of proof. Thus, since the standard of proof varies with the violation, the standard of reasonable certainty does not apply to all cases.\nIn *Armed Activities* and *Oil Platforms*, the ICJ set the threshold of alleging an unlawful use of force to clear and convincing evidence.¹⁵⁴ As noted in section 3, the Court demands the higher standard of fully conclusive evidence only in charges of exceptional gravity. This suggests that the violation of Article 2(4) is not considered to be of such grave nature, which – given that a non-forceful intervention is considered less harmful, must hold true for the principle of non-intervention as well. Consequently, the clear and convincing standard would most likely equally apply to prove an intervention.\nHowever, especially when alleging a cyber-attack that violated the prohibition of use of force or non-intervention, direct proof will often be missing and thus the only type of evidence the parties may be able to offer is circumstantial evidence.¹⁵⁵ In that case, as we have seen before, the proof provided ‘must leave no room for reasonable doubt’.¹⁵⁶ However, with current techniques, it is almost impossible to attribute an attack to a state beyond reasonable doubt, especially without giving away specific know-how that might be too delicate to share with the rest of the world.¹⁵⁷ Therefore, without lowering the standard to give credit to the special circumstances of cyber-attacks, it will be almost impossible for states to prove the affiliation of a state to the attack. See section 5.2 on this issue.\n# 5. Possible Means to Address the Evidentiary Dilemma in Cyberspace Cyber-attacks might to some extent be considered textbook examples of a scenario where one party has exclusive control over the evidence required and where direct proof is often not available.¹⁵⁸ Section 5.1 thus seeks to ¹⁵².

Next, the question whether the ICJ might depart from its strict approach concerning circumstantial evidence will be addressed in section 5.2.¹⁵⁹ For both questions, opinions of different legal scholars will be analysed. Finally, as a new way forward to resolve some of the evidentiary issues in the cyber context, the present authors suggest that – as an alternative solution – the Court should make more use of its inherent powers regarding the production of evidence (section 5.3).\n## 5.1. Reversing the Burden of Proof As attribution poses one of the biggest problems in the cyber context, some authors have called for a reversal of the burden of proof, even though the reasons for arriving at this conclusion are very different. One of them makes a case for not applying the ICJ’s findings in *Corfu Channel*, arguing that by their very nature computers are different to sea-mines.¹⁶⁰ Therefore, the same standards cannot be applied in the cyber context; hence a reversal of the burden of proof is appropriate.¹⁶¹ For authors dealing with problems like identification or attribution, fairness and efficiency seem to be their focal point for arguing for a reversal of the burden, assuming that the party whose territory the attack has emanated from, has superior access to information.¹⁶² Consequently, the onus should be on the country where the attack had been launched from (allegedly).¹⁶³ Proponents of this approach also put forward that, with a reversal of the burden, states would take their due diligence obligations of preventing cyber-attacks more seriously.¹⁶⁴ This is closely linked to the claim that the precautionary principle originating from environmental law can be applied to cyberspace, which then automatically shifts the burden of proof.¹⁶⁵ While the application of the precautionary principle might well ¹⁵⁹.

When looking at the ICJ’s case law, ever since its first decision, the Court has not been inclined to shift the burden, even when evidence was exclusively located in the territory of one state.¹⁶⁸ This finding in *Corfu Channel* has so far not been overruled in any way.¹⁶⁹ What is more, the Court reaffirmed its findings in the *Nicaragua* case, acknowledging that even in times of ongoing armed conflicts (as was the case in *eg Georgia* in 2008), where evidence might be hard to come by, this might affect the standard of proof, not however the burden.¹⁷⁰ Even Judge Owada’s Separate Opinion to the *Oil Platforms* case dealt with difficulties arising from evidentiary imbalances between the applicant and the respondent in a self-defence scenario, as it was the US’s duty to establish that Iran had launched an armed attack against them, against which they defended themselves. While not wholeheartedly content with the situation, he stated that: Nevertheless, there is no denying the fact that there undoubtedly exists an asymmetry in the situation surrounding the case [...]. I am prepared to accept that this asymmetry is inherent in the circumstances of the present case and there is little the Court can do under the circumstances. It is primarily the task incumbent upon the party which claims certain facts as the basis of its contention to establish them by producing sufficient evidence in accordance with the principle *actori incumbit onus probandi*.¹⁷¹ In light of the discussion above, it can be therefore concluded that it is highly unlikely that the ICJ would shift the burden of proof in the cyber context, not only because of the established case law but also because of certain --- ¹⁶⁶.

Cyber operations are often routed through numerous countries,¹⁷² thus a reversal could place the burden of proof on a wholly uninvolved party.¹⁷³ It is, however, important to note that the Court has always been concerned with a level playing field for the parties, which could not be facilitated by a reversal of the burden. What may however be considered, might be lowering the evidentiary standard to facilitate the discharge of the burden.¹⁷⁴ ## 5.2. Lowering the Evidentiary Standard – The Indirect Evidence Dilemma As was already explained above, the ICJ seems to have a case-to-case approach for the evidentiary standard to be applied. This makes it incredibly difficult for the parties to assess how much evidence is needed to successfully discharge the burden. However, there are certain signpost judgments shining light on an expected standard to be met (such as Armed Activities or Oil Platforms in the case of claiming use of force).¹⁷⁵ As was already mentioned in section 4.4.b), it only seems logical to assume that the party alleging such violations in the form of a cyber-attack would need to meet the same clear and convincing evidentiary standard.¹⁷⁶ Some authors regard this standard as still too high, deeming it as too strict and advocating for the lower balance of probabilities standard.¹⁷⁷ However, looking at the ICJ’s previous case law, it is very unlikely that the Court would apply a lower standard than clear and convincing. In fact, as noted above, the ICJ might even set the standard to proof beyond reasonable doubt, since direct proof will often be missing.¹⁷⁸ This, however, would set Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack the standard for cyber-attacks incredibly high. On the other hand, it would do away with concerns that a lower evidentiary standard would make it easier to blame a state for conduct it had nothing to do with. Protecting the respondent from false attribution, be it through IP spoofing, botnets or onion routing,¹⁷⁹ is an argument that should not be left out of the debate concerning a lower evidentiary standard.¹⁸⁰ However, applying a beyond reasonable doubt standard in the cyber context might also be too far reaching: With regard to cyber-attacks, collecting evidence will always remain extremely hard and it would be (at least at the moment) impossible to collect information that reaches a higher level than clear and convincing.¹⁸¹ The victim state would be left with the impossible task to meet a standard which is ‘unreachable’, which could potentially result in perpetrator states evading their responsibility under international law. As Judge Owada held in his Separate Opinion to *Oil Platforms*: As a court of justice whose primary function is the proper administration of justice, should see to it that this problem relating to evidence be dealt with in such a way that utmost justice is brought to bear on the final finding of the Court [...] It would seem to me that the only way to achieve this would have been for the Court to take a more proactive stance on the issue of evidence and that of fact-finding in the present case. This brings me to the standard of proof to be required for discharging the burden of proof in a case where the party who carries the burden of proof, though responsible for discharging that burden, finds itself in an extremely difficult situation as seen from an objective point of view.¹⁸² These opinions, however, clearly show that the ICJ itself would not be interested in applying a standard that would be impossible to meet for the parties involved and that the paramount principle underlying the ICJ’s assessment of evidence is the proper administration of justice.¹⁸³ Such is unlikely when the Court would require parties to prove their allegations beyond reasonable doubt, even when direct proof is not available.\n--- ¹⁷⁹.

Hugh Thirlway, *The Law and Procedure of the International Court of Justice* (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2013) 10; Amerasinghe (n 25) 13–18.\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) This leaves us with the still relatively high clear and convincing standard that effectively protects states from false attribution, while at the same time making it possible to discharge the burden of proof successfully.¹⁸⁴ However, it is nevertheless unrealistic to assume that states themselves are able to collect sufficient evidence in order to meet the clear and convincing standard without the Court's involvement. This, particularly due to the fact that evidence is often located in the exclusive territory of the alleged perpetrator and obtaining said evidence one-sidedly would constitute a violation of that state's sovereignty.¹⁸⁵ The present authors therefore suggest combining the clear and convincing standard with a more enhanced use of the Court's inherent fact-finding powers. This new approach will be discussed below.\n## 5.3. The Court’s Powers for the Production of Evidence As discussed above, the present authors propose that the clear and convincing standard would be the best way to aptly deal with the evidentiary difficulties relating to cyber-attacks. Authors such as Roscini and Schmitt have already illustrated quite convincingly why this standard, being still significantly high, would be appropriate.¹⁸⁶ However, little has been said so far on how exactly the Court could be furnished with evidence that would satisfy the demands of a clear and convincing standard. Therefore, this section seeks to shine light on how to overcome certain evidentiary hurdles through the Court's more active usage of its powers to produce evidence. More specifically, it will do so by focusing on the evidentiary power that might become indispensable in these highly scientific and technical matters: the use of court-appointed experts. Before analysing those in detail, however, this section will start with a more general overview on ways to collect evidence in an ICJ proceeding.\nFirst, in theory, the Court has the inherent power to request additional documents, call its own witnesses, appoint own experts, or make on site visits. This has rarely happened in the past, as the Court has always been of the opinion that parties to the dispute should first and foremost furnish the Court with evidence themselves.¹⁸⁷ However, the extremely cautious approach as an intermediary not making use of its powers has been widely criticised.¹⁸⁸ --- ¹⁸⁴.

Regarding the power of the Court to call experts, see, eg, Benzing (n 39) 1256–57.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack For example, in Bosnian Genocide, the Court did not grant an evidentiary request by Bosnia (as according to the Court, they already had extensive evidence in their possession) but then ultimately found that it had not successfully discharged its burden.¹⁸⁹ The backlash created by this finding might open up the road to a more proactive stance in the future, particularly in the cyber context.\nSecond, the parties can appoint experts according to Articles 57 and 64 Rules of the Court.¹⁹⁰ It happened before that scientific experts appeared as counsel for one of the parties, which, however, due to not having been appointed as experts according to the ICJ’s Statute, barred the other party to the proceeding from cross-examining this counsel.¹⁹¹ The Court criticised this approach in *Pulp Mills* of having limited value.¹⁹² This critique seems to have been successful, as in recent cases, such as *Whaling*, the parties appointed experts according to the Rules, that could be cross-examined by both the Court and other parties.¹⁹³ Lastly, the Court may appoint experts itself. Pursuant to Article 50 of the Statute, ‘[t]he Court may, at any time, entrust any individual, body, bureau, commission, or other organization that it may select, with the task of carrying out an enquiry or giving an expert opinion’.¹⁹⁴ The advantages of using court-appointed experts are manifold, aside from the fact that a potential bias plays less of a role as opposed to party-appointed experts.¹⁹⁵ Therefore, the present authors argue that making better usage of the Court’s own powers to appoint experts under Article 50 would help resolve attribution issues in the cyber context.\n¹⁸⁹.

Only in the Chorzow Factory case in front of the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ), as well as the Corfu Channel and the Gulf of Maine case in front of the ICJ, experts have been appointed under this procedure.¹⁹⁸ This reluctance has been widely criticised not only by doctrine¹⁹⁹ but also within the Court.²⁰⁰ One explanation for the neglect of Article 50 might be the fact that court-appointed experts almost exclusively appear in civil law jurisdictions and that to jurists from common law backgrounds, this appointment might seem like an undue interference, especially with regard to the burden of proof of the parties.²⁰¹ It has also been the Court's contention that the use of experts was just not necessary, as the parties involved in the proceedings seldom disagreed on matters of fact but rather on matters of law.²⁰² This, however, Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack is an outdated notion, as proceedings seem to gradually focus more on scientific and technical questions and the Court is increasingly involved in extensive fact-finding.²⁰³ Consequently, particularly due to the specific technical and scientific knowledge required in cyber-related proceedings, judges will not be able to obtain such expertise easily by themselves and reliance on party-appointed experts will likely not yield a satisfactory outcome due to the uncertainty resulting out of their potential bias.\nAnother argument in favour of court-appointed experts is that particularly in the cyber context, one party may have superior access to information, or might even be the only one able to access specific documents.²⁰⁴ Also, it is hard to imagine that the decision in a proceeding involving cyber-attacks would not to a large part hinge on the establishment of factual circumstances, as traces can be erased so easily, computers hijacked and so forth. Gaining that kind of knowledge through court-appointed experts seems to be one of the best ways to establish those facts.²⁰⁵ Legal scholar Roscini proposes that the ICJ should use the fact-finding powers mentioned above to counterbalance evidentiary difficulties in cases where an exceptionally high standard has to be met (such as for example 'fully conclusive' in the case of genocide).²⁰⁶ However, the present authors argue that – in the cyber context – not even a more proactive stance on fact-finding could produce evidence that meets the requirements of a fully conclusive or beyond reasonable doubt standard. These evidentiary difficulties in the cyber context become clear when comparing a typical cyber scenario to a state responsibility case, where the Court made use of its fact-finding powers. In Corfu Channel, the Court concluded that the exceptionally high standard of beyond reasonable doubt to decide on Albania's international responsibility was met due to the tests run by court-appointed experts. It might thus be possible for experts to arrive at a single logical conclusion on whether an Albanian coastguard would have been able to see a ship passing through in the dark.²⁰⁷ This, however, cannot be said for experts having to determine whether an attack, which was routed through multiple countries, was caused Finnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) by a specific state. Not even the biggest team of experts could furnish the Court with evidence that simply does not exist. This is why the present authors propose that the best way to overcome evidentiary problems in the cyber context would be a more active use of the Court's fact-finding powers to reach the lower, but still satisfying clear and convincing standard. The fact that the Court has recently appointed experts in the Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean case between Costa Rica and Nicaragua – the first appointment in over 30 years – might be an indicator that the Court is about to change its reluctant stance on Article 50.²⁰⁸ ## 6. Conclusion It is probably only a matter of time until a state lodges an application before the ICJ, claiming that it suffered damage arising out of a cyber-attack. It is almost certain that the Court will then be faced with several new questions, starting with whether a specific cyber-attack amounts to a violation of international law, to whether the current regime of evidentiary standards employed by the Court so far gives credit to the specific technical difficulties of proving cyber-attacks. As demonstrated by Estonia and Georgia, this contribution displayed the severe evidentiary troubles victim states have faced so far when trying to prove a state's involvement and thus, arguably, a reluctance to address international tribunals in this matter.\nFirst, the present authors started with analysing the current evidentiary regime of the Court to shine light on this delicate topic. It became clear that when dealing with state responsibility, the Court has applied three different standards. These vary according to the seriousness of the claim. Thus, for charges of exceptional gravity, for example, it found that it must be convinced by fully conclusive evidence.\nTherefore, there must be a breach of an international obligation first, in order to assess what standard of proof the Court will most likely apply in the cyber context. Consequently, the present authors analysed two principles of international law that are most probable to be violated in the case of a cyber-attack against a state: the prohibition of the threat or use of force and the non-intervention principle: two principles, that by their very nature want to protect a state's territorial integrity.\n²⁰⁸. Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean (Costa Rica v Nicaragua), ICJ Order (31 May 2016); see Order of 16 June 2016; Gaja (n 195) 416–17.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack Although the Court already held that it will require clear and convincing evidence when a breach of Article 2(4) – and most likely also an unlawful intervention – is claimed, this only applies when direct proof is available. Nowadays, where technical difficulties hinder states to gather evidence linking a state directly to a cyber-attack, only indirect evidence can be submitted. In such a case, however, the Court established that it will require proof beyond reasonable doubt to let international responsibility arise. It is very likely that the ICJ will face various problems with this standard. Above all, a victim state would be left having to prove beyond reasonable doubt that a state is the originator of an attack. This is something that is obviously impossible with our current technical expertise.\nThus, scholars have proposed to shift the burden of proof to the perpetrator state, which now has to prove that it had not been involved in a cyberattack. This seems to be an unsatisfying solution: Not only did the Court itself refuse such an approach in the past; a shift would also put too much responsibility on the respondent state. Therefore, a more plausible approach would be to lower the evidentiary standard to clear and convincing, even in cases where direct proof is missing. Additionally, the present authors have pointed out how the inability of the parties to produce sufficient evidence can be overcome through the usage of the Court's power to appoint experts. This makes it possible to meet the clear and convincing standard and thus establish international responsibility.\nTo conclude, the relevant case law so far suggests that the Court will remain flexible in its application of evidentiary standards. It will be seen whether it may be open to lowering the standard in cases of exceptional difficulty. In this way, it could ensure that in each individual case, the appropriate standard to enable attribution is applied, but still protects states from wrongful conviction.\n^{}[]"

Despite its vast benefits, however, it has also been used to cause severe damage to states. Hostile cyber activities seem to have occurred more frequently over the past years. It is already recognised that international law – thus also the law on state responsibility – is applicable to cyber-related issues. However, particularly in the context of inter-state relations, the question of how states are able to seek reparation in front of the International Court of Justice for damage caused by a cyber-attack conducted by a state remains open to debate. This is primarily due to the fact that the cyber sphere enjoys a considerable amount of anonymity, which makes it hard to establish the main perpetrator behind an act. Therefore, calls have been made to shift the burden of proof or to lower the evidentiary standard required by the Court. In this article, the present authors will assess the relevant case law of the Court and apply it to two scenarios: a cyber-attack violating the prohibition of use of force and the non-intervention principle. The aim is to display the Court's line of reasoning and assess whether the scholarly demands to ease evidentiary issues, by shifting the burden or lowering the standard of proof, are justified or not. Additionally, the present authors will address a yet in the cyber-context unexplored, but nevertheless, important tool in collecting sufficient evidence: the power of the Court to appoint experts.\nKEYWORDS: cyber-attack, attribution, state responsibility, evidence, International Court of Justice, burden of proof, standard of proof\n* Isabella Brunner works in the Office of the Legal Adviser (Department of Public International Law) at the Austrian Federal Ministry for Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs.

Introduction\nSince the emergence of the Internet in the 1980s, various actors – both private and governmental – became the target of foreign cyber operations.¹ While thus being a ‘relatively’ new phenomenon in our society, it is unquestionable that their frequency and impact is rising with each year. This is owed to the fact that nowadays, individuals, private companies and governments increasingly and more intensely operate online.²\nCyber operations targeted against states themselves generally aim to bring down governmental infrastructures, such as computer systems of institutions and governmental web pages. This has occurred, for instance, in Estonia and Georgia, where several facilities were brought down through so-called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.³ Another operation that has created widespread interest among international lawyers and remains heavily debated is the cyber hack into the emails of the US Democratic National Committee during the 2016 US presidential elections. One of the most recent large-scale cyber operations was the so-called NotPetya attack on 27 June 2017, targeting primarily Ukraine.⁴ However, the most consequential cyber operation so far remains the 2010 attack on Iran's Natanz nuclear facility plant, which is believed to have been carried out by Israel and the US. Through an infected USB device, it allegedly led to the physical damage of a significant number of centrifuges.⁵\nAs demonstrated above, the methods of launching a cyber-attack may vary in many ways (be it a DDoS attack or infiltration of malicious software). Nevertheless, all cyber-attacks so far have had one thing in common: the attacker was and remains fairly difficult to determine. As a consequence, it appears\n1.

These factual difficulties, however, have significant legal consequences, especially because they will most certainly prevent state responsibility from being triggered, which thus gradually undermines the international legal order. Thus, although victim states often have at least an educated guess on the identity of the actual perpetrator, they remain reluctant to point fingers. And while some states have publicly accused other states for cyber operations in the past,⁸ so far none has resorted to international litigation in an attempt to pursue reparation. In fact, to date there has not been a single dispute on this issue brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ).\nThis contribution therefore explores how far the past case law of the ICJ gives guidance on how it might deal with a case concerning state responsibility for an injury arising out of a cyber-attack.⁹\nFor the purpose of this article, cyber-attacks shall be considered to constitute any state-operated hostile intrusion into the cyber facilities of another state.¹⁰ Thus, the focus lies solely on cyber activities conducted by a state\n6.

Thereafter, in section 3, the contribution provides a general overview over the ICJ’s past jurisprudence on its evidentiary standards and clarifies the standards the Court has required in the past for the establishment of certain breaches of international law. In particular, two possible breaches, the violation of the use of force principle and the prohibition of non-intervention and their attribution to a state are of interest in the case of cyber-attacks. In this context, the present authors will also address the newest large-scale cyber operations and conclude if they could be considered a violation of these two principles (section 4). Thereafter, the specific standard of proof required by the Court when examining the violation of the prohibition of the threat or use of force and non-intervention principle, as well as the burden of proof, will be addressed in more detail. Finally, in section 5, already suggested solutions by legal scholars to overcome evidentiary difficulties related to cyber-attacks will be analysed: shifting the burden of proof and lowering the evidentiary standard used by the Court (sections 5.1 and 5.2). The present authors will additionally address a significant topic that has been disregarded so far, namely the extremely difficult task to collect sufficient evidence in the cyber-context. Thus, without the Court’s involvement, it is the authors’ contention that it would be almost impossible for states to meet the required evidentiary standard (section 5.3).\n## 2.

In this case, the victim state would have to provide evidence in support of its claim, namely that a specific state was behind the cyber-attack which is consequently obligated to make reparation under the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. Despite the fact that the Court has not dealt with a dispute concerning cyber-attacks yet, it was nevertheless already confronted with difficult fact-finding. Therefore, the next section will deal with a general analysis on the standard of proof which the ICJ will require in a proceeding to successfully attribute an internationally wrongful act to the perpetrator.\n# 3. Evidentiary Standards before the International Court of Justice\nIn order to invoke state responsibility, a victim state needs evidence to 1) establish the material elements of the wrongful act, as well as 2) attribute this act to the alleged perpetrator.³⁸ In general, such evidence needs to be persuasive in order to satisfy the court/tribunal of the truthfulness of its allegation.\n33.

See section 4 for a specific analysis on internationally wrongful acts and their attribution to states under the ILC Articles on State Responsibility in the special context of cyber-attacks.\n38. See accordingly, Article 2 ILC Articles on State Responsibility: ‘There is an internationally wrongful act of a State when conduct consisting of an action or omission: (a) is attributable to the State under international law; and (b) constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.’; Roscini (n 6) 220.\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015)\nThis section will show that, concerning the responsibility of states, the ICJ’s case law indicates that three different types of standards can be distinguished. All of them will be explained below.\nBefore examining the evidentiary standards, it is important to highlight that the Court generally enjoys wide discretion in matters of evidence.³⁹ Neither the Statute nor the Rules of Court contain formal rules regarding the Court’s handling of evidence and in particular, the evaluation of the probative value of evidence submitted by the parties.⁴⁰ Accordingly, Article 58(2) Rules of Court only stipulates that ‘[…] the method of handling the evidence […] shall be settled by the Court after the views of the parties have been ascertained […].’⁴¹ The Rules of the Court, equally, do not mention which standard of proof has to be applied by the Court nor which methods of proof (eg documentary evidence) are persuasive enough to the ICJ to meet a certain standard.⁴² This wide discretionary power, therefore, not only applies to fact-finding in general, but also to the Court’s choice of the appropriate evidentiary standard in a given case.⁴³\n39.

Roscini (n 6) 227.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack\nWhen discussing the standard of proof, however, it is inevitable to discuss the issue of burden of proof beforehand.⁴⁴ Most importantly, the two should not be confused. Burden of proof means that the party who asserts a fact in the proceeding is also the party who bears the burden of proving it,⁴⁵ namely ‘to convince the Court of the truthfulness of its claim’.⁴⁶ Only after it becomes clear which party bears the burden of proof, the Court is called upon to decide on the necessary standard.⁴⁷ In this sense, the standard of proof stipulates which degree of probability has to be provided by the party to convince the Court⁴⁸ or more specifically, the quantum of proof that has to be shown in order to ‘[...] discharge the burden of proof when that burden rests upon [that party]’.⁴⁹ Looking at the rare amount of cases where the ICJ has touched upon the question of evidentiary standards, it becomes evident that there is not a single standard for all disputes arising before it.⁵⁰ In cases concerning state responsibility,⁵¹ the actual standard of proof in a given case is determined by the substantive nature of the obligation, which was breached and is claimed by a party.⁵²\n⁴⁴.

Accordingly, Judge Greenwood pointed out that if cases exist where a state claims charges of exceptional gravity against another state, there have to be cases where a party claims less serious breaches and in those disputes, a lower standard of proof would be appropriate.⁵⁷ While the Bosnian Genocide case clearly shows that the ICJ requires a higher degree of certainty for serious charges, it is more difficult to perceive the exact difference between – in what seems like – a variety of evidentiary standards mentioned in the Court’s other case law. This is exemplified by the Court’s approach to use terms such as ‘convincing/convinced’,⁵⁸ ‘conclusive’,⁵⁹ ‘sufficient’⁶⁰ and ‘insufficient/not sufficient evidence’⁶¹ rather confusable so far instead of explaining which\n⁵³.

To establish international responsibility, one must have clear and indisputable facts.’⁶⁵\nIn the authors’ opinion, this seems plausible. The application of a balance of probabilities standard essentially means that the truthfulness of an allegation has to be ‘more probable than not’⁶⁶ compared to the evidence submitted by the alleged perpetrator. This, however, cannot suffice to establish international responsibility convincingly. Such a low standard might very easily lead to a false attribution of internationally wrongful acts, which ultimately were not committed by the state, although it might indeed seem this way.⁶⁷ Accordingly, it is important to highlight that the Court itself never used a balance of probabilities standard with regard to a state responsibility case.\nThe *Corfu Channel* case also indicates that proof beyond reasonable doubt, a standard applied in national and international cases concerning the criminal responsibility of individuals,⁶⁸ is not an appropriate standard before\n⁶². Benzing (n 39) 1265; see also *Oil Platforms* (n 50) 270, Separate Opinion of Judge Buergenthal, para 41: ‘One might ask, moreover, where the test of “insufficient” evidence comes from … and by reference to what standards the Court applies it? What is meant by “insufficient” evidence? Does the evidence have to be “convincing”, “preponderant”, “overwhelming” or “beyond a reasonable doubt” to be sufficient? The Court never spells out what the here relevant standard of proof is.’; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 129–30.\n⁶³. See *Corfu Channel* (n 25) 14, 16, 17, 18; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 126–27.\n⁶⁴. The preponderance of evidence standard is also known as balance of probabilities. “Preponderance of evidence” generally means that there is evidence greater in weight in comparison with the evidence adduced by the other party on the basis of reasonable probability rather than possibility.’ See Amerasinghe (n 25) 242.\n⁶⁵. *Corfu Channel* (n 25) 68, Dissenting Opinion of Judge Krylov, 72; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 133.\n⁶⁶.

Consequently, in Corfu Channel, the Court has not found that the UK met this high standard when claiming that the minefield was laid with the connivance of Albania.⁷⁰ This finding was later confirmed in Bosnian Genocide, where the Court equally refrained from applying the proof beyond reasonable doubt standard.⁷¹\nHowever, the foregoing only applies to claims for which direct proof is available.⁷² Where mere circumstantial evidence is submitted by a party, the ICJ did require that proof must leave no room for reasonable doubt.⁷³ Again, the ICJ determined the exact parameters in Corfu Channel, when it noted with regards to the claim brought forward by the UK that Albania knew about the minefield in its territorial waters:\n[...] the fact of this exclusive territorial control exercised by a State within its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the knowledge of that State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. [...] The proof may be drawn from inferences of fact, provided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt.⁷⁴\nEssentially, the ICJ held on the basis of circumstantial evidence – meaning facts which considered together lead ‘logically to a single conclusion’ – that\n⁶⁹. Corfu Channel (n 25) 17; Benzing (n 39) 1265; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 134–36; see also Amerasinghe (n 25) 235, who pointed out that the proof beyond reasonable doubt standard is too severe to be applied to non-criminal cases. One reason for this might be the fact that inter-state disputes are not criminal cases and in their very nature resemble civil cases, where parties stand on an equal footing. Cf Roscini (n 6) 227.\n⁷⁰. This was the second alternative argument of the UK Government. See Corfu Channel (n 25) 16–17. See also reference to Corfu Channel in Bosnian Genocide (n 50) para 209.\n⁷¹. See Bosnian Genocide (n 50) para 209; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 135. At one point, however, the Court did apply a standard of proof close to the standard beyond reasonable doubt, when it required proof beyond any doubt in respect of the allegation that there was aid and assistance between the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and VRS leaders, who carried out the acts of genocide.

The restraint of international courts and tribunals to discuss evidentiary standards has also been criticised by international judges, see Markus Benzing, Das Beweisrecht vor\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015)\nmay also be ascribed to the influence of the civil/continental law – as opposed to common law – tradition on inter-state dispute settlement.⁸⁶ In the civil law system, judges determine the probative value of submitted evidence in both civil, and criminal law cases based on their internal conviction and are thus not required to apply a specific standard.⁸⁷ In common law jurisdictions, however, judges generally apply the preponderance of evidence or reasonable degree of probability standard with regard to civil law cases, whereas in criminal law cases, a higher standard, namely proof beyond reasonable doubt, has to be met.⁸⁸ Above all, many difficulties when determining evidentiary standards arise due to the simple fact that the evaluation of evidence is a subjective matter – ultimately leading to contradictions between judges on what kind of evidence suffices to be convincing to discharge the burden.⁸⁹\nHowever, it would still be important to know for parties what the ICJ itself exactly means by conclusive, convincing and sufficient evidence.⁹⁰ What is more, the parties appearing before the Court should, already during the proceedings, have at least some clue as to which evidentiary standard will be applied to the case and not be taken by surprise by the Court's final judgment.⁹¹ Particularly in Bosnian Genocide, however, the Court already went a step further by giving more detailed answers than in previous cases and hopefully will continue to develop the case law more consistently with regard to the question of evidentiary standards.⁹²\nIn conclusion, legal scholars have identified three types of state responsibility cases before the ICJ when it comes to determining the relevant standard of proof.⁹³ First, in regular cases, the ICJ demands proof at a high level of certainty appropriate to the seriousness of the allegation.⁹⁴ The amount of\n⁸⁶.

This makes it then possible to explore the level of seriousness of the alleged breach in order to determine the evidentiary standard which has to be met by the parties in the dispute.\n## 4. Cyber-Attacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts\nCyber-attacks may vary greatly in scale and form. However, only when these ‘hostile uses of cyberspace’¹⁰¹ amount to a violation of international law, the question of international adjudication arises.¹⁰² In the authors’ opinion, the international obligations most relevant for a cyber-attack to constitute an internationally wrongful act are those that most severely infringe a state’s sovereignty. Thus, the prohibition of the threat or use of force and the principle of non-intervention and their applicability to cyber operations are of special interest. Based on these two principles, the question of how to attribute these\n⁹⁵. Teitelbaum (n 39) 125–26; Roscini (n 6) 228.\n⁹⁶. Quintana (n 47) 408; cf Riddell and Plant (n 39) 132–36.\n⁹⁷.

More specifically, when they occur ‘in the “international relations” of member states’ and do not merely constitute a private act without a state’s involvement, Dinniss (n 1) 40.\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015)\n'attacks' to a state will be examined and the necessary standard of proof to be applied in those cases will be determined. It is also important to note that the term cyber-'attack', being a non-legal term, is not to be equated to the term 'armed attack', triggering the right of self-defence under Article 51 UN Charter.¹⁰³\n## 4.1. The Threat or Use of Force\nDue to its severity, the first international obligation to be discussed here is the prohibition of the threat or use of force, enshrined in Article 2(4) UN Charter.¹⁰⁴ This prohibition is considered to be a norm of customary international law¹⁰⁵ and the overall consensus is that it is also applicable to cyber operations.¹⁰⁶ This is in line with the ICJ's Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion, where it noted that the prohibition to use force applies 'regardless of the weapons employed'.¹⁰⁷ It is more the effect of a weapon upon which a breach of Article 2(4) is determined.¹⁰⁸ Traditionally, only physical damage to property, loss of life or injury of persons were thought to meet this requirement.¹⁰⁹ Moreover, a state would need to prove that the cyber-attack has caused a severe effect, meaning that 'its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force'.¹¹⁰ Given the virtual (rather than physical) nature of cyber-attacks, this seems to be\n¹⁰³. Article 51 UN Charter, 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS 16: 'Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.'\n¹⁰⁴.

Schmitt (ed) (n 101) Rule 11, 45.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack\nthe most difficult part.¹¹¹ To give an example of such severity, the Stuxnet virus launched at the Iranian Natanz nuclear plant, supposedly leading to the physical damage of the plant's centrifuges could be considered, if proven, to be of such gravity that it would constitute a use of force.¹¹² Another attack worth mentioning in this regard is the recent NotPetya operation at the end of June this year. It was initially thought to be a ransomware attack,¹¹³ but then later qualified as being more than that, as the generation of revenue did not seem to be the primary goal of its operation.¹¹⁴ It also led to chaos on a large scale, with Ukraine seeming to be the main target.¹¹⁵ Despite the fact that physical damage did not occur, the NotPetya operation may nevertheless open up the discussion as to whether non-destructive cyber operations, which still massively disrupt the apparatus of the state, might be considered a violation of Article 2(4) in the future.¹¹⁶\nTo conclude, there seems to be a relatively high threshold of invoking the violation of Article 2(4), since the damage must be so severe it can be equated to a use of force in the traditional sense. Thus, in the case of less than forceful cyber-attacks or general lack of evidence, a state might have more success in claiming that the cyber intrusion constituted an unlawful intervention.¹¹⁷\n¹¹¹. On a side note, as the ICJ held in Nicaragua, the 'most grave forms' of the use of force amount to an 'armed attack', which would trigger the right of self-defence under Article 51 UN Charter, see Nicaragua (Merits) (n 41) para 191; Thus, by acknowledging that Article 51 UN Charter is also applicable in the cyber context, a cyber-attack of the 'most grave form' must also be one that enables the victim state to defend itself effectively.\n¹¹².

Non-Intervention\nThe principle of non-intervention derived out of the principle of the sovereign equality of states, which is enshrined in Article 2(1) UN Charter.¹¹⁸ It also reflects customary international law.¹¹⁹ It is widely seen to be equally applicable to cyber-attacks.¹²⁰ According to the ICJ, a state’s coercive interference in another state’s internal affairs constitutes an unlawful intervention.¹²¹ The Court noted in the Nicaragua judgment, that the requirement of coercion is fulfilled, when a state is deprived of its free ‘choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy’.¹²² The most obvious form of such coercion, according to the ICJ, is an intervention that uses force.¹²³ Being a much broader obligation than the prohibition of threat or use of force, it thus prohibits both forceful and less than forceful operations.¹²⁴\nHaving determined previously that severe damage is needed to establish a use of force, less than forceful – but still coercive – cyber operations might thus still be unlawful. To give an example, the cyber-attack against Estonia in 2007 (if it is assumed that it was conducted by Russia) could be seen as an unlawful intervention in Estonia’s affairs, as it was a coercive attempt to influence Estonia not to relocate the Second World War memorial.¹²⁵\nMore recently, the hack and release of a vast amount of internal emails of the US Democratic National Committee to WikiLeaks right before the US elections has sparked widespread media attention. It primarily led to the increased negative portrayal of candidate Clinton in the media and is widely believed to have been conducted by the Russian Government in order to help candidate Trump win the presidency.¹²⁶ Another consequential hack was the attack against President Macron’s election campaign, which led to the\n¹¹⁸.

Attribution\nEventually, for state responsibility to arise, the wrongful conduct must be attributable to a state. The ILC Articles on State Responsibility set out in Articles 4 to 11 the different activities by individuals which are attributable to a state. These include first and foremost the conduct of de jure and de facto state organs as well as persons/entities ‘exercising elements of governmental authority’.¹³²\nParticular notice shall be made to private hackers, whose expertise might be used by states to conduct a cyber-attack. Two provisions of the ILC Articles might be of relevance in this regard. First, the ICJ noted in Bosnian Genocide that Article 4 ILC Articles might enable the attribution of acts of private individuals that are not formally recognised as state organs to the state, if they are ‘in a relationship of complete dependence on the State’.¹³³\n¹²⁷.

Bosnian Genocide (n 50) para 391.\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015)\nProving a complete dependence, however, might be very difficult. Thus, according to Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility,¹³⁴ the conduct of private individuals may still be attributable to a state if they are either acting under the instructions of that state or under their direction or control.¹³⁵ In the Nicaragua judgment, the ICJ determined the degree of control to be one of effective control ‘in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred’.¹³⁶ The ICTY’s Appeals Chamber argued in Tadić that its ‘overall control’ test, which was a test to establish the internationality of a conflict, would be equally applicable to questions of state responsibility.¹³⁷ This, however, was rejected by the ICJ in Bosnian Genocide, which considered the test to be too broad to apply it to the context of Article 8 and upheld its reasoning from Nicaragua.¹³⁸ This stricter test, however, poses another difficulty for an injured state, since proving effective control is a much higher threshold than claiming overall control of a state over the activities of a non-state actor.¹³⁹\nTherefore, in order to attribute an act to a state, the ‘victim’ state would need to prove that the cyber-attack was launched from a device that belonged to someone who was either completely dependent on that state or his/her activities were somehow conducted under effective control of that state.\nSetting aside this high threshold of proving an individual’s affiliation with the state, the attribution to a specific territory itself proves already extremely difficult. To start with, one may have to identify the exact location of the device. In the simplest cases, this could be achieved by tracing back the IP address from which the attack was launched.¹⁴⁰ Thus, if the IP address reveals a government-owned facility, the device can be identified as a government computer and thus, state responsibility may arise.¹⁴¹ However, as explained in section 2 in more detail, there are many ways to obscure the identity of the actual perpetrator, eg through IP spoofing, or computer hijacking. Moreover, the Tallinn Manual notes that ‘the fact that a cyber operation has been routed via the cyber infrastructure located in a State’ does not constitute ‘sufficient evidence’ that the cyber activity is attributable to\n¹³⁴.

Proving a State’s Breach of the Prohibition of Non-Intervention and Article 2(4)\nHaving demonstrated the various hurdles of applying the principle of non-intervention and Article 2(4) to the cyber context, the question now remains whether the current regime of proving a state’s breach of these principles remains applicable. For the purpose of this article, it is assumed that the material elements of a breach (such as coercion or severe damage) are sufficiently proven. Of particular interest is the question of proving the *attribution* of the attack to a state. For that as well, however, two main elements of proof need to be considered: the burden and the standard of proof.\n## 4.4.1. Burden of Proof\nIt is important to note that the formal status of the parties in the proceedings, whether applicant or respondent, has no bearing on the allocation of the burden.¹⁴⁴ When asserting which party carries the burden of proof, the Court generally applies the *onus probandi incumbit actori* principle: It is the party asserting a fact that is responsible for providing the Court with proof thereof.¹⁴⁵ The allocation of the burden of proof is of fundamental importance since there can only be a decision in favour of a party that has to prove a certain fact when it has successfully discharged the burden.¹⁴⁶ Thus, if a state wants to successfully claim reparations for a state’s violations of the threat or use of force and non-intervention principle, it is up to the victim state to collect enough evidence to discharge the burden. The *onus probandi* rule, however, is not an absolute one,\nthe determination of the burden of proof is in reality dependent on the subject-matter and nature of each dispute brought before the Court; it varies according to\n¹⁴².

Even if a state could successfully trace back IP addresses to another government's computer infrastructures, it would not have access to these computers in the same way as the perpetrator state. While some argue for the general notion that states need to act in good faith when participating in a judicial procedure,¹⁴⁸ with regard to the wording of Article 49 of the Court's Statute ('formal note shall be taken of any refusal'), this provision for the production of evidence does not seem to imply a binding legal obligation for states to comply with Article 49 requests.¹⁴⁹ While the Court might be allowed to draw adverse inferences from not complying with such a request (even though it has been reluctant to do so in the past), this does not mean it could compel a party to produce evidence.¹⁵⁰ It can therefore be assumed that an argument for the non-binding nature of Article 49 requests stands on stronger footing.\n## 4.4.2. Standard of Proof\nDue to the technical difficulty of attributing a cyber-attack, it might be argued that different standards of proof shall apply for the attribution on the one hand and claiming the substantive violation on the other. For attribution, certain scholars refer to the Yeager arbitration.¹⁵¹ There, the Iran-US Claims\n¹⁴⁷.

See however Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Salvador v Honduras; Nicaragua intervening), ICJ Reports (1992) 351, para 63, where the Court stated that it 'cannot however apply a presumption that evidence which is unavailable would, if produced, have supported a particular party's case; still less a presumption of the existence of evidence which has not been produced'. Riddell and Plant (n 39) 116.\n¹⁵¹. See, eg Schmitt and Vihul (n 5) 65–66.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack\nTribunal noted that the attribution of a wrongful conduct to a state must be proven with reasonable certainty.¹⁵² However, the ICJ noted in *Bosnian Genocide* that the same standard of proof applies to both the violation of the substantive rule as well as the attribution for such acts.¹⁵³ In other words, rather than separating attribution and violation, both of them require the same standard of proof. Thus, since the standard of proof varies with the violation, the standard of reasonable certainty does not apply to all cases.\nIn *Armed Activities* and *Oil Platforms*, the ICJ set the threshold of alleging an unlawful use of force to clear and convincing evidence.¹⁵⁴ As noted in section 3, the Court demands the higher standard of fully conclusive evidence only in charges of exceptional gravity. This suggests that the violation of Article 2(4) is not considered to be of such grave nature, which – given that a non-forceful intervention is considered less harmful, must hold true for the principle of non-intervention as well. Consequently, the clear and convincing standard would most likely equally apply to prove an intervention.\nHowever, especially when alleging a cyber-attack that violated the prohibition of use of force or non-intervention, direct proof will often be missing and thus the only type of evidence the parties may be able to offer is circumstantial evidence.¹⁵⁵ In that case, as we have seen before, the proof provided ‘must leave no room for reasonable doubt’.¹⁵⁶ However, with current techniques, it is almost impossible to attribute an attack to a state beyond reasonable doubt, especially without giving away specific know-how that might be too delicate to share with the rest of the world.¹⁵⁷ Therefore, without lowering the standard to give credit to the special circumstances of cyber-attacks, it will be almost impossible for states to prove the affiliation of a state to the attack. See section 5.2 on this issue.\n# 5. Possible Means to Address the Evidentiary Dilemma in Cyberspace\nCyber-attacks might to some extent be considered textbook examples of a scenario where one party has exclusive control over the evidence required and where direct proof is often not available.¹⁵⁸ Section 5.1 thus seeks to\n¹⁵².

Next, the question whether the ICJ might depart from its strict approach concerning circumstantial evidence will be addressed in section 5.2.¹⁵⁹ For both questions, opinions of different legal scholars will be analysed. Finally, as a new way forward to resolve some of the evidentiary issues in the cyber context, the present authors suggest that – as an alternative solution – the Court should make more use of its inherent powers regarding the production of evidence (section 5.3).\n## 5.1. Reversing the Burden of Proof\nAs attribution poses one of the biggest problems in the cyber context, some authors have called for a reversal of the burden of proof, even though the reasons for arriving at this conclusion are very different. One of them makes a case for not applying the ICJ’s findings in *Corfu Channel*, arguing that by their very nature computers are different to sea-mines.¹⁶⁰ Therefore, the same standards cannot be applied in the cyber context; hence a reversal of the burden of proof is appropriate.¹⁶¹ For authors dealing with problems like identification or attribution, fairness and efficiency seem to be their focal point for arguing for a reversal of the burden, assuming that the party whose territory the attack has emanated from, has superior access to information.¹⁶² Consequently, the onus should be on the country where the attack had been launched from (allegedly).¹⁶³ Proponents of this approach also put forward that, with a reversal of the burden, states would take their due diligence obligations of preventing cyber-attacks more seriously.¹⁶⁴ This is closely linked to the claim that the precautionary principle originating from environmental law can be applied to cyberspace, which then automatically shifts the burden of proof.¹⁶⁵ While the application of the precautionary principle might well\n¹⁵⁹.

When looking at the ICJ’s case law, ever since its first decision, the Court has not been inclined to shift the burden, even when evidence was exclusively located in the territory of one state.¹⁶⁸ This finding in *Corfu Channel* has so far not been overruled in any way.¹⁶⁹ What is more, the Court reaffirmed its findings in the *Nicaragua* case, acknowledging that even in times of ongoing armed conflicts (as was the case in *eg Georgia* in 2008), where evidence might be hard to come by, this might affect the standard of proof, not however the burden.¹⁷⁰ Even Judge Owada’s Separate Opinion to the *Oil Platforms* case dealt with difficulties arising from evidentiary imbalances between the applicant and the respondent in a self-defence scenario, as it was the US’s duty to establish that Iran had launched an armed attack against them, against which they defended themselves. While not wholeheartedly content with the situation, he stated that:\nNevertheless, there is no denying the fact that there undoubtedly exists an asymmetry in the situation surrounding the case [...]. I am prepared to accept that this asymmetry is inherent in the circumstances of the present case and there is little the Court can do under the circumstances. It is primarily the task incumbent upon the party which claims certain facts as the basis of its contention to establish them by producing sufficient evidence in accordance with the principle *actori incumbit onus probandi*.¹⁷¹\nIn light of the discussion above, it can be therefore concluded that it is highly unlikely that the ICJ would shift the burden of proof in the cyber context, not only because of the established case law but also because of certain\n---\n¹⁶⁶.

Cyber operations are often routed through numerous countries,¹⁷² thus a reversal could place the burden of proof on a wholly uninvolved party.¹⁷³\nIt is, however, important to note that the Court has always been concerned with a level playing field for the parties, which could not be facilitated by a reversal of the burden. What may however be considered, might be lowering the evidentiary standard to facilitate the discharge of the burden.¹⁷⁴\n## 5.2. Lowering the Evidentiary Standard – The Indirect Evidence Dilemma\nAs was already explained above, the ICJ seems to have a case-to-case approach for the evidentiary standard to be applied. This makes it incredibly difficult for the parties to assess how much evidence is needed to successfully discharge the burden. However, there are certain signpost judgments shining light on an expected standard to be met (such as Armed Activities or Oil Platforms in the case of claiming use of force).¹⁷⁵ As was already mentioned in section 4.4.b), it only seems logical to assume that the party alleging such violations in the form of a cyber-attack would need to meet the same clear and convincing evidentiary standard.¹⁷⁶ Some authors regard this standard as still too high, deeming it as too strict and advocating for the lower balance of probabilities standard.¹⁷⁷\nHowever, looking at the ICJ’s previous case law, it is very unlikely that the Court would apply a lower standard than clear and convincing. In fact, as noted above, the ICJ might even set the standard to proof beyond reasonable doubt, since direct proof will often be missing.¹⁷⁸ This, however, would set\n172.

See section 3.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack\nthe standard for cyber-attacks incredibly high. On the other hand, it would do away with concerns that a lower evidentiary standard would make it easier to blame a state for conduct it had nothing to do with. Protecting the respondent from false attribution, be it through IP spoofing, botnets or onion routing,¹⁷⁹ is an argument that should not be left out of the debate concerning a lower evidentiary standard.¹⁸⁰\nHowever, applying a beyond reasonable doubt standard in the cyber context might also be too far reaching: With regard to cyber-attacks, collecting evidence will always remain extremely hard and it would be (at least at the moment) impossible to collect information that reaches a higher level than clear and convincing.¹⁸¹ The victim state would be left with the impossible task to meet a standard which is ‘unreachable’, which could potentially result in perpetrator states evading their responsibility under international law. As Judge Owada held in his Separate Opinion to *Oil Platforms*:\nAs a court of justice whose primary function is the proper administration of justice, should see to it that this problem relating to evidence be dealt with in such a way that utmost justice is brought to bear on the final finding of the Court [...] It would seem to me that the only way to achieve this would have been for the Court to take a more proactive stance on the issue of evidence and that of fact-finding in the present case. This brings me to the standard of proof to be required for discharging the burden of proof in a case where the party who carries the burden of proof, though responsible for discharging that burden, finds itself in an extremely difficult situation as seen from an objective point of view.¹⁸²\nThese opinions, however, clearly show that the ICJ itself would not be interested in applying a standard that would be impossible to meet for the parties involved and that the paramount principle underlying the ICJ’s assessment of evidence is the proper administration of justice.¹⁸³ Such is unlikely when the Court would require parties to prove their allegations beyond reasonable doubt, even when direct proof is not available.\n---\n¹⁷⁹.

This, particularly due to the fact that evidence is often located in the exclusive territory of the alleged perpetrator and obtaining said evidence one-sidedly would constitute a violation of that state's sovereignty.¹⁸⁵ The present authors therefore suggest combining the clear and convincing standard with a more enhanced use of the Court's inherent fact-finding powers. This new approach will be discussed below.\n## 5.3. The Court’s Powers for the Production of Evidence\nAs discussed above, the present authors propose that the clear and convincing standard would be the best way to aptly deal with the evidentiary difficulties relating to cyber-attacks. Authors such as Roscini and Schmitt have already illustrated quite convincingly why this standard, being still significantly high, would be appropriate.¹⁸⁶ However, little has been said so far on how exactly the Court could be furnished with evidence that would satisfy the demands of a clear and convincing standard. Therefore, this section seeks to shine light on how to overcome certain evidentiary hurdles through the Court's more active usage of its powers to produce evidence. More specifically, it will do so by focusing on the evidentiary power that might become indispensable in these highly scientific and technical matters: the use of court-appointed experts. Before analysing those in detail, however, this section will start with a more general overview on ways to collect evidence in an ICJ proceeding.\nFirst, in theory, the Court has the inherent power to request additional documents, call its own witnesses, appoint own experts, or make on site visits. This has rarely happened in the past, as the Court has always been of the opinion that parties to the dispute should first and foremost furnish the Court with evidence themselves.¹⁸⁷ However, the extremely cautious approach as an intermediary not making use of its powers has been widely criticised.¹⁸⁸\n---\n¹⁸⁴.

Pursuant to Article 50 of the Statute, ‘[t]he Court may, at any time, entrust any individual, body, bureau, commission, or other organization that it may select, with the task of carrying out an enquiry or giving an expert opinion’.¹⁹⁴ The advantages of using court-appointed experts are manifold, aside from the fact that a potential bias plays less of a role as opposed to party-appointed experts.¹⁹⁵ Therefore, the present authors argue that making better usage of the Court’s own powers to appoint experts under Article 50 would help resolve attribution issues in the cyber context.\n¹⁸⁹.

Only in the Chorzow Factory case in front of the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ), as well as the Corfu Channel and the Gulf of Maine case in front of the ICJ, experts have been appointed under this procedure.¹⁹⁸ This reluctance has been widely criticised not only by doctrine¹⁹⁹ but also within the Court.²⁰⁰\nOne explanation for the neglect of Article 50 might be the fact that court-appointed experts almost exclusively appear in civil law jurisdictions and that to jurists from common law backgrounds, this appointment might seem like an undue interference, especially with regard to the burden of proof of the parties.²⁰¹ It has also been the Court's contention that the use of experts was just not necessary, as the parties involved in the proceedings seldom disagreed on matters of fact but rather on matters of law.²⁰² This, however,\n196.

Gaining that kind of knowledge through court-appointed experts seems to be one of the best ways to establish those facts.²⁰⁵\nLegal scholar Roscini proposes that the ICJ should use the fact-finding powers mentioned above to counterbalance evidentiary difficulties in cases where an exceptionally high standard has to be met (such as for example 'fully conclusive' in the case of genocide).²⁰⁶ However, the present authors argue that – in the cyber context – not even a more proactive stance on fact-finding could produce evidence that meets the requirements of a fully conclusive or beyond reasonable doubt standard. These evidentiary difficulties in the cyber context become clear when comparing a typical cyber scenario to a state responsibility case, where the Court made use of its fact-finding powers. In Corfu Channel, the Court concluded that the exceptionally high standard of beyond reasonable doubt to decide on Albania's international responsibility was met due to the tests run by court-appointed experts. It might thus be possible for experts to arrive at a single logical conclusion on whether an Albanian coastguard would have been able to see a ship passing through in the dark.²⁰⁷ This, however, cannot be said for experts having to determine whether an attack, which was routed through multiple countries, was caused\n203.

Not even the biggest team of experts could furnish the Court with evidence that simply does not exist. This is why the present authors propose that the best way to overcome evidentiary problems in the cyber context would be a more active use of the Court's fact-finding powers to reach the lower, but still satisfying clear and convincing standard. The fact that the Court has recently appointed experts in the Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean case between Costa Rica and Nicaragua – the first appointment in over 30 years – might be an indicator that the Court is about to change its reluctant stance on Article 50.²⁰⁸\n## 6. Conclusion\nIt is probably only a matter of time until a state lodges an application before the ICJ, claiming that it suffered damage arising out of a cyber-attack. It is almost certain that the Court will then be faced with several new questions, starting with whether a specific cyber-attack amounts to a violation of international law, to whether the current regime of evidentiary standards employed by the Court so far gives credit to the specific technical difficulties of proving cyber-attacks. As demonstrated by Estonia and Georgia, this contribution displayed the severe evidentiary troubles victim states have faced so far when trying to prove a state's involvement and thus, arguably, a reluctance to address international tribunals in this matter.\nFirst, the present authors started with analysing the current evidentiary regime of the Court to shine light on this delicate topic. It became clear that when dealing with state responsibility, the Court has applied three different standards. These vary according to the seriousness of the claim. Thus, for charges of exceptional gravity, for example, it found that it must be convinced by fully conclusive evidence.\nTherefore, there must be a breach of an international obligation first, in order to assess what standard of proof the Court will most likely apply in the cyber context. Consequently, the present authors analysed two principles of international law that are most probable to be violated in the case of a cyber-attack against a state: the prohibition of the threat or use of force and the non-intervention principle: two principles, that by their very nature want to protect a state's territorial integrity.\n²⁰⁸. Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean (Costa Rica v Nicaragua), ICJ Order (31 May 2016); see Order of 16 June 2016; Gaja (n 195) 416–17.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack\nAlthough the Court already held that it will require clear and convincing evidence when a breach of Article 2(4) – and most likely also an unlawful intervention – is claimed, this only applies when direct proof is available. Nowadays, where technical difficulties hinder states to gather evidence linking a state directly to a cyber-attack, only indirect evidence can be submitted. In such a case, however, the Court established that it will require proof beyond reasonable doubt to let international responsibility arise. It is very likely that the ICJ will face various problems with this standard. Above all, a victim state would be left having to prove beyond reasonable doubt that a state is the originator of an attack. This is something that is obviously impossible with our current technical expertise.\nThus, scholars have proposed to shift the burden of proof to the perpetrator state, which now has to prove that it had not been involved in a cyberattack. This seems to be an unsatisfying solution: Not only did the Court itself refuse such an approach in the past; a shift would also put too much responsibility on the respondent state. Therefore, a more plausible approach would be to lower the evidentiary standard to clear and convincing, even in cases where direct proof is missing. Additionally, the present authors have pointed out how the inability of the parties to produce sufficient evidence can be overcome through the usage of the Court's power to appoint experts. This makes it possible to meet the clear and convincing standard and thus establish international responsibility.\nTo conclude, the relevant case law so far suggests that the Court will remain flexible in its application of evidentiary standards. It will be seen whether it may be open to lowering the standard in cases of exceptional difficulty. In this way, it could ensure that in each individual case, the appropriate standard to enable attribution is applied, but still protects states from wrongful conviction.\n^{}[]"

Despite its vast benefits, however, it has also been used to cause severe damage to states. Hostile cyber activities seem to have occurred more frequently over the past years. It is already recognised that international law – thus also the law on state responsibility – is applicable to cyber-related issues. However, particularly in the context of inter-state relations, the question of how states are able to seek reparation in front of the International Court of Justice for damage caused by a cyber-attack conducted by a state remains open to debate. This is primarily due to the fact that the cyber sphere enjoys a considerable amount of anonymity, which makes it hard to establish the main perpetrator behind an act. Therefore, calls have been made to shift the burden of proof or to lower the evidentiary standard required by the Court. In this article, the present authors will assess the relevant case law of the Court and apply it to two scenarios: a cyber-attack violating the prohibition of use of force and the non-intervention principle. The aim is to display the Court's line of reasoning and assess whether the scholarly demands to ease evidentiary issues, by shifting the burden or lowering the standard of proof, are justified or not. Additionally, the present authors will address a yet in the cyber-context unexplored, but nevertheless, important tool in collecting sufficient evidence: the power of the Court to appoint experts.\nKEYWORDS: cyber-attack, attribution, state responsibility, evidence, International Court of Justice, burden of proof, standard of proof * Isabella Brunner works in the Office of the Legal Adviser (Department of Public International Law) at the Austrian Federal Ministry for Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs.

Introduction Since the emergence of the Internet in the 1980s, various actors – both private and governmental – became the target of foreign cyber operations.¹ While thus being a ‘relatively’ new phenomenon in our society, it is unquestionable that their frequency and impact is rising with each year. This is owed to the fact that nowadays, individuals, private companies and governments increasingly and more intensely operate online.² Cyber operations targeted against states themselves generally aim to bring down governmental infrastructures, such as computer systems of institutions and governmental web pages. This has occurred, for instance, in Estonia and Georgia, where several facilities were brought down through so-called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.³ Another operation that has created widespread interest among international lawyers and remains heavily debated is the cyber hack into the emails of the US Democratic National Committee during the 2016 US presidential elections. One of the most recent large-scale cyber operations was the so-called NotPetya attack on 27 June 2017, targeting primarily Ukraine.⁴ However, the most consequential cyber operation so far remains the 2010 attack on Iran's Natanz nuclear facility plant, which is believed to have been carried out by Israel and the US. Through an infected USB device, it allegedly led to the physical damage of a significant number of centrifuges.⁵ As demonstrated above, the methods of launching a cyber-attack may vary in many ways (be it a DDoS attack or infiltration of malicious software). Nevertheless, all cyber-attacks so far have had one thing in common: the attacker was and remains fairly difficult to determine. As a consequence, it appears Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack that cyber operations may gradually be seen as a new and viable method through which states are able to inflict harm upon other states, enabling them to ‘hide behind their proxy servers’ while reaching their objectives.⁶ This results from the immense technical difficulties in attributing cyber operations to other states – also due to the possibility to conceal traces by methods such as IP spoofing – essentially giving states ‘impunity in cyberspace’.⁷ Therefore, victim states are often left unable to evince the origins of the act, making it impossible to persuasively attribute a wrongful act to another state. These factual difficulties, however, have significant legal consequences, especially because they will most certainly prevent state responsibility from being triggered, which thus gradually undermines the international legal order. Thus, although victim states often have at least an educated guess on the identity of the actual perpetrator, they remain reluctant to point fingers. And while some states have publicly accused other states for cyber operations in the past,⁸ so far none has resorted to international litigation in an attempt to pursue reparation. In fact, to date there has not been a single dispute on this issue brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ).\nThis contribution therefore explores how far the past case law of the ICJ gives guidance on how it might deal with a case concerning state responsibility for an injury arising out of a cyber-attack.⁹ For the purpose of this article, cyber-attacks shall be considered to constitute any state-operated hostile intrusion into the cyber facilities of another state.¹⁰ Thus, the focus lies solely on cyber activities conducted by a state Finnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) targeting another state.¹¹ This contribution, however, will not delve into issues that might arise out of the law of armed conflict.¹² In section 2, this article starts with illustrating evidentiary difficulties relating to cyber operations exemplified by Estonia and Georgia – two states that have been suffering under relatively harmful DDoS attacks. Thereafter, in section 3, the contribution provides a general overview over the ICJ’s past jurisprudence on its evidentiary standards and clarifies the standards the Court has required in the past for the establishment of certain breaches of international law. In particular, two possible breaches, the violation of the use of force principle and the prohibition of non-intervention and their attribution to a state are of interest in the case of cyber-attacks. In this context, the present authors will also address the newest large-scale cyber operations and conclude if they could be considered a violation of these two principles (section 4). Thereafter, the specific standard of proof required by the Court when examining the violation of the prohibition of the threat or use of force and non-intervention principle, as well as the burden of proof, will be addressed in more detail. Finally, in section 5, already suggested solutions by legal scholars to overcome evidentiary difficulties related to cyber-attacks will be analysed: shifting the burden of proof and lowering the evidentiary standard used by the Court (sections 5.1 and 5.2). The present authors will additionally address a significant topic that has been disregarded so far, namely the extremely difficult task to collect sufficient evidence in the cyber-context. Thus, without the Court’s involvement, it is the authors’ contention that it would be almost impossible for states to meet the required evidentiary standard (section 5.3).\n## 2. Cyber-Attacks and Evidentiary Difficulties: Estonia and Georgia In the current cyberspace era, where societies are more and more reliant on computer networks, cyber-attacks are becoming an ever-growing threat.¹³ As Roscini rightly pointed out: ‘The more digitally reliant a state is, the more Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack vulnerable to cyber attacks: if computer systems become the society's 'nerve system', incapacitating them may mean paralyzing the country.¹⁴ The weakness of a state, which is highly dependent on computer networks and electronic information, was best observed in Estonia, when it was the target of several DDoS attacks¹⁵ in 2007.¹⁶ In what was one of the most prominent cyber-attacks in history to date, several Estonian governmental web pages and services became victims of DDoS attacks.¹⁷ The series of attacks, which lasted about three weeks, also targeted the Estonian banking system and media, including newspapers and TV stations, as well as other companies.¹⁸ Interestingly, the operation occurred closely after the Estonian Government decided to remove a Soviet Second World War memorial from the Tallinn city centre, which led to protests of Russian youth groups and vocal opposition by the Russian Government itself.¹⁹ Due to the political circumstances and the fact that some of the attacks could be traced back to IP addresses of Russian state institutions, Estonia accused Russia of the operation.²⁰ Russia, however, denied any involvement and responsibility for the attacks and eventually, Estonia backed away from its accusations.²¹ Similarly, the DDoS attacks conducted against Georgia in 2008 could, to some extent, be traced back to IP addresses belonging to Russian state-operated companies.²² The attacks happened at the time where Georgia was already involved in an armed conflict with Russia over South Ossetia.²³ Finnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) While Georgia tried to hold on to the region, Russia supported it in its aim to become independent.²⁴ Both attacks were merely accompanied by circumstantial evidence.²⁵ In order to successfully claim Russia's involvement, the tense political climate between both Georgia and Russia as well as Estonia and Russia was brought forward in combination with the fact that the attack could be tracked back to Russian IP addresses.²⁶ However, neither Estonia nor Georgia could provide essential evidence in order to attribute those cyber operations to Russia.²⁷ What is more, many experts do not believe that Russian authorities were behind the Georgian attacks, but want to attribute them rather to Russian patriotic hackers.²⁸ While technical attribution is very helpful in the determination of the originator of an attack, it cannot provide perfect accuracy.²⁹ First, the actual attacker can make attribution³⁰ very difficult and conceal his/her paths and traces through tactics like IP spoofing, botnets³¹ or 'onion routing'.³² Through IP spoofing, for instance, individual hackers might try to feign Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack their identity and erroneously attribute cyber-attacks to an innocent state.³³ Hackers can also use computer networks over the whole world to launch an attack, and as data goes through various countries, it is even more difficult to identify one single state as responsible for the cyber operation.³⁴ For instance, 85,000 computers from 178 different countries carried out the DDoS attacks against Estonia.³⁵ If a state suffers damage from a cyber-attack like Estonia, where damage amounted to tens of millions of euros,³⁶ and if it can be established that the attack constitutes an internationally wrongful act (eg an unlawful intervention),³⁷ one would think that it might have an interest in invoking state responsibility for its injury before the ICJ. In this case, the victim state would have to provide evidence in support of its claim, namely that a specific state was behind the cyber-attack which is consequently obligated to make reparation under the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. Despite the fact that the Court has not dealt with a dispute concerning cyber-attacks yet, it was nevertheless already confronted with difficult fact-finding. Therefore, the next section will deal with a general analysis on the standard of proof which the ICJ will require in a proceeding to successfully attribute an internationally wrongful act to the perpetrator.\n# 3. Evidentiary Standards before the International Court of Justice In order to invoke state responsibility, a victim state needs evidence to 1) establish the material elements of the wrongful act, as well as 2) attribute this act to the alleged perpetrator.³⁸ In general, such evidence needs to be persuasive in order to satisfy the court/tribunal of the truthfulness of its allegation.\n\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) This section will show that, concerning the responsibility of states, the ICJ’s case law indicates that three different types of standards can be distinguished. All of them will be explained below.\nBefore examining the evidentiary standards, it is important to highlight that the Court generally enjoys wide discretion in matters of evidence.³⁹ Neither the Statute nor the Rules of Court contain formal rules regarding the Court’s handling of evidence and in particular, the evaluation of the probative value of evidence submitted by the parties.⁴⁰ Accordingly, Article 58(2) Rules of Court only stipulates that ‘[…] the method of handling the evidence […] shall be settled by the Court after the views of the parties have been ascertained […].’⁴¹ The Rules of the Court, equally, do not mention which standard of proof has to be applied by the Court nor which methods of proof (eg documentary evidence) are persuasive enough to the ICJ to meet a certain standard.⁴² This wide discretionary power, therefore, not only applies to fact-finding in general, but also to the Court’s choice of the appropriate evidentiary standard in a given case.⁴³ Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack When discussing the standard of proof, however, it is inevitable to discuss the issue of burden of proof beforehand.⁴⁴ Most importantly, the two should not be confused. Burden of proof means that the party who asserts a fact in the proceeding is also the party who bears the burden of proving it,⁴⁵ namely ‘to convince the Court of the truthfulness of its claim’.⁴⁶ Only after it becomes clear which party bears the burden of proof, the Court is called upon to decide on the necessary standard.⁴⁷ In this sense, the standard of proof stipulates which degree of probability has to be provided by the party to convince the Court⁴⁸ or more specifically, the quantum of proof that has to be shown in order to ‘[...] discharge the burden of proof when that burden rests upon [that party]’.⁴⁹ Looking at the rare amount of cases where the ICJ has touched upon the question of evidentiary standards, it becomes evident that there is not a single standard for all disputes arising before it.⁵⁰ In cases concerning state responsibility,⁵¹ the actual standard of proof in a given case is determined by the substantive nature of the obligation, which was breached and is claimed by a party.⁵² ⁴⁴.

Accordingly, Judge Greenwood pointed out that if cases exist where a state claims charges of exceptional gravity against another state, there have to be cases where a party claims less serious breaches and in those disputes, a lower standard of proof would be appropriate.⁵⁷ While the Bosnian Genocide case clearly shows that the ICJ requires a higher degree of certainty for serious charges, it is more difficult to perceive the exact difference between – in what seems like – a variety of evidentiary standards mentioned in the Court’s other case law. This is exemplified by the Court’s approach to use terms such as ‘convincing/convinced’,⁵⁸ ‘conclusive’,⁵⁹ ‘sufficient’⁶⁰ and ‘insufficient/not sufficient evidence’⁶¹ rather confusable so far instead of explaining which ⁵³.

To establish international responsibility, one must have clear and indisputable facts.’⁶⁵ In the authors’ opinion, this seems plausible. The application of a balance of probabilities standard essentially means that the truthfulness of an allegation has to be ‘more probable than not’⁶⁶ compared to the evidence submitted by the alleged perpetrator. This, however, cannot suffice to establish international responsibility convincingly. Such a low standard might very easily lead to a false attribution of internationally wrongful acts, which ultimately were not committed by the state, although it might indeed seem this way.⁶⁷ Accordingly, it is important to highlight that the Court itself never used a balance of probabilities standard with regard to a state responsibility case.\nThe *Corfu Channel* case also indicates that proof beyond reasonable doubt, a standard applied in national and international cases concerning the criminal responsibility of individuals,⁶⁸ is not an appropriate standard before ⁶². Benzing (n 39) 1265; see also *Oil Platforms* (n 50) 270, Separate Opinion of Judge Buergenthal, para 41: ‘One might ask, moreover, where the test of “insufficient” evidence comes from … and by reference to what standards the Court applies it? What is meant by “insufficient” evidence? Does the evidence have to be “convincing”, “preponderant”, “overwhelming” or “beyond a reasonable doubt” to be sufficient? The Court never spells out what the here relevant standard of proof is.’; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 129–30.\n⁶³. See *Corfu Channel* (n 25) 14, 16, 17, 18; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 126–27.\n⁶⁴. The preponderance of evidence standard is also known as balance of probabilities. “Preponderance of evidence” generally means that there is evidence greater in weight in comparison with the evidence adduced by the other party on the basis of reasonable probability rather than possibility.’ See Amerasinghe (n 25) 242.\n⁶⁵. *Corfu Channel* (n 25) 68, Dissenting Opinion of Judge Krylov, 72; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 133.\n⁶⁶.

For further details, see at n 88.\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) the ICJ, even if charges against a state are of exceptional gravity.⁶⁹ However, where such a grave breach is alleged, the Court does require a relatively high degree of certainty, namely fully conclusive evidence. Consequently, in Corfu Channel, the Court has not found that the UK met this high standard when claiming that the minefield was laid with the connivance of Albania.⁷⁰ This finding was later confirmed in Bosnian Genocide, where the Court equally refrained from applying the proof beyond reasonable doubt standard.⁷¹ However, the foregoing only applies to claims for which direct proof is available.⁷² Where mere circumstantial evidence is submitted by a party, the ICJ did require that proof must leave no room for reasonable doubt.⁷³ Again, the ICJ determined the exact parameters in Corfu Channel, when it noted with regards to the claim brought forward by the UK that Albania knew about the minefield in its territorial waters: [...] the fact of this exclusive territorial control exercised by a State within its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the knowledge of that State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. [...] The proof may be drawn from inferences of fact, provided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt.⁷⁴ Essentially, the ICJ held on the basis of circumstantial evidence – meaning facts which considered together lead ‘logically to a single conclusion’ – that ⁶⁹. Corfu Channel (n 25) 17; Benzing (n 39) 1265; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 134–36; see also Amerasinghe (n 25) 235, who pointed out that the proof beyond reasonable doubt standard is too severe to be applied to non-criminal cases. One reason for this might be the fact that inter-state disputes are not criminal cases and in their very nature resemble civil cases, where parties stand on an equal footing. Cf Roscini (n 6) 227.\n⁷⁰. This was the second alternative argument of the UK Government. See Corfu Channel (n 25) 16–17. See also reference to Corfu Channel in Bosnian Genocide (n 50) para 209.\n⁷¹. See Bosnian Genocide (n 50) para 209; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 135. At one point, however, the Court did apply a standard of proof close to the standard beyond reasonable doubt, when it required proof beyond any doubt in respect of the allegation that there was aid and assistance between the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and VRS leaders, who carried out the acts of genocide. See Bosnian Genocide (n 50) para 422; Teitelbaum (n 39) 128.\n⁷². Quintana (n 47) 407.\n⁷³. Corfu Channel (n 25) 18. For a definition on circumstantial evidence, see at n 26.\n⁷⁴. Corfu Channel (n 25) 18. Note that ‘[...] inferences are a tool of judicial reasoning employed to aid a court in determining whether the burden of proof has been met in cases where direct proof is not available on a particular fact.’; Riddell and Plant (n 39) 113.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack Albania must have known about the mines in the Corfu Channel.75 Where the Court allows recourse to indirect evidence, this only being the case where direct evidence is under the exclusive territorial control of the other party and circumstantial evidence does not ‘contradict’ any existing direct proof,76 the standard will be elevated to proof beyond reasonable doubt.77 In two other cases, *Oil Platforms* and *Armed Activities*, where the violation of the prohibition of the use of force was claimed respectively, the ICJ applied a clear and convincing standard.78 Additionally, the Court also mentioned several times that the submitted evidence was either sufficient79 or insufficient.80 In Nicaragua, the Court merely noted that there was insufficient evidence to prove ‘various points’ but abstained from establishing a certain standard of proof, which needed to be met by the parties.81 It is not clear, however, how the evidentiary standards mentioned by the ICJ in those cases exactly differ from each other and how, in the end, they are decisive for the Court in the determination of the amount of proof the party has to provide in order to discharge its burden.82 Consequently, commentators have tried to highlight the differences between those standards by, inter alia, referring to their ordinary meaning as referred to in the Oxford English Dictionary.83 In doing so, they established a hierarchy between the terms conclusive, convincing and sufficient, with conclusive being the highest of the three standards.84 What is more, the lack of precise definitions for the different evidentiary standards, and especially the reluctance of international courts from discussing the standards they use85 Finnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) may also be ascribed to the influence of the civil/continental law – as opposed to common law – tradition on inter-state dispute settlement.⁸⁶ In the civil law system, judges determine the probative value of submitted evidence in both civil, and criminal law cases based on their internal conviction and are thus not required to apply a specific standard.⁸⁷ In common law jurisdictions, however, judges generally apply the preponderance of evidence or reasonable degree of probability standard with regard to civil law cases, whereas in criminal law cases, a higher standard, namely proof beyond reasonable doubt, has to be met.⁸⁸ Above all, many difficulties when determining evidentiary standards arise due to the simple fact that the evaluation of evidence is a subjective matter – ultimately leading to contradictions between judges on what kind of evidence suffices to be convincing to discharge the burden.⁸⁹ However, it would still be important to know for parties what the ICJ itself exactly means by conclusive, convincing and sufficient evidence.⁹⁰ What is more, the parties appearing before the Court should, already during the proceedings, have at least some clue as to which evidentiary standard will be applied to the case and not be taken by surprise by the Court's final judgment.⁹¹ Particularly in Bosnian Genocide, however, the Court already went a step further by giving more detailed answers than in previous cases and hopefully will continue to develop the case law more consistently with regard to the question of evidentiary standards.⁹² In conclusion, legal scholars have identified three types of state responsibility cases before the ICJ when it comes to determining the relevant standard of proof.⁹³ First, in regular cases, the ICJ demands proof at a high level of certainty appropriate to the seriousness of the allegation.⁹⁴ The amount of ⁸⁶. Kazazi (n 39) 325; Roscini (n 6) 227; see also Riddell and Plant (n 39) 123: 'It appears however that the Court prefers not to provide a definitive standard, most probably because the Judges from the different legal traditions cannot agree.'\n⁸⁷.

Quintana (n 47) 408; cf Riddell and Plant (n 39) 132.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack certainty the Court generally requires in those cases seems to be clear and convincing evidence by parties.⁹⁵ Second, the Court requires a higher standard of proof/higher degree of certainty for cases where charges of exceptional gravity are claimed by a party against another state.⁹⁶ Here, the Court needs to be fully convinced that a state has actually committed the breach of an obligation.⁹⁷ In other words, the graver the charge, the more confidence there must be on the truthfulness of the claim.⁹⁸ Third, where states are only able to provide circumstantial evidence, this being the case where direct evidence is absent and the Court draws inferences from facts, it ultimately requires the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt.⁹⁹ The ICJ’s case law so far clearly shows that it adopts the relevant standard of proof on a case-by-case basis, appropriate to the circumstances and seriousness of the allegation.¹⁰⁰ The next step in this contribution is, therefore, to examine which internationally wrongful act states may want to attribute to other states before the ICJ, as far as cyber-attacks are concerned. This makes it then possible to explore the level of seriousness of the alleged breach in order to determine the evidentiary standard which has to be met by the parties in the dispute.\n## 4. Cyber-Attacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts Cyber-attacks may vary greatly in scale and form. However, only when these ‘hostile uses of cyberspace’¹⁰¹ amount to a violation of international law, the question of international adjudication arises.¹⁰² In the authors’ opinion, the international obligations most relevant for a cyber-attack to constitute an internationally wrongful act are those that most severely infringe a state’s sovereignty. Thus, the prohibition of the threat or use of force and the principle of non-intervention and their applicability to cyber operations are of special interest. Based on these two principles, the question of how to attribute these ⁹⁵. Teitelbaum (n 39) 125–26; Roscini (n 6) 228.\n⁹⁶. Quintana (n 47) 408; cf Riddell and Plant (n 39) 132–36.\n⁹⁷.

More specifically, when they occur ‘in the “international relations” of member states’ and do not merely constitute a private act without a state’s involvement, Dinniss (n 1) 40.\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) 'attacks' to a state will be examined and the necessary standard of proof to be applied in those cases will be determined. It is also important to note that the term cyber-'attack', being a non-legal term, is not to be equated to the term 'armed attack', triggering the right of self-defence under Article 51 UN Charter.¹⁰³ ## 4.1. The Threat or Use of Force Due to its severity, the first international obligation to be discussed here is the prohibition of the threat or use of force, enshrined in Article 2(4) UN Charter.¹⁰⁴ This prohibition is considered to be a norm of customary international law¹⁰⁵ and the overall consensus is that it is also applicable to cyber operations.¹⁰⁶ This is in line with the ICJ's Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion, where it noted that the prohibition to use force applies 'regardless of the weapons employed'.¹⁰⁷ It is more the effect of a weapon upon which a breach of Article 2(4) is determined.¹⁰⁸ Traditionally, only physical damage to property, loss of life or injury of persons were thought to meet this requirement.¹⁰⁹ Moreover, a state would need to prove that the cyber-attack has caused a severe effect, meaning that 'its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force'.¹¹⁰ Given the virtual (rather than physical) nature of cyber-attacks, this seems to be ¹⁰³. Article 51 UN Charter, 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS 16: 'Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.'\n¹⁰⁴. Article 2(4) UN Charter: 'Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.'\n¹⁰⁵.

Schmitt (ed) (n 101) Rule 11, 45.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack the most difficult part.¹¹¹ To give an example of such severity, the Stuxnet virus launched at the Iranian Natanz nuclear plant, supposedly leading to the physical damage of the plant's centrifuges could be considered, if proven, to be of such gravity that it would constitute a use of force.¹¹² Another attack worth mentioning in this regard is the recent NotPetya operation at the end of June this year. It was initially thought to be a ransomware attack,¹¹³ but then later qualified as being more than that, as the generation of revenue did not seem to be the primary goal of its operation.¹¹⁴ It also led to chaos on a large scale, with Ukraine seeming to be the main target.¹¹⁵ Despite the fact that physical damage did not occur, the NotPetya operation may nevertheless open up the discussion as to whether non-destructive cyber operations, which still massively disrupt the apparatus of the state, might be considered a violation of Article 2(4) in the future.¹¹⁶ To conclude, there seems to be a relatively high threshold of invoking the violation of Article 2(4), since the damage must be so severe it can be equated to a use of force in the traditional sense. Thus, in the case of less than forceful cyber-attacks or general lack of evidence, a state might have more success in claiming that the cyber intrusion constituted an unlawful intervention.¹¹⁷ ¹¹¹. On a side note, as the ICJ held in Nicaragua, the 'most grave forms' of the use of force amount to an 'armed attack', which would trigger the right of self-defence under Article 51 UN Charter, see Nicaragua (Merits) (n 41) para 191; Thus, by acknowledging that Article 51 UN Charter is also applicable in the cyber context, a cyber-attack of the 'most grave form' must also be one that enables the victim state to defend itself effectively.\n¹¹².

Non-Intervention The principle of non-intervention derived out of the principle of the sovereign equality of states, which is enshrined in Article 2(1) UN Charter.¹¹⁸ It also reflects customary international law.¹¹⁹ It is widely seen to be equally applicable to cyber-attacks.¹²⁰ According to the ICJ, a state’s coercive interference in another state’s internal affairs constitutes an unlawful intervention.¹²¹ The Court noted in the Nicaragua judgment, that the requirement of coercion is fulfilled, when a state is deprived of its free ‘choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy’.¹²² The most obvious form of such coercion, according to the ICJ, is an intervention that uses force.¹²³ Being a much broader obligation than the prohibition of threat or use of force, it thus prohibits both forceful and less than forceful operations.¹²⁴ Having determined previously that severe damage is needed to establish a use of force, less than forceful – but still coercive – cyber operations might thus still be unlawful. To give an example, the cyber-attack against Estonia in 2007 (if it is assumed that it was conducted by Russia) could be seen as an unlawful intervention in Estonia’s affairs, as it was a coercive attempt to influence Estonia not to relocate the Second World War memorial.¹²⁵ More recently, the hack and release of a vast amount of internal emails of the US Democratic National Committee to WikiLeaks right before the US elections has sparked widespread media attention. It primarily led to the increased negative portrayal of candidate Clinton in the media and is widely believed to have been conducted by the Russian Government in order to help candidate Trump win the presidency.¹²⁶ Another consequential hack was the attack against President Macron’s election campaign, which led to the ¹¹⁸.

Attribution Eventually, for state responsibility to arise, the wrongful conduct must be attributable to a state. The ILC Articles on State Responsibility set out in Articles 4 to 11 the different activities by individuals which are attributable to a state. These include first and foremost the conduct of de jure and de facto state organs as well as persons/entities ‘exercising elements of governmental authority’.¹³² Particular notice shall be made to private hackers, whose expertise might be used by states to conduct a cyber-attack. Two provisions of the ILC Articles might be of relevance in this regard. First, the ICJ noted in Bosnian Genocide that Article 4 ILC Articles might enable the attribution of acts of private individuals that are not formally recognised as state organs to the state, if they are ‘in a relationship of complete dependence on the State’.¹³³ ¹²⁷.

Bosnian Genocide (n 50) para 391.\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) Proving a complete dependence, however, might be very difficult. Thus, according to Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility,¹³⁴ the conduct of private individuals may still be attributable to a state if they are either acting under the instructions of that state or under their direction or control.¹³⁵ In the Nicaragua judgment, the ICJ determined the degree of control to be one of effective control ‘in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred’.¹³⁶ The ICTY’s Appeals Chamber argued in Tadić that its ‘overall control’ test, which was a test to establish the internationality of a conflict, would be equally applicable to questions of state responsibility.¹³⁷ This, however, was rejected by the ICJ in Bosnian Genocide, which considered the test to be too broad to apply it to the context of Article 8 and upheld its reasoning from Nicaragua.¹³⁸ This stricter test, however, poses another difficulty for an injured state, since proving effective control is a much higher threshold than claiming overall control of a state over the activities of a non-state actor.¹³⁹ Therefore, in order to attribute an act to a state, the ‘victim’ state would need to prove that the cyber-attack was launched from a device that belonged to someone who was either completely dependent on that state or his/her activities were somehow conducted under effective control of that state.\nSetting aside this high threshold of proving an individual’s affiliation with the state, the attribution to a specific territory itself proves already extremely difficult. To start with, one may have to identify the exact location of the device. In the simplest cases, this could be achieved by tracing back the IP address from which the attack was launched.¹⁴⁰ Thus, if the IP address reveals a government-owned facility, the device can be identified as a government computer and thus, state responsibility may arise.¹⁴¹ However, as explained in section 2 in more detail, there are many ways to obscure the identity of the actual perpetrator, eg through IP spoofing, or computer hijacking. Moreover, the Tallinn Manual notes that ‘the fact that a cyber operation has been routed via the cyber infrastructure located in a State’ does not constitute ‘sufficient evidence’ that the cyber activity is attributable to ¹³⁴.

Ibid.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack 95 that state.¹⁴² And, even if an attack could be traced back to a specific governmental computer infrastructure, this is only an *indication* which government was behind the attack.¹⁴³ Thus, attribution in the context of cyberspace proves extremely difficult.\n## 4.4. Proving a State’s Breach of the Prohibition of Non-Intervention and Article 2(4) Having demonstrated the various hurdles of applying the principle of non-intervention and Article 2(4) to the cyber context, the question now remains whether the current regime of proving a state’s breach of these principles remains applicable. For the purpose of this article, it is assumed that the material elements of a breach (such as coercion or severe damage) are sufficiently proven. Of particular interest is the question of proving the *attribution* of the attack to a state. For that as well, however, two main elements of proof need to be considered: the burden and the standard of proof.\n## 4.4.1. Burden of Proof It is important to note that the formal status of the parties in the proceedings, whether applicant or respondent, has no bearing on the allocation of the burden.¹⁴⁴ When asserting which party carries the burden of proof, the Court generally applies the *onus probandi incumbit actori* principle: It is the party asserting a fact that is responsible for providing the Court with proof thereof.¹⁴⁵ The allocation of the burden of proof is of fundamental importance since there can only be a decision in favour of a party that has to prove a certain fact when it has successfully discharged the burden.¹⁴⁶ Thus, if a state wants to successfully claim reparations for a state’s violations of the threat or use of force and non-intervention principle, it is up to the victim state to collect enough evidence to discharge the burden. The *onus probandi* rule, however, is not an absolute one, the determination of the burden of proof is in reality dependent on the subject-matter and nature of each dispute brought before the Court; it varies according to ¹⁴².

Even if a state could successfully trace back IP addresses to another government's computer infrastructures, it would not have access to these computers in the same way as the perpetrator state. While some argue for the general notion that states need to act in good faith when participating in a judicial procedure,¹⁴⁸ with regard to the wording of Article 49 of the Court's Statute ('formal note shall be taken of any refusal'), this provision for the production of evidence does not seem to imply a binding legal obligation for states to comply with Article 49 requests.¹⁴⁹ While the Court might be allowed to draw adverse inferences from not complying with such a request (even though it has been reluctant to do so in the past), this does not mean it could compel a party to produce evidence.¹⁵⁰ It can therefore be assumed that an argument for the non-binding nature of Article 49 requests stands on stronger footing.\n## 4.4.2. Standard of Proof Due to the technical difficulty of attributing a cyber-attack, it might be argued that different standards of proof shall apply for the attribution on the one hand and claiming the substantive violation on the other. For attribution, certain scholars refer to the Yeager arbitration.¹⁵¹ There, the Iran-US Claims ¹⁴⁷. Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v Democratic Republic of the Congo), ICJ Reports (2010) 639, para 54; Quintana (n 47) 393.

See however Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Salvador v Honduras; Nicaragua intervening), ICJ Reports (1992) 351, para 63, where the Court stated that it 'cannot however apply a presumption that evidence which is unavailable would, if produced, have supported a particular party's case; still less a presumption of the existence of evidence which has not been produced'. Riddell and Plant (n 39) 116.\n¹⁵¹. See, eg Schmitt and Vihul (n 5) 65–66.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack Tribunal noted that the attribution of a wrongful conduct to a state must be proven with reasonable certainty.¹⁵² However, the ICJ noted in *Bosnian Genocide* that the same standard of proof applies to both the violation of the substantive rule as well as the attribution for such acts.¹⁵³ In other words, rather than separating attribution and violation, both of them require the same standard of proof. Thus, since the standard of proof varies with the violation, the standard of reasonable certainty does not apply to all cases.\nIn *Armed Activities* and *Oil Platforms*, the ICJ set the threshold of alleging an unlawful use of force to clear and convincing evidence.¹⁵⁴ As noted in section 3, the Court demands the higher standard of fully conclusive evidence only in charges of exceptional gravity. This suggests that the violation of Article 2(4) is not considered to be of such grave nature, which – given that a non-forceful intervention is considered less harmful, must hold true for the principle of non-intervention as well. Consequently, the clear and convincing standard would most likely equally apply to prove an intervention.\nHowever, especially when alleging a cyber-attack that violated the prohibition of use of force or non-intervention, direct proof will often be missing and thus the only type of evidence the parties may be able to offer is circumstantial evidence.¹⁵⁵ In that case, as we have seen before, the proof provided ‘must leave no room for reasonable doubt’.¹⁵⁶ However, with current techniques, it is almost impossible to attribute an attack to a state beyond reasonable doubt, especially without giving away specific know-how that might be too delicate to share with the rest of the world.¹⁵⁷ Therefore, without lowering the standard to give credit to the special circumstances of cyber-attacks, it will be almost impossible for states to prove the affiliation of a state to the attack. See section 5.2 on this issue.\n# 5. Possible Means to Address the Evidentiary Dilemma in Cyberspace Cyber-attacks might to some extent be considered textbook examples of a scenario where one party has exclusive control over the evidence required and where direct proof is often not available.¹⁵⁸ Section 5.1 thus seeks to ¹⁵².

Next, the question whether the ICJ might depart from its strict approach concerning circumstantial evidence will be addressed in section 5.2.¹⁵⁹ For both questions, opinions of different legal scholars will be analysed. Finally, as a new way forward to resolve some of the evidentiary issues in the cyber context, the present authors suggest that – as an alternative solution – the Court should make more use of its inherent powers regarding the production of evidence (section 5.3).\n## 5.1. Reversing the Burden of Proof As attribution poses one of the biggest problems in the cyber context, some authors have called for a reversal of the burden of proof, even though the reasons for arriving at this conclusion are very different. One of them makes a case for not applying the ICJ’s findings in *Corfu Channel*, arguing that by their very nature computers are different to sea-mines.¹⁶⁰ Therefore, the same standards cannot be applied in the cyber context; hence a reversal of the burden of proof is appropriate.¹⁶¹ For authors dealing with problems like identification or attribution, fairness and efficiency seem to be their focal point for arguing for a reversal of the burden, assuming that the party whose territory the attack has emanated from, has superior access to information.¹⁶² Consequently, the onus should be on the country where the attack had been launched from (allegedly).¹⁶³ Proponents of this approach also put forward that, with a reversal of the burden, states would take their due diligence obligations of preventing cyber-attacks more seriously.¹⁶⁴ This is closely linked to the claim that the precautionary principle originating from environmental law can be applied to cyberspace, which then automatically shifts the burden of proof.¹⁶⁵ While the application of the precautionary principle might well ¹⁵⁹.

When looking at the ICJ’s case law, ever since its first decision, the Court has not been inclined to shift the burden, even when evidence was exclusively located in the territory of one state.¹⁶⁸ This finding in *Corfu Channel* has so far not been overruled in any way.¹⁶⁹ What is more, the Court reaffirmed its findings in the *Nicaragua* case, acknowledging that even in times of ongoing armed conflicts (as was the case in *eg Georgia* in 2008), where evidence might be hard to come by, this might affect the standard of proof, not however the burden.¹⁷⁰ Even Judge Owada’s Separate Opinion to the *Oil Platforms* case dealt with difficulties arising from evidentiary imbalances between the applicant and the respondent in a self-defence scenario, as it was the US’s duty to establish that Iran had launched an armed attack against them, against which they defended themselves. While not wholeheartedly content with the situation, he stated that: Nevertheless, there is no denying the fact that there undoubtedly exists an asymmetry in the situation surrounding the case [...]. I am prepared to accept that this asymmetry is inherent in the circumstances of the present case and there is little the Court can do under the circumstances. It is primarily the task incumbent upon the party which claims certain facts as the basis of its contention to establish them by producing sufficient evidence in accordance with the principle *actori incumbit onus probandi*.¹⁷¹ In light of the discussion above, it can be therefore concluded that it is highly unlikely that the ICJ would shift the burden of proof in the cyber context, not only because of the established case law but also because of certain --- ¹⁶⁶.

Cyber operations are often routed through numerous countries,¹⁷² thus a reversal could place the burden of proof on a wholly uninvolved party.¹⁷³ It is, however, important to note that the Court has always been concerned with a level playing field for the parties, which could not be facilitated by a reversal of the burden. What may however be considered, might be lowering the evidentiary standard to facilitate the discharge of the burden.¹⁷⁴ ## 5.2. Lowering the Evidentiary Standard – The Indirect Evidence Dilemma As was already explained above, the ICJ seems to have a case-to-case approach for the evidentiary standard to be applied. This makes it incredibly difficult for the parties to assess how much evidence is needed to successfully discharge the burden. However, there are certain signpost judgments shining light on an expected standard to be met (such as Armed Activities or Oil Platforms in the case of claiming use of force).¹⁷⁵ As was already mentioned in section 4.4.b), it only seems logical to assume that the party alleging such violations in the form of a cyber-attack would need to meet the same clear and convincing evidentiary standard.¹⁷⁶ Some authors regard this standard as still too high, deeming it as too strict and advocating for the lower balance of probabilities standard.¹⁷⁷ However, looking at the ICJ’s previous case law, it is very unlikely that the Court would apply a lower standard than clear and convincing. In fact, as noted above, the ICJ might even set the standard to proof beyond reasonable doubt, since direct proof will often be missing.¹⁷⁸ This, however, would set Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack the standard for cyber-attacks incredibly high. On the other hand, it would do away with concerns that a lower evidentiary standard would make it easier to blame a state for conduct it had nothing to do with. Protecting the respondent from false attribution, be it through IP spoofing, botnets or onion routing,¹⁷⁹ is an argument that should not be left out of the debate concerning a lower evidentiary standard.¹⁸⁰ However, applying a beyond reasonable doubt standard in the cyber context might also be too far reaching: With regard to cyber-attacks, collecting evidence will always remain extremely hard and it would be (at least at the moment) impossible to collect information that reaches a higher level than clear and convincing.¹⁸¹ The victim state would be left with the impossible task to meet a standard which is ‘unreachable’, which could potentially result in perpetrator states evading their responsibility under international law. As Judge Owada held in his Separate Opinion to *Oil Platforms*: As a court of justice whose primary function is the proper administration of justice, should see to it that this problem relating to evidence be dealt with in such a way that utmost justice is brought to bear on the final finding of the Court [...] It would seem to me that the only way to achieve this would have been for the Court to take a more proactive stance on the issue of evidence and that of fact-finding in the present case. This brings me to the standard of proof to be required for discharging the burden of proof in a case where the party who carries the burden of proof, though responsible for discharging that burden, finds itself in an extremely difficult situation as seen from an objective point of view.¹⁸² These opinions, however, clearly show that the ICJ itself would not be interested in applying a standard that would be impossible to meet for the parties involved and that the paramount principle underlying the ICJ’s assessment of evidence is the proper administration of justice.¹⁸³ Such is unlikely when the Court would require parties to prove their allegations beyond reasonable doubt, even when direct proof is not available.\n--- ¹⁷⁹.

Hugh Thirlway, *The Law and Procedure of the International Court of Justice* (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2013) 10; Amerasinghe (n 25) 13–18.\nFinnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) This leaves us with the still relatively high clear and convincing standard that effectively protects states from false attribution, while at the same time making it possible to discharge the burden of proof successfully.¹⁸⁴ However, it is nevertheless unrealistic to assume that states themselves are able to collect sufficient evidence in order to meet the clear and convincing standard without the Court's involvement. This, particularly due to the fact that evidence is often located in the exclusive territory of the alleged perpetrator and obtaining said evidence one-sidedly would constitute a violation of that state's sovereignty.¹⁸⁵ The present authors therefore suggest combining the clear and convincing standard with a more enhanced use of the Court's inherent fact-finding powers. This new approach will be discussed below.\n## 5.3. The Court’s Powers for the Production of Evidence As discussed above, the present authors propose that the clear and convincing standard would be the best way to aptly deal with the evidentiary difficulties relating to cyber-attacks. Authors such as Roscini and Schmitt have already illustrated quite convincingly why this standard, being still significantly high, would be appropriate.¹⁸⁶ However, little has been said so far on how exactly the Court could be furnished with evidence that would satisfy the demands of a clear and convincing standard. Therefore, this section seeks to shine light on how to overcome certain evidentiary hurdles through the Court's more active usage of its powers to produce evidence. More specifically, it will do so by focusing on the evidentiary power that might become indispensable in these highly scientific and technical matters: the use of court-appointed experts. Before analysing those in detail, however, this section will start with a more general overview on ways to collect evidence in an ICJ proceeding.\nFirst, in theory, the Court has the inherent power to request additional documents, call its own witnesses, appoint own experts, or make on site visits. This has rarely happened in the past, as the Court has always been of the opinion that parties to the dispute should first and foremost furnish the Court with evidence themselves.¹⁸⁷ However, the extremely cautious approach as an intermediary not making use of its powers has been widely criticised.¹⁸⁸ --- ¹⁸⁴. Roscini (n 6) 230–31; Michael N Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and the Jus ad Bellum Revisited’ (2011) 56 Villanova Law Review 569, 595.\n¹⁸⁵. See the Court’s decision in Corfu Channel (n 25) 34–35 with regard to the UK’s unlawful collection of evidence through ‘Operation Retail’.\n¹⁸⁶. See section 5.2 on this issue.\n¹⁸⁷. Benzing (n 39) 1266; Tams (n 149) 1282–83.\n¹⁸⁸. Regarding the power of the Court to call experts, see, eg, Benzing (n 39) 1256–57.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack For example, in Bosnian Genocide, the Court did not grant an evidentiary request by Bosnia (as according to the Court, they already had extensive evidence in their possession) but then ultimately found that it had not successfully discharged its burden.¹⁸⁹ The backlash created by this finding might open up the road to a more proactive stance in the future, particularly in the cyber context.\nSecond, the parties can appoint experts according to Articles 57 and 64 Rules of the Court.¹⁹⁰ It happened before that scientific experts appeared as counsel for one of the parties, which, however, due to not having been appointed as experts according to the ICJ’s Statute, barred the other party to the proceeding from cross-examining this counsel.¹⁹¹ The Court criticised this approach in *Pulp Mills* of having limited value.¹⁹² This critique seems to have been successful, as in recent cases, such as *Whaling*, the parties appointed experts according to the Rules, that could be cross-examined by both the Court and other parties.¹⁹³ Lastly, the Court may appoint experts itself. Pursuant to Article 50 of the Statute, ‘[t]he Court may, at any time, entrust any individual, body, bureau, commission, or other organization that it may select, with the task of carrying out an enquiry or giving an expert opinion’.¹⁹⁴ The advantages of using court-appointed experts are manifold, aside from the fact that a potential bias plays less of a role as opposed to party-appointed experts.¹⁹⁵ Therefore, the present authors argue that making better usage of the Court’s own powers to appoint experts under Article 50 would help resolve attribution issues in the cyber context.\n¹⁸⁹.

Only in the Chorzow Factory case in front of the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ), as well as the Corfu Channel and the Gulf of Maine case in front of the ICJ, experts have been appointed under this procedure.¹⁹⁸ This reluctance has been widely criticised not only by doctrine¹⁹⁹ but also within the Court.²⁰⁰ One explanation for the neglect of Article 50 might be the fact that court-appointed experts almost exclusively appear in civil law jurisdictions and that to jurists from common law backgrounds, this appointment might seem like an undue interference, especially with regard to the burden of proof of the parties.²⁰¹ It has also been the Court's contention that the use of experts was just not necessary, as the parties involved in the proceedings seldom disagreed on matters of fact but rather on matters of law.²⁰² This, however, Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack is an outdated notion, as proceedings seem to gradually focus more on scientific and technical questions and the Court is increasingly involved in extensive fact-finding.²⁰³ Consequently, particularly due to the specific technical and scientific knowledge required in cyber-related proceedings, judges will not be able to obtain such expertise easily by themselves and reliance on party-appointed experts will likely not yield a satisfactory outcome due to the uncertainty resulting out of their potential bias.\nAnother argument in favour of court-appointed experts is that particularly in the cyber context, one party may have superior access to information, or might even be the only one able to access specific documents.²⁰⁴ Also, it is hard to imagine that the decision in a proceeding involving cyber-attacks would not to a large part hinge on the establishment of factual circumstances, as traces can be erased so easily, computers hijacked and so forth. Gaining that kind of knowledge through court-appointed experts seems to be one of the best ways to establish those facts.²⁰⁵ Legal scholar Roscini proposes that the ICJ should use the fact-finding powers mentioned above to counterbalance evidentiary difficulties in cases where an exceptionally high standard has to be met (such as for example 'fully conclusive' in the case of genocide).²⁰⁶ However, the present authors argue that – in the cyber context – not even a more proactive stance on fact-finding could produce evidence that meets the requirements of a fully conclusive or beyond reasonable doubt standard. These evidentiary difficulties in the cyber context become clear when comparing a typical cyber scenario to a state responsibility case, where the Court made use of its fact-finding powers. In Corfu Channel, the Court concluded that the exceptionally high standard of beyond reasonable doubt to decide on Albania's international responsibility was met due to the tests run by court-appointed experts. It might thus be possible for experts to arrive at a single logical conclusion on whether an Albanian coastguard would have been able to see a ship passing through in the dark.²⁰⁷ This, however, cannot be said for experts having to determine whether an attack, which was routed through multiple countries, was caused Finnish Yearbook of International Law (Vol. 25, 2014–2015) by a specific state. Not even the biggest team of experts could furnish the Court with evidence that simply does not exist. This is why the present authors propose that the best way to overcome evidentiary problems in the cyber context would be a more active use of the Court's fact-finding powers to reach the lower, but still satisfying clear and convincing standard. The fact that the Court has recently appointed experts in the Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean case between Costa Rica and Nicaragua – the first appointment in over 30 years – might be an indicator that the Court is about to change its reluctant stance on Article 50.²⁰⁸ ## 6. Conclusion It is probably only a matter of time until a state lodges an application before the ICJ, claiming that it suffered damage arising out of a cyber-attack. It is almost certain that the Court will then be faced with several new questions, starting with whether a specific cyber-attack amounts to a violation of international law, to whether the current regime of evidentiary standards employed by the Court so far gives credit to the specific technical difficulties of proving cyber-attacks. As demonstrated by Estonia and Georgia, this contribution displayed the severe evidentiary troubles victim states have faced so far when trying to prove a state's involvement and thus, arguably, a reluctance to address international tribunals in this matter.\nFirst, the present authors started with analysing the current evidentiary regime of the Court to shine light on this delicate topic. It became clear that when dealing with state responsibility, the Court has applied three different standards. These vary according to the seriousness of the claim. Thus, for charges of exceptional gravity, for example, it found that it must be convinced by fully conclusive evidence.\nTherefore, there must be a breach of an international obligation first, in order to assess what standard of proof the Court will most likely apply in the cyber context. Consequently, the present authors analysed two principles of international law that are most probable to be violated in the case of a cyber-attack against a state: the prohibition of the threat or use of force and the non-intervention principle: two principles, that by their very nature want to protect a state's territorial integrity.\n²⁰⁸. Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean (Costa Rica v Nicaragua), ICJ Order (31 May 2016); see Order of 16 June 2016; Gaja (n 195) 416–17.\nProving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack Although the Court already held that it will require clear and convincing evidence when a breach of Article 2(4) – and most likely also an unlawful intervention – is claimed, this only applies when direct proof is available. Nowadays, where technical difficulties hinder states to gather evidence linking a state directly to a cyber-attack, only indirect evidence can be submitted. In such a case, however, the Court established that it will require proof beyond reasonable doubt to let international responsibility arise. It is very likely that the ICJ will face various problems with this standard. Above all, a victim state would be left having to prove beyond reasonable doubt that a state is the originator of an attack. This is something that is obviously impossible with our current technical expertise.\nThus, scholars have proposed to shift the burden of proof to the perpetrator state, which now has to prove that it had not been involved in a cyberattack. This seems to be an unsatisfying solution: Not only did the Court itself refuse such an approach in the past; a shift would also put too much responsibility on the respondent state. Therefore, a more plausible approach would be to lower the evidentiary standard to clear and convincing, even in cases where direct proof is missing. Additionally, the present authors have pointed out how the inability of the parties to produce sufficient evidence can be overcome through the usage of the Court's power to appoint experts. This makes it possible to meet the clear and convincing standard and thus establish international responsibility.\nTo conclude, the relevant case law so far suggests that the Court will remain flexible in its application of evidentiary standards. It will be seen whether it may be open to lowering the standard in cases of exceptional difficulty. In this way, it could ensure that in each individual case, the appropriate standard to enable attribution is applied, but still protects states from wrongful conviction.\n^{}[]"

    "abstract": "In 2017, the Internet dominates a large part of the worldwide population. Despite its vast benefits, however, it has also been used to cause severe damage to states. Hostile cyber activities seem to have occurred more frequently over the past years. It is already recognised that international law – thus also the law on state responsibility – is applicable to cyber-related issues. However, particularly in the context of inter-state relations, the question of how states are able to seek reparation in front of the International Court of Justice for damage caused by a cyber-attack conducted by a state remains open to debate. This is primarily due to the fact that the cyber sphere enjoys a considerable amount of anonymity, which makes it hard to establish the main perpetrator behind an act. Therefore, calls have been made to shift the burden of proof or to lower the evidentiary standard required by the Court. In this article, the present authors will assess the relevant case law of the Court and apply it to two scenarios: a cyber-attack violating the prohibition of use of force and the non-intervention principle. The aim is to display the Court's line of reasoning and assess whether the scholarly demands to ease evidentiary issues, by shifting the burden or lowering the standard of proof, are justified or not. Additionally, the present authors will address a yet in the cyber-context unexplored, but nevertheless, important tool in collecting sufficient evidence: the power of the Court to appoint experts.",
