On the surface, states such as the US, Cuba and India argue that it was a disagreement over international law (Markoff 2017; Rodriguez 2017; Sukumar 2017). Yet, the iceberg underneath is a mix of great power politics, competing and occasionally clashing political systems, and continued uncertainty with respect to a new technology.\n\nOverall, states' approach to norms for cyberspace remains highly contested internationally among governments and fragmented domestically within governments. Cyber norms are still in their “constituting phase” (Wiener 2014). Agreed upon, explicitly stated norms are considered voluntary, defined vaguely, and internalized weakly (Farrell and Glaser 2017: 16). Implicit state practice is slowly emerging, yet poorly understood, and cloaked in secrecy. Nevertheless, the diplomatic activities over the past two decades have shaped significantly how governments think about cyber norms and how they behave accordingly (Nye 2018).\n\nTo understand the dynamics of the international cyber norms contestation, various lenses can be applied. In addition to signs of the security dilemma impacting states' behavior (Buchanan 2017), competing conceptual approaches and key terms explain this outcome. These include key concepts such as ‘norms' (Finnemore and Hollis 2016), ‘deterrence' (White House 2018a), even ‘information security' and ‘cyber security' (Maurer and Morgus 2014), with new concepts such as ‘persistent engagement' (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2018) complementing the mix. Each of them is associated with a specific bureaucratic agency advancing its own agenda. Even the behavior of individual actors is worth mentioning as the two key diplomats in the U.S. and Russia leading these negotiations have not changed in the last 20 years achieving unusual influence setting the agenda, strategies, and pace of the discussions since the process began.\n\nThis state of affairs raises several important questions: how do norms emerge for cyberspace? What has been the contribution of the UN process to the international community's understanding of norms for cyberspace? Why did the process collapse in 2017, the very same year that two of the biggest cyber attacks to date caused indiscriminate economic harm worldwide? And why did member states, in an unprecedented move in the UN's history, create two processes dedicated to the same issue in 2018? This article investigates these questions and presents a deep dive into what cyber norms are all about.\n\nThe analysis of the dynamic process of norm contestation in this area is divided into several sections. The first section focuses on how the competing and",

The second section presents a deep dive with five subparts ranging from the impact of existing norms on cyber norms to the emergence of norms, the diffusion and contestation thereof, including access to contestation, and the metacontestation over the UN process itself. The third section points to the impact of the cyber norms discussion on existing norms followed by the conclusion and some broader reflections.\n\n## 2 The Big Confusion: What Are (Cyber) Norms in the First Place?\n\nThere is severe confusion about cyber norms. It is not uncommon to encounter statements from diplomats implying that norms, per definition, are voluntary in nature and never legally binding—in contradiction to the decades-old academic literature of sociology and international relations theory.³ What is to blame for the confusion? Politics and the gap between academics and practitioners. Yet, this confusion also reflects an undercurrent of competing political systems that affects the terminology used in this area. It is therefore worth briefly unpacking what (cyber) norms are and how to define them given the implications for contestation.\n\nOne of the key points of confusion centers on the relationship between norms and laws. In academia, scholars debate whether legal norms enjoy a special status compared to norms generally.⁴ Finnemore argues they do not because “There are, after all, many kinds of norms in the world—social, cultural, professional, moral, religious, and familial” (Finnemore 1999: 701).⁵ Others argue that norms tied to law stand out because of the level of compliance given rise to concepts such as ‘soft law’ and ‘hard law’ (Abbott and Snidal 2000; see Jose (2018): 25). More recently, Finnemore and Hollis concluded that “Simply put, laws can serve as a basis for formulating norms, just as norms can be codified in law” (Finnemore and Hollis 2016: 442).\n\nIn international politics, the concept of ‘voluntary norms’ emerged as a political strategy developed by the U.S. Department of State in juxtaposition to Russia’s proposal for a legally binding arms control treaty on information security. Moscow approached Washington with this idea in the late 1990s which the U.S. government opposed for several reasons. One of the key decision-makers involved, Richard Clarke, “viewed the Russian proposal as largely a propaganda tool” in addition to considering verification of a cyber agreement “impossible” and that “the U.S. had not yet explored what it wanted to do in the area of cyber war. It was not obvious then whether or not cyber war added to or subtracted from U.S. national security\n\n³ For a first discussion of cyber norms by academics, see Finnemore (2011) and Maurer (2011).\n\n⁴ There is a related discussion focusing on norm adoption and internalization through the lens of behavior “mimicry” see Goodman/Jinks (2013).\n\n⁵ More recently Percy in her 2007 study of the norm against mercenaries.\n\n⁶ With respect to sources of international law and the logic within the UN system, UNGGE reports generally barely matter. In international law, they would rank even below the ‘soft law’ nature of UN General Assembly resolutions.\n\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS",

Other factors that have come up since are the quickly evolving nature of the technology challenging the longevity of a potential international treaty and growing concerns that the broad definition of ‘information security' advanced by Moscow and Beijing is a Trojan horse for content control and a human rights issue at heart. Another is the difficulty of attributing malicious cyber activity and the related ability to hold actors responsible (Rid and Buchanan 2015; Lindsay 2015; Brantly et al. 2016; Egloff and Wenger 2019).\n\nAfter the U.S. decided to reject the Russian proposal, it was in search for a strategy to advance its own agenda while still engaging with the Russians when the issue rose in prominence, namely after the 2007 DDoS attack against Estonia and the 2008 compromise of the classified networks of the U.S. Department of Defense. Principally opposed to a legally binding agreement as a goal, the U.S. government came up with the idea for the international community to develop ‘voluntary norms' in addition to arguing that existing international law applies to cyberspace. The 2015 UNGGE report therefore repeatedly highlights the “voluntary, non-binding” nature of the norms it outlines for cyberspace (UN Group of Governmental Experts 2015). The process that emerged out of these early days has since been scrutinized, including its dynamics and actors, by several scholars (Kavanagh and Stauffacher 2014; Hurwitz 2014; Cornish 2015; Farrell 2015; Erskine and Carr 2016; Tikk-Ringas 2016; Macák 2017; Hurel and Lobato 2018).\n\nUltimately, these factors explain the confusion and highlight the need to pay close attention what actors mean when they use the term ‘norm.'\n\n## Contestation, Norms, and Cyberspace\n\nAs a process, the cyber norms negotiations consist of norm contestation, which can be defined as “social practices which discursively express disapproval of norms” (Wiener 2014: 1). If there was no such contestation, all actors would have a shared understanding what norms apply and how. If they disagree, some form of contestation must be occurring and can lead to the weakening, reinforcing, adjusting, or replacing of a norm. That is why it is important to consider norms as much through the lens of a process as through a lens focused on products and explicit, agreed outcomes (Finnemore and Hollis 2016: 427). This contestation raises the question: what has been the contribution of the UN process to the international community's understanding of norms for cyberspace? First, the UNGGE process has helped crystallize",

A second important contribution was the process leading to the affirmation of the applicability of existing international law by the international community, analyzed in part 2, as well as its role as an incubator for constructing new norms outlined in part 3. Part 4 details how these agreements have been diffused worldwide.\n\n### Part I: Contestation Over Key Terms\n\nThe fight over norms for cyberspace starts with the terminology. For authoritarian governments, preserving their political system and ensuring regime stability is the single most important goal. This explains why the term ‘information security' and the proposals by Moscow and Beijing have become so politically charged and contested. Originally, information security was a technical term focused on the protection of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information (International Organization for Standardization 2018). Over the past two decades, it has taken on a life of its own as Moscow and later on Beijing argued that information itself—content in other words—can be a threat, and in doing so, they have broadened the conceptualization of information security. As liberal democracies face empowered authoritarian regimes and a democratic backsliding worldwide (Diamond 2016), they opted to use ‘cybersecurity' excluding content to highlight the need to protect human rights in juxtaposition to this broader concept of ‘information security'. International negotiations have therefore touched on essentially two issues: (i) hacking and the related use of information and communications technology (ICT) and (ii) content and the related use of ICT.\n\nUN member states camouflage these differences and the underlying clashes of their political systems by referring to the vague “malicious use of ICT” throughout their documents at the UN and the G20 (UN Group of Governmental Experts 2015: 6; G7 2017). That way, liberal democratic governments such as the U.S. and European countries can claim that their concerns are limited to hacking and related use of ICT, thereby opposing discussions of content while authoritarian governments such as Russia and China can claim that this definition reflects their broader conceptualization of ‘information security.'\n\nTaking these political realities into account while striving for a robust and sound academic definition, cyber norms can be defined as standards of appropriate behavior with respect to the use of ICT inconsistent with the objectives of maintaining international stability and security. The value of this definition is that it sets cyber norms apart from the broader set of norms that shape our behavior online",

This definition of ‘cyber norms' combines (1) the standard definition of norms in International Relations theory (Katzenstein 1996: 5) with (2) the use of the term ‘cyber norms' in the international relations context, namely in the context of international security and the UNGGE process (General Assembly 1999).\n\nIn fact, the successful adoption UNGGE reports in 2010, 2013, and 2015 demonstrates that diplomats have been able to make progress despite their disagreement with respect to the scope of ‘information security.' John Rawls's ‘overlapping consensus' and Cass Sunstein's ‘incompletely theorized agreements' help explain why actors, including states, can agree on particular norms despite divergent values (Rawls 1971; Sunstein 2007). The use of offensive cyber operations that could pose a threat to international stability and security is such an area with greater intersubjective agreement. Hacking has enabled a diffusion of reach for actors around the world to create effects remotely, the truly novel and unique aspect of the technology, ranging from stealing data to manipulating centrifuges of nuclear enrichment facilities or disrupting power supply (Maurer 2018: 26--27).\n\n### Part 2: Contestation Over Existing Norms\n\nTo analyze the impact of existing norms, namely existing international law, it is worth noting that some scholars propose to differentiate between norm ‘validity contestation' and norm ‘application contestation' (Zimmermann et al. 2017: 699). Norm validity contestation involves actors debating whether a norm or a set of norms is valid generally and to be upheld. Norm application contestation does not challenge whether a norm or set of norms is generally valid but whether it “is appropriate for a given situation...over time and varying local contexts, such application discourses often lead to evolving interpretations of a norm, in line with new technological inventions” (Zimmermann et al. 2017: 699).\n\nThese distinctions are particularly useful with respect to norms and emerging technologies. Yet, applying the concept of validity and application contestation to cyber norms raises a conceptual challenge because cyberspace is viewed by an increasing number of states not only as a new technology but as a standalone “domain” of human interaction complementing the conventional military domains of operation—land, sea, air, and space (Lynn 2010). The special status of cyberspace as a domain has fueled arguments that it requires its own set of rules.",

China's refusal until 2013 to affirm that international law generally applies to cyberspace constitutes such validity contestation. In fact, China's argument for the need to negotiate international law anew can be seen within the context of its broader contestation of the liberal world order and validity of its norms. Seen in this light, China's behavior reflects a general challenge to the validity of norms that solidified in the aftermath of World War II including with respect to rules of the road for cyberspace. It was not until the 2013 UNGGE consensus report that China was willing to change its position.¹⁴ In this case, the impact of the cyber norms discussion and China's temporary contestation on existing norms was to ultimately reinforce the latter with several governments including Russia's explicitly¹⁵ affirming their views that international law does apply (Koh 2015; Putin 2016; Wright 2018).\n\n## 3.2.2 Cyber Norms and Application Contestation\n\nFollowing the 2013 consensus that international law generally applies to cyberspace, application contestation has become the dominant dynamic in the cyber norms process. Discussing how international law applies was part of the 2016/2017 UNGGE's mandate. It was also one of the reasons why the UNGGE collapsed in 2017 because its members could not agree on whether or not to include an explicit reference in the UNGGE report specifying that international humanitarian law (IHL) applies to cyberspace.¹⁶ According to the U.S. representative, “those who are unwilling to affirm the applicability of these international [humanitarian] legal rules and principles believe their States are free to act in or through cyberspace to achieve their political ends with no limits or constraints on their actions” (Markoff 2017).¹⁷\n\n¹⁴ Part of China's argument was that affirming the applicability of international law would have unintended consequences namely contributing to the militarization of cyberspace. I thank Arun Sukumar for highlighting this point.\n\n¹⁵ The Doctrine of Information Security of the Russian Federation approved by Decree of the President of the Russian Federation on December 5, 2016, states in paragraph 4 as a basic notion that “The Constitution of the Russian Federation, universally recognized principles and norms of international law, international treaties signed by the Russian Federation...form the legal framework of the Doctrine” specifying in paragraph 34 that “Information security activities of government bodies is based on the following principles...(e) compliance with the universally recognized principles and norms of international law, international treaties to which the Russian Federation is a party and laws of the Russian Federation.”\n\n¹⁶ There is an inherent contradiction in states’ positions having on the one hand confirmed that existing international law applies but then refusing to affirm that a subset of existing international law, international humanitarian law, applies. While the latter could be considered another example of validity contestation, it is included in the section on application contestation due to the previous affirmation that existing international law generally does apply.\n\n¹⁷ It is worth noting that the US government also contests the validity of certain parts of international law. For example, the US government does not recognize due diligence as a legal concept applying to cyberspace. See Schmitt (2015a) on due diligence.",

            "markdown": "T. Maurer\n\nCuba also issued a statement explaining that the reason why it and other states including China rejected affirming the applicability of IHL in the context of ICT “since it would legitimize a scenario of war and military actions in the context of ICT” referencing “unilateral punitive force actions, including the application of sanctions and even military action by States claiming to be victims of illicit uses of ICTs” (Rodriguez 2017). An Indian expert on the UNGGE, Arun Sukumar, has since pointed out that “This argument, however, is really about military objectives. Countries that are rapidly scaling up their offensive cyber capabilities are buying time to test the effects of new weapons on civilian networks and critical infrastructure. To commit to the applicability of IHL, they fear, would be to foreclose the development and testing of some cyber weapons that may have unintended consequences” (Sukumar 2017).\n\nSukumar’s statement implies that, in his view, it was interests rather than identity that drove states’ behavior.¹⁸ There are two characteristics of offensive cyber operations that lend weight to this assessment. First, the more sophisticated an actor, the more precise such an actor can be in limiting the effect of malware (Maurer 2018: 10–11). Second, the more sophisticated an actor, the easier it is for such an actor to successfully attribute the source of malicious cyber activity. IHL is based on norms such as distinguishing between civilian and military targets and proportionality. Both depend on precision. Similarly, the exercise of the right to self-defense and use of countermeasures depend on the ability to trace malicious activity back to its source territory. This explains why Sukumar argues that “In reality, Cuba and others are concerned that an endorsement of the ‘right to self-defense’ will undermine asymmetric advantages which states that do not enjoy conventional superiority over their adversaries may have in cyberspace” (Sukumar 2017). Through this lens, the debate over international law with respect to cyberspace is an example of the concept of ‘lawfare’ (Kennedy 2006).¹⁹ Ultimately, both—interests and identity—are likely to have influenced states’ behavior in this context.\n\nDespite the disagreements over whether to explicitly affirm its applicability, emerging state practice in cyberspace so far seems to suggest that states’ behavior is strongly influenced by IHL. With the exception of the Stuxnet malware whose effects according to some international lawyers can be considered equivalent to the ‘use of force’, all other incidents publicly known to date have remained below this threshold and often aligned with principles of IHL.²⁰ This possibly illustrates\n\n¹⁸ Sukumar in an email dated March 3, 2019, noted that “self-actualization of ‘identity’ of states in this domain is still a work in progress and therefore, it would not be surprising if individual positions were to change over the course of subsequent rounds of negotiations but, of course, short term interests have a great role in shaping that identity.”.\n\n¹⁹ If one rejects this assessment and instead takes the Cuban statement at face value as echoing others’ concerns over a militarization of the Internet, it reflects the different approaches between pacifists and Dunantists. Pacifists advocate for the abolition of war. Dunantists follow Henry Dunant’s humanitarian footsteps acknowledging that wars will occur (at least in their lifetime) and therefore focus on making it less cruel.\n\n²⁰ The temporary 6-h blackout in Ukraine in 2015 caused by a cyber attack is not considered a violation of the 2015 UNGGE norm protecting critical infrastructure, at least by the U.S. government which considers Ukraine to have been in a state of armed conflict at the time (Markoff et al 2017).

That is also why the discussion about cyber norms has been driven by an “effects-based logic” (Farrell and Glaser 2017). Norms governing subthreshold effects through cyberspace are less a question of applicability of existing international law but best described through the lens of cyber norm emergence.²³\n\nThe contestation over the emergence of cyber norms ties back to the initial Russian proposal for an arms control treaty focusing on information security. A main point of contestation since then has been over whether a new, legally binding treaty is required to codify new norms for cyberspace or whether a soft law approach is better suited. Moscow has continued to promote the idea of a treaty through a draft International Code of Conduct and by circulating a draft convention (McKune 2015; Russian MOFA 2011). The Shanghai Cooperation Organization and partnering with China has been the main vehicle for this effort. Meanwhile, the U.S. and its Western allies have used the London Conference on Cyberspace series to advocate for their vision (UK 2011). With that said, this bifurcation into two camps became murkier when Microsoft launched its campaign for a Digital Geneva Convention in 2017 (Microsoft 2017).\n\nDespite this broader contestation, the governmental experts were able to reach agreement on a list of eleven voluntary, nonbinding norms outlined in their 2015 UNGGE report. Figure 1 details this list together with a set of questions to help\n\nFootnote 20 (continued)\n\nHollis for pointing out that this does not mean that the attack did not potentially violate provisions of IHL, for example, with respect to the indiscriminate targeting of civilians.\n\n²¹ This article disagrees with the assessment that states are developing a “policy of optionality toward the application of international law” as suggested by Efrony and Shany (2018: 648–649) and instead attributes the lack of clarity and explicit statements to the still nascent understanding and nature of cyber norms.\n\n²² See, for example, Hathaway et al (2012); Schmitt and Vihul (2014); Eichensehr (2014).\n\n²³ According to the norm life cycle, norm entrepreneurs will help advance the emergence of a new norm that can eventually reach a tipping point. Once a sufficient number of relevant actors support the norm for it to reach a cascade, the norm becomes internalized reflecting normal patterns of behavior with only sporadic violations (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998).\n\nSpringer\n\nASSER PRESS",

Complementing the affirmation that existing international law applies, the voluntary nature of these norms is reflected by the use of “should” rather than “must” or “are obliged to”. Moreover, the U.S. has explicitly promoted behavior that it does not consider to be part of international law as norms. Assessing the level of compliance therefore primarily depends on the state whose compliance is being assessed having explicitly affirmed that it will adhere to the described standard of appropriate behavior. Also, the meaning of these voluntary norms remains contested. It is also unclear if all states are committed to all eleven norms equally. For example, the U.S. government had explicitly proposed four of the eleven norms (Kerry 2015). Is it equally committed to the other seven it agreed to in 2015? What about other countries' priorities?\n\nWith respect to the diffusion of the agreed upon statements on norms, Fig. 2 shows various international accords over the past decade since the first successful UNGGE started convening in 2009 (Maurer et al. 2017). The list shows a timeline of relevant multilateral accords explicitly referencing cyber norms. This includes successful UNGGE reports which were subsequently endorsed by heads of states at the G20, the G7, and in other multilateral and bilateral statements. These efforts demonstrate that the “socialization tools employed to make the norm effective” include a mix of global and regional institutions to help diffuse the agreements reached and to support the norms reaching a tipping point and cascading effect (Finnemore and Hollis 2016: 428). Specifically noteworthy is the significantly increasing number of such accords starting in 2015 and thereafter contributing to the diffusion of the norms agreed to in the 2015 UNGGE report. Many of these are the result of a deliberate effort by UNGGE member states to increase awareness of the UNGGE process among non-UNGGE member states and thereby enhance its universality, legitimacy, and global adherence.\n\n### Part 4: Contestation Over Access to Contestation\n\nWho gets to sit at the table and participate in the discussions about norms for cyberspace has also been contested. UNGGEs were restricted clubs with membership limited to initially 15 and eventually 25 member states with the composition changing from one UNGGE to the next. While the consistent participation of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council provided a minimum of legitimacy, other countries have criticized the restrictive membership as cybersecurity rose on the agenda. In fact, for the UNGGE established in 2016 with its 25 members, nearly three times as many member states expressed their desire to be part of the group reflecting a desire to move from being norm takers to being norm shapers. In other words, it is a reflection of contestation over ‘access to contestation' as a pre-condition for agency and participation in contestation in the first place (Wiener 2017).",

These criticisms can be considered a standalone metacontestation over the existing UN process writ large. Its critics question whether the UN process has been sufficiently impactful, whether it is worth pursuing further, and whether it ought to be replaced with a different process. These arguments focus on (1) the broad scope and vague nature of agreements, (2) the inadequacy of addressing the deteriorating security environment, (3) the hidden agendas, including hypocrisy, of some stakeholders, and (4) the disconnect between those negotiating and those carrying out offensive operations.\n\n1. Broad scope and vague nature of agreements A common critique from officials in national security agencies is that the framework developed by the UNGGE is too broad and too vague to be truly effective at establishing rules of the road adhered to by those carrying out offensive cyber operations (Burgess 2018; Baker 2017; Fischerkeller and Harknett 2018).

Instead of viewing the UNGGE's framework as too broad and ambitious, this separate camp of critics argues that the UNGGE process has not been ambitious enough. They see a functional need for international cooperation among governments and transnational cooperation among nongovernmental actors to address the deteriorating cybersecurity environment. A leading voice of this group is the multinational company Microsoft. After years of being involved in international cyber norms discussions, Microsoft CEO Brad Smith elevated the company's engagement to an unprecedented level by calling for a Digital Geneva Convention (Smith 2017; Meredith 2018). In the wake of the economic costs caused by the 2017 WannaCry and NotPetya, these voices have become louder with a growing number of CEOs joining the chorus (Greenberg 2018; Cybersecurity Tech Accord 2018; Siemens 2018). In addition, the UN Secretary General made the topic a priority in 2018 supporting a more ambitious agenda (Khalip 2018; Fidler 2018).This group of norm entrepreneurs remains very active trying to further advance the cyber norms discussion by keeping the pressure on governments. For example, Microsoft broadened its efforts beyond its engagement as a single company by creating the ‘Tech Accord' consortium counting more than 70 global companies at the beginning of 2019 (Cybersecurity Tech Accord 2018). In late 2017, Siemens established a nonrival network of a dozen companies creating a ‘Charter of Trust' focusing specifically on supply chain integrity (Siemens 2018). Meanwhile, the Dutch government led the charge to add a norm protecting the core of the Internet to the list of norms agreed to through the 2015 UNGGE (Broeders 2016). The French government's desire to maximize the impact of the Paris Peace Forum launched in 2018 at the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I led to the adoption of the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace in November 2018 that explicitly references the norm to protect the core of the Internet (France Diplomatie 2018). The Paris Call has also been described as an umbrella framework for the activities of various norm entrepreneurs. Hidden agendas Those promoting a more ambitious agenda have encountered a number of challenges due to the dynamics among and within governments. First, among governments, calls for a treaty have been met with resistance by Western governments. Concerned about Moscow's true intentions, these governments worry that any push for a treaty will empower Moscow's longstanding proposal. Their concerns explain continued resistance by Washington and Western capitals",

They also help explain why Microsoft's call for a Digital Geneva Convention has met similar resistance and illustrate that overcoming this path dependence would require exceptional circumstances. Second, within governments, national security agencies are reluctant to internalize and adhere to the norms reflected in the UNGGE agreements due to the still nascent understanding of the domain, a related desire to preserve options until a mature strategic framework has emerged, and the dynamics of the security dilemma (Burgess 2018, Efrony and Shany 2018). A good illustration of this still maturing understanding of the technology is the argument promoted by some that there is moral obligation to use hacking instead of conventional weaponry if the effects of the former are less harmful than the latter (Hollis 2014). Disconnect between those negotiating and those conducting offensive cyber operations A final obstacle worth mentioning—rather in form of a hypothesis than conclusive analysis—is that a particular challenge for negotiating cyber norms may be that the conduct of offensive cyber operations originated in and continues to be closely tied to intelligence agencies, the most secretive parts of any government (Smeets 2018). Until recently, their public engagement was minimal. For example, the acronym of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) has been commonly referred to as ‘No Such Agency.' The bureaucratic culture of these agencies is therefore not infused with a history of interactions with their respective counterparts internationally (apart from the norms governing spy swaps that emerged during the Cold War.) Unlike the militaries of the world that—despite fighting each other—have developed norms for the exchange of prisoners, the treatment of the wounded, and other activity, this sort of interaction is not part of intelligence agencies' DNA. With that said, the pace of change affecting intelligence agencies in the past 5 years alone is breathtaking with potential changing attitudes toward such interactions. For example, from the NSA to the Australian signals directorate, agencies now even have active Twitter accounts and terms such as Five Eyes have become household names (Australian Signals Directorate 2018).\n\n## The Flipside: The Impact of Cyber Norms on Existing Norms\n\nNot only have existing international law and norms shaped the thinking about behavior in cyberspace but, on the flipside, the discussion about cyber norms has had an impact on existing international law and norms more broadly. For example, the affirmation of states' commitment to foundational norms of the international system such as sovereignty, the UN Charter, and international law have reinforced these",

Moreover, in addition to what has been affirmed and included through the UNGGE process, it is important to take into account what has been excluded. For example, breaches of confidentiality of data for espionage purposes have been deliberately excluded from the UNGGE process, both with respect to economic and political espionage. This exclusion in and of itself reflects normativity.\n\nThe best case study showing how the cyber norms discussion has impacted intersubjective agreement on existing international law and norms is indeed the debate over espionage. While ultimately not included in UNGGE process, the role of intelligence collection activity has been part of the discussions. Particularly in the aftermath of Edward Snowden, some countries such as Brazil and Germany were keen to discuss potential norms with respect to political espionage. However, they introduced their resolutions in the UN General Assembly's Third Committee rather than through the First Committee and UNGGE process (Abdenur and Gama 2015).29 Other countries, namely the U.S., opposed such initiatives arguing that political espionage is not prohibited under international law but constitutes legitimate intelligence collection. In short, while contested by some, the debate starting in 2013 reinforced the existing norms governing political intelligence collection overall.\n\nAt the same time, the U.S. government has been very keen to reinforce the norm against economic espionage, namely the theft of intellectual property for competitive advantage, as the U.S. is specifically concerned by China's cyber-enabled behavior. In fact, of the five norms that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry outlined as U.S. government priorities in 2015, one of the five focused on economic espionage30 (Kerry 2015). While mentioned in the same context of cyber norms in his speech, the U.S. government did not pursue this issue through the UNGGE process to avoid introducing espionage to the First Committee discussions. Instead, the U.S. government pursued a bilateral agreement with China31 and subsequently a G20 communique incorporating the language of the bilateral agreement.\n\nHow challenging it has been for the U.S. government to communicate its nuanced view and differentiation between legitimate political espionage and illegitimate economic espionage is illustrated by the Chinese government's misperception of Washington's demands. In 2015, the U.S. government was requesting that Beijing arrest Chinese hackers responsible for economic espionage (Nakashima and Goldman 2015). Beijing eventually responded by presenting the arrest of hackers allegedly for the breach of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and theft of confidential\n\nSpringer\n\nASSER PRESS",

In light of the public outrage among members of the U.S. Congress over the OPM breach, Beijing apparently believed the arrests would address the U.S. government's demand (Hosenball and Zengerle 2015). The White House was subsequently at pains trying to communicate to Beijing that the U.S. government actually believed that the OPM breach—as much as it despised its occurrence—had been a legitimate activity and therefore did not expect the arrest of those hackers but instead wanted Beijing to crack down on those carrying out economic espionage.\n\n## Conclusion and Broader Reflections\n\nInternational consensus on norms for cyberspace remains in its infancy. Nevertheless, there have been active international discussions on norms for cyberspace since the late 1990s. In addition, states and non-state actors have been using offensive cyber operations for years. These discussions and activities do not take place in isolation but have been shaping cyber norms. The UNGGE process has contributed to the international community's understanding of norms for cyberspace by crystallizing the core tensions, affirming and thereby reinforcing the applicability of existing international law, and becoming an incubator for the construction of new norms and diffusion thereof.\n\nThe collapse of the 2017 UNGGE marks a caesura in the international discussion on cyber norms. The process collapsed due to a combination of geopolitical tensions, competing tactics, and growing pressure to open the process to others. Relations between Russia and the U.S. the drivers behind the UNGGE process, were at an historic low. Most argue the relationship is at its worst since the end of the Cold War, some even argue there is less dialogue now than during the Cold War. It is therefore not surprising that participants privately only gave the 2016/2017 UNGGE a 50/50 chance of success at its beginning. While future analysis may consider the failure of the 2017 UNGGE only a temporary set-back in the diplomatic process, it is a caesura nevertheless. Importantly, the 2017 collapse of the UNGGE process demonstrates that rising geopolitical tensions and heightened security concerns trumped growing pressures to address the functional need to cooperate in light of the deteriorating security environment illustrated by WannaCry and NotPetya.\n\nStarting in the fall of 2019, there will be a new UNGGE and a new open-ended working group—the “mess in New York” as one ambassador called it. This outcome was not by design, the U.S. and Russia simply could not agree on a compromise resolution like they had in the past. Countries caught in the middle then thought it was best not to alienate either and voted for both the American proposal for a",

Both remain anchored in the UN General Assembly's First Committee that created the five UNGGEs. How to make sense of them and establish some sort of complementarity was left to the UN Secretariat. If and how the two processes will build on each other remains an open question (as of August 2019). It is also unclear whether the U.S. will buy into the open-ended working group based on Russia's proposal and vice versa with respect to the UNGGE or if they will try to sabotage the other.\n\nSome states plan to use the two new processes to focus on how best to operationalize the agreed upon norms. Capacity-building is emerging as a priority, although it is unclear how this will differ from past commitments to capacity-building (UNIDIR 2019). Moreover, neither process is likely to address the question how those states behind some of the most aggressive activity in the past, namely Iran and North Korea, can become deterred from similar activity in the future. A key indicator for future developments will be the generational transition among the chief negotiators in coming years. When the godfather and godmother of cyber norms, Andrey Krutskikh and Michele Markoff, step down, the question will be whether their successors will pursue the same strategies or make incremental or even transformational changes. This transition is likely to also raise the question if China will assume a more active role in this discussion and how its behavior will shape cyber norms in the future.\n\nIn short, neither the new UNGGE nor the open-ended working group are likely to produce a diplomatic breakthrough by 2021. Despite growing pressures on governments, particularly from multinational companies (Microsoft 2018: Part 1 and 2; Cybersecurity Tech Accord 2018; France Diplomatie 2018) as well as a few NGOs to address the deteriorating cybersecurity environment as a functional need (Mitrany 1943), some states are becoming even more reluctant to pursue a more ambitious multilateral agenda (Sanger 2018). For example, the U.S. government has started focusing on holding actors accountable and enforcing the norms agreed to through the 2015 UNGGE (Hollis and Waxman 2018; White House 2018b). After years of primarily cyber threat intelligence companies exposing state-sponsored cyber operations (Mandiant 2013), the U.S. and other governments have become increasingly active in attributing such activity and doing so in a coordinated fashion. For example, the U.S. and other governments released statements holding Russia accountable for the NotPetya malware attack on the eve of the 2018 Munich Security Conference.\n\n### Broader Reflections\n\nWith respect to the bigger picture, the twenty-year old negotiations among states about cyber norms are a microcosm of the broader changes in world politics and the international system at the beginning of the 21^{st} century. They reflect the resurgence of great power rivalry, competing value propositions, and strategic decisions in the face of a global technology revolution. Russia's determination to remain a globally relevant actor, China's desire to shape the world order of the 21st century, and the U.S. attempt to retain its dominant position all permeate the international",

These debates also foreshadow broader systemic tensions between clashing political systems and visions for the future of the liberal world order.\n\nSo what does the process so far tell us about how norms emerge for cyberspace? It is clear that the top-down approach of the diplomatic negotiations is only one piece of the puzzle. While the UN process has certainly contributed to strengthening intersubjective agreement on what behavior is considered (in)appropriate in cyberspace, recent developments have exposed its shortcomings. Existing international law does provide a baseline framework but how it applies and what norms govern the new types of effects and resulting gaps in existing international law remains unclear. Efforts such as the Tallinn Manual and the voluntary norms outlined in the 2015 UNGGE reports are useful attempts to clarify these open questions, yet states are proceedings cautiously. Meanwhile, state practice is slowly emerging and becoming increasingly visible to others (Chesney 2019; Barnes and Gibbons-Neff 2019). The two are likely to increasingly converge in coming years providing fresh impetus for the construction and internalization of norms for cyberspace.\n\nNye has pointed out that “norms and institutions develop much more slowly than technology” (Nye 2018: 23). Part of the reason is that states continue to struggle on multiple fronts. States are still struggling with conceptualizing the technology and its implications which hampers the development of coherent strategies and policies. For example, in the U.S. the State Department's pursuit of a framework for stability and the cyber deterrence initiative announced by the White House in 2018 are disconnected from the development of the strategic concept of ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defend forward' outlined in the 2018 Command Vision for U.S. Cyber Command (Department of State 2018; White House 2018a; U.S. Cyber Command 2018). Western governments are revisiting their split of cyber operations from information operations in the early 2000s in light of Moscow's and Beijing's more integrated doctrines, especially in the wake of Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. elections (ODNI 2017).\n\nStates are also struggling to keep pace with technological developments, the proliferation of capabilities, and the malicious use of these capabilities. For example, most cyber incidents of the past decade were surprises, from the Iranian Distributed Denial of Service attacks from 2011 to 2013 to North Korea's attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014, (White House 2015a, b; Department of Justice 2016). Meanwhile, the number of countries developing offensive cyber tools rose from half a dozen to over 30 countries between 2010 and 2017 (Clapper, Lettre, and Rogers 2017).\n\nUltimately, the two new processes at the UN reflect competing visions for the future of cyberspace raising important questions for members of the international community. Should states have more or less power? Will they tolerate the existing institutions governing the Internet consisting primarily of private transnational",

With each attack causing several billions of U.S. dollars in economic damage worldwide, the cyber attacks raise the question: why did the international\n¹ Co-Director, Cyber Policy Initiative, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 1779 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20036, USA\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\ncommunity through the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UNGGE) fail to reach a consensus on how to advance the emerging regime of norms for cyberspace? On the surface, states such as the US, Cuba and India argue that it was a disagreement over international law (Markoff 2017; Rodriguez 2017; Sukumar 2017). Yet, the iceberg underneath is a mix of great power politics, competing and occasionally clashing political systems, and continued uncertainty with respect to a new technology.\nOverall, states' approach to norms for cyberspace remains highly contested internationally among governments and fragmented domestically within governments. Cyber norms are still in their “constituting phase” (Wiener 2014). Agreed upon, explicitly stated norms are considered voluntary, defined vaguely, and internalized weakly (Farrell and Glaser 2017: 16). Implicit state practice is slowly emerging, yet poorly understood, and cloaked in secrecy. Nevertheless, the diplomatic activities over the past two decades have shaped significantly how governments think about cyber norms and how they behave accordingly (Nye 2018).\nTo understand the dynamics of the international cyber norms contestation, various lenses can be applied. In addition to signs of the security dilemma impacting states' behavior (Buchanan 2017), competing conceptual approaches and key terms explain this outcome. These include key concepts such as ‘norms' (Finnemore and Hollis 2016), ‘deterrence' (White House 2018a), even ‘information security' and ‘cyber security' (Maurer and Morgus 2014), with new concepts such as ‘persistent engagement' (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2018) complementing the mix. Each of them is associated with a specific bureaucratic agency advancing its own agenda. Even the behavior of individual actors is worth mentioning as the two key diplomats in the U.S. and Russia leading these negotiations have not changed in the last 20 years achieving unusual influence setting the agenda, strategies, and pace of the discussions since the process began.\nThis state of affairs raises several important questions: how do norms emerge for cyberspace? What has been the contribution of the UN process to the international community's understanding of norms for cyberspace? Why did the process collapse in 2017, the very same year that two of the biggest cyber attacks to date caused indiscriminate economic harm worldwide? And why did member states, in an unprecedented move in the UN's history, create two processes dedicated to the same issue in 2018? This article investigates these questions and presents a deep dive into what cyber norms are all about.\nThe analysis of the dynamic process of norm contestation in this area is divided into several sections. The first section focuses on how the competing and\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\n285\noccasionally clashing political systems affect how cyber norms are conceptualized and defined. The second section presents a deep dive with five subparts ranging from the impact of existing norms on cyber norms to the emergence of norms, the diffusion and contestation thereof, including access to contestation, and the metacontestation over the UN process itself. The third section points to the impact of the cyber norms discussion on existing norms followed by the conclusion and some broader reflections.\n## 2 The Big Confusion: What Are (Cyber) Norms in the First Place?\nThere is severe confusion about cyber norms. It is not uncommon to encounter statements from diplomats implying that norms, per definition, are voluntary in nature and never legally binding—in contradiction to the decades-old academic literature of sociology and international relations theory.³ What is to blame for the confusion? Politics and the gap between academics and practitioners. Yet, this confusion also reflects an undercurrent of competing political systems that affects the terminology used in this area. It is therefore worth briefly unpacking what (cyber) norms are and how to define them given the implications for contestation.\nOne of the key points of confusion centers on the relationship between norms and laws. In academia, scholars debate whether legal norms enjoy a special status compared to norms generally.⁴ Finnemore argues they do not because “There are, after all, many kinds of norms in the world—social, cultural, professional, moral, religious, and familial” (Finnemore 1999: 701).⁵ Others argue that norms tied to law stand out because of the level of compliance given rise to concepts such as ‘soft law’ and ‘hard law’ (Abbott and Snidal 2000; see Jose (2018): 25). More recently, Finnemore and Hollis concluded that “Simply put, laws can serve as a basis for formulating norms, just as norms can be codified in law” (Finnemore and Hollis 2016: 442).\nIn international politics, the concept of ‘voluntary norms’ emerged as a political strategy developed by the U.S. Department of State in juxtaposition to Russia’s proposal for a legally binding arms control treaty on information security. Moscow approached Washington with this idea in the late 1990s which the U.S. government opposed for several reasons. One of the key decision-makers involved, Richard Clarke, “viewed the Russian proposal as largely a propaganda tool” in addition to considering verification of a cyber agreement “impossible” and that “the U.S. had not yet explored what it wanted to do in the area of cyber war. It was not obvious then whether or not cyber war added to or subtracted from U.S. national security\n³ For a first discussion of cyber norms by academics, see Finnemore (2011) and Maurer (2011).\n⁴ There is a related discussion focusing on norm adoption and internalization through the lens of behavior “mimicry” see Goodman/Jinks (2013).\n⁵ More recently Percy in her 2007 study of the norm against mercenaries.\n⁶ With respect to sources of international law and the logic within the UN system, UNGGE reports generally barely matter. In international law, they would rank even below the ‘soft law’ nature of UN General Assembly resolutions.\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\n(Clarke and Knake 2011: 219)”. Other factors that have come up since are the quickly evolving nature of the technology challenging the longevity of a potential international treaty and growing concerns that the broad definition of ‘information security' advanced by Moscow and Beijing is a Trojan horse for content control and a human rights issue at heart. Another is the difficulty of attributing malicious cyber activity and the related ability to hold actors responsible (Rid and Buchanan 2015; Lindsay 2015; Brantly et al. 2016; Egloff and Wenger 2019).\nAfter the U.S. decided to reject the Russian proposal, it was in search for a strategy to advance its own agenda while still engaging with the Russians when the issue rose in prominence, namely after the 2007 DDoS attack against Estonia and the 2008 compromise of the classified networks of the U.S. Department of Defense. Principally opposed to a legally binding agreement as a goal, the U.S. government came up with the idea for the international community to develop ‘voluntary norms' in addition to arguing that existing international law applies to cyberspace. The 2015 UNGGE report therefore repeatedly highlights the “voluntary, non-binding” nature of the norms it outlines for cyberspace (UN Group of Governmental Experts 2015). The process that emerged out of these early days has since been scrutinized, including its dynamics and actors, by several scholars (Kavanagh and Stauffacher 2014; Hurwitz 2014; Cornish 2015; Farrell 2015; Erskine and Carr 2016; Tikk-Ringas 2016; Macák 2017; Hurel and Lobato 2018).\nUltimately, these factors explain the confusion and highlight the need to pay close attention what actors mean when they use the term ‘norm.'\n## Contestation, Norms, and Cyberspace\nAs a process, the cyber norms negotiations consist of norm contestation, which can be defined as “social practices which discursively express disapproval of norms” (Wiener 2014: 1). If there was no such contestation, all actors would have a shared understanding what norms apply and how. If they disagree, some form of contestation must be occurring and can lead to the weakening, reinforcing, adjusting, or replacing of a norm. That is why it is important to consider norms as much through the lens of a process as through a lens focused on products and explicit, agreed outcomes (Finnemore and Hollis 2016: 427). This contestation raises the question: what has been the contribution of the UN process to the international community's understanding of norms for cyberspace? First, the UNGGE process has helped crystallize\nthe underlying core tensions among the stakeholders involved as described in part 1 of this section. A second important contribution was the process leading to the affirmation of the applicability of existing international law by the international community, analyzed in part 2, as well as its role as an incubator for constructing new norms outlined in part 3. Part 4 details how these agreements have been diffused worldwide.\n### Part I: Contestation Over Key Terms\nThe fight over norms for cyberspace starts with the terminology. For authoritarian governments, preserving their political system and ensuring regime stability is the single most important goal. This explains why the term ‘information security' and the proposals by Moscow and Beijing have become so politically charged and contested. Originally, information security was a technical term focused on the protection of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information (International Organization for Standardization 2018). Over the past two decades, it has taken on a life of its own as Moscow and later on Beijing argued that information itself—content in other words—can be a threat, and in doing so, they have broadened the conceptualization of information security. As liberal democracies face empowered authoritarian regimes and a democratic backsliding worldwide (Diamond 2016), they opted to use ‘cybersecurity' excluding content to highlight the need to protect human rights in juxtaposition to this broader concept of ‘information security'. International negotiations have therefore touched on essentially two issues: (i) hacking and the related use of information and communications technology (ICT) and (ii) content and the related use of ICT.\nUN member states camouflage these differences and the underlying clashes of their political systems by referring to the vague “malicious use of ICT” throughout their documents at the UN and the G20 (UN Group of Governmental Experts 2015: 6; G7 2017). That way, liberal democratic governments such as the U.S. and European countries can claim that their concerns are limited to hacking and related use of ICT, thereby opposing discussions of content while authoritarian governments such as Russia and China can claim that this definition reflects their broader conceptualization of ‘information security.'\nTaking these political realities into account while striving for a robust and sound academic definition, cyber norms can be defined as standards of appropriate behavior with respect to the use of ICT inconsistent with the objectives of maintaining international stability and security. The value of this definition is that it sets cyber norms apart from the broader set of norms that shape our behavior online\nfrom dating online to shopping online. This definition of ‘cyber norms' combines (1) the standard definition of norms in International Relations theory (Katzenstein 1996: 5) with (2) the use of the term ‘cyber norms' in the international relations context, namely in the context of international security and the UNGGE process (General Assembly 1999).\nIn fact, the successful adoption UNGGE reports in 2010, 2013, and 2015 demonstrates that diplomats have been able to make progress despite their disagreement with respect to the scope of ‘information security.' John Rawls's ‘overlapping consensus' and Cass Sunstein's ‘incompletely theorized agreements' help explain why actors, including states, can agree on particular norms despite divergent values (Rawls 1971; Sunstein 2007). The use of offensive cyber operations that could pose a threat to international stability and security is such an area with greater intersubjective agreement. Hacking has enabled a diffusion of reach for actors around the world to create effects remotely, the truly novel and unique aspect of the technology, ranging from stealing data to manipulating centrifuges of nuclear enrichment facilities or disrupting power supply (Maurer 2018: 26--27).\n### Part 2: Contestation Over Existing Norms\nTo analyze the impact of existing norms, namely existing international law, it is worth noting that some scholars propose to differentiate between norm ‘validity contestation' and norm ‘application contestation' (Zimmermann et al. 2017: 699). Norm validity contestation involves actors debating whether a norm or a set of norms is valid generally and to be upheld. Norm application contestation does not challenge whether a norm or set of norms is generally valid but whether it “is appropriate for a given situation...over time and varying local contexts, such application discourses often lead to evolving interpretations of a norm, in line with new technological inventions” (Zimmermann et al. 2017: 699).\nThese distinctions are particularly useful with respect to norms and emerging technologies. Yet, applying the concept of validity and application contestation to cyber norms raises a conceptual challenge because cyberspace is viewed by an increasing number of states not only as a new technology but as a standalone “domain” of human interaction complementing the conventional military domains of operation—land, sea, air, and space (Lynn 2010). The special status of cyberspace as a domain has fueled arguments that it requires its own set of rules.\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\n289\n## 3.2.1 Cyber Norms and Validity Contestation\nGenerally speaking, the question whether international law applies to behavior online is an example of validity contestation. China's refusal until 2013 to affirm that international law generally applies to cyberspace constitutes such validity contestation. In fact, China's argument for the need to negotiate international law anew can be seen within the context of its broader contestation of the liberal world order and validity of its norms. Seen in this light, China's behavior reflects a general challenge to the validity of norms that solidified in the aftermath of World War II including with respect to rules of the road for cyberspace. It was not until the 2013 UNGGE consensus report that China was willing to change its position.¹⁴ In this case, the impact of the cyber norms discussion and China's temporary contestation on existing norms was to ultimately reinforce the latter with several governments including Russia's explicitly¹⁵ affirming their views that international law does apply (Koh 2015; Putin 2016; Wright 2018).\n## 3.2.2 Cyber Norms and Application Contestation\nFollowing the 2013 consensus that international law generally applies to cyberspace, application contestation has become the dominant dynamic in the cyber norms process. Discussing how international law applies was part of the 2016/2017 UNGGE's mandate. It was also one of the reasons why the UNGGE collapsed in 2017 because its members could not agree on whether or not to include an explicit reference in the UNGGE report specifying that international humanitarian law (IHL) applies to cyberspace.¹⁶ According to the U.S. representative, “those who are unwilling to affirm the applicability of these international [humanitarian] legal rules and principles believe their States are free to act in or through cyberspace to achieve their political ends with no limits or constraints on their actions” (Markoff 2017).¹⁷\n¹⁴ Part of China's argument was that affirming the applicability of international law would have unintended consequences namely contributing to the militarization of cyberspace. I thank Arun Sukumar for highlighting this point.\n¹⁵ The Doctrine of Information Security of the Russian Federation approved by Decree of the President of the Russian Federation on December 5, 2016, states in paragraph 4 as a basic notion that “The Constitution of the Russian Federation, universally recognized principles and norms of international law, international treaties signed by the Russian Federation...form the legal framework of the Doctrine” specifying in paragraph 34 that “Information security activities of government bodies is based on the following principles...(e) compliance with the universally recognized principles and norms of international law, international treaties to which the Russian Federation is a party and laws of the Russian Federation.”\n¹⁶ There is an inherent contradiction in states’ positions having on the one hand confirmed that existing international law applies but then refusing to affirm that a subset of existing international law, international humanitarian law, applies. While the latter could be considered another example of validity contestation, it is included in the section on application contestation due to the previous affirmation that existing international law generally does apply.\n¹⁷ It is worth noting that the US government also contests the validity of certain parts of international law. For example, the US government does not recognize due diligence as a legal concept applying to cyberspace. See Schmitt (2015a) on due diligence.\nT. Maurer\nCuba also issued a statement explaining that the reason why it and other states including China rejected affirming the applicability of IHL in the context of ICT “since it would legitimize a scenario of war and military actions in the context of ICT” referencing “unilateral punitive force actions, including the application of sanctions and even military action by States claiming to be victims of illicit uses of ICTs” (Rodriguez 2017). An Indian expert on the UNGGE, Arun Sukumar, has since pointed out that “This argument, however, is really about military objectives. Countries that are rapidly scaling up their offensive cyber capabilities are buying time to test the effects of new weapons on civilian networks and critical infrastructure. To commit to the applicability of IHL, they fear, would be to foreclose the development and testing of some cyber weapons that may have unintended consequences” (Sukumar 2017).\nSukumar’s statement implies that, in his view, it was interests rather than identity that drove states’ behavior.¹⁸ There are two characteristics of offensive cyber operations that lend weight to this assessment. First, the more sophisticated an actor, the more precise such an actor can be in limiting the effect of malware (Maurer 2018: 10–11). Second, the more sophisticated an actor, the easier it is for such an actor to successfully attribute the source of malicious cyber activity. IHL is based on norms such as distinguishing between civilian and military targets and proportionality. Both depend on precision. Similarly, the exercise of the right to self-defense and use of countermeasures depend on the ability to trace malicious activity back to its source territory. This explains why Sukumar argues that “In reality, Cuba and others are concerned that an endorsement of the ‘right to self-defense’ will undermine asymmetric advantages which states that do not enjoy conventional superiority over their adversaries may have in cyberspace” (Sukumar 2017). Through this lens, the debate over international law with respect to cyberspace is an example of the concept of ‘lawfare’ (Kennedy 2006).¹⁹ Ultimately, both—interests and identity—are likely to have influenced states’ behavior in this context.\nDespite the disagreements over whether to explicitly affirm its applicability, emerging state practice in cyberspace so far seems to suggest that states’ behavior is strongly influenced by IHL. With the exception of the Stuxnet malware whose effects according to some international lawyers can be considered equivalent to the ‘use of force’, all other incidents publicly known to date have remained below this threshold and often aligned with principles of IHL.²⁰ This possibly illustrates\n¹⁸ Sukumar in an email dated March 3, 2019, noted that “self-actualization of ‘identity’ of states in this domain is still a work in progress and therefore, it would not be surprising if individual positions were to change over the course of subsequent rounds of negotiations but, of course, short term interests have a great role in shaping that identity.”.\n¹⁹ If one rejects this assessment and instead takes the Cuban statement at face value as echoing others’ concerns over a militarization of the Internet, it reflects the different approaches between pacifists and Dunantists. Pacifists advocate for the abolition of war. Dunantists follow Henry Dunant’s humanitarian footsteps acknowledging that wars will occur (at least in their lifetime) and therefore focus on making it less cruel.\n²⁰ The temporary 6-h blackout in Ukraine in 2015 caused by a cyber attack is not considered a violation of the 2015 UNGGE norm protecting critical infrastructure, at least by the U.S. government which considers Ukraine to have been in a state of armed conflict at the time (Markoff et al 2017). I thank Duncan\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\na significant degree of restraint by states in the use of available offensive tools and deliberate design thereof.²¹ With that said, it is also worth noting that despite some states having explicitly affirmed that they consider IHL to apply to cyberspace, their international lawyers have yet to agree on how it applies specifically.²² This lack of clarity is not limited to highly specific scenarios but extends to such foundational questions as to whether data enjoys the status of an object as such, which in turn determines whether distinctions between military and civilian objects apply (Schmitt 2013, 2015b).\n## 3.3 Part 3: Contestation Over the Emergence of Cyber Norms\nThe key challenge for the international community to address is what some scholars have called ‘subthreshold activity’: effects caused by malicious cyber activity below the threshold of ‘use of force’/‘armed attack’ (Lin 2012). That is also why the discussion about cyber norms has been driven by an “effects-based logic” (Farrell and Glaser 2017). Norms governing subthreshold effects through cyberspace are less a question of applicability of existing international law but best described through the lens of cyber norm emergence.²³\nThe contestation over the emergence of cyber norms ties back to the initial Russian proposal for an arms control treaty focusing on information security. A main point of contestation since then has been over whether a new, legally binding treaty is required to codify new norms for cyberspace or whether a soft law approach is better suited. Moscow has continued to promote the idea of a treaty through a draft International Code of Conduct and by circulating a draft convention (McKune 2015; Russian MOFA 2011). The Shanghai Cooperation Organization and partnering with China has been the main vehicle for this effort. Meanwhile, the U.S. and its Western allies have used the London Conference on Cyberspace series to advocate for their vision (UK 2011). With that said, this bifurcation into two camps became murkier when Microsoft launched its campaign for a Digital Geneva Convention in 2017 (Microsoft 2017).\nDespite this broader contestation, the governmental experts were able to reach agreement on a list of eleven voluntary, nonbinding norms outlined in their 2015 UNGGE report. Figure 1 details this list together with a set of questions to help\nFootnote 20 (continued)\nHollis for pointing out that this does not mean that the attack did not potentially violate provisions of IHL, for example, with respect to the indiscriminate targeting of civilians.\n²¹ This article disagrees with the assessment that states are developing a “policy of optionality toward the application of international law” as suggested by Efrony and Shany (2018: 648–649) and instead attributes the lack of clarity and explicit statements to the still nascent understanding and nature of cyber norms.\n²² See, for example, Hathaway et al (2012); Schmitt and Vihul (2014); Eichensehr (2014).\n²³ According to the norm life cycle, norm entrepreneurs will help advance the emergence of a new norm that can eventually reach a tipping point. Once a sufficient number of relevant actors support the norm for it to reach a cascade, the norm becomes internalized reflecting normal patterns of behavior with only sporadic violations (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998).\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\ndetermine their level of ambiguity (for discussion of different levels of ambiguity generally, see Jose (2018) 27; Abbott et al. (2000) 415). Complementing the affirmation that existing international law applies, the voluntary nature of these norms is reflected by the use of “should” rather than “must” or “are obliged to”. Moreover, the U.S. has explicitly promoted behavior that it does not consider to be part of international law as norms. Assessing the level of compliance therefore primarily depends on the state whose compliance is being assessed having explicitly affirmed that it will adhere to the described standard of appropriate behavior. Also, the meaning of these voluntary norms remains contested. It is also unclear if all states are committed to all eleven norms equally. For example, the U.S. government had explicitly proposed four of the eleven norms (Kerry 2015). Is it equally committed to the other seven it agreed to in 2015? What about other countries' priorities?\nWith respect to the diffusion of the agreed upon statements on norms, Fig. 2 shows various international accords over the past decade since the first successful UNGGE started convening in 2009 (Maurer et al. 2017). The list shows a timeline of relevant multilateral accords explicitly referencing cyber norms. This includes successful UNGGE reports which were subsequently endorsed by heads of states at the G20, the G7, and in other multilateral and bilateral statements. These efforts demonstrate that the “socialization tools employed to make the norm effective” include a mix of global and regional institutions to help diffuse the agreements reached and to support the norms reaching a tipping point and cascading effect (Finnemore and Hollis 2016: 428). Specifically noteworthy is the significantly increasing number of such accords starting in 2015 and thereafter contributing to the diffusion of the norms agreed to in the 2015 UNGGE report. Many of these are the result of a deliberate effort by UNGGE member states to increase awareness of the UNGGE process among non-UNGGE member states and thereby enhance its universality, legitimacy, and global adherence.\n### Part 4: Contestation Over Access to Contestation\nWho gets to sit at the table and participate in the discussions about norms for cyberspace has also been contested. UNGGEs were restricted clubs with membership limited to initially 15 and eventually 25 member states with the composition changing from one UNGGE to the next. While the consistent participation of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council provided a minimum of legitimacy, other countries have criticized the restrictive membership as cybersecurity rose on the agenda. In fact, for the UNGGE established in 2016 with its 25 members, nearly three times as many member states expressed their desire to be part of the group reflecting a desire to move from being norm takers to being norm shapers. In other words, it is a reflection of contestation over ‘access to contestation' as a pre-condition for agency and participation in contestation in the first place (Wiener 2017).\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\n|  VOLUNTARY, NONBINDING NORM | AMBIGUITY + KEY QUESTIONS  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  (a) Consistent with the purposes of the United Nations, including to maintain international peace and security, States should cooperate in developing and applying measures to increase stability and security in the use of ICTs and to prevent ICT practices that are acknowledged to be harmful or that may pose threats to international peace and security; | How will 'cooperation' be assessed?

These criticisms can be considered a standalone metacontestation over the existing UN process writ large. Its critics question whether the UN process has been sufficiently impactful, whether it is worth pursuing further, and whether it ought to be replaced with a different process. These arguments focus on (1) the broad scope and vague nature of agreements, (2) the inadequacy of addressing the deteriorating security environment, (3) the hidden agendas, including hypocrisy, of some stakeholders, and (4) the disconnect between those negotiating and those carrying out offensive operations.\n1. Broad scope and vague nature of agreements A common critique from officials in national security agencies is that the framework developed by the UNGGE is too broad and too vague to be truly effective at establishing rules of the road adhered to by those carrying out offensive cyber operations (Burgess 2018; Baker 2017; Fischerkeller and Harknett 2018).

(2017)\nof power, its use as an instrument of statecraft, and the security dilemma that is as present online as it is offline. As an alternative approach, this group of stakeholders proposes to focus on agreements based on emerging state practice and more narrowly defined areas of common interest as the basis for cyber norms that\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\ncould then be expanded over time (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2018; Fischerkeller 2018).Inadequacy of addressing deteriorating security environment A separate point of critique of the UNGGE process makes the opposite argument. Instead of viewing the UNGGE's framework as too broad and ambitious, this separate camp of critics argues that the UNGGE process has not been ambitious enough. They see a functional need for international cooperation among governments and transnational cooperation among nongovernmental actors to address the deteriorating cybersecurity environment. A leading voice of this group is the multinational company Microsoft. After years of being involved in international cyber norms discussions, Microsoft CEO Brad Smith elevated the company's engagement to an unprecedented level by calling for a Digital Geneva Convention (Smith 2017; Meredith 2018). In the wake of the economic costs caused by the 2017 WannaCry and NotPetya, these voices have become louder with a growing number of CEOs joining the chorus (Greenberg 2018; Cybersecurity Tech Accord 2018; Siemens 2018). In addition, the UN Secretary General made the topic a priority in 2018 supporting a more ambitious agenda (Khalip 2018; Fidler 2018).This group of norm entrepreneurs remains very active trying to further advance the cyber norms discussion by keeping the pressure on governments. For example, Microsoft broadened its efforts beyond its engagement as a single company by creating the ‘Tech Accord' consortium counting more than 70 global companies at the beginning of 2019 (Cybersecurity Tech Accord 2018). In late 2017, Siemens established a nonrival network of a dozen companies creating a ‘Charter of Trust' focusing specifically on supply chain integrity (Siemens 2018). Meanwhile, the Dutch government led the charge to add a norm protecting the core of the Internet to the list of norms agreed to through the 2015 UNGGE (Broeders 2016). The French government's desire to maximize the impact of the Paris Peace Forum launched in 2018 at the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I led to the adoption of the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace in November 2018 that explicitly references the norm to protect the core of the Internet (France Diplomatie 2018). The Paris Call has also been described as an umbrella framework for the activities of various norm entrepreneurs. Hidden agendas Those promoting a more ambitious agenda have encountered a number of challenges due to the dynamics among and within governments. First, among governments, calls for a treaty have been met with resistance by Western governments. Concerned about Moscow's true intentions, these governments worry that any push for a treaty will empower Moscow's longstanding proposal. Their concerns explain continued resistance by Washington and Western capitals\nwith respect to the draft International Code of Conduct that Moscow and Beijing developed in 2011, updated in 2015, and have been promoting since (see McKune 2015.) They also help explain why Microsoft's call for a Digital Geneva Convention has met similar resistance and illustrate that overcoming this path dependence would require exceptional circumstances. Second, within governments, national security agencies are reluctant to internalize and adhere to the norms reflected in the UNGGE agreements due to the still nascent understanding of the domain, a related desire to preserve options until a mature strategic framework has emerged, and the dynamics of the security dilemma (Burgess 2018, Efrony and Shany 2018). A good illustration of this still maturing understanding of the technology is the argument promoted by some that there is moral obligation to use hacking instead of conventional weaponry if the effects of the former are less harmful than the latter (Hollis 2014). Disconnect between those negotiating and those conducting offensive cyber operations A final obstacle worth mentioning—rather in form of a hypothesis than conclusive analysis—is that a particular challenge for negotiating cyber norms may be that the conduct of offensive cyber operations originated in and continues to be closely tied to intelligence agencies, the most secretive parts of any government (Smeets 2018). Until recently, their public engagement was minimal. For example, the acronym of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) has been commonly referred to as ‘No Such Agency.' The bureaucratic culture of these agencies is therefore not infused with a history of interactions with their respective counterparts internationally (apart from the norms governing spy swaps that emerged during the Cold War.) Unlike the militaries of the world that—despite fighting each other—have developed norms for the exchange of prisoners, the treatment of the wounded, and other activity, this sort of interaction is not part of intelligence agencies' DNA. With that said, the pace of change affecting intelligence agencies in the past 5 years alone is breathtaking with potential changing attitudes toward such interactions. For example, from the NSA to the Australian signals directorate, agencies now even have active Twitter accounts and terms such as Five Eyes have become household names (Australian Signals Directorate 2018).\n## The Flipside: The Impact of Cyber Norms on Existing Norms\nNot only have existing international law and norms shaped the thinking about behavior in cyberspace but, on the flipside, the discussion about cyber norms has had an impact on existing international law and norms more broadly. For example, the affirmation of states' commitment to foundational norms of the international system such as sovereignty, the UN Charter, and international law have reinforced these\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\nfoundational norms. Moreover, in addition to what has been affirmed and included through the UNGGE process, it is important to take into account what has been excluded. For example, breaches of confidentiality of data for espionage purposes have been deliberately excluded from the UNGGE process, both with respect to economic and political espionage. This exclusion in and of itself reflects normativity.\nThe best case study showing how the cyber norms discussion has impacted intersubjective agreement on existing international law and norms is indeed the debate over espionage. While ultimately not included in UNGGE process, the role of intelligence collection activity has been part of the discussions. Particularly in the aftermath of Edward Snowden, some countries such as Brazil and Germany were keen to discuss potential norms with respect to political espionage. However, they introduced their resolutions in the UN General Assembly's Third Committee rather than through the First Committee and UNGGE process (Abdenur and Gama 2015).29 Other countries, namely the U.S., opposed such initiatives arguing that political espionage is not prohibited under international law but constitutes legitimate intelligence collection. In short, while contested by some, the debate starting in 2013 reinforced the existing norms governing political intelligence collection overall.\nAt the same time, the U.S. government has been very keen to reinforce the norm against economic espionage, namely the theft of intellectual property for competitive advantage, as the U.S. is specifically concerned by China's cyber-enabled behavior. In fact, of the five norms that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry outlined as U.S. government priorities in 2015, one of the five focused on economic espionage30 (Kerry 2015). While mentioned in the same context of cyber norms in his speech, the U.S. government did not pursue this issue through the UNGGE process to avoid introducing espionage to the First Committee discussions. Instead, the U.S. government pursued a bilateral agreement with China31 and subsequently a G20 communique incorporating the language of the bilateral agreement.\nHow challenging it has been for the U.S. government to communicate its nuanced view and differentiation between legitimate political espionage and illegitimate economic espionage is illustrated by the Chinese government's misperception of Washington's demands. In 2015, the U.S. government was requesting that Beijing arrest Chinese hackers responsible for economic espionage (Nakashima and Goldman 2015). Beijing eventually responded by presenting the arrest of hackers allegedly for the breach of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and theft of confidential\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\ndata of U.S. government employees (Noble 2015). In light of the public outrage among members of the U.S. Congress over the OPM breach, Beijing apparently believed the arrests would address the U.S. government's demand (Hosenball and Zengerle 2015). The White House was subsequently at pains trying to communicate to Beijing that the U.S. government actually believed that the OPM breach—as much as it despised its occurrence—had been a legitimate activity and therefore did not expect the arrest of those hackers but instead wanted Beijing to crack down on those carrying out economic espionage.\n## Conclusion and Broader Reflections\nInternational consensus on norms for cyberspace remains in its infancy. Nevertheless, there have been active international discussions on norms for cyberspace since the late 1990s. In addition, states and non-state actors have been using offensive cyber operations for years. These discussions and activities do not take place in isolation but have been shaping cyber norms. The UNGGE process has contributed to the international community's understanding of norms for cyberspace by crystallizing the core tensions, affirming and thereby reinforcing the applicability of existing international law, and becoming an incubator for the construction of new norms and diffusion thereof.\nThe collapse of the 2017 UNGGE marks a caesura in the international discussion on cyber norms. The process collapsed due to a combination of geopolitical tensions, competing tactics, and growing pressure to open the process to others. Relations between Russia and the U.S. the drivers behind the UNGGE process, were at an historic low. Most argue the relationship is at its worst since the end of the Cold War, some even argue there is less dialogue now than during the Cold War. It is therefore not surprising that participants privately only gave the 2016/2017 UNGGE a 50/50 chance of success at its beginning. While future analysis may consider the failure of the 2017 UNGGE only a temporary set-back in the diplomatic process, it is a caesura nevertheless. Importantly, the 2017 collapse of the UNGGE process demonstrates that rising geopolitical tensions and heightened security concerns trumped growing pressures to address the functional need to cooperate in light of the deteriorating security environment illustrated by WannaCry and NotPetya.\nStarting in the fall of 2019, there will be a new UNGGE and a new open-ended working group—the “mess in New York” as one ambassador called it. This outcome was not by design, the U.S. and Russia simply could not agree on a compromise resolution like they had in the past. Countries caught in the middle then thought it was best not to alienate either and voted for both the American proposal for a\nnew UNGGE and the Russian proposal for an open-ended working group (Grigsby 2017). Both remain anchored in the UN General Assembly's First Committee that created the five UNGGEs. How to make sense of them and establish some sort of complementarity was left to the UN Secretariat. If and how the two processes will build on each other remains an open question (as of August 2019). It is also unclear whether the U.S. will buy into the open-ended working group based on Russia's proposal and vice versa with respect to the UNGGE or if they will try to sabotage the other.\nSome states plan to use the two new processes to focus on how best to operationalize the agreed upon norms. Capacity-building is emerging as a priority, although it is unclear how this will differ from past commitments to capacity-building (UNIDIR 2019). Moreover, neither process is likely to address the question how those states behind some of the most aggressive activity in the past, namely Iran and North Korea, can become deterred from similar activity in the future. A key indicator for future developments will be the generational transition among the chief negotiators in coming years. When the godfather and godmother of cyber norms, Andrey Krutskikh and Michele Markoff, step down, the question will be whether their successors will pursue the same strategies or make incremental or even transformational changes. This transition is likely to also raise the question if China will assume a more active role in this discussion and how its behavior will shape cyber norms in the future.\nIn short, neither the new UNGGE nor the open-ended working group are likely to produce a diplomatic breakthrough by 2021. Despite growing pressures on governments, particularly from multinational companies (Microsoft 2018: Part 1 and 2; Cybersecurity Tech Accord 2018; France Diplomatie 2018) as well as a few NGOs to address the deteriorating cybersecurity environment as a functional need (Mitrany 1943), some states are becoming even more reluctant to pursue a more ambitious multilateral agenda (Sanger 2018). For example, the U.S. government has started focusing on holding actors accountable and enforcing the norms agreed to through the 2015 UNGGE (Hollis and Waxman 2018; White House 2018b). After years of primarily cyber threat intelligence companies exposing state-sponsored cyber operations (Mandiant 2013), the U.S. and other governments have become increasingly active in attributing such activity and doing so in a coordinated fashion. For example, the U.S. and other governments released statements holding Russia accountable for the NotPetya malware attack on the eve of the 2018 Munich Security Conference.\n### Broader Reflections\nWith respect to the bigger picture, the twenty-year old negotiations among states about cyber norms are a microcosm of the broader changes in world politics and the international system at the beginning of the 21^{st} century. They reflect the resurgence of great power rivalry, competing value propositions, and strategic decisions in the face of a global technology revolution. Russia's determination to remain a globally relevant actor, China's desire to shape the world order of the 21st century, and the U.S. attempt to retain its dominant position all permeate the international\ndiscussions on which rules apply to cyberspace and how. These debates also foreshadow broader systemic tensions between clashing political systems and visions for the future of the liberal world order.\nSo what does the process so far tell us about how norms emerge for cyberspace? It is clear that the top-down approach of the diplomatic negotiations is only one piece of the puzzle. While the UN process has certainly contributed to strengthening intersubjective agreement on what behavior is considered (in)appropriate in cyberspace, recent developments have exposed its shortcomings. Existing international law does provide a baseline framework but how it applies and what norms govern the new types of effects and resulting gaps in existing international law remains unclear. Efforts such as the Tallinn Manual and the voluntary norms outlined in the 2015 UNGGE reports are useful attempts to clarify these open questions, yet states are proceedings cautiously. Meanwhile, state practice is slowly emerging and becoming increasingly visible to others (Chesney 2019; Barnes and Gibbons-Neff 2019). The two are likely to increasingly converge in coming years providing fresh impetus for the construction and internalization of norms for cyberspace.\nNye has pointed out that “norms and institutions develop much more slowly than technology” (Nye 2018: 23). Part of the reason is that states continue to struggle on multiple fronts. States are still struggling with conceptualizing the technology and its implications which hampers the development of coherent strategies and policies. For example, in the U.S. the State Department's pursuit of a framework for stability and the cyber deterrence initiative announced by the White House in 2018 are disconnected from the development of the strategic concept of ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defend forward' outlined in the 2018 Command Vision for U.S. Cyber Command (Department of State 2018; White House 2018a; U.S. Cyber Command 2018). Western governments are revisiting their split of cyber operations from information operations in the early 2000s in light of Moscow's and Beijing's more integrated doctrines, especially in the wake of Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. elections (ODNI 2017).\nStates are also struggling to keep pace with technological developments, the proliferation of capabilities, and the malicious use of these capabilities. For example, most cyber incidents of the past decade were surprises, from the Iranian Distributed Denial of Service attacks from 2011 to 2013 to North Korea's attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014, (White House 2015a, b; Department of Justice 2016). Meanwhile, the number of countries developing offensive cyber tools rose from half a dozen to over 30 countries between 2010 and 2017 (Clapper, Lettre, and Rogers 2017).\nUltimately, the two new processes at the UN reflect competing visions for the future of cyberspace raising important questions for members of the international community. Should states have more or less power? Will they tolerate the existing institutions governing the Internet consisting primarily of private transnational\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\n301\nregulatory organizations (Abbott et al. 2016) or will they seek to replace them? Will states adhere to the existing international legal and normative regime, namely that of state responsibility, or will revisionist powers succeed in pushing major changes (Goddard 2018)?\nAcknowledgements Many thanks to Arun Sukumar, Duncan Hollis, Garrett Hinck, and Hannes Ebert in addition to two anonymous reviewers for providing feedback on an earlier draft of this article.",

With each attack causing several billions of U.S. dollars in economic damage worldwide, the cyber attacks raise the question: why did the international\n Co-Director, Cyber Policy Initiative, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 1779 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20036, USA\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\ncommunity through the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UNGGE) fail to reach a consensus on how to advance the emerging regime of norms for cyberspace? On the surface, states such as the US, Cuba and India argue that it was a disagreement over international law (Markoff 2017; Rodriguez 2017; Sukumar 2017). Yet, the iceberg underneath is a mix of great power politics, competing and occasionally clashing political systems, and continued uncertainty with respect to a new technology.\nOverall, states' approach to norms for cyberspace remains highly contested internationally among governments and fragmented domestically within governments. Cyber norms are still in their “constituting phase” (Wiener 2014). Agreed upon, explicitly stated norms are considered voluntary, defined vaguely, and internalized weakly (Farrell and Glaser 2017: 16). Implicit state practice is slowly emerging, yet poorly understood, and cloaked in secrecy. Nevertheless, the diplomatic activities over the past two decades have shaped significantly how governments think about cyber norms and how they behave accordingly (Nye 2018).\nTo understand the dynamics of the international cyber norms contestation, various lenses can be applied. In addition to signs of the security dilemma impacting states' behavior (Buchanan 2017), competing conceptual approaches and key terms explain this outcome. These include key concepts such as ‘norms' (Finnemore and Hollis 2016), ‘deterrence' (White House 2018a), even ‘information security' and ‘cyber security' (Maurer and Morgus 2014), with new concepts such as ‘persistent engagement' (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2018) complementing the mix. Each of them is associated with a specific bureaucratic agency advancing its own agenda. Even the behavior of individual actors is worth mentioning as the two key diplomats in the U.S. and Russia leading these negotiations have not changed in the last 20 years achieving unusual influence setting the agenda, strategies, and pace of the discussions since the process began.\nThis state of affairs raises several important questions: how do norms emerge for cyberspace? What has been the contribution of the UN process to the international community's understanding of norms for cyberspace? Why did the process collapse in 2017, the very same year that two of the biggest cyber attacks to date caused indiscriminate economic harm worldwide? And why did member states, in an unprecedented move in the UN's history, create two processes dedicated to the same issue in 2018? This article investigates these questions and presents a deep dive into what cyber norms are all about.\nThe analysis of the dynamic process of norm contestation in this area is divided into several sections. The first section focuses on how the competing and\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\n\n## 2 The Big Confusion: What Are (Cyber) Norms in the First Place?\nThere is severe confusion about cyber norms. It is not uncommon to encounter statements from diplomats implying that norms, per definition, are voluntary in nature and never legally binding—in contradiction to the decades-old academic literature of sociology and international relations theory. What is to blame for the confusion? Politics and the gap between academics and practitioners. Yet, this confusion also reflects an undercurrent of competing political systems that affects the terminology used in this area. It is therefore worth briefly unpacking what (cyber) norms are and how to define them given the implications for contestation.\nOne of the key points of confusion centers on the relationship between norms and laws. In academia, scholars debate whether legal norms enjoy a special status compared to norms generally. Finnemore argues they do not because “There are, after all, many kinds of norms in the world—social, cultural, professional, moral, religious, and familial” (Finnemore 1999: 701). Others argue that norms tied to law stand out because of the level of compliance given rise to concepts such as ‘soft law’ and ‘hard law’ (Abbott and Snidal 2000; see Jose (2018): 25). More recently, Finnemore and Hollis concluded that “Simply put, laws can serve as a basis for formulating norms, just as norms can be codified in law” (Finnemore and Hollis 2016: 442).\nIn international politics, the concept of ‘voluntary norms’ emerged as a political strategy developed by the U.S. Department of State in juxtaposition to Russia’s proposal for a legally binding arms control treaty on information security. Moscow approached Washington with this idea in the late 1990s which the U.S. government opposed for several reasons. One of the key decision-makers involved, Richard Clarke, “viewed the Russian proposal as largely a propaganda tool” in addition to considering verification of a cyber agreement “impossible” and that “the U.S. had not yet explored what it wanted to do in the area of cyber war. It was not obvious then whether or not cyber war added to or subtracted from U.S. national security\n For a first discussion of cyber norms by academics, see Finnemore (2011) and Maurer (2011).\n There is a related discussion focusing on norm adoption and internalization through the lens of behavior “mimicry” see Goodman/Jinks (2013).\n More recently Percy in her 2007 study of the norm against mercenaries.\n With respect to sources of international law and the logic within the UN system, UNGGE reports generally barely matter. In international law, they would rank even below the ‘soft law’ nature of UN General Assembly resolutions.\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\n(Clarke and Knake 2011: 219)”. Other factors that have come up since are the quickly evolving nature of the technology challenging the longevity of a potential international treaty and growing concerns that the broad definition of ‘information security' advanced by Moscow and Beijing is a Trojan horse for content control and a human rights issue at heart. Another is the difficulty of attributing malicious cyber activity and the related ability to hold actors responsible (Rid and Buchanan 2015; Lindsay 2015; Brantly et al. 2016; Egloff and Wenger 2019).\nAfter the U.S. decided to reject the Russian proposal, it was in search for a strategy to advance its own agenda while still engaging with the Russians when the issue rose in prominence, namely after the 2007 DDoS attack against Estonia and the 2008 compromise of the classified networks of the U.S. Department of Defense. Principally opposed to a legally binding agreement as a goal, the U.S. government came up with the idea for the international community to develop ‘voluntary norms' in addition to arguing that existing international law applies to cyberspace. The 2015 UNGGE report therefore repeatedly highlights the “voluntary, non-binding” nature of the norms it outlines for cyberspace (UN Group of Governmental Experts 2015). The process that emerged out of these early days has since been scrutinized, including its dynamics and actors, by several scholars (Kavanagh and Stauffacher 2014; Hurwitz 2014; Cornish 2015; Farrell 2015; Erskine and Carr 2016; Tikk-Ringas 2016; Macák 2017; Hurel and Lobato 2018).\nUltimately, these factors explain the confusion and highlight the need to pay close attention what actors mean when they use the term ‘norm.'\n## Contestation, Norms, and Cyberspace\nAs a process, the cyber norms negotiations consist of norm contestation, which can be defined as “social practices which discursively express disapproval of norms” (Wiener 2014: 1). If there was no such contestation, all actors would have a shared understanding what norms apply and how. If they disagree, some form of contestation must be occurring and can lead to the weakening, reinforcing, adjusting, or replacing of a norm. That is why it is important to consider norms as much through the lens of a process as through a lens focused on products and explicit, agreed outcomes (Finnemore and Hollis 2016: 427). This contestation raises the question: what has been the contribution of the UN process to the international community's understanding of norms for cyberspace? First, the UNGGE process has helped crystallize\nthe underlying core tensions among the stakeholders involved as described in part 1 of this section. A second important contribution was the process leading to the affirmation of the applicability of existing international law by the international community, analyzed in part 2, as well as its role as an incubator for constructing new norms outlined in part 3. Part 4 details how these agreements have been diffused worldwide.\n### Part I: Contestation Over Key Terms\nThe fight over norms for cyberspace starts with the terminology. For authoritarian governments, preserving their political system and ensuring regime stability is the single most important goal. This explains why the term ‘information security' and the proposals by Moscow and Beijing have become so politically charged and contested. Originally, information security was a technical term focused on the protection of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information (International Organization for Standardization 2018). Over the past two decades, it has taken on a life of its own as Moscow and later on Beijing argued that information itself—content in other words—can be a threat, and in doing so, they have broadened the conceptualization of information security. As liberal democracies face empowered authoritarian regimes and a democratic backsliding worldwide (Diamond 2016), they opted to use ‘cybersecurity' excluding content to highlight the need to protect human rights in juxtaposition to this broader concept of ‘information security'. International negotiations have therefore touched on essentially two issues: (i) hacking and the related use of information and communications technology (ICT) and (ii) content and the related use of ICT.\nUN member states camouflage these differences and the underlying clashes of their political systems by referring to the vague “malicious use of ICT” throughout their documents at the UN and the G20 (UN Group of Governmental Experts 2015: 6; G7 2017). That way, liberal democratic governments such as the U.S. and European countries can claim that their concerns are limited to hacking and related use of ICT, thereby opposing discussions of content while authoritarian governments such as Russia and China can claim that this definition reflects their broader conceptualization of ‘information security.'\nTaking these political realities into account while striving for a robust and sound academic definition, cyber norms can be defined as standards of appropriate behavior with respect to the use of ICT inconsistent with the objectives of maintaining international stability and security. The value of this definition is that it sets cyber norms apart from the broader set of norms that shape our behavior online\nfrom dating online to shopping online. This definition of ‘cyber norms' combines (1) the standard definition of norms in International Relations theory (Katzenstein 1996: 5) with (2) the use of the term ‘cyber norms' in the international relations context, namely in the context of international security and the UNGGE process (General Assembly 1999).\nIn fact, the successful adoption UNGGE reports in 2010, 2013, and 2015 demonstrates that diplomats have been able to make progress despite their disagreement with respect to the scope of ‘information security.' John Rawls's ‘overlapping consensus' and Cass Sunstein's ‘incompletely theorized agreements' help explain why actors, including states, can agree on particular norms despite divergent values (Rawls 1971; Sunstein 2007). The use of offensive cyber operations that could pose a threat to international stability and security is such an area with greater intersubjective agreement. Hacking has enabled a diffusion of reach for actors around the world to create effects remotely, the truly novel and unique aspect of the technology, ranging from stealing data to manipulating centrifuges of nuclear enrichment facilities or disrupting power supply (Maurer 2018: 26--27).\n### Part 2: Contestation Over Existing Norms\nTo analyze the impact of existing norms, namely existing international law, it is worth noting that some scholars propose to differentiate between norm ‘validity contestation' and norm ‘application contestation' (Zimmermann et al. 2017: 699). Norm validity contestation involves actors debating whether a norm or a set of norms is valid generally and to be upheld. Norm application contestation does not challenge whether a norm or set of norms is generally valid but whether it “is appropriate for a given situation...over time and varying local contexts, such application discourses often lead to evolving interpretations of a norm, in line with new technological inventions” (Zimmermann et al. 2017: 699).\nThese distinctions are particularly useful with respect to norms and emerging technologies. Yet, applying the concept of validity and application contestation to cyber norms raises a conceptual challenge because cyberspace is viewed by an increasing number of states not only as a new technology but as a standalone “domain” of human interaction complementing the conventional military domains of operation—land, sea, air, and space (Lynn 2010). The special status of cyberspace as a domain has fueled arguments that it requires its own set of rules.\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\n\nGenerally speaking, the question whether international law applies to behavior online is an example of validity contestation. China's refusal until 2013 to affirm that international law generally applies to cyberspace constitutes such validity contestation. In fact, China's argument for the need to negotiate international law anew can be seen within the context of its broader contestation of the liberal world order and validity of its norms. Seen in this light, China's behavior reflects a general challenge to the validity of norms that solidified in the aftermath of World War II including with respect to rules of the road for cyberspace. It was not until the 2013 UNGGE consensus report that China was willing to change its position. In this case, the impact of the cyber norms discussion and China's temporary contestation on existing norms was to ultimately reinforce the latter with several governments including Russia's explicitly affirming their views that international law does apply (Koh 2015; Putin 2016; Wright 2018).\n## 3.2.2 Cyber Norms and Application Contestation\nFollowing the 2013 consensus that international law generally applies to cyberspace, application contestation has become the dominant dynamic in the cyber norms process. Discussing how international law applies was part of the 2016/2017 UNGGE's mandate. It was also one of the reasons why the UNGGE collapsed in 2017 because its members could not agree on whether or not to include an explicit reference in the UNGGE report specifying that international humanitarian law (IHL) applies to cyberspace. According to the U.S. representative, “those who are unwilling to affirm the applicability of these international [humanitarian] legal rules and principles believe their States are free to act in or through cyberspace to achieve their political ends with no limits or constraints on their actions” (Markoff 2017).\n Part of China's argument was that affirming the applicability of international law would have unintended consequences namely contributing to the militarization of cyberspace. I thank Arun Sukumar for highlighting this point.\n The Doctrine of Information Security of the Russian Federation approved by Decree of the President of the Russian Federation on December 5, 2016, states in paragraph 4 as a basic notion that “The Constitution of the Russian Federation, universally recognized principles and norms of international law, international treaties signed by the Russian Federation...form the legal framework of the Doctrine” specifying in paragraph 34 that “Information security activities of government bodies is based on the following principles...(e) compliance with the universally recognized principles and norms of international law, international treaties to which the Russian Federation is a party and laws of the Russian Federation.”\n There is an inherent contradiction in states’ positions having on the one hand confirmed that existing international law applies but then refusing to affirm that a subset of existing international law, international humanitarian law, applies. While the latter could be considered another example of validity contestation, it is included in the section on application contestation due to the previous affirmation that existing international law generally does apply.\n It is worth noting that the US government also contests the validity of certain parts of international law. For example, the US government does not recognize due diligence as a legal concept applying to cyberspace. See Schmitt (2015a) on due diligence.\nT. Maurer\nCuba also issued a statement explaining that the reason why it and other states including China rejected affirming the applicability of IHL in the context of ICT “since it would legitimize a scenario of war and military actions in the context of ICT” referencing “unilateral punitive force actions, including the application of sanctions and even military action by States claiming to be victims of illicit uses of ICTs” (Rodriguez 2017). An Indian expert on the UNGGE, Arun Sukumar, has since pointed out that “This argument, however, is really about military objectives. Countries that are rapidly scaling up their offensive cyber capabilities are buying time to test the effects of new weapons on civilian networks and critical infrastructure. To commit to the applicability of IHL, they fear, would be to foreclose the development and testing of some cyber weapons that may have unintended consequences” (Sukumar 2017).\nSukumar’s statement implies that, in his view, it was interests rather than identity that drove states’ behavior. There are two characteristics of offensive cyber operations that lend weight to this assessment. First, the more sophisticated an actor, the more precise such an actor can be in limiting the effect of malware (Maurer 2018: 10–11). Second, the more sophisticated an actor, the easier it is for such an actor to successfully attribute the source of malicious cyber activity. IHL is based on norms such as distinguishing between civilian and military targets and proportionality. Both depend on precision. Similarly, the exercise of the right to self-defense and use of countermeasures depend on the ability to trace malicious activity back to its source territory. This explains why Sukumar argues that “In reality, Cuba and others are concerned that an endorsement of the ‘right to self-defense’ will undermine asymmetric advantages which states that do not enjoy conventional superiority over their adversaries may have in cyberspace” (Sukumar 2017). Through this lens, the debate over international law with respect to cyberspace is an example of the concept of ‘lawfare’ (Kennedy 2006). Ultimately, both—interests and identity—are likely to have influenced states’ behavior in this context.\nDespite the disagreements over whether to explicitly affirm its applicability, emerging state practice in cyberspace so far seems to suggest that states’ behavior is strongly influenced by IHL. With the exception of the Stuxnet malware whose effects according to some international lawyers can be considered equivalent to the ‘use of force’, all other incidents publicly known to date have remained below this threshold and often aligned with principles of IHL. This possibly illustrates\n Sukumar in an email dated March 3, 2019, noted that “self-actualization of ‘identity’ of states in this domain is still a work in progress and therefore, it would not be surprising if individual positions were to change over the course of subsequent rounds of negotiations but, of course, short term interests have a great role in shaping that identity.”.\n If one rejects this assessment and instead takes the Cuban statement at face value as echoing others’ concerns over a militarization of the Internet, it reflects the different approaches between pacifists and Dunantists. Pacifists advocate for the abolition of war. Dunantists follow Henry Dunant’s humanitarian footsteps acknowledging that wars will occur (at least in their lifetime) and therefore focus on making it less cruel.\n The temporary 6-h blackout in Ukraine in 2015 caused by a cyber attack is not considered a violation of the 2015 UNGGE norm protecting critical infrastructure, at least by the U.S. government which considers Ukraine to have been in a state of armed conflict at the time (Markoff et al 2017). I thank Duncan\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\na significant degree of restraint by states in the use of available offensive tools and deliberate design thereof. With that said, it is also worth noting that despite some states having explicitly affirmed that they consider IHL to apply to cyberspace, their international lawyers have yet to agree on how it applies specifically. This lack of clarity is not limited to highly specific scenarios but extends to such foundational questions as to whether data enjoys the status of an object as such, which in turn determines whether distinctions between military and civilian objects apply (Schmitt 2013, 2015b).\n## 3.3 Part 3: Contestation Over the Emergence of Cyber Norms\nThe key challenge for the international community to address is what some scholars have called ‘subthreshold activity’: effects caused by malicious cyber activity below the threshold of ‘use of force’/‘armed attack’ (Lin 2012). That is also why the discussion about cyber norms has been driven by an “effects-based logic” (Farrell and Glaser 2017). Norms governing subthreshold effects through cyberspace are less a question of applicability of existing international law but best described through the lens of cyber norm emergence.\nThe contestation over the emergence of cyber norms ties back to the initial Russian proposal for an arms control treaty focusing on information security. A main point of contestation since then has been over whether a new, legally binding treaty is required to codify new norms for cyberspace or whether a soft law approach is better suited. Moscow has continued to promote the idea of a treaty through a draft International Code of Conduct and by circulating a draft convention (McKune 2015; Russian MOFA 2011). The Shanghai Cooperation Organization and partnering with China has been the main vehicle for this effort. Meanwhile, the U.S. and its Western allies have used the London Conference on Cyberspace series to advocate for their vision (UK 2011). With that said, this bifurcation into two camps became murkier when Microsoft launched its campaign for a Digital Geneva Convention in 2017 (Microsoft 2017).\nDespite this broader contestation, the governmental experts were able to reach agreement on a list of eleven voluntary, nonbinding norms outlined in their 2015 UNGGE report. Figure 1 details this list together with a set of questions to help\nFootnote 20 (continued)\nHollis for pointing out that this does not mean that the attack did not potentially violate provisions of IHL, for example, with respect to the indiscriminate targeting of civilians.\n This article disagrees with the assessment that states are developing a “policy of optionality toward the application of international law” as suggested by Efrony and Shany (2018: 648–649) and instead attributes the lack of clarity and explicit statements to the still nascent understanding and nature of cyber norms.\n See, for example, Hathaway et al (2012); Schmitt and Vihul (2014); Eichensehr (2014).\n According to the norm life cycle, norm entrepreneurs will help advance the emergence of a new norm that can eventually reach a tipping point. Once a sufficient number of relevant actors support the norm for it to reach a cascade, the norm becomes internalized reflecting normal patterns of behavior with only sporadic violations (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998).\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\ndetermine their level of ambiguity (for discussion of different levels of ambiguity generally, see Jose (2018) 27; Abbott et al. (2000) 415). Complementing the affirmation that existing international law applies, the voluntary nature of these norms is reflected by the use of “should” rather than “must” or “are obliged to”. Moreover, the U.S. has explicitly promoted behavior that it does not consider to be part of international law as norms. Assessing the level of compliance therefore primarily depends on the state whose compliance is being assessed having explicitly affirmed that it will adhere to the described standard of appropriate behavior. Also, the meaning of these voluntary norms remains contested. It is also unclear if all states are committed to all eleven norms equally. For example, the U.S. government had explicitly proposed four of the eleven norms (Kerry 2015). Is it equally committed to the other seven it agreed to in 2015? What about other countries' priorities?\nWith respect to the diffusion of the agreed upon statements on norms, Fig. 2 shows various international accords over the past decade since the first successful UNGGE started convening in 2009 (Maurer et al. 2017). The list shows a timeline of relevant multilateral accords explicitly referencing cyber norms. This includes successful UNGGE reports which were subsequently endorsed by heads of states at the G20, the G7, and in other multilateral and bilateral statements. These efforts demonstrate that the “socialization tools employed to make the norm effective” include a mix of global and regional institutions to help diffuse the agreements reached and to support the norms reaching a tipping point and cascading effect (Finnemore and Hollis 2016: 428). Specifically noteworthy is the significantly increasing number of such accords starting in 2015 and thereafter contributing to the diffusion of the norms agreed to in the 2015 UNGGE report. Many of these are the result of a deliberate effort by UNGGE member states to increase awareness of the UNGGE process among non-UNGGE member states and thereby enhance its universality, legitimacy, and global adherence.\n### Part 4: Contestation Over Access to Contestation\nWho gets to sit at the table and participate in the discussions about norms for cyberspace has also been contested. UNGGEs were restricted clubs with membership limited to initially 15 and eventually 25 member states with the composition changing from one UNGGE to the next. While the consistent participation of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council provided a minimum of legitimacy, other countries have criticized the restrictive membership as cybersecurity rose on the agenda. In fact, for the UNGGE established in 2016 with its 25 members, nearly three times as many member states expressed their desire to be part of the group reflecting a desire to move from being norm takers to being norm shapers. In other words, it is a reflection of contestation over ‘access to contestation' as a pre-condition for agency and participation in contestation in the first place (Wiener 2017).\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\n|  VOLUNTARY, NONBINDING NORM | AMBIGUITY + KEY QUESTIONS  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  (a) Consistent with the purposes of the United Nations, including to maintain international peace and security, States should cooperate in developing and applying measures to increase stability and security in the use of ICTs and to prevent ICT practices that are acknowledged to be harmful or that may pose threats to international peace and security; | How will 'cooperation' be assessed?

These criticisms can be considered a standalone metacontestation over the existing UN process writ large. Its critics question whether the UN process has been sufficiently impactful, whether it is worth pursuing further, and whether it ought to be replaced with a different process. These arguments focus on (1) the broad scope and vague nature of agreements, (2) the inadequacy of addressing the deteriorating security environment, (3) the hidden agendas, including hypocrisy, of some stakeholders, and (4) the disconnect between those negotiating and those carrying out offensive operations.\n1. Broad scope and vague nature of agreements A common critique from officials in national security agencies is that the framework developed by the UNGGE is too broad and too vague to be truly effective at establishing rules of the road adhered to by those carrying out offensive cyber operations (Burgess 2018; Baker 2017; Fischerkeller and Harknett 2018). Their skepticism reflects the still nascent and continuously maturing understanding of the technology's impact on the balance\nSpringer\n#\nASSER PRESS\nT.

(2017)\nof power, its use as an instrument of statecraft, and the security dilemma that is as present online as it is offline. As an alternative approach, this group of stakeholders proposes to focus on agreements based on emerging state practice and more narrowly defined areas of common interest as the basis for cyber norms that\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\ncould then be expanded over time (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2018; Fischerkeller 2018).Inadequacy of addressing deteriorating security environment A separate point of critique of the UNGGE process makes the opposite argument. Instead of viewing the UNGGE's framework as too broad and ambitious, this separate camp of critics argues that the UNGGE process has not been ambitious enough. They see a functional need for international cooperation among governments and transnational cooperation among nongovernmental actors to address the deteriorating cybersecurity environment. A leading voice of this group is the multinational company Microsoft. After years of being involved in international cyber norms discussions, Microsoft CEO Brad Smith elevated the company's engagement to an unprecedented level by calling for a Digital Geneva Convention (Smith 2017; Meredith 2018). In the wake of the economic costs caused by the 2017 WannaCry and NotPetya, these voices have become louder with a growing number of CEOs joining the chorus (Greenberg 2018; Cybersecurity Tech Accord 2018; Siemens 2018). In addition, the UN Secretary General made the topic a priority in 2018 supporting a more ambitious agenda (Khalip 2018; Fidler 2018).This group of norm entrepreneurs remains very active trying to further advance the cyber norms discussion by keeping the pressure on governments. For example, Microsoft broadened its efforts beyond its engagement as a single company by creating the ‘Tech Accord' consortium counting more than 70 global companies at the beginning of 2019 (Cybersecurity Tech Accord 2018). In late 2017, Siemens established a nonrival network of a dozen companies creating a ‘Charter of Trust' focusing specifically on supply chain integrity (Siemens 2018). Meanwhile, the Dutch government led the charge to add a norm protecting the core of the Internet to the list of norms agreed to through the 2015 UNGGE (Broeders 2016). The French government's desire to maximize the impact of the Paris Peace Forum launched in 2018 at the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I led to the adoption of the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace in November 2018 that explicitly references the norm to protect the core of the Internet (France Diplomatie 2018). The Paris Call has also been described as an umbrella framework for the activities of various norm entrepreneurs. Hidden agendas Those promoting a more ambitious agenda have encountered a number of challenges due to the dynamics among and within governments. First, among governments, calls for a treaty have been met with resistance by Western governments. Concerned about Moscow's true intentions, these governments worry that any push for a treaty will empower Moscow's longstanding proposal. Their concerns explain continued resistance by Washington and Western capitals\nwith respect to the draft International Code of Conduct that Moscow and Beijing developed in 2011, updated in 2015, and have been promoting since (see McKune 2015.) They also help explain why Microsoft's call for a Digital Geneva Convention has met similar resistance and illustrate that overcoming this path dependence would require exceptional circumstances. Second, within governments, national security agencies are reluctant to internalize and adhere to the norms reflected in the UNGGE agreements due to the still nascent understanding of the domain, a related desire to preserve options until a mature strategic framework has emerged, and the dynamics of the security dilemma (Burgess 2018, Efrony and Shany 2018). A good illustration of this still maturing understanding of the technology is the argument promoted by some that there is moral obligation to use hacking instead of conventional weaponry if the effects of the former are less harmful than the latter (Hollis 2014). Disconnect between those negotiating and those conducting offensive cyber operations A final obstacle worth mentioning—rather in form of a hypothesis than conclusive analysis—is that a particular challenge for negotiating cyber norms may be that the conduct of offensive cyber operations originated in and continues to be closely tied to intelligence agencies, the most secretive parts of any government (Smeets 2018). Until recently, their public engagement was minimal. For example, the acronym of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) has been commonly referred to as ‘No Such Agency.' The bureaucratic culture of these agencies is therefore not infused with a history of interactions with their respective counterparts internationally (apart from the norms governing spy swaps that emerged during the Cold War.) Unlike the militaries of the world that—despite fighting each other—have developed norms for the exchange of prisoners, the treatment of the wounded, and other activity, this sort of interaction is not part of intelligence agencies' DNA. With that said, the pace of change affecting intelligence agencies in the past 5 years alone is breathtaking with potential changing attitudes toward such interactions. For example, from the NSA to the Australian signals directorate, agencies now even have active Twitter accounts and terms such as Five Eyes have become household names (Australian Signals Directorate 2018).\n## The Flipside: The Impact of Cyber Norms on Existing Norms\nNot only have existing international law and norms shaped the thinking about behavior in cyberspace but, on the flipside, the discussion about cyber norms has had an impact on existing international law and norms more broadly. For example, the affirmation of states' commitment to foundational norms of the international system such as sovereignty, the UN Charter, and international law have reinforced these\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\nfoundational norms. Moreover, in addition to what has been affirmed and included through the UNGGE process, it is important to take into account what has been excluded. For example, breaches of confidentiality of data for espionage purposes have been deliberately excluded from the UNGGE process, both with respect to economic and political espionage. This exclusion in and of itself reflects normativity.\nThe best case study showing how the cyber norms discussion has impacted intersubjective agreement on existing international law and norms is indeed the debate over espionage. While ultimately not included in UNGGE process, the role of intelligence collection activity has been part of the discussions. Particularly in the aftermath of Edward Snowden, some countries such as Brazil and Germany were keen to discuss potential norms with respect to political espionage. However, they introduced their resolutions in the UN General Assembly's Third Committee rather than through the First Committee and UNGGE process (Abdenur and Gama 2015).29 Other countries, namely the U.S., opposed such initiatives arguing that political espionage is not prohibited under international law but constitutes legitimate intelligence collection. In short, while contested by some, the debate starting in 2013 reinforced the existing norms governing political intelligence collection overall.\nAt the same time, the U.S. government has been very keen to reinforce the norm against economic espionage, namely the theft of intellectual property for competitive advantage, as the U.S. is specifically concerned by China's cyber-enabled behavior. In fact, of the five norms that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry outlined as U.S. government priorities in 2015, one of the five focused on economic espionage30 (Kerry 2015). While mentioned in the same context of cyber norms in his speech, the U.S. government did not pursue this issue through the UNGGE process to avoid introducing espionage to the First Committee discussions. Instead, the U.S. government pursued a bilateral agreement with China31 and subsequently a G20 communique incorporating the language of the bilateral agreement.\nHow challenging it has been for the U.S. government to communicate its nuanced view and differentiation between legitimate political espionage and illegitimate economic espionage is illustrated by the Chinese government's misperception of Washington's demands. In 2015, the U.S. government was requesting that Beijing arrest Chinese hackers responsible for economic espionage (Nakashima and Goldman 2015). Beijing eventually responded by presenting the arrest of hackers allegedly for the breach of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and theft of confidential\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\ndata of U.S. government employees (Noble 2015). In light of the public outrage among members of the U.S. Congress over the OPM breach, Beijing apparently believed the arrests would address the U.S. government's demand (Hosenball and Zengerle 2015). The White House was subsequently at pains trying to communicate to Beijing that the U.S. government actually believed that the OPM breach—as much as it despised its occurrence—had been a legitimate activity and therefore did not expect the arrest of those hackers but instead wanted Beijing to crack down on those carrying out economic espionage.\n## Conclusion and Broader Reflections\nInternational consensus on norms for cyberspace remains in its infancy. Nevertheless, there have been active international discussions on norms for cyberspace since the late 1990s. In addition, states and non-state actors have been using offensive cyber operations for years. These discussions and activities do not take place in isolation but have been shaping cyber norms. The UNGGE process has contributed to the international community's understanding of norms for cyberspace by crystallizing the core tensions, affirming and thereby reinforcing the applicability of existing international law, and becoming an incubator for the construction of new norms and diffusion thereof.\nThe collapse of the 2017 UNGGE marks a caesura in the international discussion on cyber norms. The process collapsed due to a combination of geopolitical tensions, competing tactics, and growing pressure to open the process to others. Relations between Russia and the U.S. the drivers behind the UNGGE process, were at an historic low. Most argue the relationship is at its worst since the end of the Cold War, some even argue there is less dialogue now than during the Cold War. It is therefore not surprising that participants privately only gave the 2016/2017 UNGGE a 50/50 chance of success at its beginning. While future analysis may consider the failure of the 2017 UNGGE only a temporary set-back in the diplomatic process, it is a caesura nevertheless. Importantly, the 2017 collapse of the UNGGE process demonstrates that rising geopolitical tensions and heightened security concerns trumped growing pressures to address the functional need to cooperate in light of the deteriorating security environment illustrated by WannaCry and NotPetya.\nStarting in the fall of 2019, there will be a new UNGGE and a new open-ended working group—the “mess in New York” as one ambassador called it. This outcome was not by design, the U.S. and Russia simply could not agree on a compromise resolution like they had in the past. Countries caught in the middle then thought it was best not to alienate either and voted for both the American proposal for a\nnew UNGGE and the Russian proposal for an open-ended working group (Grigsby 2017). Both remain anchored in the UN General Assembly's First Committee that created the five UNGGEs. How to make sense of them and establish some sort of complementarity was left to the UN Secretariat. If and how the two processes will build on each other remains an open question (as of August 2019). It is also unclear whether the U.S. will buy into the open-ended working group based on Russia's proposal and vice versa with respect to the UNGGE or if they will try to sabotage the other.\nSome states plan to use the two new processes to focus on how best to operationalize the agreed upon norms. Capacity-building is emerging as a priority, although it is unclear how this will differ from past commitments to capacity-building (UNIDIR 2019). Moreover, neither process is likely to address the question how those states behind some of the most aggressive activity in the past, namely Iran and North Korea, can become deterred from similar activity in the future. A key indicator for future developments will be the generational transition among the chief negotiators in coming years. When the godfather and godmother of cyber norms, Andrey Krutskikh and Michele Markoff, step down, the question will be whether their successors will pursue the same strategies or make incremental or even transformational changes. This transition is likely to also raise the question if China will assume a more active role in this discussion and how its behavior will shape cyber norms in the future.\nIn short, neither the new UNGGE nor the open-ended working group are likely to produce a diplomatic breakthrough by 2021. Despite growing pressures on governments, particularly from multinational companies (Microsoft 2018: Part 1 and 2; Cybersecurity Tech Accord 2018; France Diplomatie 2018) as well as a few NGOs to address the deteriorating cybersecurity environment as a functional need (Mitrany 1943), some states are becoming even more reluctant to pursue a more ambitious multilateral agenda (Sanger 2018). For example, the U.S. government has started focusing on holding actors accountable and enforcing the norms agreed to through the 2015 UNGGE (Hollis and Waxman 2018; White House 2018b). After years of primarily cyber threat intelligence companies exposing state-sponsored cyber operations (Mandiant 2013), the U.S. and other governments have become increasingly active in attributing such activity and doing so in a coordinated fashion. For example, the U.S. and other governments released statements holding Russia accountable for the NotPetya malware attack on the eve of the 2018 Munich Security Conference.\n### Broader Reflections\nWith respect to the bigger picture, the twenty-year old negotiations among states about cyber norms are a microcosm of the broader changes in world politics and the international system at the beginning of the 21^{st} century. They reflect the resurgence of great power rivalry, competing value propositions, and strategic decisions in the face of a global technology revolution. Russia's determination to remain a globally relevant actor, China's desire to shape the world order of the 21st century, and the U.S. attempt to retain its dominant position all permeate the international\ndiscussions on which rules apply to cyberspace and how. These debates also foreshadow broader systemic tensions between clashing political systems and visions for the future of the liberal world order.\nSo what does the process so far tell us about how norms emerge for cyberspace? It is clear that the top-down approach of the diplomatic negotiations is only one piece of the puzzle. While the UN process has certainly contributed to strengthening intersubjective agreement on what behavior is considered (in)appropriate in cyberspace, recent developments have exposed its shortcomings. Existing international law does provide a baseline framework but how it applies and what norms govern the new types of effects and resulting gaps in existing international law remains unclear. Efforts such as the Tallinn Manual and the voluntary norms outlined in the 2015 UNGGE reports are useful attempts to clarify these open questions, yet states are proceedings cautiously. Meanwhile, state practice is slowly emerging and becoming increasingly visible to others (Chesney 2019; Barnes and Gibbons-Neff 2019). The two are likely to increasingly converge in coming years providing fresh impetus for the construction and internalization of norms for cyberspace.\nNye has pointed out that “norms and institutions develop much more slowly than technology” (Nye 2018: 23). Part of the reason is that states continue to struggle on multiple fronts. States are still struggling with conceptualizing the technology and its implications which hampers the development of coherent strategies and policies. For example, in the U.S. the State Department's pursuit of a framework for stability and the cyber deterrence initiative announced by the White House in 2018 are disconnected from the development of the strategic concept of ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defend forward' outlined in the 2018 Command Vision for U.S. Cyber Command (Department of State 2018; White House 2018a; U.S. Cyber Command 2018). Western governments are revisiting their split of cyber operations from information operations in the early 2000s in light of Moscow's and Beijing's more integrated doctrines, especially in the wake of Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. elections (ODNI 2017).\nStates are also struggling to keep pace with technological developments, the proliferation of capabilities, and the malicious use of these capabilities. For example, most cyber incidents of the past decade were surprises, from the Iranian Distributed Denial of Service attacks from 2011 to 2013 to North Korea's attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014, (White House 2015a, b; Department of Justice 2016). Meanwhile, the number of countries developing offensive cyber tools rose from half a dozen to over 30 countries between 2010 and 2017 (Clapper, Lettre, and Rogers 2017).\nUltimately, the two new processes at the UN reflect competing visions for the future of cyberspace raising important questions for members of the international community. Should states have more or less power? Will they tolerate the existing institutions governing the Internet consisting primarily of private transnational\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\n\nAcknowledgements Many thanks to Arun Sukumar, Duncan Hollis, Garrett Hinck, and Hannes Ebert in addition to two anonymous reviewers for providing feedback on an earlier draft of this article.",

With each attack causing several billions of U.S. dollars in economic damage worldwide, the cyber attacks raise the question: why did the international\n Co-Director, Cyber Policy Initiative, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 1779 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20036, USA\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\ncommunity through the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UNGGE) fail to reach a consensus on how to advance the emerging regime of norms for cyberspace? On the surface, states such as the US, Cuba and India argue that it was a disagreement over international law (Markoff 2017; Rodriguez 2017; Sukumar 2017). Yet, the iceberg underneath is a mix of great power politics, competing and occasionally clashing political systems, and continued uncertainty with respect to a new technology.\nOverall, states' approach to norms for cyberspace remains highly contested internationally among governments and fragmented domestically within governments. Cyber norms are still in their “constituting phase” (Wiener 2014). Agreed upon, explicitly stated norms are considered voluntary, defined vaguely, and internalized weakly (Farrell and Glaser 2017: 16). Implicit state practice is slowly emerging, yet poorly understood, and cloaked in secrecy. Nevertheless, the diplomatic activities over the past two decades have shaped significantly how governments think about cyber norms and how they behave accordingly (Nye 2018).\nTo understand the dynamics of the international cyber norms contestation, various lenses can be applied. In addition to signs of the security dilemma impacting states' behavior (Buchanan 2017), competing conceptual approaches and key terms explain this outcome. These include key concepts such as ‘norms' (Finnemore and Hollis 2016), ‘deterrence' (White House 2018a), even ‘information security' and ‘cyber security' (Maurer and Morgus 2014), with new concepts such as ‘persistent engagement' (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2018) complementing the mix. Each of them is associated with a specific bureaucratic agency advancing its own agenda. Even the behavior of individual actors is worth mentioning as the two key diplomats in the U.S. and Russia leading these negotiations have not changed in the last 20 years achieving unusual influence setting the agenda, strategies, and pace of the discussions since the process began.\nThis state of affairs raises several important questions: how do norms emerge for cyberspace? What has been the contribution of the UN process to the international community's understanding of norms for cyberspace? Why did the process collapse in 2017, the very same year that two of the biggest cyber attacks to date caused indiscriminate economic harm worldwide? And why did member states, in an unprecedented move in the UN's history, create two processes dedicated to the same issue in 2018? This article investigates these questions and presents a deep dive into what cyber norms are all about.\nThe analysis of the dynamic process of norm contestation in this area is divided into several sections. The first section focuses on how the competing and\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\n\n## 2 The Big Confusion: What Are (Cyber) Norms in the First Place?\nThere is severe confusion about cyber norms. It is not uncommon to encounter statements from diplomats implying that norms, per definition, are voluntary in nature and never legally binding—in contradiction to the decades-old academic literature of sociology and international relations theory. What is to blame for the confusion? Politics and the gap between academics and practitioners. Yet, this confusion also reflects an undercurrent of competing political systems that affects the terminology used in this area. It is therefore worth briefly unpacking what (cyber) norms are and how to define them given the implications for contestation.\nOne of the key points of confusion centers on the relationship between norms and laws. In academia, scholars debate whether legal norms enjoy a special status compared to norms generally. Finnemore argues they do not because “There are, after all, many kinds of norms in the world—social, cultural, professional, moral, religious, and familial” (Finnemore 1999: 701). Others argue that norms tied to law stand out because of the level of compliance given rise to concepts such as ‘soft law’ and ‘hard law’ (Abbott and Snidal 2000; see Jose (2018): 25). More recently, Finnemore and Hollis concluded that “Simply put, laws can serve as a basis for formulating norms, just as norms can be codified in law” (Finnemore and Hollis 2016: 442).\nIn international politics, the concept of ‘voluntary norms’ emerged as a political strategy developed by the U.S. Department of State in juxtaposition to Russia’s proposal for a legally binding arms control treaty on information security. Moscow approached Washington with this idea in the late 1990s which the U.S. government opposed for several reasons. One of the key decision-makers involved, Richard Clarke, “viewed the Russian proposal as largely a propaganda tool” in addition to considering verification of a cyber agreement “impossible” and that “the U.S. had not yet explored what it wanted to do in the area of cyber war. It was not obvious then whether or not cyber war added to or subtracted from U.S. national security\n For a first discussion of cyber norms by academics, see Finnemore (2011) and Maurer (2011).\n There is a related discussion focusing on norm adoption and internalization through the lens of behavior “mimicry” see Goodman/Jinks (2013).\n More recently Percy in her 2007 study of the norm against mercenaries.\n With respect to sources of international law and the logic within the UN system, UNGGE reports generally barely matter. In international law, they would rank even below the ‘soft law’ nature of UN General Assembly resolutions.\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\n(Clarke and Knake 2011: 219)”. Other factors that have come up since are the quickly evolving nature of the technology challenging the longevity of a potential international treaty and growing concerns that the broad definition of ‘information security' advanced by Moscow and Beijing is a Trojan horse for content control and a human rights issue at heart. Another is the difficulty of attributing malicious cyber activity and the related ability to hold actors responsible (Rid and Buchanan 2015; Lindsay 2015; Brantly et al. 2016; Egloff and Wenger 2019).\nAfter the U.S. decided to reject the Russian proposal, it was in search for a strategy to advance its own agenda while still engaging with the Russians when the issue rose in prominence, namely after the 2007 DDoS attack against Estonia and the 2008 compromise of the classified networks of the U.S. Department of Defense. Principally opposed to a legally binding agreement as a goal, the U.S. government came up with the idea for the international community to develop ‘voluntary norms' in addition to arguing that existing international law applies to cyberspace. The 2015 UNGGE report therefore repeatedly highlights the “voluntary, non-binding” nature of the norms it outlines for cyberspace (UN Group of Governmental Experts 2015). The process that emerged out of these early days has since been scrutinized, including its dynamics and actors, by several scholars (Kavanagh and Stauffacher 2014; Hurwitz 2014; Cornish 2015; Farrell 2015; Erskine and Carr 2016; Tikk-Ringas 2016; Macák 2017; Hurel and Lobato 2018).\nUltimately, these factors explain the confusion and highlight the need to pay close attention what actors mean when they use the term ‘norm.'\n## Contestation, Norms, and Cyberspace\nAs a process, the cyber norms negotiations consist of norm contestation, which can be defined as “social practices which discursively express disapproval of norms” (Wiener 2014: 1). If there was no such contestation, all actors would have a shared understanding what norms apply and how. If they disagree, some form of contestation must be occurring and can lead to the weakening, reinforcing, adjusting, or replacing of a norm. That is why it is important to consider norms as much through the lens of a process as through a lens focused on products and explicit, agreed outcomes (Finnemore and Hollis 2016: 427). This contestation raises the question: what has been the contribution of the UN process to the international community's understanding of norms for cyberspace? First, the UNGGE process has helped crystallize\nthe underlying core tensions among the stakeholders involved as described in part 1 of this section. A second important contribution was the process leading to the affirmation of the applicability of existing international law by the international community, analyzed in part 2, as well as its role as an incubator for constructing new norms outlined in part 3. Part 4 details how these agreements have been diffused worldwide.\n### Part I: Contestation Over Key Terms\nThe fight over norms for cyberspace starts with the terminology. For authoritarian governments, preserving their political system and ensuring regime stability is the single most important goal. This explains why the term ‘information security' and the proposals by Moscow and Beijing have become so politically charged and contested. Originally, information security was a technical term focused on the protection of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information (International Organization for Standardization 2018). Over the past two decades, it has taken on a life of its own as Moscow and later on Beijing argued that information itself—content in other words—can be a threat, and in doing so, they have broadened the conceptualization of information security. As liberal democracies face empowered authoritarian regimes and a democratic backsliding worldwide (Diamond 2016), they opted to use ‘cybersecurity' excluding content to highlight the need to protect human rights in juxtaposition to this broader concept of ‘information security'. International negotiations have therefore touched on essentially two issues: (i) hacking and the related use of information and communications technology (ICT) and (ii) content and the related use of ICT.\nUN member states camouflage these differences and the underlying clashes of their political systems by referring to the vague “malicious use of ICT” throughout their documents at the UN and the G20 (UN Group of Governmental Experts 2015: 6; G7 2017). That way, liberal democratic governments such as the U.S. and European countries can claim that their concerns are limited to hacking and related use of ICT, thereby opposing discussions of content while authoritarian governments such as Russia and China can claim that this definition reflects their broader conceptualization of ‘information security.'\nTaking these political realities into account while striving for a robust and sound academic definition, cyber norms can be defined as standards of appropriate behavior with respect to the use of ICT inconsistent with the objectives of maintaining international stability and security. The value of this definition is that it sets cyber norms apart from the broader set of norms that shape our behavior online\nfrom dating online to shopping online. This definition of ‘cyber norms' combines (1) the standard definition of norms in International Relations theory (Katzenstein 1996: 5) with (2) the use of the term ‘cyber norms' in the international relations context, namely in the context of international security and the UNGGE process (General Assembly 1999).\nIn fact, the successful adoption UNGGE reports in 2010, 2013, and 2015 demonstrates that diplomats have been able to make progress despite their disagreement with respect to the scope of ‘information security.' John Rawls's ‘overlapping consensus' and Cass Sunstein's ‘incompletely theorized agreements' help explain why actors, including states, can agree on particular norms despite divergent values (Rawls 1971; Sunstein 2007). The use of offensive cyber operations that could pose a threat to international stability and security is such an area with greater intersubjective agreement. Hacking has enabled a diffusion of reach for actors around the world to create effects remotely, the truly novel and unique aspect of the technology, ranging from stealing data to manipulating centrifuges of nuclear enrichment facilities or disrupting power supply (Maurer 2018: 26--27).\n### Part 2: Contestation Over Existing Norms\nTo analyze the impact of existing norms, namely existing international law, it is worth noting that some scholars propose to differentiate between norm ‘validity contestation' and norm ‘application contestation' (Zimmermann et al. 2017: 699). Norm validity contestation involves actors debating whether a norm or a set of norms is valid generally and to be upheld. Norm application contestation does not challenge whether a norm or set of norms is generally valid but whether it “is appropriate for a given situation...over time and varying local contexts, such application discourses often lead to evolving interpretations of a norm, in line with new technological inventions” (Zimmermann et al. 2017: 699).\nThese distinctions are particularly useful with respect to norms and emerging technologies. Yet, applying the concept of validity and application contestation to cyber norms raises a conceptual challenge because cyberspace is viewed by an increasing number of states not only as a new technology but as a standalone “domain” of human interaction complementing the conventional military domains of operation—land, sea, air, and space (Lynn 2010). The special status of cyberspace as a domain has fueled arguments that it requires its own set of rules.\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\n\nGenerally speaking, the question whether international law applies to behavior online is an example of validity contestation. China's refusal until 2013 to affirm that international law generally applies to cyberspace constitutes such validity contestation. In fact, China's argument for the need to negotiate international law anew can be seen within the context of its broader contestation of the liberal world order and validity of its norms. Seen in this light, China's behavior reflects a general challenge to the validity of norms that solidified in the aftermath of World War II including with respect to rules of the road for cyberspace. It was not until the 2013 UNGGE consensus report that China was willing to change its position. In this case, the impact of the cyber norms discussion and China's temporary contestation on existing norms was to ultimately reinforce the latter with several governments including Russia's explicitly affirming their views that international law does apply (Koh 2015; Putin 2016; Wright 2018).\n## 3.2.2 Cyber Norms and Application Contestation\nFollowing the 2013 consensus that international law generally applies to cyberspace, application contestation has become the dominant dynamic in the cyber norms process. Discussing how international law applies was part of the 2016/2017 UNGGE's mandate. It was also one of the reasons why the UNGGE collapsed in 2017 because its members could not agree on whether or not to include an explicit reference in the UNGGE report specifying that international humanitarian law (IHL) applies to cyberspace. According to the U.S. representative, “those who are unwilling to affirm the applicability of these international [humanitarian] legal rules and principles believe their States are free to act in or through cyberspace to achieve their political ends with no limits or constraints on their actions” (Markoff 2017).\n Part of China's argument was that affirming the applicability of international law would have unintended consequences namely contributing to the militarization of cyberspace. I thank Arun Sukumar for highlighting this point.\n The Doctrine of Information Security of the Russian Federation approved by Decree of the President of the Russian Federation on December 5, 2016, states in paragraph 4 as a basic notion that “The Constitution of the Russian Federation, universally recognized principles and norms of international law, international treaties signed by the Russian Federation...form the legal framework of the Doctrine” specifying in paragraph 34 that “Information security activities of government bodies is based on the following principles...(e) compliance with the universally recognized principles and norms of international law, international treaties to which the Russian Federation is a party and laws of the Russian Federation.”\n There is an inherent contradiction in states’ positions having on the one hand confirmed that existing international law applies but then refusing to affirm that a subset of existing international law, international humanitarian law, applies. While the latter could be considered another example of validity contestation, it is included in the section on application contestation due to the previous affirmation that existing international law generally does apply.\n It is worth noting that the US government also contests the validity of certain parts of international law. For example, the US government does not recognize due diligence as a legal concept applying to cyberspace. See Schmitt (2015a) on due diligence.\nT. Maurer\nCuba also issued a statement explaining that the reason why it and other states including China rejected affirming the applicability of IHL in the context of ICT “since it would legitimize a scenario of war and military actions in the context of ICT” referencing “unilateral punitive force actions, including the application of sanctions and even military action by States claiming to be victims of illicit uses of ICTs” (Rodriguez 2017). An Indian expert on the UNGGE, Arun Sukumar, has since pointed out that “This argument, however, is really about military objectives. Countries that are rapidly scaling up their offensive cyber capabilities are buying time to test the effects of new weapons on civilian networks and critical infrastructure. To commit to the applicability of IHL, they fear, would be to foreclose the development and testing of some cyber weapons that may have unintended consequences” (Sukumar 2017).\nSukumar’s statement implies that, in his view, it was interests rather than identity that drove states’ behavior. There are two characteristics of offensive cyber operations that lend weight to this assessment. First, the more sophisticated an actor, the more precise such an actor can be in limiting the effect of malware (Maurer 2018: 10–11). Second, the more sophisticated an actor, the easier it is for such an actor to successfully attribute the source of malicious cyber activity. IHL is based on norms such as distinguishing between civilian and military targets and proportionality. Both depend on precision. Similarly, the exercise of the right to self-defense and use of countermeasures depend on the ability to trace malicious activity back to its source territory. This explains why Sukumar argues that “In reality, Cuba and others are concerned that an endorsement of the ‘right to self-defense’ will undermine asymmetric advantages which states that do not enjoy conventional superiority over their adversaries may have in cyberspace” (Sukumar 2017). Through this lens, the debate over international law with respect to cyberspace is an example of the concept of ‘lawfare’ (Kennedy 2006). Ultimately, both—interests and identity—are likely to have influenced states’ behavior in this context.\nDespite the disagreements over whether to explicitly affirm its applicability, emerging state practice in cyberspace so far seems to suggest that states’ behavior is strongly influenced by IHL. With the exception of the Stuxnet malware whose effects according to some international lawyers can be considered equivalent to the ‘use of force’, all other incidents publicly known to date have remained below this threshold and often aligned with principles of IHL. This possibly illustrates\n Sukumar in an email dated March 3, 2019, noted that “self-actualization of ‘identity’ of states in this domain is still a work in progress and therefore, it would not be surprising if individual positions were to change over the course of subsequent rounds of negotiations but, of course, short term interests have a great role in shaping that identity.”.\n If one rejects this assessment and instead takes the Cuban statement at face value as echoing others’ concerns over a militarization of the Internet, it reflects the different approaches between pacifists and Dunantists. Pacifists advocate for the abolition of war. Dunantists follow Henry Dunant’s humanitarian footsteps acknowledging that wars will occur (at least in their lifetime) and therefore focus on making it less cruel.\n The temporary 6-h blackout in Ukraine in 2015 caused by a cyber attack is not considered a violation of the 2015 UNGGE norm protecting critical infrastructure, at least by the U.S. government which considers Ukraine to have been in a state of armed conflict at the time (Markoff et al 2017). I thank Duncan\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\na significant degree of restraint by states in the use of available offensive tools and deliberate design thereof. With that said, it is also worth noting that despite some states having explicitly affirmed that they consider IHL to apply to cyberspace, their international lawyers have yet to agree on how it applies specifically. This lack of clarity is not limited to highly specific scenarios but extends to such foundational questions as to whether data enjoys the status of an object as such, which in turn determines whether distinctions between military and civilian objects apply (Schmitt 2013, 2015b).\n## 3.3 Part 3: Contestation Over the Emergence of Cyber Norms\nThe key challenge for the international community to address is what some scholars have called ‘subthreshold activity’: effects caused by malicious cyber activity below the threshold of ‘use of force’/‘armed attack’ (Lin 2012). That is also why the discussion about cyber norms has been driven by an “effects-based logic” (Farrell and Glaser 2017). Norms governing subthreshold effects through cyberspace are less a question of applicability of existing international law but best described through the lens of cyber norm emergence.\nThe contestation over the emergence of cyber norms ties back to the initial Russian proposal for an arms control treaty focusing on information security. A main point of contestation since then has been over whether a new, legally binding treaty is required to codify new norms for cyberspace or whether a soft law approach is better suited. Moscow has continued to promote the idea of a treaty through a draft International Code of Conduct and by circulating a draft convention (McKune 2015; Russian MOFA 2011). The Shanghai Cooperation Organization and partnering with China has been the main vehicle for this effort. Meanwhile, the U.S. and its Western allies have used the London Conference on Cyberspace series to advocate for their vision (UK 2011). With that said, this bifurcation into two camps became murkier when Microsoft launched its campaign for a Digital Geneva Convention in 2017 (Microsoft 2017).\nDespite this broader contestation, the governmental experts were able to reach agreement on a list of eleven voluntary, nonbinding norms outlined in their 2015 UNGGE report. Figure 1 details this list together with a set of questions to help\nFootnote 20 (continued)\nHollis for pointing out that this does not mean that the attack did not potentially violate provisions of IHL, for example, with respect to the indiscriminate targeting of civilians.\n This article disagrees with the assessment that states are developing a “policy of optionality toward the application of international law” as suggested by Efrony and Shany (2018: 648–649) and instead attributes the lack of clarity and explicit statements to the still nascent understanding and nature of cyber norms.\n See, for example, Hathaway et al (2012); Schmitt and Vihul (2014); Eichensehr (2014).\n According to the norm life cycle, norm entrepreneurs will help advance the emergence of a new norm that can eventually reach a tipping point. Once a sufficient number of relevant actors support the norm for it to reach a cascade, the norm becomes internalized reflecting normal patterns of behavior with only sporadic violations (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998).\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\ndetermine their level of ambiguity (for discussion of different levels of ambiguity generally, see Jose (2018) 27; Abbott et al. (2000) 415). Complementing the affirmation that existing international law applies, the voluntary nature of these norms is reflected by the use of “should” rather than “must” or “are obliged to”. Moreover, the U.S. has explicitly promoted behavior that it does not consider to be part of international law as norms. Assessing the level of compliance therefore primarily depends on the state whose compliance is being assessed having explicitly affirmed that it will adhere to the described standard of appropriate behavior. Also, the meaning of these voluntary norms remains contested. It is also unclear if all states are committed to all eleven norms equally. For example, the U.S. government had explicitly proposed four of the eleven norms (Kerry 2015). Is it equally committed to the other seven it agreed to in 2015? What about other countries' priorities?\nWith respect to the diffusion of the agreed upon statements on norms, Fig. 2 shows various international accords over the past decade since the first successful UNGGE started convening in 2009 (Maurer et al. 2017). The list shows a timeline of relevant multilateral accords explicitly referencing cyber norms. This includes successful UNGGE reports which were subsequently endorsed by heads of states at the G20, the G7, and in other multilateral and bilateral statements. These efforts demonstrate that the “socialization tools employed to make the norm effective” include a mix of global and regional institutions to help diffuse the agreements reached and to support the norms reaching a tipping point and cascading effect (Finnemore and Hollis 2016: 428). Specifically noteworthy is the significantly increasing number of such accords starting in 2015 and thereafter contributing to the diffusion of the norms agreed to in the 2015 UNGGE report. Many of these are the result of a deliberate effort by UNGGE member states to increase awareness of the UNGGE process among non-UNGGE member states and thereby enhance its universality, legitimacy, and global adherence.\n### Part 4: Contestation Over Access to Contestation\nWho gets to sit at the table and participate in the discussions about norms for cyberspace has also been contested. UNGGEs were restricted clubs with membership limited to initially 15 and eventually 25 member states with the composition changing from one UNGGE to the next. While the consistent participation of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council provided a minimum of legitimacy, other countries have criticized the restrictive membership as cybersecurity rose on the agenda. In fact, for the UNGGE established in 2016 with its 25 members, nearly three times as many member states expressed their desire to be part of the group reflecting a desire to move from being norm takers to being norm shapers. In other words, it is a reflection of contestation over ‘access to contestation' as a pre-condition for agency and participation in contestation in the first place (Wiener 2017).\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\n|  VOLUNTARY, NONBINDING NORM | AMBIGUITY + KEY QUESTIONS  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  (a) Consistent with the purposes of the United Nations, including to maintain international peace and security, States should cooperate in developing and applying measures to increase stability and security in the use of ICTs and to prevent ICT practices that are acknowledged to be harmful or that may pose threats to international peace and security; | How will 'cooperation' be assessed?

These criticisms can be considered a standalone metacontestation over the existing UN process writ large. Its critics question whether the UN process has been sufficiently impactful, whether it is worth pursuing further, and whether it ought to be replaced with a different process. These arguments focus on (1) the broad scope and vague nature of agreements, (2) the inadequacy of addressing the deteriorating security environment, (3) the hidden agendas, including hypocrisy, of some stakeholders, and (4) the disconnect between those negotiating and those carrying out offensive operations.\n1. Broad scope and vague nature of agreements A common critique from officials in national security agencies is that the framework developed by the UNGGE is too broad and too vague to be truly effective at establishing rules of the road adhered to by those carrying out offensive cyber operations (Burgess 2018; Baker 2017; Fischerkeller and Harknett 2018). Their skepticism reflects the still nascent and continuously maturing understanding of the technology's impact on the balance\nSpringer\n#\nASSER PRESS\nT.

(2017)\nof power, its use as an instrument of statecraft, and the security dilemma that is as present online as it is offline. As an alternative approach, this group of stakeholders proposes to focus on agreements based on emerging state practice and more narrowly defined areas of common interest as the basis for cyber norms that\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\ncould then be expanded over time (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2018; Fischerkeller 2018).Inadequacy of addressing deteriorating security environment A separate point of critique of the UNGGE process makes the opposite argument. Instead of viewing the UNGGE's framework as too broad and ambitious, this separate camp of critics argues that the UNGGE process has not been ambitious enough. They see a functional need for international cooperation among governments and transnational cooperation among nongovernmental actors to address the deteriorating cybersecurity environment. A leading voice of this group is the multinational company Microsoft. After years of being involved in international cyber norms discussions, Microsoft CEO Brad Smith elevated the company's engagement to an unprecedented level by calling for a Digital Geneva Convention (Smith 2017; Meredith 2018). In the wake of the economic costs caused by the 2017 WannaCry and NotPetya, these voices have become louder with a growing number of CEOs joining the chorus (Greenberg 2018; Cybersecurity Tech Accord 2018; Siemens 2018). In addition, the UN Secretary General made the topic a priority in 2018 supporting a more ambitious agenda (Khalip 2018; Fidler 2018).This group of norm entrepreneurs remains very active trying to further advance the cyber norms discussion by keeping the pressure on governments. For example, Microsoft broadened its efforts beyond its engagement as a single company by creating the ‘Tech Accord' consortium counting more than 70 global companies at the beginning of 2019 (Cybersecurity Tech Accord 2018). In late 2017, Siemens established a nonrival network of a dozen companies creating a ‘Charter of Trust' focusing specifically on supply chain integrity (Siemens 2018). Meanwhile, the Dutch government led the charge to add a norm protecting the core of the Internet to the list of norms agreed to through the 2015 UNGGE (Broeders 2016). The French government's desire to maximize the impact of the Paris Peace Forum launched in 2018 at the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I led to the adoption of the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace in November 2018 that explicitly references the norm to protect the core of the Internet (France Diplomatie 2018). The Paris Call has also been described as an umbrella framework for the activities of various norm entrepreneurs. Hidden agendas Those promoting a more ambitious agenda have encountered a number of challenges due to the dynamics among and within governments. First, among governments, calls for a treaty have been met with resistance by Western governments. Concerned about Moscow's true intentions, these governments worry that any push for a treaty will empower Moscow's longstanding proposal. Their concerns explain continued resistance by Washington and Western capitals\nwith respect to the draft International Code of Conduct that Moscow and Beijing developed in 2011, updated in 2015, and have been promoting since (see McKune 2015.) They also help explain why Microsoft's call for a Digital Geneva Convention has met similar resistance and illustrate that overcoming this path dependence would require exceptional circumstances. Second, within governments, national security agencies are reluctant to internalize and adhere to the norms reflected in the UNGGE agreements due to the still nascent understanding of the domain, a related desire to preserve options until a mature strategic framework has emerged, and the dynamics of the security dilemma (Burgess 2018, Efrony and Shany 2018). A good illustration of this still maturing understanding of the technology is the argument promoted by some that there is moral obligation to use hacking instead of conventional weaponry if the effects of the former are less harmful than the latter (Hollis 2014). Disconnect between those negotiating and those conducting offensive cyber operations A final obstacle worth mentioning—rather in form of a hypothesis than conclusive analysis—is that a particular challenge for negotiating cyber norms may be that the conduct of offensive cyber operations originated in and continues to be closely tied to intelligence agencies, the most secretive parts of any government (Smeets 2018). Until recently, their public engagement was minimal. For example, the acronym of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) has been commonly referred to as ‘No Such Agency.' The bureaucratic culture of these agencies is therefore not infused with a history of interactions with their respective counterparts internationally (apart from the norms governing spy swaps that emerged during the Cold War.) Unlike the militaries of the world that—despite fighting each other—have developed norms for the exchange of prisoners, the treatment of the wounded, and other activity, this sort of interaction is not part of intelligence agencies' DNA. With that said, the pace of change affecting intelligence agencies in the past 5 years alone is breathtaking with potential changing attitudes toward such interactions. For example, from the NSA to the Australian signals directorate, agencies now even have active Twitter accounts and terms such as Five Eyes have become household names (Australian Signals Directorate 2018).\n## The Flipside: The Impact of Cyber Norms on Existing Norms\nNot only have existing international law and norms shaped the thinking about behavior in cyberspace but, on the flipside, the discussion about cyber norms has had an impact on existing international law and norms more broadly. For example, the affirmation of states' commitment to foundational norms of the international system such as sovereignty, the UN Charter, and international law have reinforced these\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\nfoundational norms. Moreover, in addition to what has been affirmed and included through the UNGGE process, it is important to take into account what has been excluded. For example, breaches of confidentiality of data for espionage purposes have been deliberately excluded from the UNGGE process, both with respect to economic and political espionage. This exclusion in and of itself reflects normativity.\nThe best case study showing how the cyber norms discussion has impacted intersubjective agreement on existing international law and norms is indeed the debate over espionage. While ultimately not included in UNGGE process, the role of intelligence collection activity has been part of the discussions. Particularly in the aftermath of Edward Snowden, some countries such as Brazil and Germany were keen to discuss potential norms with respect to political espionage. However, they introduced their resolutions in the UN General Assembly's Third Committee rather than through the First Committee and UNGGE process (Abdenur and Gama 2015).29 Other countries, namely the U.S., opposed such initiatives arguing that political espionage is not prohibited under international law but constitutes legitimate intelligence collection. In short, while contested by some, the debate starting in 2013 reinforced the existing norms governing political intelligence collection overall.\nAt the same time, the U.S. government has been very keen to reinforce the norm against economic espionage, namely the theft of intellectual property for competitive advantage, as the U.S. is specifically concerned by China's cyber-enabled behavior. In fact, of the five norms that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry outlined as U.S. government priorities in 2015, one of the five focused on economic espionage30 (Kerry 2015). While mentioned in the same context of cyber norms in his speech, the U.S. government did not pursue this issue through the UNGGE process to avoid introducing espionage to the First Committee discussions. Instead, the U.S. government pursued a bilateral agreement with China31 and subsequently a G20 communique incorporating the language of the bilateral agreement.\nHow challenging it has been for the U.S. government to communicate its nuanced view and differentiation between legitimate political espionage and illegitimate economic espionage is illustrated by the Chinese government's misperception of Washington's demands. In 2015, the U.S. government was requesting that Beijing arrest Chinese hackers responsible for economic espionage (Nakashima and Goldman 2015). Beijing eventually responded by presenting the arrest of hackers allegedly for the breach of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and theft of confidential\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\ndata of U.S. government employees (Noble 2015). In light of the public outrage among members of the U.S. Congress over the OPM breach, Beijing apparently believed the arrests would address the U.S. government's demand (Hosenball and Zengerle 2015). The White House was subsequently at pains trying to communicate to Beijing that the U.S. government actually believed that the OPM breach—as much as it despised its occurrence—had been a legitimate activity and therefore did not expect the arrest of those hackers but instead wanted Beijing to crack down on those carrying out economic espionage.\n## Conclusion and Broader Reflections\nInternational consensus on norms for cyberspace remains in its infancy. Nevertheless, there have been active international discussions on norms for cyberspace since the late 1990s. In addition, states and non-state actors have been using offensive cyber operations for years. These discussions and activities do not take place in isolation but have been shaping cyber norms. The UNGGE process has contributed to the international community's understanding of norms for cyberspace by crystallizing the core tensions, affirming and thereby reinforcing the applicability of existing international law, and becoming an incubator for the construction of new norms and diffusion thereof.\nThe collapse of the 2017 UNGGE marks a caesura in the international discussion on cyber norms. The process collapsed due to a combination of geopolitical tensions, competing tactics, and growing pressure to open the process to others. Relations between Russia and the U.S. the drivers behind the UNGGE process, were at an historic low. Most argue the relationship is at its worst since the end of the Cold War, some even argue there is less dialogue now than during the Cold War. It is therefore not surprising that participants privately only gave the 2016/2017 UNGGE a 50/50 chance of success at its beginning. While future analysis may consider the failure of the 2017 UNGGE only a temporary set-back in the diplomatic process, it is a caesura nevertheless. Importantly, the 2017 collapse of the UNGGE process demonstrates that rising geopolitical tensions and heightened security concerns trumped growing pressures to address the functional need to cooperate in light of the deteriorating security environment illustrated by WannaCry and NotPetya.\nStarting in the fall of 2019, there will be a new UNGGE and a new open-ended working group—the “mess in New York” as one ambassador called it. This outcome was not by design, the U.S. and Russia simply could not agree on a compromise resolution like they had in the past. Countries caught in the middle then thought it was best not to alienate either and voted for both the American proposal for a\nnew UNGGE and the Russian proposal for an open-ended working group (Grigsby 2017). Both remain anchored in the UN General Assembly's First Committee that created the five UNGGEs. How to make sense of them and establish some sort of complementarity was left to the UN Secretariat. If and how the two processes will build on each other remains an open question (as of August 2019). It is also unclear whether the U.S. will buy into the open-ended working group based on Russia's proposal and vice versa with respect to the UNGGE or if they will try to sabotage the other.\nSome states plan to use the two new processes to focus on how best to operationalize the agreed upon norms. Capacity-building is emerging as a priority, although it is unclear how this will differ from past commitments to capacity-building (UNIDIR 2019). Moreover, neither process is likely to address the question how those states behind some of the most aggressive activity in the past, namely Iran and North Korea, can become deterred from similar activity in the future. A key indicator for future developments will be the generational transition among the chief negotiators in coming years. When the godfather and godmother of cyber norms, Andrey Krutskikh and Michele Markoff, step down, the question will be whether their successors will pursue the same strategies or make incremental or even transformational changes. This transition is likely to also raise the question if China will assume a more active role in this discussion and how its behavior will shape cyber norms in the future.\nIn short, neither the new UNGGE nor the open-ended working group are likely to produce a diplomatic breakthrough by 2021. Despite growing pressures on governments, particularly from multinational companies (Microsoft 2018: Part 1 and 2; Cybersecurity Tech Accord 2018; France Diplomatie 2018) as well as a few NGOs to address the deteriorating cybersecurity environment as a functional need (Mitrany 1943), some states are becoming even more reluctant to pursue a more ambitious multilateral agenda (Sanger 2018). For example, the U.S. government has started focusing on holding actors accountable and enforcing the norms agreed to through the 2015 UNGGE (Hollis and Waxman 2018; White House 2018b). After years of primarily cyber threat intelligence companies exposing state-sponsored cyber operations (Mandiant 2013), the U.S. and other governments have become increasingly active in attributing such activity and doing so in a coordinated fashion. For example, the U.S. and other governments released statements holding Russia accountable for the NotPetya malware attack on the eve of the 2018 Munich Security Conference.\n### Broader Reflections\nWith respect to the bigger picture, the twenty-year old negotiations among states about cyber norms are a microcosm of the broader changes in world politics and the international system at the beginning of the 21^{st} century. They reflect the resurgence of great power rivalry, competing value propositions, and strategic decisions in the face of a global technology revolution. Russia's determination to remain a globally relevant actor, China's desire to shape the world order of the 21st century, and the U.S. attempt to retain its dominant position all permeate the international\ndiscussions on which rules apply to cyberspace and how. These debates also foreshadow broader systemic tensions between clashing political systems and visions for the future of the liberal world order.\nSo what does the process so far tell us about how norms emerge for cyberspace? It is clear that the top-down approach of the diplomatic negotiations is only one piece of the puzzle. While the UN process has certainly contributed to strengthening intersubjective agreement on what behavior is considered (in)appropriate in cyberspace, recent developments have exposed its shortcomings. Existing international law does provide a baseline framework but how it applies and what norms govern the new types of effects and resulting gaps in existing international law remains unclear. Efforts such as the Tallinn Manual and the voluntary norms outlined in the 2015 UNGGE reports are useful attempts to clarify these open questions, yet states are proceedings cautiously. Meanwhile, state practice is slowly emerging and becoming increasingly visible to others (Chesney 2019; Barnes and Gibbons-Neff 2019). The two are likely to increasingly converge in coming years providing fresh impetus for the construction and internalization of norms for cyberspace.\nNye has pointed out that “norms and institutions develop much more slowly than technology” (Nye 2018: 23). Part of the reason is that states continue to struggle on multiple fronts. States are still struggling with conceptualizing the technology and its implications which hampers the development of coherent strategies and policies. For example, in the U.S. the State Department's pursuit of a framework for stability and the cyber deterrence initiative announced by the White House in 2018 are disconnected from the development of the strategic concept of ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defend forward' outlined in the 2018 Command Vision for U.S. Cyber Command (Department of State 2018; White House 2018a; U.S. Cyber Command 2018). Western governments are revisiting their split of cyber operations from information operations in the early 2000s in light of Moscow's and Beijing's more integrated doctrines, especially in the wake of Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. elections (ODNI 2017).\nStates are also struggling to keep pace with technological developments, the proliferation of capabilities, and the malicious use of these capabilities. For example, most cyber incidents of the past decade were surprises, from the Iranian Distributed Denial of Service attacks from 2011 to 2013 to North Korea's attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014, (White House 2015a, b; Department of Justice 2016). Meanwhile, the number of countries developing offensive cyber tools rose from half a dozen to over 30 countries between 2010 and 2017 (Clapper, Lettre, and Rogers 2017).\nUltimately, the two new processes at the UN reflect competing visions for the future of cyberspace raising important questions for members of the international community. Should states have more or less power? Will they tolerate the existing institutions governing the Internet consisting primarily of private transnational\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\n\nAcknowledgements Many thanks to Arun Sukumar, Duncan Hollis, Garrett Hinck, and Hannes Ebert in addition to two anonymous reviewers for providing feedback on an earlier draft of this article.",

With each attack causing several billions of U.S. dollars in economic damage worldwide, the cyber attacks raise the question: why did the international\n Co-Director, Cyber Policy Initiative, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 1779 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20036, USA\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\ncommunity through the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UNGGE) fail to reach a consensus on how to advance the emerging regime of norms for cyberspace? On the surface, states such as the US, Cuba and India argue that it was a disagreement over international law (Markoff 2017; Rodriguez 2017; Sukumar 2017). Yet, the iceberg underneath is a mix of great power politics, competing and occasionally clashing political systems, and continued uncertainty with respect to a new technology.\nOverall, states' approach to norms for cyberspace remains highly contested internationally among governments and fragmented domestically within governments. Cyber norms are still in their “constituting phase” (Wiener 2014). Agreed upon, explicitly stated norms are considered voluntary, defined vaguely, and internalized weakly (Farrell and Glaser 2017: 16). Implicit state practice is slowly emerging, yet poorly understood, and cloaked in secrecy. Nevertheless, the diplomatic activities over the past two decades have shaped significantly how governments think about cyber norms and how they behave accordingly (Nye 2018).\nTo understand the dynamics of the international cyber norms contestation, various lenses can be applied. In addition to signs of the security dilemma impacting states' behavior (Buchanan 2017), competing conceptual approaches and key terms explain this outcome. These include key concepts such as ‘norms' (Finnemore and Hollis 2016), ‘deterrence' (White House 2018a), even ‘information security' and ‘cyber security' (Maurer and Morgus 2014), with new concepts such as ‘persistent engagement' (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2018) complementing the mix. Each of them is associated with a specific bureaucratic agency advancing its own agenda. Even the behavior of individual actors is worth mentioning as the two key diplomats in the U.S. and Russia leading these negotiations have not changed in the last 20 years achieving unusual influence setting the agenda, strategies, and pace of the discussions since the process began.\nThis state of affairs raises several important questions: how do norms emerge for cyberspace? What has been the contribution of the UN process to the international community's understanding of norms for cyberspace? Why did the process collapse in 2017, the very same year that two of the biggest cyber attacks to date caused indiscriminate economic harm worldwide? And why did member states, in an unprecedented move in the UN's history, create two processes dedicated to the same issue in 2018? This article investigates these questions and presents a deep dive into what cyber norms are all about.\nThe analysis of the dynamic process of norm contestation in this area is divided into several sections. The first section focuses on how the competing and\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\n\n## 2 The Big Confusion: What Are (Cyber) Norms in the First Place?\nThere is severe confusion about cyber norms. It is not uncommon to encounter statements from diplomats implying that norms, per definition, are voluntary in nature and never legally binding—in contradiction to the decades-old academic literature of sociology and international relations theory. What is to blame for the confusion? Politics and the gap between academics and practitioners. Yet, this confusion also reflects an undercurrent of competing political systems that affects the terminology used in this area. It is therefore worth briefly unpacking what (cyber) norms are and how to define them given the implications for contestation.\nOne of the key points of confusion centers on the relationship between norms and laws. In academia, scholars debate whether legal norms enjoy a special status compared to norms generally. Finnemore argues they do not because “There are, after all, many kinds of norms in the world—social, cultural, professional, moral, religious, and familial” (Finnemore 1999: 701). Others argue that norms tied to law stand out because of the level of compliance given rise to concepts such as ‘soft law’ and ‘hard law’ (Abbott and Snidal 2000; see Jose (2018): 25). More recently, Finnemore and Hollis concluded that “Simply put, laws can serve as a basis for formulating norms, just as norms can be codified in law” (Finnemore and Hollis 2016: 442).\nIn international politics, the concept of ‘voluntary norms’ emerged as a political strategy developed by the U.S. Department of State in juxtaposition to Russia’s proposal for a legally binding arms control treaty on information security. Moscow approached Washington with this idea in the late 1990s which the U.S. government opposed for several reasons. One of the key decision-makers involved, Richard Clarke, “viewed the Russian proposal as largely a propaganda tool” in addition to considering verification of a cyber agreement “impossible” and that “the U.S. had not yet explored what it wanted to do in the area of cyber war. It was not obvious then whether or not cyber war added to or subtracted from U.S. national security\n For a first discussion of cyber norms by academics, see Finnemore (2011) and Maurer (2011).\n There is a related discussion focusing on norm adoption and internalization through the lens of behavior “mimicry” see Goodman/Jinks (2013).\n More recently Percy in her 2007 study of the norm against mercenaries.\n With respect to sources of international law and the logic within the UN system, UNGGE reports generally barely matter. In international law, they would rank even below the ‘soft law’ nature of UN General Assembly resolutions.\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\n(Clarke and Knake 2011: 219)”. Other factors that have come up since are the quickly evolving nature of the technology challenging the longevity of a potential international treaty and growing concerns that the broad definition of ‘information security' advanced by Moscow and Beijing is a Trojan horse for content control and a human rights issue at heart. Another is the difficulty of attributing malicious cyber activity and the related ability to hold actors responsible (Rid and Buchanan 2015; Lindsay 2015; Brantly et al. 2016; Egloff and Wenger 2019).\nAfter the U.S. decided to reject the Russian proposal, it was in search for a strategy to advance its own agenda while still engaging with the Russians when the issue rose in prominence, namely after the 2007 DDoS attack against Estonia and the 2008 compromise of the classified networks of the U.S. Department of Defense. Principally opposed to a legally binding agreement as a goal, the U.S. government came up with the idea for the international community to develop ‘voluntary norms' in addition to arguing that existing international law applies to cyberspace. The 2015 UNGGE report therefore repeatedly highlights the “voluntary, non-binding” nature of the norms it outlines for cyberspace (UN Group of Governmental Experts 2015). The process that emerged out of these early days has since been scrutinized, including its dynamics and actors, by several scholars (Kavanagh and Stauffacher 2014; Hurwitz 2014; Cornish 2015; Farrell 2015; Erskine and Carr 2016; Tikk-Ringas 2016; Macák 2017; Hurel and Lobato 2018).\nUltimately, these factors explain the confusion and highlight the need to pay close attention what actors mean when they use the term ‘norm.'\n## Contestation, Norms, and Cyberspace\nAs a process, the cyber norms negotiations consist of norm contestation, which can be defined as “social practices which discursively express disapproval of norms” (Wiener 2014: 1). If there was no such contestation, all actors would have a shared understanding what norms apply and how. If they disagree, some form of contestation must be occurring and can lead to the weakening, reinforcing, adjusting, or replacing of a norm. That is why it is important to consider norms as much through the lens of a process as through a lens focused on products and explicit, agreed outcomes (Finnemore and Hollis 2016: 427). This contestation raises the question: what has been the contribution of the UN process to the international community's understanding of norms for cyberspace? First, the UNGGE process has helped crystallize\nthe underlying core tensions among the stakeholders involved as described in part 1 of this section. A second important contribution was the process leading to the affirmation of the applicability of existing international law by the international community, analyzed in part 2, as well as its role as an incubator for constructing new norms outlined in part 3. Part 4 details how these agreements have been diffused worldwide.\n### Part I: Contestation Over Key Terms\nThe fight over norms for cyberspace starts with the terminology. For authoritarian governments, preserving their political system and ensuring regime stability is the single most important goal. This explains why the term ‘information security' and the proposals by Moscow and Beijing have become so politically charged and contested. Originally, information security was a technical term focused on the protection of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information (International Organization for Standardization 2018). Over the past two decades, it has taken on a life of its own as Moscow and later on Beijing argued that information itself—content in other words—can be a threat, and in doing so, they have broadened the conceptualization of information security. As liberal democracies face empowered authoritarian regimes and a democratic backsliding worldwide (Diamond 2016), they opted to use ‘cybersecurity' excluding content to highlight the need to protect human rights in juxtaposition to this broader concept of ‘information security'. International negotiations have therefore touched on essentially two issues: (i) hacking and the related use of information and communications technology (ICT) and (ii) content and the related use of ICT.\nUN member states camouflage these differences and the underlying clashes of their political systems by referring to the vague “malicious use of ICT” throughout their documents at the UN and the G20 (UN Group of Governmental Experts 2015: 6; G7 2017). That way, liberal democratic governments such as the U.S. and European countries can claim that their concerns are limited to hacking and related use of ICT, thereby opposing discussions of content while authoritarian governments such as Russia and China can claim that this definition reflects their broader conceptualization of ‘information security.'\nTaking these political realities into account while striving for a robust and sound academic definition, cyber norms can be defined as standards of appropriate behavior with respect to the use of ICT inconsistent with the objectives of maintaining international stability and security. The value of this definition is that it sets cyber norms apart from the broader set of norms that shape our behavior online\nfrom dating online to shopping online. This definition of ‘cyber norms' combines (1) the standard definition of norms in International Relations theory (Katzenstein 1996: 5) with (2) the use of the term ‘cyber norms' in the international relations context, namely in the context of international security and the UNGGE process (General Assembly 1999).\nIn fact, the successful adoption UNGGE reports in 2010, 2013, and 2015 demonstrates that diplomats have been able to make progress despite their disagreement with respect to the scope of ‘information security.' John Rawls's ‘overlapping consensus' and Cass Sunstein's ‘incompletely theorized agreements' help explain why actors, including states, can agree on particular norms despite divergent values (Rawls 1971; Sunstein 2007). The use of offensive cyber operations that could pose a threat to international stability and security is such an area with greater intersubjective agreement. Hacking has enabled a diffusion of reach for actors around the world to create effects remotely, the truly novel and unique aspect of the technology, ranging from stealing data to manipulating centrifuges of nuclear enrichment facilities or disrupting power supply (Maurer 2018: 26--27).\n### Part 2: Contestation Over Existing Norms\nTo analyze the impact of existing norms, namely existing international law, it is worth noting that some scholars propose to differentiate between norm ‘validity contestation' and norm ‘application contestation' (Zimmermann et al. 2017: 699). Norm validity contestation involves actors debating whether a norm or a set of norms is valid generally and to be upheld. Norm application contestation does not challenge whether a norm or set of norms is generally valid but whether it “is appropriate for a given situation...over time and varying local contexts, such application discourses often lead to evolving interpretations of a norm, in line with new technological inventions” (Zimmermann et al. 2017: 699).\nThese distinctions are particularly useful with respect to norms and emerging technologies. Yet, applying the concept of validity and application contestation to cyber norms raises a conceptual challenge because cyberspace is viewed by an increasing number of states not only as a new technology but as a standalone “domain” of human interaction complementing the conventional military domains of operation—land, sea, air, and space (Lynn 2010). The special status of cyberspace as a domain has fueled arguments that it requires its own set of rules.\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\n\nGenerally speaking, the question whether international law applies to behavior online is an example of validity contestation. China's refusal until 2013 to affirm that international law generally applies to cyberspace constitutes such validity contestation. In fact, China's argument for the need to negotiate international law anew can be seen within the context of its broader contestation of the liberal world order and validity of its norms. Seen in this light, China's behavior reflects a general challenge to the validity of norms that solidified in the aftermath of World War II including with respect to rules of the road for cyberspace. It was not until the 2013 UNGGE consensus report that China was willing to change its position. In this case, the impact of the cyber norms discussion and China's temporary contestation on existing norms was to ultimately reinforce the latter with several governments including Russia's explicitly affirming their views that international law does apply (Koh 2015; Putin 2016; Wright 2018).\n## 3.2.2 Cyber Norms and Application Contestation\nFollowing the 2013 consensus that international law generally applies to cyberspace, application contestation has become the dominant dynamic in the cyber norms process. Discussing how international law applies was part of the 2016/2017 UNGGE's mandate. It was also one of the reasons why the UNGGE collapsed in 2017 because its members could not agree on whether or not to include an explicit reference in the UNGGE report specifying that international humanitarian law (IHL) applies to cyberspace. According to the U.S. representative, “those who are unwilling to affirm the applicability of these international [humanitarian] legal rules and principles believe their States are free to act in or through cyberspace to achieve their political ends with no limits or constraints on their actions” (Markoff 2017).\n Part of China's argument was that affirming the applicability of international law would have unintended consequences namely contributing to the militarization of cyberspace. I thank Arun Sukumar for highlighting this point.\n The Doctrine of Information Security of the Russian Federation approved by Decree of the President of the Russian Federation on December 5, 2016, states in paragraph 4 as a basic notion that “The Constitution of the Russian Federation, universally recognized principles and norms of international law, international treaties signed by the Russian Federation...form the legal framework of the Doctrine” specifying in paragraph 34 that “Information security activities of government bodies is based on the following principles...(e) compliance with the universally recognized principles and norms of international law, international treaties to which the Russian Federation is a party and laws of the Russian Federation.”\n There is an inherent contradiction in states’ positions having on the one hand confirmed that existing international law applies but then refusing to affirm that a subset of existing international law, international humanitarian law, applies. While the latter could be considered another example of validity contestation, it is included in the section on application contestation due to the previous affirmation that existing international law generally does apply.\n It is worth noting that the US government also contests the validity of certain parts of international law. For example, the US government does not recognize due diligence as a legal concept applying to cyberspace. See Schmitt (2015a) on due diligence.\nT. Maurer\nCuba also issued a statement explaining that the reason why it and other states including China rejected affirming the applicability of IHL in the context of ICT “since it would legitimize a scenario of war and military actions in the context of ICT” referencing “unilateral punitive force actions, including the application of sanctions and even military action by States claiming to be victims of illicit uses of ICTs” (Rodriguez 2017). An Indian expert on the UNGGE, Arun Sukumar, has since pointed out that “This argument, however, is really about military objectives. Countries that are rapidly scaling up their offensive cyber capabilities are buying time to test the effects of new weapons on civilian networks and critical infrastructure. To commit to the applicability of IHL, they fear, would be to foreclose the development and testing of some cyber weapons that may have unintended consequences” (Sukumar 2017).\nSukumar’s statement implies that, in his view, it was interests rather than identity that drove states’ behavior. There are two characteristics of offensive cyber operations that lend weight to this assessment. First, the more sophisticated an actor, the more precise such an actor can be in limiting the effect of malware (Maurer 2018: 10–11). Second, the more sophisticated an actor, the easier it is for such an actor to successfully attribute the source of malicious cyber activity. IHL is based on norms such as distinguishing between civilian and military targets and proportionality. Both depend on precision. Similarly, the exercise of the right to self-defense and use of countermeasures depend on the ability to trace malicious activity back to its source territory. This explains why Sukumar argues that “In reality, Cuba and others are concerned that an endorsement of the ‘right to self-defense’ will undermine asymmetric advantages which states that do not enjoy conventional superiority over their adversaries may have in cyberspace” (Sukumar 2017). Through this lens, the debate over international law with respect to cyberspace is an example of the concept of ‘lawfare’ (Kennedy 2006). Ultimately, both—interests and identity—are likely to have influenced states’ behavior in this context.\nDespite the disagreements over whether to explicitly affirm its applicability, emerging state practice in cyberspace so far seems to suggest that states’ behavior is strongly influenced by IHL. With the exception of the Stuxnet malware whose effects according to some international lawyers can be considered equivalent to the ‘use of force’, all other incidents publicly known to date have remained below this threshold and often aligned with principles of IHL. This possibly illustrates\n Sukumar in an email dated March 3, 2019, noted that “self-actualization of ‘identity’ of states in this domain is still a work in progress and therefore, it would not be surprising if individual positions were to change over the course of subsequent rounds of negotiations but, of course, short term interests have a great role in shaping that identity.”.\n If one rejects this assessment and instead takes the Cuban statement at face value as echoing others’ concerns over a militarization of the Internet, it reflects the different approaches between pacifists and Dunantists. Pacifists advocate for the abolition of war. Dunantists follow Henry Dunant’s humanitarian footsteps acknowledging that wars will occur (at least in their lifetime) and therefore focus on making it less cruel.\n The temporary 6-h blackout in Ukraine in 2015 caused by a cyber attack is not considered a violation of the 2015 UNGGE norm protecting critical infrastructure, at least by the U.S. government which considers Ukraine to have been in a state of armed conflict at the time (Markoff et al 2017). I thank Duncan\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\na significant degree of restraint by states in the use of available offensive tools and deliberate design thereof. With that said, it is also worth noting that despite some states having explicitly affirmed that they consider IHL to apply to cyberspace, their international lawyers have yet to agree on how it applies specifically. This lack of clarity is not limited to highly specific scenarios but extends to such foundational questions as to whether data enjoys the status of an object as such, which in turn determines whether distinctions between military and civilian objects apply (Schmitt 2013, 2015b).\n## 3.3 Part 3: Contestation Over the Emergence of Cyber Norms\nThe key challenge for the international community to address is what some scholars have called ‘subthreshold activity’: effects caused by malicious cyber activity below the threshold of ‘use of force’/‘armed attack’ (Lin 2012). That is also why the discussion about cyber norms has been driven by an “effects-based logic” (Farrell and Glaser 2017). Norms governing subthreshold effects through cyberspace are less a question of applicability of existing international law but best described through the lens of cyber norm emergence.\nThe contestation over the emergence of cyber norms ties back to the initial Russian proposal for an arms control treaty focusing on information security. A main point of contestation since then has been over whether a new, legally binding treaty is required to codify new norms for cyberspace or whether a soft law approach is better suited. Moscow has continued to promote the idea of a treaty through a draft International Code of Conduct and by circulating a draft convention (McKune 2015; Russian MOFA 2011). The Shanghai Cooperation Organization and partnering with China has been the main vehicle for this effort. Meanwhile, the U.S. and its Western allies have used the London Conference on Cyberspace series to advocate for their vision (UK 2011). With that said, this bifurcation into two camps became murkier when Microsoft launched its campaign for a Digital Geneva Convention in 2017 (Microsoft 2017).\nDespite this broader contestation, the governmental experts were able to reach agreement on a list of eleven voluntary, nonbinding norms outlined in their 2015 UNGGE report. Figure 1 details this list together with a set of questions to help\nFootnote 20 (continued)\nHollis for pointing out that this does not mean that the attack did not potentially violate provisions of IHL, for example, with respect to the indiscriminate targeting of civilians.\n This article disagrees with the assessment that states are developing a “policy of optionality toward the application of international law” as suggested by Efrony and Shany (2018: 648–649) and instead attributes the lack of clarity and explicit statements to the still nascent understanding and nature of cyber norms.\n See, for example, Hathaway et al (2012); Schmitt and Vihul (2014); Eichensehr (2014).\n According to the norm life cycle, norm entrepreneurs will help advance the emergence of a new norm that can eventually reach a tipping point. Once a sufficient number of relevant actors support the norm for it to reach a cascade, the norm becomes internalized reflecting normal patterns of behavior with only sporadic violations (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998).\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\ndetermine their level of ambiguity (for discussion of different levels of ambiguity generally, see Jose (2018) 27; Abbott et al. (2000) 415). Complementing the affirmation that existing international law applies, the voluntary nature of these norms is reflected by the use of “should” rather than “must” or “are obliged to”. Moreover, the U.S. has explicitly promoted behavior that it does not consider to be part of international law as norms. Assessing the level of compliance therefore primarily depends on the state whose compliance is being assessed having explicitly affirmed that it will adhere to the described standard of appropriate behavior. Also, the meaning of these voluntary norms remains contested. It is also unclear if all states are committed to all eleven norms equally. For example, the U.S. government had explicitly proposed four of the eleven norms (Kerry 2015). Is it equally committed to the other seven it agreed to in 2015? What about other countries' priorities?\nWith respect to the diffusion of the agreed upon statements on norms, Fig. 2 shows various international accords over the past decade since the first successful UNGGE started convening in 2009 (Maurer et al. 2017). The list shows a timeline of relevant multilateral accords explicitly referencing cyber norms. This includes successful UNGGE reports which were subsequently endorsed by heads of states at the G20, the G7, and in other multilateral and bilateral statements. These efforts demonstrate that the “socialization tools employed to make the norm effective” include a mix of global and regional institutions to help diffuse the agreements reached and to support the norms reaching a tipping point and cascading effect (Finnemore and Hollis 2016: 428). Specifically noteworthy is the significantly increasing number of such accords starting in 2015 and thereafter contributing to the diffusion of the norms agreed to in the 2015 UNGGE report. Many of these are the result of a deliberate effort by UNGGE member states to increase awareness of the UNGGE process among non-UNGGE member states and thereby enhance its universality, legitimacy, and global adherence.\n### Part 4: Contestation Over Access to Contestation\nWho gets to sit at the table and participate in the discussions about norms for cyberspace has also been contested. UNGGEs were restricted clubs with membership limited to initially 15 and eventually 25 member states with the composition changing from one UNGGE to the next. While the consistent participation of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council provided a minimum of legitimacy, other countries have criticized the restrictive membership as cybersecurity rose on the agenda. In fact, for the UNGGE established in 2016 with its 25 members, nearly three times as many member states expressed their desire to be part of the group reflecting a desire to move from being norm takers to being norm shapers. In other words, it is a reflection of contestation over ‘access to contestation' as a pre-condition for agency and participation in contestation in the first place (Wiener 2017).\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\n|  VOLUNTARY, NONBINDING NORM | AMBIGUITY + KEY QUESTIONS  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  (a) Consistent with the purposes of the United Nations, including to maintain international peace and security, States should cooperate in developing and applying measures to increase stability and security in the use of ICTs and to prevent ICT practices that are acknowledged to be harmful or that may pose threats to international peace and security; | How will 'cooperation' be assessed?

These criticisms can be considered a standalone metacontestation over the existing UN process writ large. Its critics question whether the UN process has been sufficiently impactful, whether it is worth pursuing further, and whether it ought to be replaced with a different process. These arguments focus on (1) the broad scope and vague nature of agreements, (2) the inadequacy of addressing the deteriorating security environment, (3) the hidden agendas, including hypocrisy, of some stakeholders, and (4) the disconnect between those negotiating and those carrying out offensive operations.\n1. Broad scope and vague nature of agreements A common critique from officials in national security agencies is that the framework developed by the UNGGE is too broad and too vague to be truly effective at establishing rules of the road adhered to by those carrying out offensive cyber operations (Burgess 2018; Baker 2017; Fischerkeller and Harknett 2018). Their skepticism reflects the still nascent and continuously maturing understanding of the technology's impact on the balance\nSpringer\n#\nASSER PRESS\nT.

(2017)\nof power, its use as an instrument of statecraft, and the security dilemma that is as present online as it is offline. As an alternative approach, this group of stakeholders proposes to focus on agreements based on emerging state practice and more narrowly defined areas of common interest as the basis for cyber norms that\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\ncould then be expanded over time (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2018; Fischerkeller 2018).Inadequacy of addressing deteriorating security environment A separate point of critique of the UNGGE process makes the opposite argument. Instead of viewing the UNGGE's framework as too broad and ambitious, this separate camp of critics argues that the UNGGE process has not been ambitious enough. They see a functional need for international cooperation among governments and transnational cooperation among nongovernmental actors to address the deteriorating cybersecurity environment. A leading voice of this group is the multinational company Microsoft. After years of being involved in international cyber norms discussions, Microsoft CEO Brad Smith elevated the company's engagement to an unprecedented level by calling for a Digital Geneva Convention (Smith 2017; Meredith 2018). In the wake of the economic costs caused by the 2017 WannaCry and NotPetya, these voices have become louder with a growing number of CEOs joining the chorus (Greenberg 2018; Cybersecurity Tech Accord 2018; Siemens 2018). In addition, the UN Secretary General made the topic a priority in 2018 supporting a more ambitious agenda (Khalip 2018; Fidler 2018).This group of norm entrepreneurs remains very active trying to further advance the cyber norms discussion by keeping the pressure on governments. For example, Microsoft broadened its efforts beyond its engagement as a single company by creating the ‘Tech Accord' consortium counting more than 70 global companies at the beginning of 2019 (Cybersecurity Tech Accord 2018). In late 2017, Siemens established a nonrival network of a dozen companies creating a ‘Charter of Trust' focusing specifically on supply chain integrity (Siemens 2018). Meanwhile, the Dutch government led the charge to add a norm protecting the core of the Internet to the list of norms agreed to through the 2015 UNGGE (Broeders 2016). The French government's desire to maximize the impact of the Paris Peace Forum launched in 2018 at the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I led to the adoption of the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace in November 2018 that explicitly references the norm to protect the core of the Internet (France Diplomatie 2018). The Paris Call has also been described as an umbrella framework for the activities of various norm entrepreneurs. Hidden agendas Those promoting a more ambitious agenda have encountered a number of challenges due to the dynamics among and within governments. First, among governments, calls for a treaty have been met with resistance by Western governments. Concerned about Moscow's true intentions, these governments worry that any push for a treaty will empower Moscow's longstanding proposal. Their concerns explain continued resistance by Washington and Western capitals\nwith respect to the draft International Code of Conduct that Moscow and Beijing developed in 2011, updated in 2015, and have been promoting since (see McKune 2015.) They also help explain why Microsoft's call for a Digital Geneva Convention has met similar resistance and illustrate that overcoming this path dependence would require exceptional circumstances. Second, within governments, national security agencies are reluctant to internalize and adhere to the norms reflected in the UNGGE agreements due to the still nascent understanding of the domain, a related desire to preserve options until a mature strategic framework has emerged, and the dynamics of the security dilemma (Burgess 2018, Efrony and Shany 2018). A good illustration of this still maturing understanding of the technology is the argument promoted by some that there is moral obligation to use hacking instead of conventional weaponry if the effects of the former are less harmful than the latter (Hollis 2014). Disconnect between those negotiating and those conducting offensive cyber operations A final obstacle worth mentioning—rather in form of a hypothesis than conclusive analysis—is that a particular challenge for negotiating cyber norms may be that the conduct of offensive cyber operations originated in and continues to be closely tied to intelligence agencies, the most secretive parts of any government (Smeets 2018). Until recently, their public engagement was minimal. For example, the acronym of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) has been commonly referred to as ‘No Such Agency.' The bureaucratic culture of these agencies is therefore not infused with a history of interactions with their respective counterparts internationally (apart from the norms governing spy swaps that emerged during the Cold War.) Unlike the militaries of the world that—despite fighting each other—have developed norms for the exchange of prisoners, the treatment of the wounded, and other activity, this sort of interaction is not part of intelligence agencies' DNA. With that said, the pace of change affecting intelligence agencies in the past 5 years alone is breathtaking with potential changing attitudes toward such interactions. For example, from the NSA to the Australian signals directorate, agencies now even have active Twitter accounts and terms such as Five Eyes have become household names (Australian Signals Directorate 2018).\n## The Flipside: The Impact of Cyber Norms on Existing Norms\nNot only have existing international law and norms shaped the thinking about behavior in cyberspace but, on the flipside, the discussion about cyber norms has had an impact on existing international law and norms more broadly. For example, the affirmation of states' commitment to foundational norms of the international system such as sovereignty, the UN Charter, and international law have reinforced these\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\nfoundational norms. Moreover, in addition to what has been affirmed and included through the UNGGE process, it is important to take into account what has been excluded. For example, breaches of confidentiality of data for espionage purposes have been deliberately excluded from the UNGGE process, both with respect to economic and political espionage. This exclusion in and of itself reflects normativity.\nThe best case study showing how the cyber norms discussion has impacted intersubjective agreement on existing international law and norms is indeed the debate over espionage. While ultimately not included in UNGGE process, the role of intelligence collection activity has been part of the discussions. Particularly in the aftermath of Edward Snowden, some countries such as Brazil and Germany were keen to discuss potential norms with respect to political espionage. However, they introduced their resolutions in the UN General Assembly's Third Committee rather than through the First Committee and UNGGE process (Abdenur and Gama 2015).29 Other countries, namely the U.S., opposed such initiatives arguing that political espionage is not prohibited under international law but constitutes legitimate intelligence collection. In short, while contested by some, the debate starting in 2013 reinforced the existing norms governing political intelligence collection overall.\nAt the same time, the U.S. government has been very keen to reinforce the norm against economic espionage, namely the theft of intellectual property for competitive advantage, as the U.S. is specifically concerned by China's cyber-enabled behavior. In fact, of the five norms that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry outlined as U.S. government priorities in 2015, one of the five focused on economic espionage30 (Kerry 2015). While mentioned in the same context of cyber norms in his speech, the U.S. government did not pursue this issue through the UNGGE process to avoid introducing espionage to the First Committee discussions. Instead, the U.S. government pursued a bilateral agreement with China31 and subsequently a G20 communique incorporating the language of the bilateral agreement.\nHow challenging it has been for the U.S. government to communicate its nuanced view and differentiation between legitimate political espionage and illegitimate economic espionage is illustrated by the Chinese government's misperception of Washington's demands. In 2015, the U.S. government was requesting that Beijing arrest Chinese hackers responsible for economic espionage (Nakashima and Goldman 2015). Beijing eventually responded by presenting the arrest of hackers allegedly for the breach of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and theft of confidential\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\ndata of U.S. government employees (Noble 2015). In light of the public outrage among members of the U.S. Congress over the OPM breach, Beijing apparently believed the arrests would address the U.S. government's demand (Hosenball and Zengerle 2015). The White House was subsequently at pains trying to communicate to Beijing that the U.S. government actually believed that the OPM breach—as much as it despised its occurrence—had been a legitimate activity and therefore did not expect the arrest of those hackers but instead wanted Beijing to crack down on those carrying out economic espionage.\n## Conclusion and Broader Reflections\nInternational consensus on norms for cyberspace remains in its infancy. Nevertheless, there have been active international discussions on norms for cyberspace since the late 1990s. In addition, states and non-state actors have been using offensive cyber operations for years. These discussions and activities do not take place in isolation but have been shaping cyber norms. The UNGGE process has contributed to the international community's understanding of norms for cyberspace by crystallizing the core tensions, affirming and thereby reinforcing the applicability of existing international law, and becoming an incubator for the construction of new norms and diffusion thereof.\nThe collapse of the 2017 UNGGE marks a caesura in the international discussion on cyber norms. The process collapsed due to a combination of geopolitical tensions, competing tactics, and growing pressure to open the process to others. Relations between Russia and the U.S. the drivers behind the UNGGE process, were at an historic low. Most argue the relationship is at its worst since the end of the Cold War, some even argue there is less dialogue now than during the Cold War. It is therefore not surprising that participants privately only gave the 2016/2017 UNGGE a 50/50 chance of success at its beginning. While future analysis may consider the failure of the 2017 UNGGE only a temporary set-back in the diplomatic process, it is a caesura nevertheless. Importantly, the 2017 collapse of the UNGGE process demonstrates that rising geopolitical tensions and heightened security concerns trumped growing pressures to address the functional need to cooperate in light of the deteriorating security environment illustrated by WannaCry and NotPetya.\nStarting in the fall of 2019, there will be a new UNGGE and a new open-ended working group—the “mess in New York” as one ambassador called it. This outcome was not by design, the U.S. and Russia simply could not agree on a compromise resolution like they had in the past. Countries caught in the middle then thought it was best not to alienate either and voted for both the American proposal for a\nnew UNGGE and the Russian proposal for an open-ended working group (Grigsby 2017). Both remain anchored in the UN General Assembly's First Committee that created the five UNGGEs. How to make sense of them and establish some sort of complementarity was left to the UN Secretariat. If and how the two processes will build on each other remains an open question (as of August 2019). It is also unclear whether the U.S. will buy into the open-ended working group based on Russia's proposal and vice versa with respect to the UNGGE or if they will try to sabotage the other.\nSome states plan to use the two new processes to focus on how best to operationalize the agreed upon norms. Capacity-building is emerging as a priority, although it is unclear how this will differ from past commitments to capacity-building (UNIDIR 2019). Moreover, neither process is likely to address the question how those states behind some of the most aggressive activity in the past, namely Iran and North Korea, can become deterred from similar activity in the future. A key indicator for future developments will be the generational transition among the chief negotiators in coming years. When the godfather and godmother of cyber norms, Andrey Krutskikh and Michele Markoff, step down, the question will be whether their successors will pursue the same strategies or make incremental or even transformational changes. This transition is likely to also raise the question if China will assume a more active role in this discussion and how its behavior will shape cyber norms in the future.\nIn short, neither the new UNGGE nor the open-ended working group are likely to produce a diplomatic breakthrough by 2021. Despite growing pressures on governments, particularly from multinational companies (Microsoft 2018: Part 1 and 2; Cybersecurity Tech Accord 2018; France Diplomatie 2018) as well as a few NGOs to address the deteriorating cybersecurity environment as a functional need (Mitrany 1943), some states are becoming even more reluctant to pursue a more ambitious multilateral agenda (Sanger 2018). For example, the U.S. government has started focusing on holding actors accountable and enforcing the norms agreed to through the 2015 UNGGE (Hollis and Waxman 2018; White House 2018b). After years of primarily cyber threat intelligence companies exposing state-sponsored cyber operations (Mandiant 2013), the U.S. and other governments have become increasingly active in attributing such activity and doing so in a coordinated fashion. For example, the U.S. and other governments released statements holding Russia accountable for the NotPetya malware attack on the eve of the 2018 Munich Security Conference.\n### Broader Reflections\nWith respect to the bigger picture, the twenty-year old negotiations among states about cyber norms are a microcosm of the broader changes in world politics and the international system at the beginning of the 21^{st} century. They reflect the resurgence of great power rivalry, competing value propositions, and strategic decisions in the face of a global technology revolution. Russia's determination to remain a globally relevant actor, China's desire to shape the world order of the 21st century, and the U.S. attempt to retain its dominant position all permeate the international\ndiscussions on which rules apply to cyberspace and how. These debates also foreshadow broader systemic tensions between clashing political systems and visions for the future of the liberal world order.\nSo what does the process so far tell us about how norms emerge for cyberspace? It is clear that the top-down approach of the diplomatic negotiations is only one piece of the puzzle. While the UN process has certainly contributed to strengthening intersubjective agreement on what behavior is considered (in)appropriate in cyberspace, recent developments have exposed its shortcomings. Existing international law does provide a baseline framework but how it applies and what norms govern the new types of effects and resulting gaps in existing international law remains unclear. Efforts such as the Tallinn Manual and the voluntary norms outlined in the 2015 UNGGE reports are useful attempts to clarify these open questions, yet states are proceedings cautiously. Meanwhile, state practice is slowly emerging and becoming increasingly visible to others (Chesney 2019; Barnes and Gibbons-Neff 2019). The two are likely to increasingly converge in coming years providing fresh impetus for the construction and internalization of norms for cyberspace.\nNye has pointed out that “norms and institutions develop much more slowly than technology” (Nye 2018: 23). Part of the reason is that states continue to struggle on multiple fronts. States are still struggling with conceptualizing the technology and its implications which hampers the development of coherent strategies and policies. For example, in the U.S. the State Department's pursuit of a framework for stability and the cyber deterrence initiative announced by the White House in 2018 are disconnected from the development of the strategic concept of ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defend forward' outlined in the 2018 Command Vision for U.S. Cyber Command (Department of State 2018; White House 2018a; U.S. Cyber Command 2018). Western governments are revisiting their split of cyber operations from information operations in the early 2000s in light of Moscow's and Beijing's more integrated doctrines, especially in the wake of Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. elections (ODNI 2017).\nStates are also struggling to keep pace with technological developments, the proliferation of capabilities, and the malicious use of these capabilities. For example, most cyber incidents of the past decade were surprises, from the Iranian Distributed Denial of Service attacks from 2011 to 2013 to North Korea's attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014, (White House 2015a, b; Department of Justice 2016). Meanwhile, the number of countries developing offensive cyber tools rose from half a dozen to over 30 countries between 2010 and 2017 (Clapper, Lettre, and Rogers 2017).\nUltimately, the two new processes at the UN reflect competing visions for the future of cyberspace raising important questions for members of the international community. Should states have more or less power? Will they tolerate the existing institutions governing the Internet consisting primarily of private transnational\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\n\nAcknowledgements Many thanks to Arun Sukumar, Duncan Hollis, Garrett Hinck, and Hannes Ebert in addition to two anonymous reviewers for providing feedback on an earlier draft of this article."

Despite diplomatic activities at the United Nations over the past two decades, intersubjective agreement on norms governing coercive cyber power is still nascent. Agreed upon, explicitly stated norms are considered voluntary, defined vaguely, and internalized weakly. Implicit state practice is slowly emerging, yet poorly understood, and cloaked in secrecy.

Why did the process collapse in 2017, the very same year that two of the biggest cyber attacks to date—WannaCry and NotPetya—caused indiscriminate economic harm worldwide each with an estimated cost of several billion U.S. dollars? And why did member states, in an unprecedented move in the UN's history, create two separate processes dedicated to the same issue in 2018? To answer these questions, this article analyses the various factors feeding into the dynamic process of norm contestation including an in-depth discussion of the process at the United Nations, the role of international law, and the main points of critiques.\n**Keywords** Cyberspace · Contestation · Cyber norms · Cybersecurity · Cyber security\n## 1 Introduction\nIn 2017, the same year that the two biggest cyber attacks to date—WannaCry and NotPetya—occurred, international negotiations over norms for cyberspace collapsed. With each attack causing several billions of U.S. dollars in economic damage worldwide, the cyber attacks raise the question: why did the international\n¹ Co-Director, Cyber Policy Initiative, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 1779 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20036, USA\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\ncommunity through the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UNGGE) fail to reach a consensus on how to advance the emerging regime of norms for cyberspace? On the surface, states such as the US, Cuba and India argue that it was a disagreement over international law (Markoff 2017; Rodriguez 2017; Sukumar 2017). Yet, the iceberg underneath is a mix of great power politics, competing and occasionally clashing political systems, and continued uncertainty with respect to a new technology.\nOverall, states' approach to norms for cyberspace remains highly contested internationally among governments and fragmented domestically within governments. Cyber norms are still in their “constituting phase” (Wiener 2014). Agreed upon, explicitly stated norms are considered voluntary, defined vaguely, and internalized weakly (Farrell and Glaser 2017: 16). Implicit state practice is slowly emerging, yet poorly understood, and cloaked in secrecy. Nevertheless, the diplomatic activities over the past two decades have shaped significantly how governments think about cyber norms and how they behave accordingly (Nye 2018).\nTo understand the dynamics of the international cyber norms contestation, various lenses can be applied. In addition to signs of the security dilemma impacting states' behavior (Buchanan 2017), competing conceptual approaches and key terms explain this outcome. These include key concepts such as ‘norms' (Finnemore and Hollis 2016), ‘deterrence' (White House 2018a), even ‘information security' and ‘cyber security' (Maurer and Morgus 2014), with new concepts such as ‘persistent engagement' (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2018) complementing the mix. Each of them is associated with a specific bureaucratic agency advancing its own agenda. Even the behavior of individual actors is worth mentioning as the two key diplomats in the U.S. and Russia leading these negotiations have not changed in the last 20 years achieving unusual influence setting the agenda, strategies, and pace of the discussions since the process began.\nThis state of affairs raises several important questions: how do norms emerge for cyberspace? What has been the contribution of the UN process to the international community's understanding of norms for cyberspace? Why did the process collapse in 2017, the very same year that two of the biggest cyber attacks to date caused indiscriminate economic harm worldwide? And why did member states, in an unprecedented move in the UN's history, create two processes dedicated to the same issue in 2018? This article investigates these questions and presents a deep dive into what cyber norms are all about.\nThe analysis of the dynamic process of norm contestation in this area is divided into several sections. The first section focuses on how the competing and\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\n285\noccasionally clashing political systems affect how cyber norms are conceptualized and defined. The second section presents a deep dive with five subparts ranging from the impact of existing norms on cyber norms to the emergence of norms, the diffusion and contestation thereof, including access to contestation, and the metacontestation over the UN process itself. The third section points to the impact of the cyber norms discussion on existing norms followed by the conclusion and some broader reflections.\n## 2 The Big Confusion: What Are (Cyber) Norms in the First Place?\nThere is severe confusion about cyber norms. It is not uncommon to encounter statements from diplomats implying that norms, per definition, are voluntary in nature and never legally binding—in contradiction to the decades-old academic literature of sociology and international relations theory.³ What is to blame for the confusion? Politics and the gap between academics and practitioners. Yet, this confusion also reflects an undercurrent of competing political systems that affects the terminology used in this area. It is therefore worth briefly unpacking what (cyber) norms are and how to define them given the implications for contestation.\nOne of the key points of confusion centers on the relationship between norms and laws. In academia, scholars debate whether legal norms enjoy a special status compared to norms generally.⁴ Finnemore argues they do not because “There are, after all, many kinds of norms in the world—social, cultural, professional, moral, religious, and familial” (Finnemore 1999: 701).⁵ Others argue that norms tied to law stand out because of the level of compliance given rise to concepts such as ‘soft law’ and ‘hard law’ (Abbott and Snidal 2000; see Jose (2018): 25). More recently, Finnemore and Hollis concluded that “Simply put, laws can serve as a basis for formulating norms, just as norms can be codified in law” (Finnemore and Hollis 2016: 442).\nIn international politics, the concept of ‘voluntary norms’ emerged as a political strategy developed by the U.S. Department of State in juxtaposition to Russia’s proposal for a legally binding arms control treaty on information security. Moscow approached Washington with this idea in the late 1990s which the U.S. government opposed for several reasons. One of the key decision-makers involved, Richard Clarke, “viewed the Russian proposal as largely a propaganda tool” in addition to considering verification of a cyber agreement “impossible” and that “the U.S. had not yet explored what it wanted to do in the area of cyber war. It was not obvious then whether or not cyber war added to or subtracted from U.S. national security\n³ For a first discussion of cyber norms by academics, see Finnemore (2011) and Maurer (2011).\n⁴ There is a related discussion focusing on norm adoption and internalization through the lens of behavior “mimicry” see Goodman/Jinks (2013).\n⁵ More recently Percy in her 2007 study of the norm against mercenaries.\n⁶ With respect to sources of international law and the logic within the UN system, UNGGE reports generally barely matter. In international law, they would rank even below the ‘soft law’ nature of UN General Assembly resolutions.\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\n(Clarke and Knake 2011: 219)”. Other factors that have come up since are the quickly evolving nature of the technology challenging the longevity of a potential international treaty and growing concerns that the broad definition of ‘information security' advanced by Moscow and Beijing is a Trojan horse for content control and a human rights issue at heart. Another is the difficulty of attributing malicious cyber activity and the related ability to hold actors responsible (Rid and Buchanan 2015; Lindsay 2015; Brantly et al. 2016; Egloff and Wenger 2019).\nAfter the U.S. decided to reject the Russian proposal, it was in search for a strategy to advance its own agenda while still engaging with the Russians when the issue rose in prominence, namely after the 2007 DDoS attack against Estonia and the 2008 compromise of the classified networks of the U.S. Department of Defense. Principally opposed to a legally binding agreement as a goal, the U.S. government came up with the idea for the international community to develop ‘voluntary norms' in addition to arguing that existing international law applies to cyberspace. The 2015 UNGGE report therefore repeatedly highlights the “voluntary, non-binding” nature of the norms it outlines for cyberspace (UN Group of Governmental Experts 2015). The process that emerged out of these early days has since been scrutinized, including its dynamics and actors, by several scholars (Kavanagh and Stauffacher 2014; Hurwitz 2014; Cornish 2015; Farrell 2015; Erskine and Carr 2016; Tikk-Ringas 2016; Macák 2017; Hurel and Lobato 2018).\nUltimately, these factors explain the confusion and highlight the need to pay close attention what actors mean when they use the term ‘norm.'\n## Contestation, Norms, and Cyberspace\nAs a process, the cyber norms negotiations consist of norm contestation, which can be defined as “social practices which discursively express disapproval of norms” (Wiener 2014: 1). If there was no such contestation, all actors would have a shared understanding what norms apply and how. If they disagree, some form of contestation must be occurring and can lead to the weakening, reinforcing, adjusting, or replacing of a norm. That is why it is important to consider norms as much through the lens of a process as through a lens focused on products and explicit, agreed outcomes (Finnemore and Hollis 2016: 427). This contestation raises the question: what has been the contribution of the UN process to the international community's understanding of norms for cyberspace? First, the UNGGE process has helped crystallize\nthe underlying core tensions among the stakeholders involved as described in part 1 of this section. A second important contribution was the process leading to the affirmation of the applicability of existing international law by the international community, analyzed in part 2, as well as its role as an incubator for constructing new norms outlined in part 3. Part 4 details how these agreements have been diffused worldwide.\n### Part I: Contestation Over Key Terms\nThe fight over norms for cyberspace starts with the terminology. For authoritarian governments, preserving their political system and ensuring regime stability is the single most important goal. This explains why the term ‘information security' and the proposals by Moscow and Beijing have become so politically charged and contested. Originally, information security was a technical term focused on the protection of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information (International Organization for Standardization 2018). Over the past two decades, it has taken on a life of its own as Moscow and later on Beijing argued that information itself—content in other words—can be a threat, and in doing so, they have broadened the conceptualization of information security. As liberal democracies face empowered authoritarian regimes and a democratic backsliding worldwide (Diamond 2016), they opted to use ‘cybersecurity' excluding content to highlight the need to protect human rights in juxtaposition to this broader concept of ‘information security'. International negotiations have therefore touched on essentially two issues: (i) hacking and the related use of information and communications technology (ICT) and (ii) content and the related use of ICT.\nUN member states camouflage these differences and the underlying clashes of their political systems by referring to the vague “malicious use of ICT” throughout their documents at the UN and the G20 (UN Group of Governmental Experts 2015: 6; G7 2017). That way, liberal democratic governments such as the U.S. and European countries can claim that their concerns are limited to hacking and related use of ICT, thereby opposing discussions of content while authoritarian governments such as Russia and China can claim that this definition reflects their broader conceptualization of ‘information security.'\nTaking these political realities into account while striving for a robust and sound academic definition, cyber norms can be defined as standards of appropriate behavior with respect to the use of ICT inconsistent with the objectives of maintaining international stability and security. The value of this definition is that it sets cyber norms apart from the broader set of norms that shape our behavior online\nfrom dating online to shopping online. This definition of ‘cyber norms' combines (1) the standard definition of norms in International Relations theory (Katzenstein 1996: 5) with (2) the use of the term ‘cyber norms' in the international relations context, namely in the context of international security and the UNGGE process (General Assembly 1999).\nIn fact, the successful adoption UNGGE reports in 2010, 2013, and 2015 demonstrates that diplomats have been able to make progress despite their disagreement with respect to the scope of ‘information security.' John Rawls's ‘overlapping consensus' and Cass Sunstein's ‘incompletely theorized agreements' help explain why actors, including states, can agree on particular norms despite divergent values (Rawls 1971; Sunstein 2007). The use of offensive cyber operations that could pose a threat to international stability and security is such an area with greater intersubjective agreement. Hacking has enabled a diffusion of reach for actors around the world to create effects remotely, the truly novel and unique aspect of the technology, ranging from stealing data to manipulating centrifuges of nuclear enrichment facilities or disrupting power supply (Maurer 2018: 26--27).\n### Part 2: Contestation Over Existing Norms\nTo analyze the impact of existing norms, namely existing international law, it is worth noting that some scholars propose to differentiate between norm ‘validity contestation' and norm ‘application contestation' (Zimmermann et al. 2017: 699). Norm validity contestation involves actors debating whether a norm or a set of norms is valid generally and to be upheld. Norm application contestation does not challenge whether a norm or set of norms is generally valid but whether it “is appropriate for a given situation...over time and varying local contexts, such application discourses often lead to evolving interpretations of a norm, in line with new technological inventions” (Zimmermann et al. 2017: 699).\nThese distinctions are particularly useful with respect to norms and emerging technologies. Yet, applying the concept of validity and application contestation to cyber norms raises a conceptual challenge because cyberspace is viewed by an increasing number of states not only as a new technology but as a standalone “domain” of human interaction complementing the conventional military domains of operation—land, sea, air, and space (Lynn 2010). The special status of cyberspace as a domain has fueled arguments that it requires its own set of rules.\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\n289\n## 3.2.1 Cyber Norms and Validity Contestation\nGenerally speaking, the question whether international law applies to behavior online is an example of validity contestation. China's refusal until 2013 to affirm that international law generally applies to cyberspace constitutes such validity contestation. In fact, China's argument for the need to negotiate international law anew can be seen within the context of its broader contestation of the liberal world order and validity of its norms. Seen in this light, China's behavior reflects a general challenge to the validity of norms that solidified in the aftermath of World War II including with respect to rules of the road for cyberspace. It was not until the 2013 UNGGE consensus report that China was willing to change its position.¹⁴ In this case, the impact of the cyber norms discussion and China's temporary contestation on existing norms was to ultimately reinforce the latter with several governments including Russia's explicitly¹⁵ affirming their views that international law does apply (Koh 2015; Putin 2016; Wright 2018).\n## 3.2.2 Cyber Norms and Application Contestation\nFollowing the 2013 consensus that international law generally applies to cyberspace, application contestation has become the dominant dynamic in the cyber norms process. Discussing how international law applies was part of the 2016/2017 UNGGE's mandate. It was also one of the reasons why the UNGGE collapsed in 2017 because its members could not agree on whether or not to include an explicit reference in the UNGGE report specifying that international humanitarian law (IHL) applies to cyberspace.¹⁶ According to the U.S. representative, “those who are unwilling to affirm the applicability of these international [humanitarian] legal rules and principles believe their States are free to act in or through cyberspace to achieve their political ends with no limits or constraints on their actions” (Markoff 2017).¹⁷\n¹⁴ Part of China's argument was that affirming the applicability of international law would have unintended consequences namely contributing to the militarization of cyberspace. I thank Arun Sukumar for highlighting this point.\n¹⁵ The Doctrine of Information Security of the Russian Federation approved by Decree of the President of the Russian Federation on December 5, 2016, states in paragraph 4 as a basic notion that “The Constitution of the Russian Federation, universally recognized principles and norms of international law, international treaties signed by the Russian Federation...form the legal framework of the Doctrine” specifying in paragraph 34 that “Information security activities of government bodies is based on the following principles...(e) compliance with the universally recognized principles and norms of international law, international treaties to which the Russian Federation is a party and laws of the Russian Federation.”\n¹⁶ There is an inherent contradiction in states’ positions having on the one hand confirmed that existing international law applies but then refusing to affirm that a subset of existing international law, international humanitarian law, applies. While the latter could be considered another example of validity contestation, it is included in the section on application contestation due to the previous affirmation that existing international law generally does apply.\n¹⁷ It is worth noting that the US government also contests the validity of certain parts of international law. For example, the US government does not recognize due diligence as a legal concept applying to cyberspace. See Schmitt (2015a) on due diligence.\nT. Maurer\nCuba also issued a statement explaining that the reason why it and other states including China rejected affirming the applicability of IHL in the context of ICT “since it would legitimize a scenario of war and military actions in the context of ICT” referencing “unilateral punitive force actions, including the application of sanctions and even military action by States claiming to be victims of illicit uses of ICTs” (Rodriguez 2017). An Indian expert on the UNGGE, Arun Sukumar, has since pointed out that “This argument, however, is really about military objectives. Countries that are rapidly scaling up their offensive cyber capabilities are buying time to test the effects of new weapons on civilian networks and critical infrastructure. To commit to the applicability of IHL, they fear, would be to foreclose the development and testing of some cyber weapons that may have unintended consequences” (Sukumar 2017).\nSukumar’s statement implies that, in his view, it was interests rather than identity that drove states’ behavior.¹⁸ There are two characteristics of offensive cyber operations that lend weight to this assessment. First, the more sophisticated an actor, the more precise such an actor can be in limiting the effect of malware (Maurer 2018: 10–11). Second, the more sophisticated an actor, the easier it is for such an actor to successfully attribute the source of malicious cyber activity. IHL is based on norms such as distinguishing between civilian and military targets and proportionality. Both depend on precision. Similarly, the exercise of the right to self-defense and use of countermeasures depend on the ability to trace malicious activity back to its source territory. This explains why Sukumar argues that “In reality, Cuba and others are concerned that an endorsement of the ‘right to self-defense’ will undermine asymmetric advantages which states that do not enjoy conventional superiority over their adversaries may have in cyberspace” (Sukumar 2017). Through this lens, the debate over international law with respect to cyberspace is an example of the concept of ‘lawfare’ (Kennedy 2006).¹⁹ Ultimately, both—interests and identity—are likely to have influenced states’ behavior in this context.\nDespite the disagreements over whether to explicitly affirm its applicability, emerging state practice in cyberspace so far seems to suggest that states’ behavior is strongly influenced by IHL. With the exception of the Stuxnet malware whose effects according to some international lawyers can be considered equivalent to the ‘use of force’, all other incidents publicly known to date have remained below this threshold and often aligned with principles of IHL.²⁰ This possibly illustrates\n¹⁸ Sukumar in an email dated March 3, 2019, noted that “self-actualization of ‘identity’ of states in this domain is still a work in progress and therefore, it would not be surprising if individual positions were to change over the course of subsequent rounds of negotiations but, of course, short term interests have a great role in shaping that identity.”.\n¹⁹ If one rejects this assessment and instead takes the Cuban statement at face value as echoing others’ concerns over a militarization of the Internet, it reflects the different approaches between pacifists and Dunantists. Pacifists advocate for the abolition of war. Dunantists follow Henry Dunant’s humanitarian footsteps acknowledging that wars will occur (at least in their lifetime) and therefore focus on making it less cruel.\n²⁰ The temporary 6-h blackout in Ukraine in 2015 caused by a cyber attack is not considered a violation of the 2015 UNGGE norm protecting critical infrastructure, at least by the U.S. government which considers Ukraine to have been in a state of armed conflict at the time (Markoff et al 2017). I thank Duncan\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\na significant degree of restraint by states in the use of available offensive tools and deliberate design thereof.²¹ With that said, it is also worth noting that despite some states having explicitly affirmed that they consider IHL to apply to cyberspace, their international lawyers have yet to agree on how it applies specifically.²² This lack of clarity is not limited to highly specific scenarios but extends to such foundational questions as to whether data enjoys the status of an object as such, which in turn determines whether distinctions between military and civilian objects apply (Schmitt 2013, 2015b).\n## 3.3 Part 3: Contestation Over the Emergence of Cyber Norms\nThe key challenge for the international community to address is what some scholars have called ‘subthreshold activity’: effects caused by malicious cyber activity below the threshold of ‘use of force’/‘armed attack’ (Lin 2012). That is also why the discussion about cyber norms has been driven by an “effects-based logic” (Farrell and Glaser 2017). Norms governing subthreshold effects through cyberspace are less a question of applicability of existing international law but best described through the lens of cyber norm emergence.²³\nThe contestation over the emergence of cyber norms ties back to the initial Russian proposal for an arms control treaty focusing on information security. A main point of contestation since then has been over whether a new, legally binding treaty is required to codify new norms for cyberspace or whether a soft law approach is better suited. Moscow has continued to promote the idea of a treaty through a draft International Code of Conduct and by circulating a draft convention (McKune 2015; Russian MOFA 2011). The Shanghai Cooperation Organization and partnering with China has been the main vehicle for this effort. Meanwhile, the U.S. and its Western allies have used the London Conference on Cyberspace series to advocate for their vision (UK 2011). With that said, this bifurcation into two camps became murkier when Microsoft launched its campaign for a Digital Geneva Convention in 2017 (Microsoft 2017).\nDespite this broader contestation, the governmental experts were able to reach agreement on a list of eleven voluntary, nonbinding norms outlined in their 2015 UNGGE report. Figure 1 details this list together with a set of questions to help\nFootnote 20 (continued)\nHollis for pointing out that this does not mean that the attack did not potentially violate provisions of IHL, for example, with respect to the indiscriminate targeting of civilians.\n²¹ This article disagrees with the assessment that states are developing a “policy of optionality toward the application of international law” as suggested by Efrony and Shany (2018: 648–649) and instead attributes the lack of clarity and explicit statements to the still nascent understanding and nature of cyber norms.\n²² See, for example, Hathaway et al (2012); Schmitt and Vihul (2014); Eichensehr (2014).\n²³ According to the norm life cycle, norm entrepreneurs will help advance the emergence of a new norm that can eventually reach a tipping point. Once a sufficient number of relevant actors support the norm for it to reach a cascade, the norm becomes internalized reflecting normal patterns of behavior with only sporadic violations (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998).\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\ndetermine their level of ambiguity (for discussion of different levels of ambiguity generally, see Jose (2018) 27; Abbott et al. (2000) 415). Complementing the affirmation that existing international law applies, the voluntary nature of these norms is reflected by the use of “should” rather than “must” or “are obliged to”. Moreover, the U.S. has explicitly promoted behavior that it does not consider to be part of international law as norms. Assessing the level of compliance therefore primarily depends on the state whose compliance is being assessed having explicitly affirmed that it will adhere to the described standard of appropriate behavior. Also, the meaning of these voluntary norms remains contested. It is also unclear if all states are committed to all eleven norms equally. For example, the U.S. government had explicitly proposed four of the eleven norms (Kerry 2015). Is it equally committed to the other seven it agreed to in 2015? What about other countries' priorities?\nWith respect to the diffusion of the agreed upon statements on norms, Fig. 2 shows various international accords over the past decade since the first successful UNGGE started convening in 2009 (Maurer et al. 2017). The list shows a timeline of relevant multilateral accords explicitly referencing cyber norms. This includes successful UNGGE reports which were subsequently endorsed by heads of states at the G20, the G7, and in other multilateral and bilateral statements. These efforts demonstrate that the “socialization tools employed to make the norm effective” include a mix of global and regional institutions to help diffuse the agreements reached and to support the norms reaching a tipping point and cascading effect (Finnemore and Hollis 2016: 428). Specifically noteworthy is the significantly increasing number of such accords starting in 2015 and thereafter contributing to the diffusion of the norms agreed to in the 2015 UNGGE report. Many of these are the result of a deliberate effort by UNGGE member states to increase awareness of the UNGGE process among non-UNGGE member states and thereby enhance its universality, legitimacy, and global adherence.\n### Part 4: Contestation Over Access to Contestation\nWho gets to sit at the table and participate in the discussions about norms for cyberspace has also been contested. UNGGEs were restricted clubs with membership limited to initially 15 and eventually 25 member states with the composition changing from one UNGGE to the next. While the consistent participation of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council provided a minimum of legitimacy, other countries have criticized the restrictive membership as cybersecurity rose on the agenda. In fact, for the UNGGE established in 2016 with its 25 members, nearly three times as many member states expressed their desire to be part of the group reflecting a desire to move from being norm takers to being norm shapers. In other words, it is a reflection of contestation over ‘access to contestation' as a pre-condition for agency and participation in contestation in the first place (Wiener 2017).\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\n|  VOLUNTARY, NONBINDING NORM | AMBIGUITY + KEY QUESTIONS  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  (a) Consistent with the purposes of the United Nations, including to maintain international peace and security, States should cooperate in developing and applying measures to increase stability and security in the use of ICTs and to prevent ICT practices that are acknowledged to be harmful or that may pose threats to international peace and security; | How will 'cooperation' be assessed?

These criticisms can be considered a standalone metacontestation over the existing UN process writ large. Its critics question whether the UN process has been sufficiently impactful, whether it is worth pursuing further, and whether it ought to be replaced with a different process. These arguments focus on (1) the broad scope and vague nature of agreements, (2) the inadequacy of addressing the deteriorating security environment, (3) the hidden agendas, including hypocrisy, of some stakeholders, and (4) the disconnect between those negotiating and those carrying out offensive operations.\n1. Broad scope and vague nature of agreements A common critique from officials in national security agencies is that the framework developed by the UNGGE is too broad and too vague to be truly effective at establishing rules of the road adhered to by those carrying out offensive cyber operations (Burgess 2018; Baker 2017; Fischerkeller and Harknett 2018). Their skepticism reflects the still nascent and continuously maturing understanding of the technology's impact on the balance\nSpringer\n#\nASSER PRESS\nT.

(2017)\nof power, its use as an instrument of statecraft, and the security dilemma that is as present online as it is offline. As an alternative approach, this group of stakeholders proposes to focus on agreements based on emerging state practice and more narrowly defined areas of common interest as the basis for cyber norms that\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\ncould then be expanded over time (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2018; Fischerkeller 2018).Inadequacy of addressing deteriorating security environment A separate point of critique of the UNGGE process makes the opposite argument. Instead of viewing the UNGGE's framework as too broad and ambitious, this separate camp of critics argues that the UNGGE process has not been ambitious enough. They see a functional need for international cooperation among governments and transnational cooperation among nongovernmental actors to address the deteriorating cybersecurity environment. A leading voice of this group is the multinational company Microsoft. After years of being involved in international cyber norms discussions, Microsoft CEO Brad Smith elevated the company's engagement to an unprecedented level by calling for a Digital Geneva Convention (Smith 2017; Meredith 2018). In the wake of the economic costs caused by the 2017 WannaCry and NotPetya, these voices have become louder with a growing number of CEOs joining the chorus (Greenberg 2018; Cybersecurity Tech Accord 2018; Siemens 2018). In addition, the UN Secretary General made the topic a priority in 2018 supporting a more ambitious agenda (Khalip 2018; Fidler 2018).This group of norm entrepreneurs remains very active trying to further advance the cyber norms discussion by keeping the pressure on governments. For example, Microsoft broadened its efforts beyond its engagement as a single company by creating the ‘Tech Accord' consortium counting more than 70 global companies at the beginning of 2019 (Cybersecurity Tech Accord 2018). In late 2017, Siemens established a nonrival network of a dozen companies creating a ‘Charter of Trust' focusing specifically on supply chain integrity (Siemens 2018). Meanwhile, the Dutch government led the charge to add a norm protecting the core of the Internet to the list of norms agreed to through the 2015 UNGGE (Broeders 2016). The French government's desire to maximize the impact of the Paris Peace Forum launched in 2018 at the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I led to the adoption of the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace in November 2018 that explicitly references the norm to protect the core of the Internet (France Diplomatie 2018). The Paris Call has also been described as an umbrella framework for the activities of various norm entrepreneurs. Hidden agendas Those promoting a more ambitious agenda have encountered a number of challenges due to the dynamics among and within governments. First, among governments, calls for a treaty have been met with resistance by Western governments. Concerned about Moscow's true intentions, these governments worry that any push for a treaty will empower Moscow's longstanding proposal. Their concerns explain continued resistance by Washington and Western capitals\nwith respect to the draft International Code of Conduct that Moscow and Beijing developed in 2011, updated in 2015, and have been promoting since (see McKune 2015.) They also help explain why Microsoft's call for a Digital Geneva Convention has met similar resistance and illustrate that overcoming this path dependence would require exceptional circumstances. Second, within governments, national security agencies are reluctant to internalize and adhere to the norms reflected in the UNGGE agreements due to the still nascent understanding of the domain, a related desire to preserve options until a mature strategic framework has emerged, and the dynamics of the security dilemma (Burgess 2018, Efrony and Shany 2018). A good illustration of this still maturing understanding of the technology is the argument promoted by some that there is moral obligation to use hacking instead of conventional weaponry if the effects of the former are less harmful than the latter (Hollis 2014). Disconnect between those negotiating and those conducting offensive cyber operations A final obstacle worth mentioning—rather in form of a hypothesis than conclusive analysis—is that a particular challenge for negotiating cyber norms may be that the conduct of offensive cyber operations originated in and continues to be closely tied to intelligence agencies, the most secretive parts of any government (Smeets 2018). Until recently, their public engagement was minimal. For example, the acronym of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) has been commonly referred to as ‘No Such Agency.' The bureaucratic culture of these agencies is therefore not infused with a history of interactions with their respective counterparts internationally (apart from the norms governing spy swaps that emerged during the Cold War.) Unlike the militaries of the world that—despite fighting each other—have developed norms for the exchange of prisoners, the treatment of the wounded, and other activity, this sort of interaction is not part of intelligence agencies' DNA. With that said, the pace of change affecting intelligence agencies in the past 5 years alone is breathtaking with potential changing attitudes toward such interactions. For example, from the NSA to the Australian signals directorate, agencies now even have active Twitter accounts and terms such as Five Eyes have become household names (Australian Signals Directorate 2018).\n## The Flipside: The Impact of Cyber Norms on Existing Norms\nNot only have existing international law and norms shaped the thinking about behavior in cyberspace but, on the flipside, the discussion about cyber norms has had an impact on existing international law and norms more broadly. For example, the affirmation of states' commitment to foundational norms of the international system such as sovereignty, the UN Charter, and international law have reinforced these\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\nfoundational norms. Moreover, in addition to what has been affirmed and included through the UNGGE process, it is important to take into account what has been excluded. For example, breaches of confidentiality of data for espionage purposes have been deliberately excluded from the UNGGE process, both with respect to economic and political espionage. This exclusion in and of itself reflects normativity.\nThe best case study showing how the cyber norms discussion has impacted intersubjective agreement on existing international law and norms is indeed the debate over espionage. While ultimately not included in UNGGE process, the role of intelligence collection activity has been part of the discussions. Particularly in the aftermath of Edward Snowden, some countries such as Brazil and Germany were keen to discuss potential norms with respect to political espionage. However, they introduced their resolutions in the UN General Assembly's Third Committee rather than through the First Committee and UNGGE process (Abdenur and Gama 2015).29 Other countries, namely the U.S., opposed such initiatives arguing that political espionage is not prohibited under international law but constitutes legitimate intelligence collection. In short, while contested by some, the debate starting in 2013 reinforced the existing norms governing political intelligence collection overall.\nAt the same time, the U.S. government has been very keen to reinforce the norm against economic espionage, namely the theft of intellectual property for competitive advantage, as the U.S. is specifically concerned by China's cyber-enabled behavior. In fact, of the five norms that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry outlined as U.S. government priorities in 2015, one of the five focused on economic espionage30 (Kerry 2015). While mentioned in the same context of cyber norms in his speech, the U.S. government did not pursue this issue through the UNGGE process to avoid introducing espionage to the First Committee discussions. Instead, the U.S. government pursued a bilateral agreement with China31 and subsequently a G20 communique incorporating the language of the bilateral agreement.\nHow challenging it has been for the U.S. government to communicate its nuanced view and differentiation between legitimate political espionage and illegitimate economic espionage is illustrated by the Chinese government's misperception of Washington's demands. In 2015, the U.S. government was requesting that Beijing arrest Chinese hackers responsible for economic espionage (Nakashima and Goldman 2015). Beijing eventually responded by presenting the arrest of hackers allegedly for the breach of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and theft of confidential\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\ndata of U.S. government employees (Noble 2015). In light of the public outrage among members of the U.S. Congress over the OPM breach, Beijing apparently believed the arrests would address the U.S. government's demand (Hosenball and Zengerle 2015). The White House was subsequently at pains trying to communicate to Beijing that the U.S. government actually believed that the OPM breach—as much as it despised its occurrence—had been a legitimate activity and therefore did not expect the arrest of those hackers but instead wanted Beijing to crack down on those carrying out economic espionage.\n## Conclusion and Broader Reflections\nInternational consensus on norms for cyberspace remains in its infancy. Nevertheless, there have been active international discussions on norms for cyberspace since the late 1990s. In addition, states and non-state actors have been using offensive cyber operations for years. These discussions and activities do not take place in isolation but have been shaping cyber norms. The UNGGE process has contributed to the international community's understanding of norms for cyberspace by crystallizing the core tensions, affirming and thereby reinforcing the applicability of existing international law, and becoming an incubator for the construction of new norms and diffusion thereof.\nThe collapse of the 2017 UNGGE marks a caesura in the international discussion on cyber norms. The process collapsed due to a combination of geopolitical tensions, competing tactics, and growing pressure to open the process to others. Relations between Russia and the U.S. the drivers behind the UNGGE process, were at an historic low. Most argue the relationship is at its worst since the end of the Cold War, some even argue there is less dialogue now than during the Cold War. It is therefore not surprising that participants privately only gave the 2016/2017 UNGGE a 50/50 chance of success at its beginning. While future analysis may consider the failure of the 2017 UNGGE only a temporary set-back in the diplomatic process, it is a caesura nevertheless. Importantly, the 2017 collapse of the UNGGE process demonstrates that rising geopolitical tensions and heightened security concerns trumped growing pressures to address the functional need to cooperate in light of the deteriorating security environment illustrated by WannaCry and NotPetya.\nStarting in the fall of 2019, there will be a new UNGGE and a new open-ended working group—the “mess in New York” as one ambassador called it. This outcome was not by design, the U.S. and Russia simply could not agree on a compromise resolution like they had in the past. Countries caught in the middle then thought it was best not to alienate either and voted for both the American proposal for a\nnew UNGGE and the Russian proposal for an open-ended working group (Grigsby 2017). Both remain anchored in the UN General Assembly's First Committee that created the five UNGGEs. How to make sense of them and establish some sort of complementarity was left to the UN Secretariat. If and how the two processes will build on each other remains an open question (as of August 2019). It is also unclear whether the U.S. will buy into the open-ended working group based on Russia's proposal and vice versa with respect to the UNGGE or if they will try to sabotage the other.\nSome states plan to use the two new processes to focus on how best to operationalize the agreed upon norms. Capacity-building is emerging as a priority, although it is unclear how this will differ from past commitments to capacity-building (UNIDIR 2019). Moreover, neither process is likely to address the question how those states behind some of the most aggressive activity in the past, namely Iran and North Korea, can become deterred from similar activity in the future. A key indicator for future developments will be the generational transition among the chief negotiators in coming years. When the godfather and godmother of cyber norms, Andrey Krutskikh and Michele Markoff, step down, the question will be whether their successors will pursue the same strategies or make incremental or even transformational changes. This transition is likely to also raise the question if China will assume a more active role in this discussion and how its behavior will shape cyber norms in the future.\nIn short, neither the new UNGGE nor the open-ended working group are likely to produce a diplomatic breakthrough by 2021. Despite growing pressures on governments, particularly from multinational companies (Microsoft 2018: Part 1 and 2; Cybersecurity Tech Accord 2018; France Diplomatie 2018) as well as a few NGOs to address the deteriorating cybersecurity environment as a functional need (Mitrany 1943), some states are becoming even more reluctant to pursue a more ambitious multilateral agenda (Sanger 2018). For example, the U.S. government has started focusing on holding actors accountable and enforcing the norms agreed to through the 2015 UNGGE (Hollis and Waxman 2018; White House 2018b). After years of primarily cyber threat intelligence companies exposing state-sponsored cyber operations (Mandiant 2013), the U.S. and other governments have become increasingly active in attributing such activity and doing so in a coordinated fashion. For example, the U.S. and other governments released statements holding Russia accountable for the NotPetya malware attack on the eve of the 2018 Munich Security Conference.\n### Broader Reflections\nWith respect to the bigger picture, the twenty-year old negotiations among states about cyber norms are a microcosm of the broader changes in world politics and the international system at the beginning of the 21^{st} century. They reflect the resurgence of great power rivalry, competing value propositions, and strategic decisions in the face of a global technology revolution. Russia's determination to remain a globally relevant actor, China's desire to shape the world order of the 21st century, and the U.S. attempt to retain its dominant position all permeate the international\ndiscussions on which rules apply to cyberspace and how. These debates also foreshadow broader systemic tensions between clashing political systems and visions for the future of the liberal world order.\nSo what does the process so far tell us about how norms emerge for cyberspace? It is clear that the top-down approach of the diplomatic negotiations is only one piece of the puzzle. While the UN process has certainly contributed to strengthening intersubjective agreement on what behavior is considered (in)appropriate in cyberspace, recent developments have exposed its shortcomings. Existing international law does provide a baseline framework but how it applies and what norms govern the new types of effects and resulting gaps in existing international law remains unclear. Efforts such as the Tallinn Manual and the voluntary norms outlined in the 2015 UNGGE reports are useful attempts to clarify these open questions, yet states are proceedings cautiously. Meanwhile, state practice is slowly emerging and becoming increasingly visible to others (Chesney 2019; Barnes and Gibbons-Neff 2019). The two are likely to increasingly converge in coming years providing fresh impetus for the construction and internalization of norms for cyberspace.\nNye has pointed out that “norms and institutions develop much more slowly than technology” (Nye 2018: 23). Part of the reason is that states continue to struggle on multiple fronts. States are still struggling with conceptualizing the technology and its implications which hampers the development of coherent strategies and policies. For example, in the U.S. the State Department's pursuit of a framework for stability and the cyber deterrence initiative announced by the White House in 2018 are disconnected from the development of the strategic concept of ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defend forward' outlined in the 2018 Command Vision for U.S. Cyber Command (Department of State 2018; White House 2018a; U.S. Cyber Command 2018). Western governments are revisiting their split of cyber operations from information operations in the early 2000s in light of Moscow's and Beijing's more integrated doctrines, especially in the wake of Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. elections (ODNI 2017).\nStates are also struggling to keep pace with technological developments, the proliferation of capabilities, and the malicious use of these capabilities. For example, most cyber incidents of the past decade were surprises, from the Iranian Distributed Denial of Service attacks from 2011 to 2013 to North Korea's attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014, (White House 2015a, b; Department of Justice 2016). Meanwhile, the number of countries developing offensive cyber tools rose from half a dozen to over 30 countries between 2010 and 2017 (Clapper, Lettre, and Rogers 2017).\nUltimately, the two new processes at the UN reflect competing visions for the future of cyberspace raising important questions for members of the international community. Should states have more or less power? Will they tolerate the existing institutions governing the Internet consisting primarily of private transnational\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\n301\nregulatory organizations (Abbott et al. 2016) or will they seek to replace them? Will states adhere to the existing international legal and normative regime, namely that of state responsibility, or will revisionist powers succeed in pushing major changes (Goddard 2018)?\nAcknowledgements Many thanks to Arun Sukumar, Duncan Hollis, Garrett Hinck, and Hannes Ebert in addition to two anonymous reviewers for providing feedback on an earlier draft of this article."

With each attack causing several billions of U.S. dollars in economic damage worldwide, the cyber attacks raise the question: why did the international ¹ Co-Director, Cyber Policy Initiative, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 1779 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20036, USA Springer ASSER PRESS community through the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UNGGE) fail to reach a consensus on how to advance the emerging regime of norms for cyberspace? On the surface, states such as the US, Cuba and India argue that it was a disagreement over international law. Yet, the iceberg underneath is a mix of great power politics, competing and occasionally clashing political systems, and continued uncertainty with respect to a new technology.\nOverall, states' approach to norms for cyberspace remains highly contested internationally among governments and fragmented domestically within governments. Cyber norms are still in their “constituting phase”. Agreed upon, explicitly stated norms are considered voluntary, defined vaguely, and internalized weakly. Implicit state practice is slowly emerging, yet poorly understood, and cloaked in secrecy. Nevertheless, the diplomatic activities over the past two decades have shaped significantly how governments think about cyber norms and how they behave accordingly.\nTo understand the dynamics of the international cyber norms contestation, various lenses can be applied. In addition to signs of the security dilemma impacting states' behavior, competing conceptual approaches and key terms explain this outcome. These include key concepts such as ‘norms', ‘deterrence' (White House 2018a), even ‘information security' and ‘cyber security', with new concepts such as ‘persistent engagement' complementing the mix. Each of them is associated with a specific bureaucratic agency advancing its own agenda. Even the behavior of individual actors is worth mentioning as the two key diplomats in the U.S. and Russia leading these negotiations have not changed in the last 20 years achieving unusual influence setting the agenda, strategies, and pace of the discussions since the process began.\nThis state of affairs raises several important questions: how do norms emerge for cyberspace? What has been the contribution of the UN process to the international community's understanding of norms for cyberspace? Why did the process collapse in 2017, the very same year that two of the biggest cyber attacks to date caused indiscriminate economic harm worldwide? And why did member states, in an unprecedented move in the UN's history, create two processes dedicated to the same issue in 2018? This article investigates these questions and presents a deep dive into what cyber norms are all about.\nThe analysis of the dynamic process of norm contestation in this area is divided into several sections. The first section focuses on how the competing and A Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\n\n## 2 The Big Confusion: What Are (Cyber) Norms in the First Place?\nThere is severe confusion about cyber norms. It is not uncommon to encounter statements from diplomats implying that norms, per definition, are voluntary in nature and never legally binding—in contradiction to the decades-old academic literature of sociology and international relations theory.³ What is to blame for the confusion? Politics and the gap between academics and practitioners. Yet, this confusion also reflects an undercurrent of competing political systems that affects the terminology used in this area. It is therefore worth briefly unpacking what (cyber) norms are and how to define them given the implications for contestation.\nOne of the key points of confusion centers on the relationship between norms and laws. In academia, scholars debate whether legal norms enjoy a special status compared to norms generally.⁴ Finnemore argues they do not because “There are, after all, many kinds of norms in the world—social, cultural, professional, moral, religious, and familial” .⁵ Others argue that norms tied to law stand out because of the level of compliance given rise to concepts such as ‘soft law’ and ‘hard law’ : 25). More recently, Finnemore and Hollis concluded that “Simply put, laws can serve as a basis for formulating norms, just as norms can be codified in law” .\nIn international politics, the concept of ‘voluntary norms’ emerged as a political strategy developed by the U.S. Department of State in juxtaposition to Russia’s proposal for a legally binding arms control treaty on information security. Moscow approached Washington with this idea in the late 1990s which the U.S. government opposed for several reasons. One of the key decision-makers involved, Richard Clarke, “viewed the Russian proposal as largely a propaganda tool” in addition to considering verification of a cyber agreement “impossible” and that “the U.S. had not yet explored what it wanted to do in the area of cyber war. It was not obvious then whether or not cyber war added to or subtracted from U.S. national security\n³ For a first discussion of cyber norms by academics, see Finnemore (2011) and Maurer (2011).\n⁴ There is a related discussion focusing on norm adoption and internalization through the lens of behavior “mimicry” see Goodman/Jinks (2013).\n⁵ More recently Percy in her 2007 study of the norm against mercenaries.\n⁶ With respect to sources of international law and the logic within the UN system, UNGGE reports generally barely matter. In international law, they would rank even below the ‘soft law’ nature of UN General Assembly resolutions.\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\n”. Other factors that have come up since are the quickly evolving nature of the technology challenging the longevity of a potential international treaty and growing concerns that the broad definition of ‘information security' advanced by Moscow and Beijing is a Trojan horse for content control and a human rights issue at heart. Another is the difficulty of attributing malicious cyber activity and the related ability to hold actors responsible .\nAfter the U.S. decided to reject the Russian proposal, it was in search for a strategy to advance its own agenda while still engaging with the Russians when the issue rose in prominence, namely after the 2007 DDoS attack against Estonia and the 2008 compromise of the classified networks of the U.S. Department of Defense. Principally opposed to a legally binding agreement as a goal, the U.S. government came up with the idea for the international community to develop ‘voluntary norms' in addition to arguing that existing international law applies to cyberspace. The 2015 UNGGE report therefore repeatedly highlights the “voluntary, non-binding” nature of the norms it outlines for cyberspace (UN Group of Governmental Experts 2015). The process that emerged out of these early days has since been scrutinized, including its dynamics and actors, by several scholars .\nUltimately, these factors explain the confusion and highlight the need to pay close attention what actors mean when they use the term ‘norm.'\n## Contestation, Norms, and Cyberspace\nAs a process, the cyber norms negotiations consist of norm contestation, which can be defined as “social practices which discursively express disapproval of norms” . If there was no such contestation, all actors would have a shared understanding what norms apply and how. If they disagree, some form of contestation must be occurring and can lead to the weakening, reinforcing, adjusting, or replacing of a norm. That is why it is important to consider norms as much through the lens of a process as through a lens focused on products and explicit, agreed outcomes . This contestation raises the question: what has been the contribution of the UN process to the international community's understanding of norms for cyberspace? First, the UNGGE process has helped crystallize\nthe underlying core tensions among the stakeholders involved as described in part 1 of this section. A second important contribution was the process leading to the affirmation of the applicability of existing international law by the international community, analyzed in part 2, as well as its role as an incubator for constructing new norms outlined in part 3. Part 4 details how these agreements have been diffused worldwide.\n### Part I: Contestation Over Key Terms\nThe fight over norms for cyberspace starts with the terminology. For authoritarian governments, preserving their political system and ensuring regime stability is the single most important goal. This explains why the term ‘information security' and the proposals by Moscow and Beijing have become so politically charged and contested. Originally, information security was a technical term focused on the protection of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information (International Organization for Standardization 2018). Over the past two decades, it has taken on a life of its own as Moscow and later on Beijing argued that information itself—content in other words—can be a threat, and in doing so, they have broadened the conceptualization of information security. As liberal democracies face empowered authoritarian regimes and a democratic backsliding worldwide , they opted to use ‘cybersecurity' excluding content to highlight the need to protect human rights in juxtaposition to this broader concept of ‘information security'. International negotiations have therefore touched on essentially two issues: (i) hacking and the related use of information and communications technology (ICT) and (ii) content and the related use of ICT.\nUN member states camouflage these differences and the underlying clashes of their political systems by referring to the vague “malicious use of ICT” throughout their documents at the UN and the G20 (UN Group of Governmental Experts 2015: 6; G7 2017). That way, liberal democratic governments such as the U.S. and European countries can claim that their concerns are limited to hacking and related use of ICT, thereby opposing discussions of content while authoritarian governments such as Russia and China can claim that this definition reflects their broader conceptualization of ‘information security.'\nTaking these political realities into account while striving for a robust and sound academic definition, cyber norms can be defined as standards of appropriate behavior with respect to the use of ICT inconsistent with the objectives of maintaining international stability and security. The value of this definition is that it sets cyber norms apart from the broader set of norms that shape our behavior online\nfrom dating online to shopping online. This definition of ‘cyber norms' combines (1) the standard definition of norms in International Relations theory  with (2) the use of the term ‘cyber norms' in the international relations context, namely in the context of international security and the UNGGE process (General Assembly 1999).\nIn fact, the successful adoption UNGGE reports in 2010, 2013, and 2015 demonstrates that diplomats have been able to make progress despite their disagreement with respect to the scope of ‘information security.' John Rawls's ‘overlapping consensus' and Cass Sunstein's ‘incompletely theorized agreements' help explain why actors, including states, can agree on particular norms despite divergent values . The use of offensive cyber operations that could pose a threat to international stability and security is such an area with greater intersubjective agreement. Hacking has enabled a diffusion of reach for actors around the world to create effects remotely, the truly novel and unique aspect of the technology, ranging from stealing data to manipulating centrifuges of nuclear enrichment facilities or disrupting power supply .\n### Part 2: Contestation Over Existing Norms\nTo analyze the impact of existing norms, namely existing international law, it is worth noting that some scholars propose to differentiate between norm ‘validity contestation' and norm ‘application contestation' . Norm validity contestation involves actors debating whether a norm or a set of norms is valid generally and to be upheld. Norm application contestation does not challenge whether a norm or set of norms is generally valid but whether it “is appropriate for a given situation...over time and varying local contexts, such application discourses often lead to evolving interpretations of a norm, in line with new technological inventions” .\nThese distinctions are particularly useful with respect to norms and emerging technologies. Yet, applying the concept of validity and application contestation to cyber norms raises a conceptual challenge because cyberspace is viewed by an increasing number of states not only as a new technology but as a standalone “domain” of human interaction complementing the conventional military domains of operation—land, sea, air, and space . The special status of cyberspace as a domain has fueled arguments that it requires its own set of rules.\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\n\nGenerally speaking, the question whether international law applies to behavior online is an example of validity contestation. China's refusal until 2013 to affirm that international law generally applies to cyberspace constitutes such validity contestation. In fact, China's argument for the need to negotiate international law anew can be seen within the context of its broader contestation of the liberal world order and validity of its norms. Seen in this light, China's behavior reflects a general challenge to the validity of norms that solidified in the aftermath of World War II including with respect to rules of the road for cyberspace. It was not until the 2013 UNGGE consensus report that China was willing to change its position.¹⁴ In this case, the impact of the cyber norms discussion and China's temporary contestation on existing norms was to ultimately reinforce the latter with several governments including Russia's explicitly¹⁵ affirming their views that international law does apply .\n## 3.2.2 Cyber Norms and Application Contestation\nFollowing the 2013 consensus that international law generally applies to cyberspace, application contestation has become the dominant dynamic in the cyber norms process. Discussing how international law applies was part of the 2016/2017 UNGGE's mandate. It was also one of the reasons why the UNGGE collapsed in 2017 because its members could not agree on whether or not to include an explicit reference in the UNGGE report specifying that international humanitarian law (IHL) applies to cyberspace.¹⁶ According to the U.S. representative, “those who are unwilling to affirm the applicability of these international [humanitarian] legal rules and principles believe their States are free to act in or through cyberspace to achieve their political ends with no limits or constraints on their actions” .¹⁷\n¹⁴ Part of China's argument was that affirming the applicability of international law would have unintended consequences namely contributing to the militarization of cyberspace. I thank Arun Sukumar for highlighting this point.\n¹⁵ The Doctrine of Information Security of the Russian Federation approved by Decree of the President of the Russian Federation on December 5, 2016, states in paragraph 4 as a basic notion that “The Constitution of the Russian Federation, universally recognized principles and norms of international law, international treaties signed by the Russian Federation...form the legal framework of the Doctrine” specifying in paragraph 34 that “Information security activities of government bodies is based on the following principles...(e) compliance with the universally recognized principles and norms of international law, international treaties to which the Russian Federation is a party and laws of the Russian Federation.”\n¹⁶ There is an inherent contradiction in states’ positions having on the one hand confirmed that existing international law applies but then refusing to affirm that a subset of existing international law, international humanitarian law, applies. While the latter could be considered another example of validity contestation, it is included in the section on application contestation due to the previous affirmation that existing international law generally does apply.\n¹⁷ It is worth noting that the US government also contests the validity of certain parts of international law. For example, the US government does not recognize due diligence as a legal concept applying to cyberspace. See Schmitt (2015a) on due diligence.\nT. Maurer\nCuba also issued a statement explaining that the reason why it and other states including China rejected affirming the applicability of IHL in the context of ICT “since it would legitimize a scenario of war and military actions in the context of ICT” referencing “unilateral punitive force actions, including the application of sanctions and even military action by States claiming to be victims of illicit uses of ICTs” . An Indian expert on the UNGGE, Arun Sukumar, has since pointed out that “This argument, however, is really about military objectives. Countries that are rapidly scaling up their offensive cyber capabilities are buying time to test the effects of new weapons on civilian networks and critical infrastructure. To commit to the applicability of IHL, they fear, would be to foreclose the development and testing of some cyber weapons that may have unintended consequences” .\nSukumar’s statement implies that, in his view, it was interests rather than identity that drove states’ behavior.¹⁸ There are two characteristics of offensive cyber operations that lend weight to this assessment. First, the more sophisticated an actor, the more precise such an actor can be in limiting the effect of malware . Second, the more sophisticated an actor, the easier it is for such an actor to successfully attribute the source of malicious cyber activity. IHL is based on norms such as distinguishing between civilian and military targets and proportionality. Both depend on precision. Similarly, the exercise of the right to self-defense and use of countermeasures depend on the ability to trace malicious activity back to its source territory. This explains why Sukumar argues that “In reality, Cuba and others are concerned that an endorsement of the ‘right to self-defense’ will undermine asymmetric advantages which states that do not enjoy conventional superiority over their adversaries may have in cyberspace” . Through this lens, the debate over international law with respect to cyberspace is an example of the concept of ‘lawfare’ .¹⁹ Ultimately, both—interests and identity—are likely to have influenced states’ behavior in this context.\nDespite the disagreements over whether to explicitly affirm its applicability, emerging state practice in cyberspace so far seems to suggest that states’ behavior is strongly influenced by IHL. With the exception of the Stuxnet malware whose effects according to some international lawyers can be considered equivalent to the ‘use of force’, all other incidents publicly known to date have remained below this threshold and often aligned with principles of IHL.²⁰ This possibly illustrates\n¹⁸ Sukumar in an email dated March 3, 2019, noted that “self-actualization of ‘identity’ of states in this domain is still a work in progress and therefore, it would not be surprising if individual positions were to change over the course of subsequent rounds of negotiations but, of course, short term interests have a great role in shaping that identity.”.\n¹⁹ If one rejects this assessment and instead takes the Cuban statement at face value as echoing others’ concerns over a militarization of the Internet, it reflects the different approaches between pacifists and Dunantists. Pacifists advocate for the abolition of war. Dunantists follow Henry Dunant’s humanitarian footsteps acknowledging that wars will occur (at least in their lifetime) and therefore focus on making it less cruel.\n²⁰ The temporary 6-h blackout in Ukraine in 2015 caused by a cyber attack is not considered a violation of the 2015 UNGGE norm protecting critical infrastructure, at least by the U.S. government which considers Ukraine to have been in a state of armed conflict at the time (Markoff et al 2017). I thank Duncan\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\na significant degree of restraint by states in the use of available offensive tools and deliberate design thereof.²¹ With that said, it is also worth noting that despite some states having explicitly affirmed that they consider IHL to apply to cyberspace, their international lawyers have yet to agree on how it applies specifically.²² This lack of clarity is not limited to highly specific scenarios but extends to such foundational questions as to whether data enjoys the status of an object as such, which in turn determines whether distinctions between military and civilian objects apply .\n## 3.3 Part 3: Contestation Over the Emergence of Cyber Norms\nThe key challenge for the international community to address is what some scholars have called ‘subthreshold activity’: effects caused by malicious cyber activity below the threshold of ‘use of force’/‘armed attack’ . That is also why the discussion about cyber norms has been driven by an “effects-based logic” . Norms governing subthreshold effects through cyberspace are less a question of applicability of existing international law but best described through the lens of cyber norm emergence.²³\nThe contestation over the emergence of cyber norms ties back to the initial Russian proposal for an arms control treaty focusing on information security. A main point of contestation since then has been over whether a new, legally binding treaty is required to codify new norms for cyberspace or whether a soft law approach is better suited. Moscow has continued to promote the idea of a treaty through a draft International Code of Conduct and by circulating a draft convention . The Shanghai Cooperation Organization and partnering with China has been the main vehicle for this effort. Meanwhile, the U.S. and its Western allies have used the London Conference on Cyberspace series to advocate for their vision . With that said, this bifurcation into two camps became murkier when Microsoft launched its campaign for a Digital Geneva Convention in 2017 .\nDespite this broader contestation, the governmental experts were able to reach agreement on a list of eleven voluntary, nonbinding norms outlined in their 2015 UNGGE report. Figure 1 details this list together with a set of questions to help\nFootnote 20 (continued)\nHollis for pointing out that this does not mean that the attack did not potentially violate provisions of IHL, for example, with respect to the indiscriminate targeting of civilians.\n²¹ This article disagrees with the assessment that states are developing a “policy of optionality toward the application of international law” as suggested by Efrony and Shany (2018: 648–649) and instead attributes the lack of clarity and explicit statements to the still nascent understanding and nature of cyber norms.\n²² See, for example, Hathaway et al (2012); Schmitt and Vihul (2014); Eichensehr (2014).\n²³ According to the norm life cycle, norm entrepreneurs will help advance the emergence of a new norm that can eventually reach a tipping point. Once a sufficient number of relevant actors support the norm for it to reach a cascade, the norm becomes internalized reflecting normal patterns of behavior with only sporadic violations .\nSpringer\nASSER PRESS\ndetermine their level of ambiguity (for discussion of different levels of ambiguity generally, see Jose (2018) 27; Abbott et al. (2000) 415). Complementing the affirmation that existing international law applies, the voluntary nature of these norms is reflected by the use of “should” rather than “must” or “are obliged to”. Moreover, the U.S. has explicitly promoted behavior that it does not consider to be part of international law as norms. Assessing the level of compliance therefore primarily depends on the state whose compliance is being assessed having explicitly affirmed that it will adhere to the described standard of appropriate behavior. Also, the meaning of these voluntary norms remains contested. It is also unclear if all states are committed to all eleven norms equally. For example, the U.S. government had explicitly proposed four of the eleven norms . Is it equally committed to the other seven it agreed to in 2015? What about other countries' priorities?\nWith respect to the diffusion of the agreed upon statements on norms, Fig. 2 shows various international accords over the past decade since the first successful UNGGE started convening in 2009 . The list shows a timeline of relevant multilateral accords explicitly referencing cyber norms. This includes successful UNGGE reports which were subsequently endorsed by heads of states at the G20, the G7, and in other multilateral and bilateral statements. These efforts demonstrate that the “socialization tools employed to make the norm effective” include a mix of global and regional institutions to help diffuse the agreements reached and to support the norms reaching a tipping point and cascading effect . Specifically noteworthy is the significantly increasing number of such accords starting in 2015 and thereafter contributing to the diffusion of the norms agreed to in the 2015 UNGGE report. Many of these are the result of a deliberate effort by UNGGE member states to increase awareness of the UNGGE process among non-UNGGE member states and thereby enhance its universality, legitimacy, and global adherence.\n### Part 4: Contestation Over Access to Contestation\nWho gets to sit at the table and participate in the discussions about norms for cyberspace has also been contested. UNGGEs were restricted clubs with membership limited to initially 15 and eventually 25 member states with the composition changing from one UNGGE to the next. While the consistent participation of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council provided a minimum of legitimacy, other countries have criticized the restrictive membership as cybersecurity rose on the agenda. In fact, for the UNGGE established in 2016 with its 25 members, nearly three times as many member states expressed their desire to be part of the group reflecting a desire to move from being norm takers to being norm shapers. In other words, it is a reflection of contestation over ‘access to contestation' as a pre-condition for agency and participation in contestation in the first place .\nA Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms\n|  VOLUNTARY, NONBINDING NORM | AMBIGUITY + KEY QUESTIONS  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  (a) Consistent with the purposes of the United Nations, including to maintain international peace and security, States should cooperate in developing and applying measures to increase stability and security in the use of ICTs and to prevent ICT practices that are acknowledged to be harmful or that may pose threats to international peace and security; | How will 'cooperation' be assessed?

These criticisms can be considered a standalone metacontestation over the existing UN process writ large. Its critics question whether the UN process has been sufficiently impactful, whether it is worth pursuing further, and whether it ought to be replaced with a different process. These arguments focus on (1) the broad scope and vague nature of agreements, (2) the inadequacy of addressing the deteriorating security environment, (3) the hidden agendas, including hypocrisy, of some stakeholders, and (4) the disconnect between those negotiating and those carrying out offensive operations.\n\nSpringer # ASSER PRESS T.

Instead of viewing the UNGGE's framework as too broad and ambitious, this separate camp of critics argues that the UNGGE process has not been ambitious enough. They see a functional need for international cooperation among governments and transnational cooperation among nongovernmental actors to address the deteriorating cybersecurity environment. A leading voice of this group is the multinational company Microsoft. After years of being involved in international cyber norms discussions, Microsoft CEO Brad Smith elevated the company's engagement to an unprecedented level by calling for a Digital Geneva Convention. In the wake of the economic costs caused by the 2017 WannaCry and NotPetya, these voices have become louder with a growing number of CEOs joining the chorus. In addition, the UN Secretary General made the topic a priority in 2018 supporting a more ambitious agenda.This group of norm entrepreneurs remains very active trying to further advance the cyber norms discussion by keeping the pressure on governments. For example, Microsoft broadened its efforts beyond its engagement as a single company by creating the ‘Tech Accord' consortium counting more than 70 global companies at the beginning of 2019 (Cybersecurity Tech Accord 2018). In late 2017, Siemens established a nonrival network of a dozen companies creating a ‘Charter of Trust' focusing specifically on supply chain integrity. Meanwhile, the Dutch government led the charge to add a norm protecting the core of the Internet to the list of norms agreed to through the 2015 UNGGE. The French government's desire to maximize the impact of the Paris Peace Forum launched in 2018 at the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I led to the adoption of the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace in November 2018 that explicitly references the norm to protect the core of the Internet (France Diplomatie 2018). The Paris Call has also been described as an umbrella framework for the activities of various norm entrepreneurs. Hidden agendas Those promoting a more ambitious agenda have encountered a number of challenges due to the dynamics among and within governments. First, among governments, calls for a treaty have been met with resistance by Western governments. Concerned about Moscow's true intentions, these governments worry that any push for a treaty will empower Moscow's longstanding proposal. Their concerns explain continued resistance by Washington and Western capitals with respect to the draft International Code of Conduct that Moscow and Beijing developed in 2011, updated in 2015, and have been promoting since (see McKune 2015.) They also help explain why Microsoft's call for a Digital Geneva Convention has met similar resistance and illustrate that overcoming this path dependence would require exceptional circumstances. Second, within governments, national security agencies are reluctant to internalize and adhere to the norms reflected in the UNGGE agreements due to the still nascent understanding of the domain, a related desire to preserve options until a mature strategic framework has emerged, and the dynamics of the security dilemma. A good illustration of this still maturing understanding of the technology is the argument promoted by some that there is moral obligation to use hacking instead of conventional weaponry if the effects of the former are less harmful than the latter. Disconnect between those negotiating and those conducting offensive cyber operations A final obstacle worth mentioning—rather in form of a hypothesis than conclusive analysis—is that a particular challenge for negotiating cyber norms may be that the conduct of offensive cyber operations originated in and continues to be closely tied to intelligence agencies, the most secretive parts of any government. Until recently, their public engagement was minimal. For example, the acronym of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) has been commonly referred to as ‘No Such Agency.' The bureaucratic culture of these agencies is therefore not infused with a history of interactions with their respective counterparts internationally (apart from the norms governing spy swaps that emerged during the Cold War.) Unlike the militaries of the world that—despite fighting each other—have developed norms for the exchange of prisoners, the treatment of the wounded, and other activity, this sort of interaction is not part of intelligence agencies' DNA. With that said, the pace of change affecting intelligence agencies in the past 5 years alone is breathtaking with potential changing attitudes toward such interactions. For example, from the NSA to the Australian signals directorate, agencies now even have active Twitter accounts and terms such as Five Eyes have become household names (Australian Signals Directorate 2018).\n## The Flipside: The Impact of Cyber Norms on Existing Norms Not only have existing international law and norms shaped the thinking about behavior in cyberspace but, on the flipside, the discussion about cyber norms has had an impact on existing international law and norms more broadly. For example, the affirmation of states' commitment to foundational norms of the international system such as sovereignty, the UN Charter, and international law have reinforced these A Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms foundational norms. Moreover, in addition to what has been affirmed and included through the UNGGE process, it is important to take into account what has been excluded. For example, breaches of confidentiality of data for espionage purposes have been deliberately excluded from the UNGGE process, both with respect to economic and political espionage. This exclusion in and of itself reflects normativity.\nThe best case study showing how the cyber norms discussion has impacted intersubjective agreement on existing international law and norms is indeed the debate over espionage. While ultimately not included in UNGGE process, the role of intelligence collection activity has been part of the discussions. Particularly in the aftermath of Edward Snowden, some countries such as Brazil and Germany were keen to discuss potential norms with respect to political espionage. However, they introduced their resolutions in the UN General Assembly's Third Committee rather than through the First Committee and UNGGE process.29 Other countries, namely the U.S., opposed such initiatives arguing that political espionage is not prohibited under international law but constitutes legitimate intelligence collection. In short, while contested by some, the debate starting in 2013 reinforced the existing norms governing political intelligence collection overall.\nAt the same time, the U.S. government has been very keen to reinforce the norm against economic espionage, namely the theft of intellectual property for competitive advantage, as the U.S. is specifically concerned by China's cyber-enabled behavior. In fact, of the five norms that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry outlined as U.S. government priorities in 2015, one of the five focused on economic espionage30. While mentioned in the same context of cyber norms in his speech, the U.S. government did not pursue this issue through the UNGGE process to avoid introducing espionage to the First Committee discussions. Instead, the U.S. government pursued a bilateral agreement with China31 and subsequently a G20 communique incorporating the language of the bilateral agreement.\nHow challenging it has been for the U.S. government to communicate its nuanced view and differentiation between legitimate political espionage and illegitimate economic espionage is illustrated by the Chinese government's misperception of Washington's demands. In 2015, the U.S. government was requesting that Beijing arrest Chinese hackers responsible for economic espionage. Beijing eventually responded by presenting the arrest of hackers allegedly for the breach of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and theft of confidential Springer ASSER PRESS data of U.S. government employees. In light of the public outrage among members of the U.S. Congress over the OPM breach, Beijing apparently believed the arrests would address the U.S. government's demand. The White House was subsequently at pains trying to communicate to Beijing that the U.S. government actually believed that the OPM breach—as much as it despised its occurrence—had been a legitimate activity and therefore did not expect the arrest of those hackers but instead wanted Beijing to crack down on those carrying out economic espionage.\n## Conclusion and Broader Reflections International consensus on norms for cyberspace remains in its infancy. Nevertheless, there have been active international discussions on norms for cyberspace since the late 1990s. In addition, states and non-state actors have been using offensive cyber operations for years. These discussions and activities do not take place in isolation but have been shaping cyber norms. The UNGGE process has contributed to the international community's understanding of norms for cyberspace by crystallizing the core tensions, affirming and thereby reinforcing the applicability of existing international law, and becoming an incubator for the construction of new norms and diffusion thereof.\nThe collapse of the 2017 UNGGE marks a caesura in the international discussion on cyber norms. The process collapsed due to a combination of geopolitical tensions, competing tactics, and growing pressure to open the process to others. Relations between Russia and the U.S. the drivers behind the UNGGE process, were at an historic low. Most argue the relationship is at its worst since the end of the Cold War, some even argue there is less dialogue now than during the Cold War. It is therefore not surprising that participants privately only gave the 2016/2017 UNGGE a 50/50 chance of success at its beginning. While future analysis may consider the failure of the 2017 UNGGE only a temporary set-back in the diplomatic process, it is a caesura nevertheless. Importantly, the 2017 collapse of the UNGGE process demonstrates that rising geopolitical tensions and heightened security concerns trumped growing pressures to address the functional need to cooperate in light of the deteriorating security environment illustrated by WannaCry and NotPetya.\nStarting in the fall of 2019, there will be a new UNGGE and a new open-ended working group—the “mess in New York” as one ambassador called it. This outcome was not by design, the U.S. and Russia simply could not agree on a compromise resolution like they had in the past. Countries caught in the middle then thought it was best not to alienate either and voted for both the American proposal for a new UNGGE and the Russian proposal for an open-ended working group. Both remain anchored in the UN General Assembly's First Committee that created the five UNGGEs. How to make sense of them and establish some sort of complementarity was left to the UN Secretariat. If and how the two processes will build on each other remains an open question (as of August 2019). It is also unclear whether the U.S. will buy into the open-ended working group based on Russia's proposal and vice versa with respect to the UNGGE or if they will try to sabotage the other.\nSome states plan to use the two new processes to focus on how best to operationalize the agreed upon norms. Capacity-building is emerging as a priority, although it is unclear how this will differ from past commitments to capacity-building. Moreover, neither process is likely to address the question how those states behind some of the most aggressive activity in the past, namely Iran and North Korea, can become deterred from similar activity in the future. A key indicator for future developments will be the generational transition among the chief negotiators in coming years. When the godfather and godmother of cyber norms, Andrey Krutskikh and Michele Markoff, step down, the question will be whether their successors will pursue the same strategies or make incremental or even transformational changes. This transition is likely to also raise the question if China will assume a more active role in this discussion and how its behavior will shape cyber norms in the future.\nIn short, neither the new UNGGE nor the open-ended working group are likely to produce a diplomatic breakthrough by 2021. Despite growing pressures on governments, particularly from multinational companies as well as a few NGOs to address the deteriorating cybersecurity environment as a functional need, some states are becoming even more reluctant to pursue a more ambitious multilateral agenda. For example, the U.S. government has started focusing on holding actors accountable and enforcing the norms agreed to through the 2015 UNGGE. After years of primarily cyber threat intelligence companies exposing state-sponsored cyber operations, the U.S. and other governments have become increasingly active in attributing such activity and doing so in a coordinated fashion. For example, the U.S. and other governments released statements holding Russia accountable for the NotPetya malware attack on the eve of the 2018 Munich Security Conference.\n### Broader Reflections With respect to the bigger picture, the twenty-year old negotiations among states about cyber norms are a microcosm of the broader changes in world politics and the international system at the beginning of the 21^{st} century. They reflect the resurgence of great power rivalry, competing value propositions, and strategic decisions in the face of a global technology revolution. Russia's determination to remain a globally relevant actor, China's desire to shape the world order of the 21st century, and the U.S. attempt to retain its dominant position all permeate the international discussions on which rules apply to cyberspace and how. These debates also foreshadow broader systemic tensions between clashing political systems and visions for the future of the liberal world order.\nSo what does the process so far tell us about how norms emerge for cyberspace? It is clear that the top-down approach of the diplomatic negotiations is only one piece of the puzzle. While the UN process has certainly contributed to strengthening intersubjective agreement on what behavior is considered (in)appropriate in cyberspace, recent developments have exposed its shortcomings. Existing international law does provide a baseline framework but how it applies and what norms govern the new types of effects and resulting gaps in existing international law remains unclear. Efforts such as the Tallinn Manual and the voluntary norms outlined in the 2015 UNGGE reports are useful attempts to clarify these open questions, yet states are proceedings cautiously. Meanwhile, state practice is slowly emerging and becoming increasingly visible to others. The two are likely to increasingly converge in coming years providing fresh impetus for the construction and internalization of norms for cyberspace.\nNye has pointed out that “norms and institutions develop much more slowly than technology”. Part of the reason is that states continue to struggle on multiple fronts. States are still struggling with conceptualizing the technology and its implications which hampers the development of coherent strategies and policies. For example, in the U.S. the State Department's pursuit of a framework for stability and the cyber deterrence initiative announced by the White House in 2018 are disconnected from the development of the strategic concept of ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defend forward' outlined in the 2018 Command Vision for U.S. Cyber Command (Department of State 2018; White House 2018a; U.S. Cyber Command 2018). Western governments are revisiting their split of cyber operations from information operations in the early 2000s in light of Moscow's and Beijing's more integrated doctrines, especially in the wake of Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.\nStates are also struggling to keep pace with technological developments, the proliferation of capabilities, and the malicious use of these capabilities. For example, most cyber incidents of the past decade were surprises, from the Iranian Distributed Denial of Service attacks from 2011 to 2013 to North Korea's attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014, (White House 2015a, b; Department of Justice 2016). Meanwhile, the number of countries developing offensive cyber tools rose from half a dozen to over 30 countries between 2010 and 2017 (Clapper, Lettre, and Rogers 2017).\nUltimately, the two new processes at the UN reflect competing visions for the future of cyberspace raising important questions for members of the international community. Should states have more or less power? Will they tolerate the existing institutions governing the Internet consisting primarily of private transnational A Dose of Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms Acknowledgements Many thanks to Arun Sukumar, Duncan Hollis, Garrett Hinck, and Hannes Ebert in addition to two anonymous reviewers for providing feedback on an earlier draft of this article."

    "abstract": "Norms for cyberspace remain highly contested internationally among governments and fragmented domestically within governments. Despite diplomatic activities at the United Nations over the past two decades, intersubjective agreement on norms governing coercive cyber power is still nascent. Agreed upon, explicitly stated norms are considered voluntary, defined vaguely, and internalized weakly. Implicit state practice is slowly emerging, yet poorly understood, and cloaked in secrecy. This raises the question: how do norms emerge for cyberspace? What has been the contribution of the UN process to the international community's understanding of norms for cyberspace? Why did the process collapse in 2017, the very same year that two of the biggest cyber attacks to date—WannaCry and NotPetya—caused indiscriminate economic harm worldwide each with an estimated cost of several billion U.S. dollars? And why did member states, in an unprecedented move in the UN's history, create two separate processes dedicated to the same issue in 2018? To answer these questions, this article analyses the various factors feeding into the dynamic process of norm contestation including an in-depth discussion of the process at the United Nations, the role of international law, and the main points of critiques.
