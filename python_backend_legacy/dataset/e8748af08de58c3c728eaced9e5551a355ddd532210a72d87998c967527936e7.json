In this article, we contend that governments take on roles vis-à-vis both domestic and foreign audiences, often resulting in conflicts between crosscutting internal and external role expectations. To alleviate these role conflicts, governments use various secret instruments of statecraft that, in turn, shape international norm development. We theorize the nexus between domestic and foreign role play and secrecy, thereby extending the understanding of role taking in international relations to the cyber-space. We argue that whereas the role conceptions of autocratic powers China and Russia have been geared toward cyber-sovereignty of the regime vis-à-vis internal and external others, the United States, as a democratic power, has sought cyber-security for both state and non-state actors in the international realm. Trying to hide some of their cyber-operations, the interaction between China, Russia and the US has resulted in a distinct pattern of cyber-proxy use and state-based surveillance interaction that has facilitated the stabilization of illiberal cyber-espionage norms and the spread of diverging notions of information sovereignty.\n\n## KEYWORDS\n\ncyber-espionage; sovereignty; proxies; norms; secrecy\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe emergence of international norms in cyber-space are bound up with the ways in which states specify and act upon norms in gestation. The extent scholarship on cyber-norms has recognized the importance of Great Power rivalry, competing political systems, sub-state actors and uncertainty about new technologies as probable causes of norm emergence.¹ So far, however, little work has explored the nexus between the validity and facticity of an emerging norm on cyber-espionage.² And yet, linking discursive specification and (identifiable) practices to the robustness of a norm offers a distinct perspective on the social purchase of an emerging norm, thus providing a broad conception of the co-constitutive effects of agency actions and norms.³\n\nCONTACT Kerstin Zettl-Schabath  kerstin.zettl@ipw.uni-heidelberg.de  @kerstin_zettl  Institute of Political Science, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany\n\n© 2022 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC",

In doing so, we examine the potential formation of a cyber-espionage norm by focusing on processes of verbal and practical norm contestation and concealment that may shape, stall and even reverse, the emergence of a norm. The cyber-espionage norm complex is unique since there is not even an uncontested overarching and explicit offline norm baring political or economic espionage. We also suggest that the norm dynamics identified in the field of espionage may spill over into other cyber-norm evolution cases as well, so that the non-emergence of cyber-espionage norms may tell us about norm evolution in the cyber-realm more broadly.\n\nConstructivist research has explored the social origin norm evolution for a long time, highlighting the co-constitutive nature as “collective expectations for the proper behavior of actors with a given identity”. Conceptually, constructivists do tie an actor's identity to the standards of a given group even if these standards are still in gestation. Since developing and enacting norms do involve discursive action, most notably speech acts and practices, norm contestation may be understood as a social process in which competing norms are expressed and acted upon, but also as social processes in which actors explicitly claim the validity of a norm while challenging the facticity of the norm through adverse action. In particular, actors may challenge whether and how the norm may apply in a given context (applicatory contestation), they may also question the exact meaning of the norm (meaning contestation), and they may challenge the righteousness of the norm (validity contestation), thereby signaling different levels of opposition or dissidence toward the international order constituted by that (and/or other) norm(s).\n\nThus far, the extent literature on cyber-espionage has focussed on the development of competing normative visions of cyber-security vs. information-security by Great Powers. But little attention has been payed to the question of how far the differences between explicit norm creation, through explicit speech acts, and implicit norm creation, through cyber-practices shapes the very form and direction of cyber-espionage norms. We address this gap by examining the discursive and practice interaction dynamics as revealed in the cyber-espionage norm evolution over the past two decades. To do so, we employ a role theoretical perspective on secrecy, noting that key differences in norm evolution processes result from crosscutting domestic and international expectation pressure to obfuscate the actor's own identity and behavior. We contend that secrecy implies a far greater significance for cyber-espionage in contrast to other forms of potentially impermissible operations in cyber-space: on the one hand, the effectiveness of a cyber-intrusion is (more) dependent upon staying undetected than in the offline world. On the other hand, keeping an intrusion secret may have reputational, financial, political or legal benefits for a victim, too. It follows then that secrecy constitutes a buffer",

In keeping offensive operations secret, both victims and offenders can manipulate their respective information environments, protecting information about their capacities and vulnerabilities as well as their intentions and respective reputation.\n\nRole theory is particular well suited to address concerns of secretive behavior in international politics. With deep roots in anthropology, social psychology and the philosophical school of American pragmatism, it suggests that roles are interbehavioural phenomena that emerge in social settings between individuals, groups and states, once social interactions result in dense and permanent expectations so that relatively stable patterns of a division of labor among role beholders emerge. In this reading, international roles are „functional positions emanating from ego and alter expectations directed toward a (common) purpose of a group“ as they pertain to states, so that substantial changes in state roles are directly tied to the norms of the international community. It follows that norm contestation, i.e. diverging expectations as to which behavior is appropriate, and role conflict, either interrole conflict -- which role should be pursued by an actor -- or intrarole conflict -- what does the role mean to the actor and significant other actors -- provide for constitutive mechanism as to how and why some norms may or may not develop and in which shape or form they do. Thus far, role theory has been used successfully to explain the emergence and fluctuation of sovereignty norms, but it has not been explored how secretive behavior, role conduct and norm emergence conceptually may fit together.\n\nIn this article, we argue that role theory advances our understanding of the cyber-espionage norm emergence process in several significant ways: First, role theory priviledges agency properties and actions over structures, i.e. norms, which is especially suitable to social situations in which uncertainty is high (as is the case for cyber-espionage), and institutionalization is low and norms are, if at all, in their infancy. In the cyber-realm, some progress has been made over the past decade to devise a catalog of norms and practices, e.g. the Tallinn Manuals. Here, however, we focus on actual state practice, which either underpins or undermines the verbal claims by governments to comply with extant norms, thereby strengthening the facticity (verbal recognition of norm) and validity (behavioral compliance with the norm). As Bruce Biddle and other role theoreticians have noted: “norms are said to provide merely a set of broad imperatives within which the details of roles can be worked out. Actual roles, then, are thought to reflect norms, attitudes, contextual demands, negotiation, and the evolving definition of the situation as understood by the actors.” Secondly, we contend that great powers which deem themselves as tied in asymmetrical hierarchical power relationships and in situations of high uncertainty, prefer using a combination of “frontstage” public signals to establish themselves as respectable leading members of international society",

Thirdly, role theory does not purport a single and/or fixed national identity or strategic culture to direct cyber-behavior such as other theoretical approaches do. Rather, role theory allows for vertical contestation, i.e. through societal actors and groups, and horizontal contestation, e.g. in government-opposition relations, intra-governing coalition and between governmental bureaucracies. Crosscutting role expectations towards a government on how to behave domestically and/or internationally may then result in “split behavior”: on the frontstage, behavior is directed to preserve a country`s international reputation as a respected member of the international community, most notably, safeguarding its sovereignty and autonomy vis-á-vis more powerful or more determined other states, institutions and non-state actors. However, on the backstage, governments may want to utilize covert actions by proxies or intelligence operatives, to mask international behavior that is deemed inappropriate on the frontstage but which is necessary to meet domestic or intra-governing coalition expectations, i.e. to advance, political, commercial or development interests or to display the superiority of one's own political system. In short, secrecy allows governments to speak with a “split voice” and address the expectations of two, often times diverging, audiences at the same time.\n\nOur role theoretical treatment of the norm evolution follows established practices in role theoretical research, using both speech acts and physical (non-) acts as representations of discursive and practical role behavior. Specifically, we do not purport that speech acts reflect genuine intentions nor do we claim that our quantitative data set has identified all the cases of (illicit) soft- or hardware infringements. Rather, we would like to stress from our symbolic interactionist (and constitutive) perspective, that the meaning of an action, speech act or otherwise, is revealed or concealed by the reaction or non-reaction of others that imbues or deprives to imbue meaning into an action. In more concrete terms, if a role is taken on, it depends on the taking up of a commensurate role by other actors whether the social group and its purpose of which the original role taking process is a part of, is stabilized. If commensurate roles are not taken up, though, or if respective role taking behavior is concealed, then no stabilization of respective role expectations can occur.\n\nIn the remainder of the article, we proceed as follows: First, we conceptualize the role theoretical nexus between secrecy and norm emergence. (Secret) role taking behavior may vary along two axes: domestic vs. international role expectations and the political vs. economic role taking. Respective discourses and practices, of course, may and do change over time. The second section presents the role behavior by Russia, China and",

To analyze their cyber-espionage conduct, a new cyber-conflict-dataset (HD-CY.CON) is used, indicating distinctive patterns in which governments used different types of secrecy to meet expectations. We conclude with a summary of our findings, demonstrating how secrecy concerns shape role taking behavior which in turn facilitate or hamper cyber-espionage norm formation.\n\n## The Secrecy-Role-Norm Nexus\n\nGrounded in symbolic interactionism international roles are constituted through Ego, i.e. domestically generated, and Alter, i.e. international, expectations toward the appropriate behavior of an actor in a group (of states). Sovereignty norms, as foundational rules of the international society, proscribe sovereignty roles to state actors which in turn require recognition of these actors, e.g. states, as “sovereign”. Through recognition as sovereign, sovereign powers are ascribed which may or may not be exerted, e.g. treaty making, joining international institutions etc. It follows that governments strive for recognition as legitimate sovereigns in the international realm as well as domestic realm, providing for various political, i.e. participation, security etc. and economic, i.e. wellbeing, goods to the international and national society.\n\nWhen doing so, cyber-operations may trigger a focus on one of the resulting role expectation types: First, if a government is challenged by an external actor that threatens its domestic sovereignty, e.g. through a misinformation campaign, the respective government may want to strengthen its domestic sovereignty by reasserting its control over information distribution. However, by restricting information distribution, a government, particularly democratic governments, may disregard societal expectations for freedom of speech, resulting in an adversarial two-level expectation game situation. Second, if the dominant (liberal) sovereignty norms collide with domestic expectations toward the international role of a country, the government has several options: to accept the international order (and respective external role expectations) and to adapt domestic expectations accordingly. Or the government accepts the international order but may want to change the country's role in it, e.g. by joining a new status group. Alternatively, the country may want to change the international order altogether, seeking a new role in a new order, thereby changing the social purpose and or hierarchy in the respective international society. In the latter case, countries (and their governments) become “revisionist powers,” seeking to change the international order and their country's role in it, thereby meeting domestic expectations about the country's purpose and role in the international order.",

Here, we are focussing on the question whether the discursive and practical enactment of sovereignty roles on the two axes include the right to “the non-consensual collection of confidential information that is under the control of another actor”, i.e. espionage. Specifically, we highlight the potential role conflicts resulting from three distinct contexts: First, even in the offline world, espionage norms, particularly their scope, communality and obligation, in war- and peace-time have been contested so that analogical reasoning between the existing international law and the emergence of respective cyber-norms is complicated. Second, in cyber-space undetected intrusion is a necessary condition for any kind of non-consensual access to a network. This is also true in cases of cyber-espionage that are supplemented by more disruptive actions, i.e. so-called “hack-and-leak” operations (or “doxing”), because these operations require secrecy before the disruptive effects become known to the victim and the public, in order to achieve their intended purpose(s). This severely complicates the question whether an intrusion serves intelligence gathering only or more nefarious purposes and whether it constitutes a violation of sovereignty. Third, while sovereignty norms are imbued with notions of equality, autonomous choice and the physical integrity among states, depending on the state's relative material and immaterial position vis-á-vis the majority of the international society, a state's government may feel entitled to exert its freedom of action to the detriment of other states (lesser or stronger powers, threatening or non-threatening states). This establishes a legal ambivalence: the government may accept the ascribed power to act autonomously by others as an equal right for all, but it may also use that same right to infringe upon the sovereign right of others. This is particularly true for cyber-espionage operations where the legal delineations between permissible and impermissible actions vary not only over time, but also depending on the targets and data involved and their subsequent instrumentalization.\n\nDrawing on recent advances in the study of secrecy, we argue that role conflicts emanating from crosscutting domestic and international expectations toward cyber-security vs. cyber-sovereignty have become so prevalent that they have a direct bearing on the emergence or non-emergence of cyber-espionage norms. In particular, we contend that as long as words and deeds lack publicity in the respective audiences, actors can avoid being held accountable for each of them or inconsistencies between them, thereby being able to act without incurring domestic or international reputational losses, i.e. impunity. It follows that governments may forego stabilizing their behavioral patterns, i.e. roles, by not tying their identifiably role behavior to explicit standards of approriate behavior, i.e. norms. In these cases, covert cyber-operations may be visible to the adversary's government but that this government may withhold information about the operation or its impact too, depending on the domestic and international reputational costs incured when not responding. In order to alleviate the reputational",

It follows that a government of a country under attack may blame a proxy, rather than a responsible government, in order to avoid domestic and/or international reputational costs when not standing up to the attacking government. The attribution through a proxy also allows for more moderate forms of political responses, such as indictments against individual hackers (whose arrest in most cases is more than unlikely), or sanctions against technological front-companies, serving as proxies. These types of actions do not constitute counter-measures under international law, which presuppose the official attribution of respective state agencies and which are regularly more escalatory in nature.\n\nAs a consequence, we contend that cyber-rivals may tacitly cooperate to steer conflicts to a “backstage”, i.e. conduct cyber-operations clandestinely, to leave an external impression to third parties that their cyber-conflict remains limited and even regulated by tacit if not obligatory rules. From a legal perspective, this “backstage” approach is not necessary as most cyber-norms are still in their infancy. Nevertheless, governments appear to still prefer the “backstage” so as to limit political, reputational and economic costs. Under these circumstances, clandestine role behavior resulting from intra-role conflicts does not lead to further, particularly multilateral norm evolution. Rather, as the adversarial interaction between two partners remains (partially) undetected among them and invisible to third parties, offensive cyber-behavior becomes regularized in a given dyad without becoming to be expected by the larger international society because it is not yet tied to intersubjective roles.\n\nIn , we illustrate this nexus between a states' verbal role taking and its role behavior by introducing the predominant democratic role conception, the guardian of the “Web of the Free.” We contrast it with the predominant autocratic role conception, the guardian of the “Web of Sovereigns.” In cases of conflicting domestic and international role expectations, we argue, that governments have a (strong) incentive to use different forms of secrecy. In doing so, they can avoid that intra- or inter-role conflicts turn into conflict escalation dynamics on the international level and de-legitimization dynamics on the domestic level.\n\nMore specifically, if information about a cyber-espionage-operation is revealed which calls a government's public stand into question, the government may react in (at least) two ways: First, it may deny any wrongdoing, rejecting any responsibility or forwarding it to cyber-proxies; second, it may acknowledge espionage operations and shift the narrative post-hoc toward claiming secret operations as legitimate (and less aggressive) expressions of its own role conception. Thus, shielding information from one's own public may be answered by similar behavior of the opponent, as both actor's “share” an interest in controlling conflict escalation dynamics emanating from domestic role expectations.",

The different types of secrecy matter because the resulting interaction patterns with the United States shape the evolution of either dyadic or multilateral expectation patterns, i.e. dyadic or international cyber-espionage roles.\n\n## Cyber-espionage norm emergence: secrecy & initial consensus (1998-2013)\n\nAt the end of the 20^{th} century, cyber-espionage campaigns, such as the alleged Russian Operation Moonlight Maze, indicated that the traditional cold war espionage tactics would be increasingly “going cyber.” To shape the new conflict domain, the Russian Federation launched a proposal for an international treaty for information security in 1998, complemented by a cooperation agreement of the member states of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The initiative indicated Russia's aspiration as a norm entrepreneur of a lex specialis for the cyber-space even before the US and its allies advocated the application of existing international law to cyber-space. From a role theoretical perspective, the Russian government thus took on a new role, making a role in a new setting geared toward a “Web of Sovereigns” rather than taking a role in the existing “Web of the Free.” This new role was tied to the concept of “information security,” which represents efforts by (autoractic) governments to control and censor the flow of information within national intranets, often legitimized by national security concerns. In contrast, democratic governments tend to promote the concept of “cyber security,” which focuses on the effective regulation of malicious cyber-operations rather than restrictions on the access and distribution of information. It follows that these diverging concepts and the respective roles taken to promote them hamper the emergence of common norms in the international community.\n\nFounded in 2004, the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security (UNGGE) acknowledged the need for an international negotiation forum, in order to sound the pathway of cyber-norm development. The final consensus reports in 2010 and 2013 emphasized the need for a common understanding of acceptable behavior in cyber-space (2010) and the need to strengthen the general applicability of international law in the cyber-realm (2013). Even though Russia and China finally agreed to these",

Both of these concepts stress that the content of the information and the technological handling through soft and hardware need to be protected, thereby ascribing the government the role as a sovereign guardian of a “national information space” which must be protected from nefarious foreign and domestic influences.\n\nSpecifically, this role conception entails and legitimizes various forms of foreign espionage and domestic surveillance including data collection, storage and analysis to bolster autocratic regime authority. Specific targets are human rights activists, dissidents or ethnic minorities in and outside the national jurisdiction. Whereas domestic surveillances system, such as China's social credit system, are not kept secret to attract or deter commensurate role taking by citizens, foreign surveillance pratices are mostly kept secret to comply with international privacy standards, except for cases of “tainted leaks” when illegally obtained information is leaked to discredit either the source of content of that information, thereby spreading mistrust or disinformation about opponents of an autocratic regime.\n\nRussia and China also cooperated bilaterally and multilaterally through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and other interstate fora, such as the International Telecommunication Union“ (ITU), to promote the “Web of Sovereigns” as a viable alternative to the US-led multistake-holder based “Web of the Free”.\n\nApart from this frontstage role behavior as would-be autocratic normmakers, Russia and China started to move to the backstage. Our cyber-conflict data shows for the period from the year 2000 on that Russia's operational pattern focused on political espionage in its regional neighborhood (five out of eleven cases) and vis-á-vis the US (five out of eleven from 2000 to 2013). Secrecy enabled the Russian government to meet nationalist domestic expectations -- putting Russia on par with other Great Powers by conducting political espionage -- while mitigating escalation risks with the highly capable US -- by using proxies for most of its espionage operations (eight out of eleven cyber-espionage cases). Pundits on Russian foreign policy agree that despite disagreements over specific foreign policy goals, Russia's foreign policy elites all advocate “that Russia is, and should remain, a power with global interest and global reach.” Notably, Russian secrecy patterns shifted over time: In early cyber-espionage operations the obfuscation of the perpetrator's identity mixed with clandestine actions, resulting in the absence of signaling intentions by Russia. In later operations, clandestine operations decreased and more open, provocative proxy action with lower deniability increased. We suggest that the motivation for obtaining plausible deniability resulted from the shift in the ambivalent relationship between Russia and the United States at the time: Russian-US relations oscillated clearly between verbal confrontation",

The dataset currently records 59 cases of Chinese cyber-espionage with alleged state-involvement between 2003 and 2013. Among the targets attacked, the US stands out with 39 operations. China's operational pattern resembles that of an autocratic developing country: the government allegedly used cyber-proxies in 37 espionage-operations, mostly against technologically superior democracies, such as the US, to leap-frog toward technological superiority while addressing domestic role expectation to further the wellbeing of the Chinese people. In political terms, the Chinese regime shadowed both Russia's bilateral and regional pro-autocratic normentrepeneurship-efforts in the SCO and in- and outside the UNGGE process.\n\nThe US government started in 2009 to respond to this latter pattern. It communicated a legal position that while cyber-espionage in general was tolerable state behavior if carried out to protect national security was deemed non-permissible if economically motivated, i.e. if the stolen data was handed to corporations to give them a head start over their US competitors. Pace, secrecy about US cyber-espionage and surveillance gained enormous conflict potential in the summer of 2013 when the revelations by Edward Snowden took place. The revelations attested to a massive, global US surveillance network that targeted governments and citizens of allies, rivals and enemies to address US national security concerns broadly defined in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks.\n\nThe Snowden revelations forced the Obama administration to reconcile its public rhetoric about the “Web of the Free” and the protection of civil liberties with the US' vast secret surveillance programs. It did so by arguing that national security concerns, including those by allied governments and citizens, required the US government to act secretly, thereby evoking conflicting domestic role expectations in democratic societies concerning crosscutting security and liberty concerns.\n\nInterestingly, instead of addressing the Snowden revelations diplomatically and calling for a multilateral (legal) solution, the Russian government chose to scold the US government of hypocrisy and double standards publicly, thereby mimicring Western concerns about data privacy on the “frontstage” and simultaneously avoiding restrictions on its own “backstage” espionage behavior. In contrast, China's official reaction was circumspect, merely asking the Obama administration to address international concerns squarely. Inofficially, however, the extent and depth of the NSA programs shocked the Chinese government, setting in motion",

Politically, the Chinese government substantially revamped its cyber-security capacities and institutions, establishing both advanced defensive and offensive capacities as well as a host of new governing bodies, institutions and regulations, which as President Xi promised, would make China a “Cyber Superpower.”^{57}\n\nIn sum, the early phase of cyber-espionage norm development was shaped by verbal confrontations between the two main camps within the UNGGE process with a fragile and partial consensus emerging regarding the applicability of international law in cyber-space. All three states conducted substantial cyber-espionage for either political (US & Russia) or economic (China) reasons. Each government used secrecy extensively to reconcile crosscutting internal and external role expectations. When concealed operations were revealed, government's reactions varied considerably because of domestic and foreign expectations: Addressing domestic and allied concerns for democratic transparency and rule of law, the Obama administration sought to legitimize the secret NSA surveillance programs by pointing at the tradeoff between (substantial) national security gains and (limited) privacy losses. In contrast, autocratic governments in Russia and China stuck to their plausible deniability claims about (non-)use of proxies, thereby addressing domestic expectations about regime security and economic wellbeing while evading international concerns.\n\nMore specifically, during this period, the US government did not recognize respective espionage-operations as directly threatening to US domestic order: with Russia being altercasted as a regional power in decline, its cyber-espionage activities did not attract much American attention, the “agent.btz” malware use in 2008 being one of the few exceptions.^{58} A similar pattern of US reactions can be detected with regard to Chinese commercial espionage, the Operations Titan Rain and Operation Aurora being the exceptions to the rule.^{59} However, both the Russian and Chinese government reacted strongly to the revelations of the NSA surveillance activities in 2013, substantially revamping their respective cyber-capacities and postures which resulted in a much more asymmetrical and aggressive approach toward the United States.\n\n## Cyber-espionage norms in turmoil: secrecy & missing normative validity (2014-2016)\n\nThe second phase of cyber-espionage norm evolution from 2014 to 2016 was crucial.

To begin with, Russia, together with Chinese and Cuban delegations, challenged the notion by the United States and other Western states that International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and the right to self-defense (Art. 51) is applicable in cyber-space, holding on to a strict textual reading in the UNGGE process. In turn, both countries -- together with other SCO member states -- submitted a draft document to the UN Secretary General to facilitate an international consensus on international norms and rules guiding the behavior of states in the information space. The Russian government has presented Russia as a “responsible cyber-power” which has an obligation to mitigate US destructive actions and protect traditional norms, such as sovereignty and institutions, such as the UN Security Council, against the Western notion of a “rules-based international order.” The latter being based on informal institutions, including “private or multistakeholder actors,” and “inclusive and consensus-based deliberation” processes which are detrimental to the interests of most autocracies and illiberal democracies. In the offline domain, Russia also challenged the EU -- through its open intervention in Ukraine -- the United States, Turkey and NATO -- through its interventions in Syria and Libya, thereby rebuffing the Obama administration's ascription as a “regional power.”\n\nFor the period 2014 to 2016, the dataset lists 30 cyber-espionage operations with attributed Russian state involvement. Notably, seven of them were publicity-seeking information warfare operations, i.e. doxing. Nearly all of these doxing-cases affected western democracies or international institutions, such as WADA, that -- in one way or the other -- had contested Russia's sovereignty conception.\n\nThe most important Russian information warfare operation was the so-called DNC-Hack, attributed to the APT Fancy Bear, which in turn was directly tied to the military intelligence agency GRU. There is substantial evidence that the DNC-Hack and later disinformation campaigns have been “liberal mimickry operations” by the Russian government, adopting the form of a liberal discourse -- transparency about the nefarious actions of the DNC leadership against Bernie Sanders -- while combining it with non-liberal content, such as data tampering, time sensitive publication or outright disinformation and fake news. As President Putin has argued repeatedly, the Russian government regards publications by Western non-governmental organizations, such as the Soros Foundation or the publication of the so-called Panama Papers, i.e. incriminating reports about corruption in the Russian elite, as US-led information campaigns to topple the Russian government.\n\nIn our role theoretical perspective, the DNC-hack demonstrates Russia's growing role as a dissident in a liberal and Western-dominated international society, as it -- from a Kremlin perspective -- responds to direct Western",

Viewed this way, secrecy is no longer functional because the Russian government wants the world to know that it has the means and wherewithal to hurt Western states and governments whenever it chooses to do so. Arguably, this is an effect of the Snowden revelations, as the United States government lost its ability to act hypocritically and get away with it.\n\nThus, from a Russian perspective, doxing operations merely turn the table on Western states, mimicking liberal values, such as free speech and open elections, by superficially complying with liberal norms while filling them with dissentient content. Accordingly, while Russia is closing its own information space to assert its digital sovereignty by quelling domestic dissent, it mouth-feeds dissent in Western liberal society to destabilize their information environment.\n\nTurning toward the international legal debate on disruptive cyber-espionage operations, UNGGE participants agreed in 2015, that “states should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity that intentionally damages critical infrastructure.” In terms of cyber-espionage, even the probing of foreign critical infrastructures appears to be prohibited under the UNGGE agreement because energy grids or similar entities are no plausible targets of espionage for national security reasons but always suggest a potential disruptive escalation in its aftermath.\n\nChinese role behavior during the second period also reflects a critical shift regarding sovereignty norms and alter expectations in particular by the US government. Between 2012 (the year, Xi took office) and 2015 (the year of the Obama-Xi-Agreement), cyber-espionage operations against US targets were attributed twenty-three times to Chinese state actors or their proxies. Among them were four operations against political targets, ten against commercial entities and four that targeted both receiver types (amongst others).\n\nUnder the Obama administration, US-responses to Chinese operations diverged sharply depending on the targets affected: While political espionage was deemed permissive by Washington economic espionage was not, with exceptions in cases of national security concerns. As the then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper stated in 2015 about the OPM-Hack: “you have to kind of salute the Chinese for what they did” and added, that the US ”would have done the same thing if they had the opportunity to do so.”\n\nIn contrast, the Obama administration grew ever more concerned about Chinese economic cyber-espionage in 2013. In February, the IT-Security Company Mandiant issued a detailed report about a specific Chinese cyber-attack unit in Shanghai (PLA Unit 61398), claiming that this group was responsible for several operations against the US and other Five Eyes member states since 2006. In June 2013, President Obama raised the issue of Chinese",

At the summit both sides signed the so-called “U.S. China-Cyber-Agreement”, committing to:^{72} Provide timely responses to requests for information and assistance concerning malicious cyber-activities,refrain from conducting or knowingly supporting cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, pursue efforts to further identify and promote appropriate norms of state behavior in cyber-space within the international community, and establish a high-level joint dialogue mechanism on fighting cyber-crime and related issues.\n\nParticularly noteworthy is Point 2 of the agreement, a public bilateral commitment to cease permanently economically motivated cyber-espionage. Through this agreement between the most prevalent target of economic espionage and arguably the most notorious perpetrator they sent an important signal to third countries, explicitly distinguishing acceptable from not-acceptable state behavior. Significantly, the PRC government acknowledged for the first time the legitimacy of the prohibition of economic cyber-espionage when stating that “the Chinese government will not, in whatever form, engage in commercial theft or encourage or support such attempts by anyone.”^{73} Moreover, after the first meeting of the new US-Sino cyber-dialogue in December 2015 Xinhua News agency reported that the group had discussed alleged theft of data of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management by Chinese hackers, noting that „through investigation, the case turned out to be a criminal case rather than a state-sponsored cyber attack as the U.S side has previously suspected”, thereby acknowledging that an offensive cyber-operation had occurred from Chinese territory.^{74}\n\nWhile Chinese compliance with the accord rescinded in 2017, the two governments reaffirmed their commitment to “further solidifying, developing, and maintaining the Dialogue mechanism and continuing to strengthen bilateral cooperation in cybersecurity” in the framework of the third US-China joint dialogue on cyber-crime at the end of 2016.^{75}\n\nNotably, the US-China agreement also fertilized similar undertakings between China and other democratic countries: a similar agreement was reached between Great Britain and China, but Germany and China have been unable to settle their discord.^{76} However, in November 2015, the G20 followed suit, including Russia, in accepting the norm against conducting or supporting economically motivated cyber-espionage.^{77}",

In doing so, the United States tried to legalize its own state practice as permissible and the actions of its adversaries as impermissible.\n\nThe Obama administration's approach also explicitly extended to more disruptive campaigns: the US put several (if not all) governments on notice, most notably non-nuclear weapon states under the Nonprolifeation Treaty, that it regards their sovereignty in the cyber-realm as permeable when it comes to the national security of the United States. The administration thus altercasted those countries into a hierarchy at the top of which the United States decides what kind of behavior is acceptable or not. When legitimizing unidentified US counter-operations against the malicious North Korean attacks on Sony Pictures in 2014, President Obama thus declared affirmatively: We cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the US”.^{78}\n\nIn the aftermath of the Snowden revelations, as other countries, such as China, started to make similar arguments, e.g. that China's economic espionage was for a national security purpose and not for economic gains.^{79} It follows that no stabilization of respective expectations between the United States and other great powers occurred, leaving norm evolution stalled during this period.\n\nThe failure of the UNGGE in 2017 to come up with a consensus report stems from these deep-seated disagreements. The strategic use of secrecy as a tool for prioritizing one's own domestic priorities could no longer conceal the incompatibility of the respective international role conceptions: whereas the United States did not regard other nations as sovereign in the traditional sense when it comes to US national security, Russia and China reciprocated with political and or economic espionage to advance their interpretation of information sovereignty, often by undermining the US' sovereignty as a democratic republic.\n\n## Cyber-espionage norms and forward action: the strategic neglect of secrecy (2017-2021)\n\nWith the incoming Trump administration, the US foreign and cyber-security role taking shifted markedly. Most notably, under President Trump the United States started to ascribe rival and/or enemy roles to former allies and foes alike by insisting on a transactionalist agenda, which prioritized one-time interactions over longer-term relationships. By altercasting China as a direct threat to US national security and hegemony, the Trump administration addressed the expanding territorial and economic sovereignty claims by the communist regime and identified them as violations of US-sovereignty.

The Trump administration's offensive cyber-strategy also featured some interesting, if illiberal, characteristics. With the so-called “Clean Network Initiative,” which was described by some observers as a “watershed” for the US internet policy, the administration moved closer to an authoritarian approach of protecting national information spaces and thus fragmenting global digital communication networks. In doing so, the United States also moved closer to resemble those democratic “swing-states” that cast their vote issue-dependent within the UN, thereby aligning with the “sovereigntist” vis-à-vis the “liberal sphere” in the internet governance debate.\n\nThe Trump administration changed tracks in domestic and external cyber-role taking behavior by more assertively applying the concept of “defending forward”: domestically, control and oversight functions in the executive branch and between the administration and Congress were reduced; externally, the United States proactively embedded US espionage malware in foreign infrastructure networks and started to publicly attribute nefarious attacks on US soil more systematically, thereby lifting the veil of secrecy in operational terms. This partial lifting of secrecy, however, may also be identified in the cyber-policies of democracies, e.g. in joint attribution statements in the aftermath of the Microsoft Exchange Hack 2021 or even the growing number of increasingly detailed National Cyber (Security) Strategies.\n\nThus, for the period of 2017-2021 the dataset and further case-investigations indicate nine US cyber-operations abroad which were directly or indirectly disclosed by US actors (2017-2019: six; 2020: two, 2021: one case). These pro-active signaling efforts were paralleled by a new offensive cyber-strategy, allegedly imposing higher costs on cyber-adversaries permanently to deter future actions. It comes as no surprise then that four of the nine US offensive operations were directed against Russian targets, four against Iran and one against North Korea. All but one of these US-operations allegedly had disruptive effects. When compared to the Obama administration, which had focused its response to the DNC-hack on domestic measures, the Trump administration employed external measures, such as the offensive cyber-operation to block the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll farm, from carrying out a cyber-enabled influence operation against the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. Notably, however, when targeting the Kremlin-associated troll factory instead of attacking Russia's military intelligence agency (GRU) directly, which was ultimately deemed responsible for most of state-based Russia's offensive cyber-operations, the Trump administration deliberately chose a target with less escalation potential.

However, these earlier operations were expanded in 2017 mounting to the “placement of potentially crippling malware inside the Russian system at a depth and with an aggressiveness that had never been tried before.”^{88} Moreover, through extensive public reporting, the Trump administration reiterated its capacity and willingness to exploit the infiltration of foreign networks for acts of sabotage, thereby reminding potential foes of similar earlier campaigns during peacetime, such as Stuxnet and Operation Nitro Zeus.^{89} Given these circumstances, an absolute ban on any form of cyber-operations against critical infrastructure, such as enshrined in the 2015 UNGGE report, appeared to be illusory.\n\nNotably, and in contrast to Russia, Chinese targets were absent from the US list for disruptive operations during this period, raising the question whether the communist regimes' cyber-operations did not require any proactive forward defense even though the administration escalated its offline conflicts with Beijing during the same period.\n\nInterestingly, the dataset also suggests that the intensified defending forward strategy was unsuccessful if not counterproductive: First, while the US expanded its offensive cyber-capacity, the Trump administration did neglect US defenses, thereby presenting Russian and Chinese operations ample reasons and a target-rich US domestic cyber-environment for escalating their offensive cyber-operations. Thus, in the period from 2017 to 2019, our dataset currently records thirteen operations with Chinese, ten operations with Russian, nine with Iranian and six with North Korean state involvement against US targets. Initial estimates for the years 2020 and 2021 do not indicate a decline in these operations. Rather, Chinese cyber-operations against (among others) U.S. targets appear to increase in intensity, as the Microsoft Exchange hack from 2021 suggests. As these numbers only reflect publicly known incidents at this time, they are bound to grow due to delayed detection and attribution processes. Arguably, with the Biden administration still assessing the damages from the SolarWinds, Microsoft Exchange and various other data compromise campaigns directed at US targets and attributed to Russian and Chinese operatives, the full extent of the blowback of the US forward cyber-defense strategy is still to be determined.^{90} And yet, given that the Biden administration has already declared its determination to respond to the SolarWinds operation, a new and more escalatory phase in disruptive operation may be in the making.\n\nIn diplomatic terms Russia also intensified its role taking as a dissident in the liberal international order: after the failed UNGGE consensus in 2017, the country proposed a resolution to the UN General Assembly (UNGA)",

Andrey Krutskikh, the Special Representative of the President of the Russian Federation for International Cooperation on Information Security, explained Russia's opposition to the UNGGE process: “Russia has come in conflict with the position of certain countries that seek to impose on the whole world their own game rules in the information space, which would only serve their own interests.”\n\nFrom a role theoretical perspective, the statement ascribes the role of a technologically dominant and hypocritical hegemon to the US, trying to legitimize its own superiority and respective aggressive actions through international law. Amb. Krutskikh also reaffirmed Russia`s position, that the western-favored focus on “humanitarian aspects” in cyber-space is nothing more than an attempt to legitimize its own use of cyber-force.\n\nThe first OEWG concluded with its Final Draft report in March 2021. The report reaffirmed that international law, and in particular the Charter of the UN, is applicable in the cyber-domain. But the report lacks any concrete recommendations concerning its actual application. It merely states that future discussions on the topic will be necessary. Moreover, and resembling the failed UNGGE consensus in 2017, it does not contain references to international humanitarian law, human rights law, and customary law, as well as principles of the UN Charter.\n\nIn the annex of the Chair`s Summary of the OEWG Final Draft report in 2021, China reiterates its strong conceptual support of national sovereignty and information security, noting that “states should refrain from using ICTs to interfere in internal affairs of other states and undermine their political, economic and social stability.” Moreover, China declared that “states should not exploit their dominant position in ICTs, [...] to undermine other states' right to independent control of ICT goods and services as well as their security,” thereby rejecting the Trump administration`s role ascription as a systemic rival and claiming China's role as an enhancer of prosperity on an international level.\n\nIn sum, the third phase saw an open confrontation between democratic vs. autocratic dominated state camps at the UN-level, resulting in two parallel institutional tracks for norm evolution. While Russia more actively took over the role of a dissident, the Chinese government chose the more accommodative role as an opponent in the current order.

Instead, our role theoretical argument has been guided by two conceptual premises: the co-constitution of domestic and international roles of governments vis-á-vis internal and external others, and the effects of secrecy on role taking and subsequent norm evolution. Our aim has been to better understand how government's use secrecy to obfuscate role conflicts resulting from internal and external expectations and their bearing on international norm evolution.\n\nThe sovereignty-role nexus applied here zoomed in the intricate two-level role conflicts emanating from two autocratic powers trying to bolster their domestic and foreign sovereignty in the face of an increasingly pro-active democratic power that seeks to protect its expansive national security concerns through proactive cyber-espionage measures. By acting clandestinely, both proponents of the “Web of the Free” as well as the “Web of Sovereigns” to hide information that does undermine their respective normative claims about their role in the international order: While comprehensive clandestine surveillance programs allow the US government to obfuscate the violation of privacy concerns, both in the US and abroad, through extensive proxy use autocratic governments try to obfuscate the violation of sovereign rights of other (mostly democratic) nations.\n\nWhen cyber-espionage operations became public over the past two decades, norm evolution started but dissipated soon: After the Snowden revelation, the Obama administration rejected to establish a binding norm, even among allies. In the German case, this resulted in the adaptation of domestic security law which legalized future US-German intelligence cooperation even when German citizen's data privacy is concerned. In the case of the US-China economic espionage agreement, China at first complied with the bilateral norm, but only so long as to avoid painful economic sanction against its tech giants. Since the onset of the US-trade war and open struggle for IT and AI dominance under the Trump administration, there appears to be less incentive on either side for self-restraint.\n\nMore generally speaking, recent role changes in cyber-espionage behavior by the US, China and Russia appear to result in norm nanism not only because secrecy prevents stable behavioral and discursive expectations over time.

However, Ukrainian information operations during the recent war with Russia indicate that even autocratic regimes are not immune against reputational losses, bolstered by the use of information communication technologies, addressing their own population. Furthermore, the leak of internal communication of the cyber crime outlet “Conti” by an alleged Ukrainian researcher is further evidence for the use of typical Russian disinformation tactics, now utilised by its usual victims against Russian-affiliated cyber actors themselves.\n\nConsistent with the role theoretical literature which asserts that roles bridge the gap between agents and structure, we have shown here that specific sovereignty claims by the US -- political sovereignty may be limited through legitimate cyber-espionage at all times -- and Russia as well as Chinese -- cyber-sovereignty must be asserted both externally and domestically -- have a direct (negative) bearing on norm evolution.\n\nCompared to more structural approaches toward norm evolution, our role theoretical perspective emphasizes the role of agency and the role conflicts emanating from a diverse set of expectations toward that agency. As such, our perspective should be also able to accommodate norm setting practices by other governmental or non-governmental institutions than the political leadership, e.g. intelligence services. When doing so, it would provide a more nuanced view why intelligence agencies may have some or no incentive to support the evolution of inter-state norms and may opt to establish loose forms of expected behavior -- in what has been called “normalization” -- between intelligence operatives of a few selected states.\n\nPace what has been portrayed as norm nanism may (only) be the stillbirth of liberal cyber-espionage norms. Liberal cyber-espionage norms rest on the assumption that responsive governments may use secrecy only in a few restricted cases because secrecy undermines public scrutiny and thus official responsibility. It follows that Russian dissidence and China's opposition in combination with the United States' growing appetite for political espionage may well lead to the effective stabilization of illiberal cyber-espionage norms. With the OEWG process on its way to supplant the less inclusive UNGGE group, a majority of governments in the OEWG group may find the Russian and Chinese concept of information sovereignty more appealing. Controlling information helps governments in fending off domestic claims of transparency and participation as well as international encroachments, e.g. by US security and intelligence agencies doxing incriminating informations, against their regime. However, current Russian efforts to implement a new cyber crime convention within the UN may be stalled, due to Russian violation of Ukraine`s sovereignty, as it is perceived by many countries worldwide. In theoretical terms, Russia's",

At this stage, it remains to be seen what long-term impact Russia`s war against Ukraine will also have on cyber-espionage and its international regulation.\n\nIn this article, we have not set out to trace how and in what direction domestic roles change over time. In the United States, the new Biden administration has declared that it may strengthen the political leadership in cyber-espionage and interagency procedures as the country faces the fallout of several of the worst cyber-espionage operations in recent US history, but also heavily disruptive ransomware operations. The U.S. Cyber-Space Solarium Commission has also made substantial recommendations as to how the United States may restructure its domestic policy process in order to reduce cyber-vulnerabilities and effectuate rational cyber-governing behavior. We thus suspect that the domestic assertion of leadership vis-á-vis a Republican minority in Congress as well as US international leadership vis-á-vis Russia and China will have lasting, if unintended consequences, for the evolution of cyber-espionage norms. It seems that these norms need more transparency about present and past behavior and less hypocrisy about stated goals in order to grow.\n\n## Notes\n\n1.

Apart from this “interference with or usurpation of inherently governmental functions” as the first legal criteria for cyber-espionage operations mounting to sovereignty-violations, the Tallinn Manual II discusses “the degree of infringement upon the target State's territorial integrity” as a second criterion (p. 20). Thus, the physical presence of the espionage-conducting state agents within the targeted country would constitute an act of sovereignty-violation, as it was the case for the (attempted) Russian espionage-operation against the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2018. However, legal experts could not agree on the concrete application of these criteria to various empirical constellations. See: Michael N.

In this article, we contend that governments take on roles vis-à-vis both domestic and foreign audiences, often resulting in conflicts between crosscutting internal and external role expectations. To alleviate these role conflicts, governments use various secret instruments of statecraft that, in turn, shape international norm development. We theorize the nexus between domestic and foreign role play and secrecy, thereby extending the understanding of role taking in international relations to the cyber-space. We argue that whereas the role conceptions of autocratic powers China and Russia have been geared toward cyber-sovereignty of the regime vis-à-vis internal and external others, the United States, as a democratic power, has sought cyber-security for both state and non-state actors in the international realm. Trying to hide some of their cyber-operations, the interaction between China, Russia and the US has resulted in a distinct pattern of cyber-proxy use and state-based surveillance interaction that has facilitated the stabilization of illiberal cyber-espionage norms and the spread of diverging notions of information sovereignty.\n## KEYWORDS\ncyber-espionage; sovereignty; proxies; norms; secrecy\n## Introduction\nThe emergence of international norms in cyber-space are bound up with the ways in which states specify and act upon norms in gestation. The extent scholarship on cyber-norms has recognized the importance of Great Power rivalry, competing political systems, sub-state actors and uncertainty about new technologies as probable causes of norm emergence.¹ So far, however, little work has explored the nexus between the validity and facticity of an emerging norm on cyber-espionage.² And yet, linking discursive specification and (identifiable) practices to the robustness of a norm offers a distinct perspective on the social purchase of an emerging norm, thus providing a broad conception of the co-constitutive effects of agency actions and norms.³\nCONTACT Kerstin Zettl-Schabath  kerstin.zettl@ipw.uni-heidelberg.de  @kerstin_zettl  Institute of Political Science, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany\n© 2022 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC\nIn this article, we develop the concept of a discursive and practice-based norm evolution nexus through a role theoretical lens. In doing so, we examine the potential formation of a cyber-espionage norm by focusing on processes of verbal and practical norm contestation and concealment that may shape, stall and even reverse, the emergence of a norm. The cyber-espionage norm complex is unique since there is not even an uncontested overarching and explicit offline norm baring political or economic espionage. We also suggest that the norm dynamics identified in the field of espionage may spill over into other cyber-norm evolution cases as well, so that the non-emergence of cyber-espionage norms may tell us about norm evolution in the cyber-realm more broadly.\nConstructivist research has explored the social origin norm evolution for a long time, highlighting the co-constitutive nature as “collective expectations for the proper behavior of actors with a given identity”. Conceptually, constructivists do tie an actor's identity to the standards of a given group even if these standards are still in gestation. Since developing and enacting norms do involve discursive action, most notably speech acts and practices, norm contestation may be understood as a social process in which competing norms are expressed and acted upon, but also as social processes in which actors explicitly claim the validity of a norm while challenging the facticity of the norm through adverse action. In particular, actors may challenge whether and how the norm may apply in a given context (applicatory contestation), they may also question the exact meaning of the norm (meaning contestation), and they may challenge the righteousness of the norm (validity contestation), thereby signaling different levels of opposition or dissidence toward the international order constituted by that (and/or other) norm(s).\nThus far, the extent literature on cyber-espionage has focussed on the development of competing normative visions of cyber-security vs. information-security by Great Powers. But little attention has been payed to the question of how far the differences between explicit norm creation, through explicit speech acts, and implicit norm creation, through cyber-practices shapes the very form and direction of cyber-espionage norms. We address this gap by examining the discursive and practice interaction dynamics as revealed in the cyber-espionage norm evolution over the past two decades. To do so, we employ a role theoretical perspective on secrecy, noting that key differences in norm evolution processes result from crosscutting domestic and international expectation pressure to obfuscate the actor's own identity and behavior. We contend that secrecy implies a far greater significance for cyber-espionage in contrast to other forms of potentially impermissible operations in cyber-space: on the one hand, the effectiveness of a cyber-intrusion is (more) dependent upon staying undetected than in the offline world. On the other hand, keeping an intrusion secret may have reputational, financial, political or legal benefits for a victim, too. It follows then that secrecy constitutes a buffer\nfor both perpetrators and victims of cyber-espionage to address role conflicts in the domestic and international realm. In keeping offensive operations secret, both victims and offenders can manipulate their respective information environments, protecting information about their capacities and vulnerabilities as well as their intentions and respective reputation.\nRole theory is particular well suited to address concerns of secretive behavior in international politics. With deep roots in anthropology, social psychology and the philosophical school of American pragmatism, it suggests that roles are interbehavioural phenomena that emerge in social settings between individuals, groups and states, once social interactions result in dense and permanent expectations so that relatively stable patterns of a division of labor among role beholders emerge. In this reading, international roles are „functional positions emanating from ego and alter expectations directed toward a (common) purpose of a group“ as they pertain to states, so that substantial changes in state roles are directly tied to the norms of the international community. It follows that norm contestation, i.e. diverging expectations as to which behavior is appropriate, and role conflict, either interrole conflict -- which role should be pursued by an actor -- or intrarole conflict -- what does the role mean to the actor and significant other actors -- provide for constitutive mechanism as to how and why some norms may or may not develop and in which shape or form they do. Thus far, role theory has been used successfully to explain the emergence and fluctuation of sovereignty norms, but it has not been explored how secretive behavior, role conduct and norm emergence conceptually may fit together.\nIn this article, we argue that role theory advances our understanding of the cyber-espionage norm emergence process in several significant ways: First, role theory priviledges agency properties and actions over structures, i.e. norms, which is especially suitable to social situations in which uncertainty is high (as is the case for cyber-espionage), and institutionalization is low and norms are, if at all, in their infancy. In the cyber-realm, some progress has been made over the past decade to devise a catalog of norms and practices, e.g. the Tallinn Manuals. Here, however, we focus on actual state practice, which either underpins or undermines the verbal claims by governments to comply with extant norms, thereby strengthening the facticity (verbal recognition of norm) and validity (behavioral compliance with the norm). As Bruce Biddle and other role theoreticians have noted: “norms are said to provide merely a set of broad imperatives within which the details of roles can be worked out. Actual roles, then, are thought to reflect norms, attitudes, contextual demands, negotiation, and the evolving definition of the situation as understood by the actors.” Secondly, we contend that great powers which deem themselves as tied in asymmetrical hierarchical power relationships and in situations of high uncertainty, prefer using a combination of “frontstage” public signals to establish themselves as respectable leading members of international society\nwhile also utilizing “backstage” signals, i.e. making use of ‘proxy actors' and or clandestine intelligence operations, to reap the domestic benefits of cyber-espionage while avoiding the reputation costs of questionable operations. Thirdly, role theory does not purport a single and/or fixed national identity or strategic culture to direct cyber-behavior such as other theoretical approaches do. Rather, role theory allows for vertical contestation, i.e. through societal actors and groups, and horizontal contestation, e.g. in government-opposition relations, intra-governing coalition and between governmental bureaucracies. Crosscutting role expectations towards a government on how to behave domestically and/or internationally may then result in “split behavior”: on the frontstage, behavior is directed to preserve a country`s international reputation as a respected member of the international community, most notably, safeguarding its sovereignty and autonomy vis-á-vis more powerful or more determined other states, institutions and non-state actors. However, on the backstage, governments may want to utilize covert actions by proxies or intelligence operatives, to mask international behavior that is deemed inappropriate on the frontstage but which is necessary to meet domestic or intra-governing coalition expectations, i.e. to advance, political, commercial or development interests or to display the superiority of one's own political system. In short, secrecy allows governments to speak with a “split voice” and address the expectations of two, often times diverging, audiences at the same time.\nOur role theoretical treatment of the norm evolution follows established practices in role theoretical research, using both speech acts and physical (non-) acts as representations of discursive and practical role behavior. Specifically, we do not purport that speech acts reflect genuine intentions nor do we claim that our quantitative data set has identified all the cases of (illicit) soft- or hardware infringements. Rather, we would like to stress from our symbolic interactionist (and constitutive) perspective, that the meaning of an action, speech act or otherwise, is revealed or concealed by the reaction or non-reaction of others that imbues or deprives to imbue meaning into an action. In more concrete terms, if a role is taken on, it depends on the taking up of a commensurate role by other actors whether the social group and its purpose of which the original role taking process is a part of, is stabilized. If commensurate roles are not taken up, though, or if respective role taking behavior is concealed, then no stabilization of respective role expectations can occur.\nIn the remainder of the article, we proceed as follows: First, we conceptualize the role theoretical nexus between secrecy and norm emergence. (Secret) role taking behavior may vary along two axes: domestic vs. international role expectations and the political vs. economic role taking. Respective discourses and practices, of course, may and do change over time. The second section presents the role behavior by Russia, China and\nthe United States in three distinct phases, highlighting shifts in rhetorical and practical front- and backstage action (1998-2013, 2014-2016, 2017-2021). To analyze their cyber-espionage conduct, a new cyber-conflict-dataset (HD-CY.CON) is used, indicating distinctive patterns in which governments used different types of secrecy to meet expectations. We conclude with a summary of our findings, demonstrating how secrecy concerns shape role taking behavior which in turn facilitate or hamper cyber-espionage norm formation.\n## The Secrecy-Role-Norm Nexus\nGrounded in symbolic interactionism international roles are constituted through Ego, i.e. domestically generated, and Alter, i.e. international, expectations toward the appropriate behavior of an actor in a group (of states). Sovereignty norms, as foundational rules of the international society, proscribe sovereignty roles to state actors which in turn require recognition of these actors, e.g. states, as “sovereign”. Through recognition as sovereign, sovereign powers are ascribed which may or may not be exerted, e.g. treaty making, joining international institutions etc. It follows that governments strive for recognition as legitimate sovereigns in the international realm as well as domestic realm, providing for various political, i.e. participation, security etc. and economic, i.e. wellbeing, goods to the international and national society.\nWhen doing so, cyber-operations may trigger a focus on one of the resulting role expectation types: First, if a government is challenged by an external actor that threatens its domestic sovereignty, e.g. through a misinformation campaign, the respective government may want to strengthen its domestic sovereignty by reasserting its control over information distribution. However, by restricting information distribution, a government, particularly democratic governments, may disregard societal expectations for freedom of speech, resulting in an adversarial two-level expectation game situation. Second, if the dominant (liberal) sovereignty norms collide with domestic expectations toward the international role of a country, the government has several options: to accept the international order (and respective external role expectations) and to adapt domestic expectations accordingly. Or the government accepts the international order but may want to change the country's role in it, e.g. by joining a new status group. Alternatively, the country may want to change the international order altogether, seeking a new role in a new order, thereby changing the social purpose and or hierarchy in the respective international society. In the latter case, countries (and their governments) become “revisionist powers,” seeking to change the international order and their country's role in it, thereby meeting domestic expectations about the country's purpose and role in the international order.\nThe case of cyber-espionage norms with different sub-specifications offers particular benefits for developing the Secrecy-Role-Norm nexus. Here, we are focussing on the question whether the discursive and practical enactment of sovereignty roles on the two axes include the right to “the non-consensual collection of confidential information that is under the control of another actor”, i.e. espionage. Specifically, we highlight the potential role conflicts resulting from three distinct contexts: First, even in the offline world, espionage norms, particularly their scope, communality and obligation, in war- and peace-time have been contested so that analogical reasoning between the existing international law and the emergence of respective cyber-norms is complicated. Second, in cyber-space undetected intrusion is a necessary condition for any kind of non-consensual access to a network. This is also true in cases of cyber-espionage that are supplemented by more disruptive actions, i.e. so-called “hack-and-leak” operations (or “doxing”), because these operations require secrecy before the disruptive effects become known to the victim and the public, in order to achieve their intended purpose(s). This severely complicates the question whether an intrusion serves intelligence gathering only or more nefarious purposes and whether it constitutes a violation of sovereignty. Third, while sovereignty norms are imbued with notions of equality, autonomous choice and the physical integrity among states, depending on the state's relative material and immaterial position vis-á-vis the majority of the international society, a state's government may feel entitled to exert its freedom of action to the detriment of other states (lesser or stronger powers, threatening or non-threatening states). This establishes a legal ambivalence: the government may accept the ascribed power to act autonomously by others as an equal right for all, but it may also use that same right to infringe upon the sovereign right of others. This is particularly true for cyber-espionage operations where the legal delineations between permissible and impermissible actions vary not only over time, but also depending on the targets and data involved and their subsequent instrumentalization.\nDrawing on recent advances in the study of secrecy, we argue that role conflicts emanating from crosscutting domestic and international expectations toward cyber-security vs. cyber-sovereignty have become so prevalent that they have a direct bearing on the emergence or non-emergence of cyber-espionage norms. In particular, we contend that as long as words and deeds lack publicity in the respective audiences, actors can avoid being held accountable for each of them or inconsistencies between them, thereby being able to act without incurring domestic or international reputational losses, i.e. impunity. It follows that governments may forego stabilizing their behavioral patterns, i.e. roles, by not tying their identifiably role behavior to explicit standards of approriate behavior, i.e. norms. In these cases, covert cyber-operations may be visible to the adversary's government but that this government may withhold information about the operation or its impact too, depending on the domestic and international reputational costs incured when not responding. In order to alleviate the reputational\ncosts domestically and internationally as well as the probability of a punishing counter role taking, i.e. a public or covert counter attack, the attacking government also often uses a proxy, non-state actors used by state actors for covert purposes. It follows that a government of a country under attack may blame a proxy, rather than a responsible government, in order to avoid domestic and/or international reputational costs when not standing up to the attacking government. The attribution through a proxy also allows for more moderate forms of political responses, such as indictments against individual hackers (whose arrest in most cases is more than unlikely), or sanctions against technological front-companies, serving as proxies. These types of actions do not constitute counter-measures under international law, which presuppose the official attribution of respective state agencies and which are regularly more escalatory in nature.\nAs a consequence, we contend that cyber-rivals may tacitly cooperate to steer conflicts to a “backstage”, i.e. conduct cyber-operations clandestinely, to leave an external impression to third parties that their cyber-conflict remains limited and even regulated by tacit if not obligatory rules. From a legal perspective, this “backstage” approach is not necessary as most cyber-norms are still in their infancy. Nevertheless, governments appear to still prefer the “backstage” so as to limit political, reputational and economic costs. Under these circumstances, clandestine role behavior resulting from intra-role conflicts does not lead to further, particularly multilateral norm evolution. Rather, as the adversarial interaction between two partners remains (partially) undetected among them and invisible to third parties, offensive cyber-behavior becomes regularized in a given dyad without becoming to be expected by the larger international society because it is not yet tied to intersubjective roles.\nIn , we illustrate this nexus between a states' verbal role taking and its role behavior by introducing the predominant democratic role conception, the guardian of the “Web of the Free.” We contrast it with the predominant autocratic role conception, the guardian of the “Web of Sovereigns.” In cases of conflicting domestic and international role expectations, we argue, that governments have a (strong) incentive to use different forms of secrecy. In doing so, they can avoid that intra- or inter-role conflicts turn into conflict escalation dynamics on the international level and de-legitimization dynamics on the domestic level.\nMore specifically, if information about a cyber-espionage-operation is revealed which calls a government's public stand into question, the government may react in (at least) two ways: First, it may deny any wrongdoing, rejecting any responsibility or forwarding it to cyber-proxies; second, it may acknowledge espionage operations and shift the narrative post-hoc toward claiming secret operations as legitimate (and less aggressive) expressions of its own role conception. Thus, shielding information from one's own public may be answered by similar behavior of the opponent, as both actor's “share” an interest in controlling conflict escalation dynamics emanating from domestic role expectations.\nDEMOCRACY AND SECURITY\n#\nGraph 1.

In empirical terms, we contend that Russia and China act as what has been called \"frustrated sovereigns\" in cyber-space,[38] i.e. agents that strive for (ever) more recognition of what they themselves claim as a legitimate (autocratic) cyber-sovereignty in a liberal-dominated international cyber-order.[39]\nAs Bettiza and Lewis (2020) have found, these practices regularly include \"liberal performance\", i.e. adopting and reproducing liberal norms in shape and form while turning them against liberal regimes themselves, such as human rights or cyber-incidents or disinformation reports, \"liberal mimicry\", i.e. adopting liberal practices while filling them with dissentient content, such as \"Responsibility-to-Protect\" to legitimize Russian-identity based interventions in the Post-Soviet space; \"civilizational essentialization\", i.e. a practice by which Western norms are presented as an \"other\" vis-à-vis a primordial civilization, and \"counter-norm entrepreneurship,\" a practice to positively promote illiberal norms, ideas and institutions, such as \"cyber\nsovereignty” (see below) and “illiberal good governance”, i.e. controls on internet access, for which even inter-autocratic learning processes seem to emerge.\nIn sum, while sharing some common normative concepts and practices, we contend that Russian and Chinese cyber-espionage discourses and practices display distinct patterns of adversarial role taking or making patterns that have led them to pursue diverging forms of regularized espionage interaction vis-à-vis each other as well as toward the United States. The different types of secrecy matter because the resulting interaction patterns with the United States shape the evolution of either dyadic or multilateral expectation patterns, i.e. dyadic or international cyber-espionage roles.\n## Cyber-espionage norm emergence: secrecy & initial consensus (1998-2013)\nAt the end of the 20^{th} century, cyber-espionage campaigns, such as the alleged Russian Operation Moonlight Maze, indicated that the traditional cold war espionage tactics would be increasingly “going cyber.” To shape the new conflict domain, the Russian Federation launched a proposal for an international treaty for information security in 1998, complemented by a cooperation agreement of the member states of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The initiative indicated Russia's aspiration as a norm entrepreneur of a lex specialis for the cyber-space even before the US and its allies advocated the application of existing international law to cyber-space. From a role theoretical perspective, the Russian government thus took on a new role, making a role in a new setting geared toward a “Web of Sovereigns” rather than taking a role in the existing “Web of the Free.” This new role was tied to the concept of “information security,” which represents efforts by (autoractic) governments to control and censor the flow of information within national intranets, often legitimized by national security concerns. In contrast, democratic governments tend to promote the concept of “cyber security,” which focuses on the effective regulation of malicious cyber-operations rather than restrictions on the access and distribution of information. It follows that these diverging concepts and the respective roles taken to promote them hamper the emergence of common norms in the international community.\nFounded in 2004, the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security (UNGGE) acknowledged the need for an international negotiation forum, in order to sound the pathway of cyber-norm development. The final consensus reports in 2010 and 2013 emphasized the need for a common understanding of acceptable behavior in cyber-space (2010) and the need to strengthen the general applicability of international law in the cyber-realm (2013). Even though Russia and China finally agreed to these\nreports, they also consistently promoted the concepts of “information security” and “cyber-sovereignty”. Both of these concepts stress that the content of the information and the technological handling through soft and hardware need to be protected, thereby ascribing the government the role as a sovereign guardian of a “national information space” which must be protected from nefarious foreign and domestic influences.\nSpecifically, this role conception entails and legitimizes various forms of foreign espionage and domestic surveillance including data collection, storage and analysis to bolster autocratic regime authority. Specific targets are human rights activists, dissidents or ethnic minorities in and outside the national jurisdiction. Whereas domestic surveillances system, such as China's social credit system, are not kept secret to attract or deter commensurate role taking by citizens, foreign surveillance pratices are mostly kept secret to comply with international privacy standards, except for cases of “tainted leaks” when illegally obtained information is leaked to discredit either the source of content of that information, thereby spreading mistrust or disinformation about opponents of an autocratic regime.\nRussia and China also cooperated bilaterally and multilaterally through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and other interstate fora, such as the International Telecommunication Union“ (ITU), to promote the “Web of Sovereigns” as a viable alternative to the US-led multistake-holder based “Web of the Free”.\nApart from this frontstage role behavior as would-be autocratic normmakers, Russia and China started to move to the backstage. Our cyber-conflict data shows for the period from the year 2000 on that Russia's operational pattern focused on political espionage in its regional neighborhood (five out of eleven cases) and vis-á-vis the US (five out of eleven from 2000 to 2013). Secrecy enabled the Russian government to meet nationalist domestic expectations -- putting Russia on par with other Great Powers by conducting political espionage -- while mitigating escalation risks with the highly capable US -- by using proxies for most of its espionage operations (eight out of eleven cyber-espionage cases). Pundits on Russian foreign policy agree that despite disagreements over specific foreign policy goals, Russia's foreign policy elites all advocate “that Russia is, and should remain, a power with global interest and global reach.” Notably, Russian secrecy patterns shifted over time: In early cyber-espionage operations the obfuscation of the perpetrator's identity mixed with clandestine actions, resulting in the absence of signaling intentions by Russia. In later operations, clandestine operations decreased and more open, provocative proxy action with lower deniability increased. We suggest that the motivation for obtaining plausible deniability resulted from the shift in the ambivalent relationship between Russia and the United States at the time: Russian-US relations oscillated clearly between verbal confrontation\n(Putin in 2007 at the Munich Security Conference), de facto cooperation (overflight rights for U.S. forces in the Afghanistan war), and rhetorical truce during the so-called reset phase between 2009 and 2013.\nIn contrast, in this early phase Chinese operational patterns focused on promoting economic growth by the theft of intellectual property through conventional offline and cyber-espionage. The dataset currently records 59 cases of Chinese cyber-espionage with alleged state-involvement between 2003 and 2013. Among the targets attacked, the US stands out with 39 operations. China's operational pattern resembles that of an autocratic developing country: the government allegedly used cyber-proxies in 37 espionage-operations, mostly against technologically superior democracies, such as the US, to leap-frog toward technological superiority while addressing domestic role expectation to further the wellbeing of the Chinese people. In political terms, the Chinese regime shadowed both Russia's bilateral and regional pro-autocratic normentrepeneurship-efforts in the SCO and in- and outside the UNGGE process.\nThe US government started in 2009 to respond to this latter pattern. It communicated a legal position that while cyber-espionage in general was tolerable state behavior if carried out to protect national security was deemed non-permissible if economically motivated, i.e. if the stolen data was handed to corporations to give them a head start over their US competitors. Pace, secrecy about US cyber-espionage and surveillance gained enormous conflict potential in the summer of 2013 when the revelations by Edward Snowden took place. The revelations attested to a massive, global US surveillance network that targeted governments and citizens of allies, rivals and enemies to address US national security concerns broadly defined in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks.\nThe Snowden revelations forced the Obama administration to reconcile its public rhetoric about the “Web of the Free” and the protection of civil liberties with the US' vast secret surveillance programs. It did so by arguing that national security concerns, including those by allied governments and citizens, required the US government to act secretly, thereby evoking conflicting domestic role expectations in democratic societies concerning crosscutting security and liberty concerns.\nInterestingly, instead of addressing the Snowden revelations diplomatically and calling for a multilateral (legal) solution, the Russian government chose to scold the US government of hypocrisy and double standards publicly, thereby mimicring Western concerns about data privacy on the “frontstage” and simultaneously avoiding restrictions on its own “backstage” espionage behavior. In contrast, China's official reaction was circumspect, merely asking the Obama administration to address international concerns squarely. Inofficially, however, the extent and depth of the NSA programs shocked the Chinese government, setting in motion\nan immediate change in (secret) commercial and governmental activities:^{56} Commercially, US IT corporations suffered significant market losses from respective security concerns in China, leading up to a full-blown Chinese-government effort to reduce dependency on US-technology and corporations. Politically, the Chinese government substantially revamped its cyber-security capacities and institutions, establishing both advanced defensive and offensive capacities as well as a host of new governing bodies, institutions and regulations, which as President Xi promised, would make China a “Cyber Superpower.”^{57}\nIn sum, the early phase of cyber-espionage norm development was shaped by verbal confrontations between the two main camps within the UNGGE process with a fragile and partial consensus emerging regarding the applicability of international law in cyber-space. All three states conducted substantial cyber-espionage for either political (US & Russia) or economic (China) reasons. Each government used secrecy extensively to reconcile crosscutting internal and external role expectations. When concealed operations were revealed, government's reactions varied considerably because of domestic and foreign expectations: Addressing domestic and allied concerns for democratic transparency and rule of law, the Obama administration sought to legitimize the secret NSA surveillance programs by pointing at the tradeoff between (substantial) national security gains and (limited) privacy losses. In contrast, autocratic governments in Russia and China stuck to their plausible deniability claims about (non-)use of proxies, thereby addressing domestic expectations about regime security and economic wellbeing while evading international concerns.\nMore specifically, during this period, the US government did not recognize respective espionage-operations as directly threatening to US domestic order: with Russia being altercasted as a regional power in decline, its cyber-espionage activities did not attract much American attention, the “agent.btz” malware use in 2008 being one of the few exceptions.^{58} A similar pattern of US reactions can be detected with regard to Chinese commercial espionage, the Operations Titan Rain and Operation Aurora being the exceptions to the rule.^{59} However, both the Russian and Chinese government reacted strongly to the revelations of the NSA surveillance activities in 2013, substantially revamping their respective cyber-capacities and postures which resulted in a much more asymmetrical and aggressive approach toward the United States.\n## Cyber-espionage norms in turmoil: secrecy & missing normative validity (2014-2016)\nThe second phase of cyber-espionage norm evolution from 2014 to 2016 was crucial. In this period, Russian and Chinese discursive role taking and cyber-espionage operations severely circumscribed US domestic and\ninternational role taking. To begin with, Russia, together with Chinese and Cuban delegations, challenged the notion by the United States and other Western states that International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and the right to self-defense (Art. 51) is applicable in cyber-space, holding on to a strict textual reading in the UNGGE process. In turn, both countries -- together with other SCO member states -- submitted a draft document to the UN Secretary General to facilitate an international consensus on international norms and rules guiding the behavior of states in the information space. The Russian government has presented Russia as a “responsible cyber-power” which has an obligation to mitigate US destructive actions and protect traditional norms, such as sovereignty and institutions, such as the UN Security Council, against the Western notion of a “rules-based international order.” The latter being based on informal institutions, including “private or multistakeholder actors,” and “inclusive and consensus-based deliberation” processes which are detrimental to the interests of most autocracies and illiberal democracies. In the offline domain, Russia also challenged the EU -- through its open intervention in Ukraine -- the United States, Turkey and NATO -- through its interventions in Syria and Libya, thereby rebuffing the Obama administration's ascription as a “regional power.”\nFor the period 2014 to 2016, the dataset lists 30 cyber-espionage operations with attributed Russian state involvement. Notably, seven of them were publicity-seeking information warfare operations, i.e. doxing. Nearly all of these doxing-cases affected western democracies or international institutions, such as WADA, that -- in one way or the other -- had contested Russia's sovereignty conception.\nThe most important Russian information warfare operation was the so-called DNC-Hack, attributed to the APT Fancy Bear, which in turn was directly tied to the military intelligence agency GRU. There is substantial evidence that the DNC-Hack and later disinformation campaigns have been “liberal mimickry operations” by the Russian government, adopting the form of a liberal discourse -- transparency about the nefarious actions of the DNC leadership against Bernie Sanders -- while combining it with non-liberal content, such as data tampering, time sensitive publication or outright disinformation and fake news. As President Putin has argued repeatedly, the Russian government regards publications by Western non-governmental organizations, such as the Soros Foundation or the publication of the so-called Panama Papers, i.e. incriminating reports about corruption in the Russian elite, as US-led information campaigns to topple the Russian government.\nIn our role theoretical perspective, the DNC-hack demonstrates Russia's growing role as a dissident in a liberal and Western-dominated international society, as it -- from a Kremlin perspective -- responds to direct Western\nviolations of its own sovereignty. Viewed this way, secrecy is no longer functional because the Russian government wants the world to know that it has the means and wherewithal to hurt Western states and governments whenever it chooses to do so. Arguably, this is an effect of the Snowden revelations, as the United States government lost its ability to act hypocritically and get away with it.\nThus, from a Russian perspective, doxing operations merely turn the table on Western states, mimicking liberal values, such as free speech and open elections, by superficially complying with liberal norms while filling them with dissentient content. Accordingly, while Russia is closing its own information space to assert its digital sovereignty by quelling domestic dissent, it mouth-feeds dissent in Western liberal society to destabilize their information environment.\nTurning toward the international legal debate on disruptive cyber-espionage operations, UNGGE participants agreed in 2015, that “states should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity that intentionally damages critical infrastructure.” In terms of cyber-espionage, even the probing of foreign critical infrastructures appears to be prohibited under the UNGGE agreement because energy grids or similar entities are no plausible targets of espionage for national security reasons but always suggest a potential disruptive escalation in its aftermath.\nChinese role behavior during the second period also reflects a critical shift regarding sovereignty norms and alter expectations in particular by the US government. Between 2012 (the year, Xi took office) and 2015 (the year of the Obama-Xi-Agreement), cyber-espionage operations against US targets were attributed twenty-three times to Chinese state actors or their proxies. Among them were four operations against political targets, ten against commercial entities and four that targeted both receiver types (amongst others).\nUnder the Obama administration, US-responses to Chinese operations diverged sharply depending on the targets affected: While political espionage was deemed permissive by Washington economic espionage was not, with exceptions in cases of national security concerns. As the then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper stated in 2015 about the OPM-Hack: “you have to kind of salute the Chinese for what they did” and added, that the US ”would have done the same thing if they had the opportunity to do so.”\nIn contrast, the Obama administration grew ever more concerned about Chinese economic cyber-espionage in 2013. In February, the IT-Security Company Mandiant issued a detailed report about a specific Chinese cyber-attack unit in Shanghai (PLA Unit 61398), claiming that this group was responsible for several operations against the US and other Five Eyes member states since 2006. In June 2013, President Obama raised the issue of Chinese\ncyber-operations directly with President Xi, to be followed by official indictments against the PLA officers (May 2014) and an Executive Order (March 2015) which provided the legal groundwork for sanctioning Chinese companies in the run-up to the State visit of President Xi to the US in September 2015. At the summit both sides signed the so-called “U.S. China-Cyber-Agreement”, committing to:^{72} Provide timely responses to requests for information and assistance concerning malicious cyber-activities,refrain from conducting or knowingly supporting cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, pursue efforts to further identify and promote appropriate norms of state behavior in cyber-space within the international community, and establish a high-level joint dialogue mechanism on fighting cyber-crime and related issues.\nParticularly noteworthy is Point 2 of the agreement, a public bilateral commitment to cease permanently economically motivated cyber-espionage. Through this agreement between the most prevalent target of economic espionage and arguably the most notorious perpetrator they sent an important signal to third countries, explicitly distinguishing acceptable from not-acceptable state behavior. Significantly, the PRC government acknowledged for the first time the legitimacy of the prohibition of economic cyber-espionage when stating that “the Chinese government will not, in whatever form, engage in commercial theft or encourage or support such attempts by anyone.”^{73} Moreover, after the first meeting of the new US-Sino cyber-dialogue in December 2015 Xinhua News agency reported that the group had discussed alleged theft of data of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management by Chinese hackers, noting that „through investigation, the case turned out to be a criminal case rather than a state-sponsored cyber attack as the U.S side has previously suspected”, thereby acknowledging that an offensive cyber-operation had occurred from Chinese territory.^{74}\nWhile Chinese compliance with the accord rescinded in 2017, the two governments reaffirmed their commitment to “further solidifying, developing, and maintaining the Dialogue mechanism and continuing to strengthen bilateral cooperation in cybersecurity” in the framework of the third US-China joint dialogue on cyber-crime at the end of 2016.^{75}\nNotably, the US-China agreement also fertilized similar undertakings between China and other democratic countries: a similar agreement was reached between Great Britain and China, but Germany and China have been unable to settle their discord.^{76} However, in November 2015, the G20 followed suit, including Russia, in accepting the norm against conducting or supporting economically motivated cyber-espionage.^{77}\nIn sum, in this phase the Obama administrations propagated an approach to cyber-espionage norms, which rested on an intricate distinction between illegitimate vs. legitimate use of the affected information and not the target type per se. In doing so, the United States tried to legalize its own state practice as permissible and the actions of its adversaries as impermissible.\nThe Obama administration's approach also explicitly extended to more disruptive campaigns: the US put several (if not all) governments on notice, most notably non-nuclear weapon states under the Nonprolifeation Treaty, that it regards their sovereignty in the cyber-realm as permeable when it comes to the national security of the United States. The administration thus altercasted those countries into a hierarchy at the top of which the United States decides what kind of behavior is acceptable or not. When legitimizing unidentified US counter-operations against the malicious North Korean attacks on Sony Pictures in 2014, President Obama thus declared affirmatively: We cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the US”.^{78}\nIn the aftermath of the Snowden revelations, as other countries, such as China, started to make similar arguments, e.g. that China's economic espionage was for a national security purpose and not for economic gains.^{79} It follows that no stabilization of respective expectations between the United States and other great powers occurred, leaving norm evolution stalled during this period.\nThe failure of the UNGGE in 2017 to come up with a consensus report stems from these deep-seated disagreements. The strategic use of secrecy as a tool for prioritizing one's own domestic priorities could no longer conceal the incompatibility of the respective international role conceptions: whereas the United States did not regard other nations as sovereign in the traditional sense when it comes to US national security, Russia and China reciprocated with political and or economic espionage to advance their interpretation of information sovereignty, often by undermining the US' sovereignty as a democratic republic.\n## Cyber-espionage norms and forward action: the strategic neglect of secrecy (2017-2021)\nWith the incoming Trump administration, the US foreign and cyber-security role taking shifted markedly. Most notably, under President Trump the United States started to ascribe rival and/or enemy roles to former allies and foes alike by insisting on a transactionalist agenda, which prioritized one-time interactions over longer-term relationships. By altercasting China as a direct threat to US national security and hegemony, the Trump administration addressed the expanding territorial and economic sovereignty claims by the communist regime and identified them as violations of US-sovereignty. Focussing on bilateral vis-à-vis\nmultilateral negotiations, and favoring relative positioning vis-á-vis other great powers rather than a functional US leadership position in the international community, became the hallmarks of US foreign and security policy. The Trump administration's offensive cyber-strategy also featured some interesting, if illiberal, characteristics. With the so-called “Clean Network Initiative,” which was described by some observers as a “watershed” for the US internet policy, the administration moved closer to an authoritarian approach of protecting national information spaces and thus fragmenting global digital communication networks. In doing so, the United States also moved closer to resemble those democratic “swing-states” that cast their vote issue-dependent within the UN, thereby aligning with the “sovereigntist” vis-à-vis the “liberal sphere” in the internet governance debate.\nThe Trump administration changed tracks in domestic and external cyber-role taking behavior by more assertively applying the concept of “defending forward”: domestically, control and oversight functions in the executive branch and between the administration and Congress were reduced; externally, the United States proactively embedded US espionage malware in foreign infrastructure networks and started to publicly attribute nefarious attacks on US soil more systematically, thereby lifting the veil of secrecy in operational terms. This partial lifting of secrecy, however, may also be identified in the cyber-policies of democracies, e.g. in joint attribution statements in the aftermath of the Microsoft Exchange Hack 2021 or even the growing number of increasingly detailed National Cyber (Security) Strategies.\nThus, for the period of 2017-2021 the dataset and further case-investigations indicate nine US cyber-operations abroad which were directly or indirectly disclosed by US actors (2017-2019: six; 2020: two, 2021: one case). These pro-active signaling efforts were paralleled by a new offensive cyber-strategy, allegedly imposing higher costs on cyber-adversaries permanently to deter future actions. It comes as no surprise then that four of the nine US offensive operations were directed against Russian targets, four against Iran and one against North Korea. All but one of these US-operations allegedly had disruptive effects. When compared to the Obama administration, which had focused its response to the DNC-hack on domestic measures, the Trump administration employed external measures, such as the offensive cyber-operation to block the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll farm, from carrying out a cyber-enabled influence operation against the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. Notably, however, when targeting the Kremlin-associated troll factory instead of attacking Russia's military intelligence agency (GRU) directly, which was ultimately deemed responsible for most of state-based Russia's offensive cyber-operations, the Trump administration deliberately chose a target with less escalation potential. In a similar vein, when a US Global Hawk drone was shot down by Iranian forces in 2019, the\nTrump administration reportedly executed a cyber-response by using malware that had been implanted in Iranian networks before the attack on the U.S. drone.^{87}\nDisruptive US cyber-operations had started in 2013 as a reconnaissance campaign against the Russian electrical grid. However, these earlier operations were expanded in 2017 mounting to the “placement of potentially crippling malware inside the Russian system at a depth and with an aggressiveness that had never been tried before.”^{88} Moreover, through extensive public reporting, the Trump administration reiterated its capacity and willingness to exploit the infiltration of foreign networks for acts of sabotage, thereby reminding potential foes of similar earlier campaigns during peacetime, such as Stuxnet and Operation Nitro Zeus.^{89} Given these circumstances, an absolute ban on any form of cyber-operations against critical infrastructure, such as enshrined in the 2015 UNGGE report, appeared to be illusory.\nNotably, and in contrast to Russia, Chinese targets were absent from the US list for disruptive operations during this period, raising the question whether the communist regimes' cyber-operations did not require any proactive forward defense even though the administration escalated its offline conflicts with Beijing during the same period.\nInterestingly, the dataset also suggests that the intensified defending forward strategy was unsuccessful if not counterproductive: First, while the US expanded its offensive cyber-capacity, the Trump administration did neglect US defenses, thereby presenting Russian and Chinese operations ample reasons and a target-rich US domestic cyber-environment for escalating their offensive cyber-operations. Thus, in the period from 2017 to 2019, our dataset currently records thirteen operations with Chinese, ten operations with Russian, nine with Iranian and six with North Korean state involvement against US targets. Initial estimates for the years 2020 and 2021 do not indicate a decline in these operations. Rather, Chinese cyber-operations against (among others) U.S. targets appear to increase in intensity, as the Microsoft Exchange hack from 2021 suggests. As these numbers only reflect publicly known incidents at this time, they are bound to grow due to delayed detection and attribution processes. Arguably, with the Biden administration still assessing the damages from the SolarWinds, Microsoft Exchange and various other data compromise campaigns directed at US targets and attributed to Russian and Chinese operatives, the full extent of the blowback of the US forward cyber-defense strategy is still to be determined.^{90} And yet, given that the Biden administration has already declared its determination to respond to the SolarWinds operation, a new and more escalatory phase in disruptive operation may be in the making.\nIn diplomatic terms Russia also intensified its role taking as a dissident in the liberal international order: after the failed UNGGE consensus in 2017, the country proposed a resolution to the UN General Assembly (UNGA)\nthat advocated a separate and more inclusive negotiation forum, an Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG), to discuss the “possible measures that could be taken by the international community to strengthen information security at the global level.” In the end, the UNGA voted for the initiation of a new OEWG that established an alternative negotiation track to the sixth UNGGE, but on a similar, shared mandate, both starting in 2019. Andrey Krutskikh, the Special Representative of the President of the Russian Federation for International Cooperation on Information Security, explained Russia's opposition to the UNGGE process: “Russia has come in conflict with the position of certain countries that seek to impose on the whole world their own game rules in the information space, which would only serve their own interests.”\nFrom a role theoretical perspective, the statement ascribes the role of a technologically dominant and hypocritical hegemon to the US, trying to legitimize its own superiority and respective aggressive actions through international law. Amb. Krutskikh also reaffirmed Russia`s position, that the western-favored focus on “humanitarian aspects” in cyber-space is nothing more than an attempt to legitimize its own use of cyber-force.\nThe first OEWG concluded with its Final Draft report in March 2021. The report reaffirmed that international law, and in particular the Charter of the UN, is applicable in the cyber-domain. But the report lacks any concrete recommendations concerning its actual application. It merely states that future discussions on the topic will be necessary. Moreover, and resembling the failed UNGGE consensus in 2017, it does not contain references to international humanitarian law, human rights law, and customary law, as well as principles of the UN Charter.\nIn the annex of the Chair`s Summary of the OEWG Final Draft report in 2021, China reiterates its strong conceptual support of national sovereignty and information security, noting that “states should refrain from using ICTs to interfere in internal affairs of other states and undermine their political, economic and social stability.” Moreover, China declared that “states should not exploit their dominant position in ICTs, [...] to undermine other states' right to independent control of ICT goods and services as well as their security,” thereby rejecting the Trump administration`s role ascription as a systemic rival and claiming China's role as an enhancer of prosperity on an international level.\nIn sum, the third phase saw an open confrontation between democratic vs. autocratic dominated state camps at the UN-level, resulting in two parallel institutional tracks for norm evolution. While Russia more actively took over the role of a dissident, the Chinese government chose the more accommodative role as an opponent in the current order. Responding to the forward defense strategy of the US, both Russia and China did not alter their role behavior but rather escalated their cyber-espionage operations. The Trump administration's reaction, to increase public attribution through indictment\nprocedures did not change this trend, rather it has strengthened the Russian (and partially Chinese determination) to openly challenge the US government's hypocrisy and to attack its legitimacy as the hegemon of the current liberal international order.\n## Conclusion\nTo explain the absence of the emergence of cyber-espionage norms we have eschewed the notion that this stems from a lack of hegemonic stability or incompatible preferences of domestic groups in the most powerful states. Instead, our role theoretical argument has been guided by two conceptual premises: the co-constitution of domestic and international roles of governments vis-á-vis internal and external others, and the effects of secrecy on role taking and subsequent norm evolution. Our aim has been to better understand how government's use secrecy to obfuscate role conflicts resulting from internal and external expectations and their bearing on international norm evolution.\nThe sovereignty-role nexus applied here zoomed in the intricate two-level role conflicts emanating from two autocratic powers trying to bolster their domestic and foreign sovereignty in the face of an increasingly pro-active democratic power that seeks to protect its expansive national security concerns through proactive cyber-espionage measures. By acting clandestinely, both proponents of the “Web of the Free” as well as the “Web of Sovereigns” to hide information that does undermine their respective normative claims about their role in the international order: While comprehensive clandestine surveillance programs allow the US government to obfuscate the violation of privacy concerns, both in the US and abroad, through extensive proxy use autocratic governments try to obfuscate the violation of sovereign rights of other (mostly democratic) nations.\nWhen cyber-espionage operations became public over the past two decades, norm evolution started but dissipated soon: After the Snowden revelation, the Obama administration rejected to establish a binding norm, even among allies. In the German case, this resulted in the adaptation of domestic security law which legalized future US-German intelligence cooperation even when German citizen's data privacy is concerned. In the case of the US-China economic espionage agreement, China at first complied with the bilateral norm, but only so long as to avoid painful economic sanction against its tech giants. Since the onset of the US-trade war and open struggle for IT and AI dominance under the Trump administration, there appears to be less incentive on either side for self-restraint.\nMore generally speaking, recent role changes in cyber-espionage behavior by the US, China and Russia appear to result in norm nanism not only because secrecy prevents stable behavioral and discursive expectations over time. As\nthe case of Russian infowar and disinformation campaigns shows, liberal mimickry, using Western concepts superficially and filling them with dissentient content, has become a powerful tool to undermine the legitimacy on which democratic societies rest. However, Ukrainian information operations during the recent war with Russia indicate that even autocratic regimes are not immune against reputational losses, bolstered by the use of information communication technologies, addressing their own population. Furthermore, the leak of internal communication of the cyber crime outlet “Conti” by an alleged Ukrainian researcher is further evidence for the use of typical Russian disinformation tactics, now utilised by its usual victims against Russian-affiliated cyber actors themselves.\nConsistent with the role theoretical literature which asserts that roles bridge the gap between agents and structure, we have shown here that specific sovereignty claims by the US -- political sovereignty may be limited through legitimate cyber-espionage at all times -- and Russia as well as Chinese -- cyber-sovereignty must be asserted both externally and domestically -- have a direct (negative) bearing on norm evolution.\nCompared to more structural approaches toward norm evolution, our role theoretical perspective emphasizes the role of agency and the role conflicts emanating from a diverse set of expectations toward that agency. As such, our perspective should be also able to accommodate norm setting practices by other governmental or non-governmental institutions than the political leadership, e.g. intelligence services. When doing so, it would provide a more nuanced view why intelligence agencies may have some or no incentive to support the evolution of inter-state norms and may opt to establish loose forms of expected behavior -- in what has been called “normalization” -- between intelligence operatives of a few selected states.\nPace what has been portrayed as norm nanism may (only) be the stillbirth of liberal cyber-espionage norms. Liberal cyber-espionage norms rest on the assumption that responsive governments may use secrecy only in a few restricted cases because secrecy undermines public scrutiny and thus official responsibility. It follows that Russian dissidence and China's opposition in combination with the United States' growing appetite for political espionage may well lead to the effective stabilization of illiberal cyber-espionage norms. With the OEWG process on its way to supplant the less inclusive UNGGE group, a majority of governments in the OEWG group may find the Russian and Chinese concept of information sovereignty more appealing. Controlling information helps governments in fending off domestic claims of transparency and participation as well as international encroachments, e.g. by US security and intelligence agencies doxing incriminating informations, against their regime. However, current Russian efforts to implement a new cyber crime convention within the UN may be stalled, due to Russian violation of Ukraine`s sovereignty, as it is perceived by many countries worldwide. In theoretical terms, Russia's\naction in the offline-sphere could hinder its ambitions to fill the role of a widely accepted norm promoter of state sovereignty in cyber-space. At this stage, it remains to be seen what long-term impact Russia`s war against Ukraine will also have on cyber-espionage and its international regulation.\nIn this article, we have not set out to trace how and in what direction domestic roles change over time. In the United States, the new Biden administration has declared that it may strengthen the political leadership in cyber-espionage and interagency procedures as the country faces the fallout of several of the worst cyber-espionage operations in recent US history, but also heavily disruptive ransomware operations. The U.S. Cyber-Space Solarium Commission has also made substantial recommendations as to how the United States may restructure its domestic policy process in order to reduce cyber-vulnerabilities and effectuate rational cyber-governing behavior. We thus suspect that the domestic assertion of leadership vis-á-vis a Republican minority in Congress as well as US international leadership vis-á-vis Russia and China will have lasting, if unintended consequences, for the evolution of cyber-espionage norms. It seems that these norms need more transparency about present and past behavior and less hypocrisy about stated goals in order to grow.",

Apart from this “interference with or usurpation of inherently governmental functions” as the first legal criteria for cyber-espionage operations mounting to sovereignty-violations, the Tallinn Manual II discusses “the degree of infringement upon the target State's territorial integrity” as a second criterion (p. 20). Thus, the physical presence of the espionage-conducting state agents within the targeted country would constitute an act of sovereignty-violation, as it was the case for the (attempted) Russian espionage-operation against the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2018. However, legal experts could not agree on the concrete application of these criteria to various empirical constellations. See: Michael N.

In this article, we contend that governments take on roles vis-à-vis both domestic and foreign audiences, often resulting in conflicts between crosscutting internal and external role expectations. To alleviate these role conflicts, governments use various secret instruments of statecraft that, in turn, shape international norm development. We theorize the nexus between domestic and foreign role play and secrecy, thereby extending the understanding of role taking in international relations to the cyber-space. We argue that whereas the role conceptions of autocratic powers China and Russia have been geared toward cyber-sovereignty of the regime vis-à-vis internal and external others, the United States, as a democratic power, has sought cyber-security for both state and non-state actors in the international realm. Trying to hide some of their cyber-operations, the interaction between China, Russia and the US has resulted in a distinct pattern of cyber-proxy use and state-based surveillance interaction that has facilitated the stabilization of illiberal cyber-espionage norms and the spread of diverging notions of information sovereignty.\n## KEYWORDS\ncyber-espionage; sovereignty; proxies; norms; secrecy\n## Introduction\nThe emergence of international norms in cyber-space are bound up with the ways in which states specify and act upon norms in gestation. The extent scholarship on cyber-norms has recognized the importance of Great Power rivalry, competing political systems, sub-state actors and uncertainty about new technologies as probable causes of norm emergence.¹ So far, however, little work has explored the nexus between the validity and facticity of an emerging norm on cyber-espionage.² And yet, linking discursive specification and (identifiable) practices to the robustness of a norm offers a distinct perspective on the social purchase of an emerging norm, thus providing a broad conception of the co-constitutive effects of agency actions and norms.³\nCONTACT Kerstin Zettl-Schabath  kerstin.zettl@ipw.uni-heidelberg.de  @kerstin_zettl  Institute of Political Science, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany\n© 2022 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC\nIn this article, we develop the concept of a discursive and practice-based norm evolution nexus through a role theoretical lens. In doing so, we examine the potential formation of a cyber-espionage norm by focusing on processes of verbal and practical norm contestation and concealment that may shape, stall and even reverse, the emergence of a norm. The cyber-espionage norm complex is unique since there is not even an uncontested overarching and explicit offline norm baring political or economic espionage. We also suggest that the norm dynamics identified in the field of espionage may spill over into other cyber-norm evolution cases as well, so that the non-emergence of cyber-espionage norms may tell us about norm evolution in the cyber-realm more broadly.\nConstructivist research has explored the social origin norm evolution for a long time, highlighting the co-constitutive nature as “collective expectations for the proper behavior of actors with a given identity”. Conceptually, constructivists do tie an actor's identity to the standards of a given group even if these standards are still in gestation. Since developing and enacting norms do involve discursive action, most notably speech acts and practices, norm contestation may be understood as a social process in which competing norms are expressed and acted upon, but also as social processes in which actors explicitly claim the validity of a norm while challenging the facticity of the norm through adverse action. In particular, actors may challenge whether and how the norm may apply in a given context (applicatory contestation), they may also question the exact meaning of the norm (meaning contestation), and they may challenge the righteousness of the norm (validity contestation), thereby signaling different levels of opposition or dissidence toward the international order constituted by that (and/or other) norm(s).\nThus far, the extent literature on cyber-espionage has focussed on the development of competing normative visions of cyber-security vs. information-security by Great Powers. But little attention has been payed to the question of how far the differences between explicit norm creation, through explicit speech acts, and implicit norm creation, through cyber-practices shapes the very form and direction of cyber-espionage norms. We address this gap by examining the discursive and practice interaction dynamics as revealed in the cyber-espionage norm evolution over the past two decades. To do so, we employ a role theoretical perspective on secrecy, noting that key differences in norm evolution processes result from crosscutting domestic and international expectation pressure to obfuscate the actor's own identity and behavior. We contend that secrecy implies a far greater significance for cyber-espionage in contrast to other forms of potentially impermissible operations in cyber-space: on the one hand, the effectiveness of a cyber-intrusion is (more) dependent upon staying undetected than in the offline world. On the other hand, keeping an intrusion secret may have reputational, financial, political or legal benefits for a victim, too. It follows then that secrecy constitutes a buffer\nfor both perpetrators and victims of cyber-espionage to address role conflicts in the domestic and international realm. In keeping offensive operations secret, both victims and offenders can manipulate their respective information environments, protecting information about their capacities and vulnerabilities as well as their intentions and respective reputation.\nRole theory is particular well suited to address concerns of secretive behavior in international politics. With deep roots in anthropology, social psychology and the philosophical school of American pragmatism, it suggests that roles are interbehavioural phenomena that emerge in social settings between individuals, groups and states, once social interactions result in dense and permanent expectations so that relatively stable patterns of a division of labor among role beholders emerge. In this reading, international roles are „functional positions emanating from ego and alter expectations directed toward a (common) purpose of a group“ as they pertain to states, so that substantial changes in state roles are directly tied to the norms of the international community. It follows that norm contestation, i.e. diverging expectations as to which behavior is appropriate, and role conflict, either interrole conflict -- which role should be pursued by an actor -- or intrarole conflict -- what does the role mean to the actor and significant other actors -- provide for constitutive mechanism as to how and why some norms may or may not develop and in which shape or form they do. Thus far, role theory has been used successfully to explain the emergence and fluctuation of sovereignty norms, but it has not been explored how secretive behavior, role conduct and norm emergence conceptually may fit together.\nIn this article, we argue that role theory advances our understanding of the cyber-espionage norm emergence process in several significant ways: First, role theory priviledges agency properties and actions over structures, i.e. norms, which is especially suitable to social situations in which uncertainty is high (as is the case for cyber-espionage), and institutionalization is low and norms are, if at all, in their infancy. In the cyber-realm, some progress has been made over the past decade to devise a catalog of norms and practices, e.g. the Tallinn Manuals. Here, however, we focus on actual state practice, which either underpins or undermines the verbal claims by governments to comply with extant norms, thereby strengthening the facticity (verbal recognition of norm) and validity (behavioral compliance with the norm). As Bruce Biddle and other role theoreticians have noted: “norms are said to provide merely a set of broad imperatives within which the details of roles can be worked out. Actual roles, then, are thought to reflect norms, attitudes, contextual demands, negotiation, and the evolving definition of the situation as understood by the actors.” Secondly, we contend that great powers which deem themselves as tied in asymmetrical hierarchical power relationships and in situations of high uncertainty, prefer using a combination of “frontstage” public signals to establish themselves as respectable leading members of international society\nwhile also utilizing “backstage” signals, i.e. making use of ‘proxy actors' and or clandestine intelligence operations, to reap the domestic benefits of cyber-espionage while avoiding the reputation costs of questionable operations. Thirdly, role theory does not purport a single and/or fixed national identity or strategic culture to direct cyber-behavior such as other theoretical approaches do. Rather, role theory allows for vertical contestation, i.e. through societal actors and groups, and horizontal contestation, e.g. in government-opposition relations, intra-governing coalition and between governmental bureaucracies. Crosscutting role expectations towards a government on how to behave domestically and/or internationally may then result in “split behavior”: on the frontstage, behavior is directed to preserve a country`s international reputation as a respected member of the international community, most notably, safeguarding its sovereignty and autonomy vis-á-vis more powerful or more determined other states, institutions and non-state actors. However, on the backstage, governments may want to utilize covert actions by proxies or intelligence operatives, to mask international behavior that is deemed inappropriate on the frontstage but which is necessary to meet domestic or intra-governing coalition expectations, i.e. to advance, political, commercial or development interests or to display the superiority of one's own political system. In short, secrecy allows governments to speak with a “split voice” and address the expectations of two, often times diverging, audiences at the same time.\nOur role theoretical treatment of the norm evolution follows established practices in role theoretical research, using both speech acts and physical (non-) acts as representations of discursive and practical role behavior. Specifically, we do not purport that speech acts reflect genuine intentions nor do we claim that our quantitative data set has identified all the cases of (illicit) soft- or hardware infringements. Rather, we would like to stress from our symbolic interactionist (and constitutive) perspective, that the meaning of an action, speech act or otherwise, is revealed or concealed by the reaction or non-reaction of others that imbues or deprives to imbue meaning into an action. In more concrete terms, if a role is taken on, it depends on the taking up of a commensurate role by other actors whether the social group and its purpose of which the original role taking process is a part of, is stabilized. If commensurate roles are not taken up, though, or if respective role taking behavior is concealed, then no stabilization of respective role expectations can occur.\nIn the remainder of the article, we proceed as follows: First, we conceptualize the role theoretical nexus between secrecy and norm emergence. (Secret) role taking behavior may vary along two axes: domestic vs. international role expectations and the political vs. economic role taking. Respective discourses and practices, of course, may and do change over time. The second section presents the role behavior by Russia, China and\nthe United States in three distinct phases, highlighting shifts in rhetorical and practical front- and backstage action (1998-2013, 2014-2016, 2017-2021). To analyze their cyber-espionage conduct, a new cyber-conflict-dataset (HD-CY.CON) is used, indicating distinctive patterns in which governments used different types of secrecy to meet expectations. We conclude with a summary of our findings, demonstrating how secrecy concerns shape role taking behavior which in turn facilitate or hamper cyber-espionage norm formation.\n## The Secrecy-Role-Norm Nexus\nGrounded in symbolic interactionism international roles are constituted through Ego, i.e. domestically generated, and Alter, i.e. international, expectations toward the appropriate behavior of an actor in a group (of states). Sovereignty norms, as foundational rules of the international society, proscribe sovereignty roles to state actors which in turn require recognition of these actors, e.g. states, as “sovereign”. Through recognition as sovereign, sovereign powers are ascribed which may or may not be exerted, e.g. treaty making, joining international institutions etc. It follows that governments strive for recognition as legitimate sovereigns in the international realm as well as domestic realm, providing for various political, i.e. participation, security etc. and economic, i.e. wellbeing, goods to the international and national society.\nWhen doing so, cyber-operations may trigger a focus on one of the resulting role expectation types: First, if a government is challenged by an external actor that threatens its domestic sovereignty, e.g. through a misinformation campaign, the respective government may want to strengthen its domestic sovereignty by reasserting its control over information distribution. However, by restricting information distribution, a government, particularly democratic governments, may disregard societal expectations for freedom of speech, resulting in an adversarial two-level expectation game situation. Second, if the dominant (liberal) sovereignty norms collide with domestic expectations toward the international role of a country, the government has several options: to accept the international order (and respective external role expectations) and to adapt domestic expectations accordingly. Or the government accepts the international order but may want to change the country's role in it, e.g. by joining a new status group. Alternatively, the country may want to change the international order altogether, seeking a new role in a new order, thereby changing the social purpose and or hierarchy in the respective international society. In the latter case, countries (and their governments) become “revisionist powers,” seeking to change the international order and their country's role in it, thereby meeting domestic expectations about the country's purpose and role in the international order.\nThe case of cyber-espionage norms with different sub-specifications offers particular benefits for developing the Secrecy-Role-Norm nexus. Here, we are focussing on the question whether the discursive and practical enactment of sovereignty roles on the two axes include the right to “the non-consensual collection of confidential information that is under the control of another actor”, i.e. espionage. Specifically, we highlight the potential role conflicts resulting from three distinct contexts: First, even in the offline world, espionage norms, particularly their scope, communality and obligation, in war- and peace-time have been contested so that analogical reasoning between the existing international law and the emergence of respective cyber-norms is complicated. Second, in cyber-space undetected intrusion is a necessary condition for any kind of non-consensual access to a network. This is also true in cases of cyber-espionage that are supplemented by more disruptive actions, i.e. so-called “hack-and-leak” operations (or “doxing”), because these operations require secrecy before the disruptive effects become known to the victim and the public, in order to achieve their intended purpose(s). This severely complicates the question whether an intrusion serves intelligence gathering only or more nefarious purposes and whether it constitutes a violation of sovereignty. Third, while sovereignty norms are imbued with notions of equality, autonomous choice and the physical integrity among states, depending on the state's relative material and immaterial position vis-á-vis the majority of the international society, a state's government may feel entitled to exert its freedom of action to the detriment of other states (lesser or stronger powers, threatening or non-threatening states). This establishes a legal ambivalence: the government may accept the ascribed power to act autonomously by others as an equal right for all, but it may also use that same right to infringe upon the sovereign right of others. This is particularly true for cyber-espionage operations where the legal delineations between permissible and impermissible actions vary not only over time, but also depending on the targets and data involved and their subsequent instrumentalization.\nDrawing on recent advances in the study of secrecy, we argue that role conflicts emanating from crosscutting domestic and international expectations toward cyber-security vs. cyber-sovereignty have become so prevalent that they have a direct bearing on the emergence or non-emergence of cyber-espionage norms. In particular, we contend that as long as words and deeds lack publicity in the respective audiences, actors can avoid being held accountable for each of them or inconsistencies between them, thereby being able to act without incurring domestic or international reputational losses, i.e. impunity. It follows that governments may forego stabilizing their behavioral patterns, i.e. roles, by not tying their identifiably role behavior to explicit standards of approriate behavior, i.e. norms. In these cases, covert cyber-operations may be visible to the adversary's government but that this government may withhold information about the operation or its impact too, depending on the domestic and international reputational costs incured when not responding. In order to alleviate the reputational\ncosts domestically and internationally as well as the probability of a punishing counter role taking, i.e. a public or covert counter attack, the attacking government also often uses a proxy, non-state actors used by state actors for covert purposes. It follows that a government of a country under attack may blame a proxy, rather than a responsible government, in order to avoid domestic and/or international reputational costs when not standing up to the attacking government. The attribution through a proxy also allows for more moderate forms of political responses, such as indictments against individual hackers (whose arrest in most cases is more than unlikely), or sanctions against technological front-companies, serving as proxies. These types of actions do not constitute counter-measures under international law, which presuppose the official attribution of respective state agencies and which are regularly more escalatory in nature.\nAs a consequence, we contend that cyber-rivals may tacitly cooperate to steer conflicts to a “backstage”, i.e. conduct cyber-operations clandestinely, to leave an external impression to third parties that their cyber-conflict remains limited and even regulated by tacit if not obligatory rules. From a legal perspective, this “backstage” approach is not necessary as most cyber-norms are still in their infancy. Nevertheless, governments appear to still prefer the “backstage” so as to limit political, reputational and economic costs. Under these circumstances, clandestine role behavior resulting from intra-role conflicts does not lead to further, particularly multilateral norm evolution. Rather, as the adversarial interaction between two partners remains (partially) undetected among them and invisible to third parties, offensive cyber-behavior becomes regularized in a given dyad without becoming to be expected by the larger international society because it is not yet tied to intersubjective roles.\nIn , we illustrate this nexus between a states' verbal role taking and its role behavior by introducing the predominant democratic role conception, the guardian of the “Web of the Free.” We contrast it with the predominant autocratic role conception, the guardian of the “Web of Sovereigns.” In cases of conflicting domestic and international role expectations, we argue, that governments have a (strong) incentive to use different forms of secrecy. In doing so, they can avoid that intra- or inter-role conflicts turn into conflict escalation dynamics on the international level and de-legitimization dynamics on the domestic level.\nMore specifically, if information about a cyber-espionage-operation is revealed which calls a government's public stand into question, the government may react in (at least) two ways: First, it may deny any wrongdoing, rejecting any responsibility or forwarding it to cyber-proxies; second, it may acknowledge espionage operations and shift the narrative post-hoc toward claiming secret operations as legitimate (and less aggressive) expressions of its own role conception. Thus, shielding information from one's own public may be answered by similar behavior of the opponent, as both actor's “share” an interest in controlling conflict escalation dynamics emanating from domestic role expectations.\nDEMOCRACY AND SECURITY\n#\nGraph 1.

In empirical terms, we contend that Russia and China act as what has been called \"frustrated sovereigns\" in cyber-space, i.e. agents that strive for (ever) more recognition of what they themselves claim as a legitimate (autocratic) cyber-sovereignty in a liberal-dominated international cyber-order.\nAs Bettiza and Lewis (2020) have found, these practices regularly include \"liberal performance\", i.e. adopting and reproducing liberal norms in shape and form while turning them against liberal regimes themselves, such as human rights or cyber-incidents or disinformation reports, \"liberal mimicry\", i.e. adopting liberal practices while filling them with dissentient content, such as \"Responsibility-to-Protect\" to legitimize Russian-identity based interventions in the Post-Soviet space; \"civilizational essentialization\", i.e. a practice by which Western norms are presented as an \"other\" vis-à-vis a primordial civilization, and \"counter-norm entrepreneurship,\" a practice to positively promote illiberal norms, ideas and institutions, such as \"cyber\nsovereignty” (see below) and “illiberal good governance”, i.e. controls on internet access, for which even inter-autocratic learning processes seem to emerge.\nIn sum, while sharing some common normative concepts and practices, we contend that Russian and Chinese cyber-espionage discourses and practices display distinct patterns of adversarial role taking or making patterns that have led them to pursue diverging forms of regularized espionage interaction vis-à-vis each other as well as toward the United States. The different types of secrecy matter because the resulting interaction patterns with the United States shape the evolution of either dyadic or multilateral expectation patterns, i.e. dyadic or international cyber-espionage roles.\n## Cyber-espionage norm emergence: secrecy & initial consensus (1998-2013)\nAt the end of the 20^{th} century, cyber-espionage campaigns, such as the alleged Russian Operation Moonlight Maze, indicated that the traditional cold war espionage tactics would be increasingly “going cyber.” To shape the new conflict domain, the Russian Federation launched a proposal for an international treaty for information security in 1998, complemented by a cooperation agreement of the member states of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The initiative indicated Russia's aspiration as a norm entrepreneur of a lex specialis for the cyber-space even before the US and its allies advocated the application of existing international law to cyber-space. From a role theoretical perspective, the Russian government thus took on a new role, making a role in a new setting geared toward a “Web of Sovereigns” rather than taking a role in the existing “Web of the Free.” This new role was tied to the concept of “information security,” which represents efforts by (autoractic) governments to control and censor the flow of information within national intranets, often legitimized by national security concerns. In contrast, democratic governments tend to promote the concept of “cyber security,” which focuses on the effective regulation of malicious cyber-operations rather than restrictions on the access and distribution of information. It follows that these diverging concepts and the respective roles taken to promote them hamper the emergence of common norms in the international community.\nFounded in 2004, the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security (UNGGE) acknowledged the need for an international negotiation forum, in order to sound the pathway of cyber-norm development. The final consensus reports in 2010 and 2013 emphasized the need for a common understanding of acceptable behavior in cyber-space (2010) and the need to strengthen the general applicability of international law in the cyber-realm (2013). Even though Russia and China finally agreed to these\nreports, they also consistently promoted the concepts of “information security” and “cyber-sovereignty”. Both of these concepts stress that the content of the information and the technological handling through soft and hardware need to be protected, thereby ascribing the government the role as a sovereign guardian of a “national information space” which must be protected from nefarious foreign and domestic influences.\nSpecifically, this role conception entails and legitimizes various forms of foreign espionage and domestic surveillance including data collection, storage and analysis to bolster autocratic regime authority. Specific targets are human rights activists, dissidents or ethnic minorities in and outside the national jurisdiction. Whereas domestic surveillances system, such as China's social credit system, are not kept secret to attract or deter commensurate role taking by citizens, foreign surveillance pratices are mostly kept secret to comply with international privacy standards, except for cases of “tainted leaks” when illegally obtained information is leaked to discredit either the source of content of that information, thereby spreading mistrust or disinformation about opponents of an autocratic regime.\nRussia and China also cooperated bilaterally and multilaterally through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and other interstate fora, such as the International Telecommunication Union“ (ITU), to promote the “Web of Sovereigns” as a viable alternative to the US-led multistake-holder based “Web of the Free”.\nApart from this frontstage role behavior as would-be autocratic normmakers, Russia and China started to move to the backstage. Our cyber-conflict data shows for the period from the year 2000 on that Russia's operational pattern focused on political espionage in its regional neighborhood (five out of eleven cases) and vis-á-vis the US (five out of eleven from 2000 to 2013). Secrecy enabled the Russian government to meet nationalist domestic expectations -- putting Russia on par with other Great Powers by conducting political espionage -- while mitigating escalation risks with the highly capable US -- by using proxies for most of its espionage operations (eight out of eleven cyber-espionage cases). Pundits on Russian foreign policy agree that despite disagreements over specific foreign policy goals, Russia's foreign policy elites all advocate “that Russia is, and should remain, a power with global interest and global reach.” Notably, Russian secrecy patterns shifted over time: In early cyber-espionage operations the obfuscation of the perpetrator's identity mixed with clandestine actions, resulting in the absence of signaling intentions by Russia. In later operations, clandestine operations decreased and more open, provocative proxy action with lower deniability increased. We suggest that the motivation for obtaining plausible deniability resulted from the shift in the ambivalent relationship between Russia and the United States at the time: Russian-US relations oscillated clearly between verbal confrontation\n(Putin in 2007 at the Munich Security Conference), de facto cooperation (overflight rights for U.S. forces in the Afghanistan war), and rhetorical truce during the so-called reset phase between 2009 and 2013.\nIn contrast, in this early phase Chinese operational patterns focused on promoting economic growth by the theft of intellectual property through conventional offline and cyber-espionage. The dataset currently records 59 cases of Chinese cyber-espionage with alleged state-involvement between 2003 and 2013. Among the targets attacked, the US stands out with 39 operations. China's operational pattern resembles that of an autocratic developing country: the government allegedly used cyber-proxies in 37 espionage-operations, mostly against technologically superior democracies, such as the US, to leap-frog toward technological superiority while addressing domestic role expectation to further the wellbeing of the Chinese people. In political terms, the Chinese regime shadowed both Russia's bilateral and regional pro-autocratic normentrepeneurship-efforts in the SCO and in- and outside the UNGGE process.\nThe US government started in 2009 to respond to this latter pattern. It communicated a legal position that while cyber-espionage in general was tolerable state behavior if carried out to protect national security was deemed non-permissible if economically motivated, i.e. if the stolen data was handed to corporations to give them a head start over their US competitors. Pace, secrecy about US cyber-espionage and surveillance gained enormous conflict potential in the summer of 2013 when the revelations by Edward Snowden took place. The revelations attested to a massive, global US surveillance network that targeted governments and citizens of allies, rivals and enemies to address US national security concerns broadly defined in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks.\nThe Snowden revelations forced the Obama administration to reconcile its public rhetoric about the “Web of the Free” and the protection of civil liberties with the US' vast secret surveillance programs. It did so by arguing that national security concerns, including those by allied governments and citizens, required the US government to act secretly, thereby evoking conflicting domestic role expectations in democratic societies concerning crosscutting security and liberty concerns.\nInterestingly, instead of addressing the Snowden revelations diplomatically and calling for a multilateral (legal) solution, the Russian government chose to scold the US government of hypocrisy and double standards publicly, thereby mimicring Western concerns about data privacy on the “frontstage” and simultaneously avoiding restrictions on its own “backstage” espionage behavior. In contrast, China's official reaction was circumspect, merely asking the Obama administration to address international concerns squarely. Inofficially, however, the extent and depth of the NSA programs shocked the Chinese government, setting in motion\nan immediate change in (secret) commercial and governmental activities:^{56} Commercially, US IT corporations suffered significant market losses from respective security concerns in China, leading up to a full-blown Chinese-government effort to reduce dependency on US-technology and corporations. Politically, the Chinese government substantially revamped its cyber-security capacities and institutions, establishing both advanced defensive and offensive capacities as well as a host of new governing bodies, institutions and regulations, which as President Xi promised, would make China a “Cyber Superpower.”^{57}\nIn sum, the early phase of cyber-espionage norm development was shaped by verbal confrontations between the two main camps within the UNGGE process with a fragile and partial consensus emerging regarding the applicability of international law in cyber-space. All three states conducted substantial cyber-espionage for either political (US & Russia) or economic (China) reasons. Each government used secrecy extensively to reconcile crosscutting internal and external role expectations. When concealed operations were revealed, government's reactions varied considerably because of domestic and foreign expectations: Addressing domestic and allied concerns for democratic transparency and rule of law, the Obama administration sought to legitimize the secret NSA surveillance programs by pointing at the tradeoff between (substantial) national security gains and (limited) privacy losses. In contrast, autocratic governments in Russia and China stuck to their plausible deniability claims about (non-)use of proxies, thereby addressing domestic expectations about regime security and economic wellbeing while evading international concerns.\nMore specifically, during this period, the US government did not recognize respective espionage-operations as directly threatening to US domestic order: with Russia being altercasted as a regional power in decline, its cyber-espionage activities did not attract much American attention, the “agent.btz” malware use in 2008 being one of the few exceptions.^{58} A similar pattern of US reactions can be detected with regard to Chinese commercial espionage, the Operations Titan Rain and Operation Aurora being the exceptions to the rule.^{59} However, both the Russian and Chinese government reacted strongly to the revelations of the NSA surveillance activities in 2013, substantially revamping their respective cyber-capacities and postures which resulted in a much more asymmetrical and aggressive approach toward the United States.\n## Cyber-espionage norms in turmoil: secrecy & missing normative validity (2014-2016)\nThe second phase of cyber-espionage norm evolution from 2014 to 2016 was crucial. In this period, Russian and Chinese discursive role taking and cyber-espionage operations severely circumscribed US domestic and\ninternational role taking. To begin with, Russia, together with Chinese and Cuban delegations, challenged the notion by the United States and other Western states that International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and the right to self-defense (Art. 51) is applicable in cyber-space, holding on to a strict textual reading in the UNGGE process. In turn, both countries -- together with other SCO member states -- submitted a draft document to the UN Secretary General to facilitate an international consensus on international norms and rules guiding the behavior of states in the information space. The Russian government has presented Russia as a “responsible cyber-power” which has an obligation to mitigate US destructive actions and protect traditional norms, such as sovereignty and institutions, such as the UN Security Council, against the Western notion of a “rules-based international order.” The latter being based on informal institutions, including “private or multistakeholder actors,” and “inclusive and consensus-based deliberation” processes which are detrimental to the interests of most autocracies and illiberal democracies. In the offline domain, Russia also challenged the EU -- through its open intervention in Ukraine -- the United States, Turkey and NATO -- through its interventions in Syria and Libya, thereby rebuffing the Obama administration's ascription as a “regional power.”\nFor the period 2014 to 2016, the dataset lists 30 cyber-espionage operations with attributed Russian state involvement. Notably, seven of them were publicity-seeking information warfare operations, i.e. doxing. Nearly all of these doxing-cases affected western democracies or international institutions, such as WADA, that -- in one way or the other -- had contested Russia's sovereignty conception.\nThe most important Russian information warfare operation was the so-called DNC-Hack, attributed to the APT Fancy Bear, which in turn was directly tied to the military intelligence agency GRU. There is substantial evidence that the DNC-Hack and later disinformation campaigns have been “liberal mimickry operations” by the Russian government, adopting the form of a liberal discourse -- transparency about the nefarious actions of the DNC leadership against Bernie Sanders -- while combining it with non-liberal content, such as data tampering, time sensitive publication or outright disinformation and fake news. As President Putin has argued repeatedly, the Russian government regards publications by Western non-governmental organizations, such as the Soros Foundation or the publication of the so-called Panama Papers, i.e. incriminating reports about corruption in the Russian elite, as US-led information campaigns to topple the Russian government.\nIn our role theoretical perspective, the DNC-hack demonstrates Russia's growing role as a dissident in a liberal and Western-dominated international society, as it -- from a Kremlin perspective -- responds to direct Western\nviolations of its own sovereignty. Viewed this way, secrecy is no longer functional because the Russian government wants the world to know that it has the means and wherewithal to hurt Western states and governments whenever it chooses to do so. Arguably, this is an effect of the Snowden revelations, as the United States government lost its ability to act hypocritically and get away with it.\nThus, from a Russian perspective, doxing operations merely turn the table on Western states, mimicking liberal values, such as free speech and open elections, by superficially complying with liberal norms while filling them with dissentient content. Accordingly, while Russia is closing its own information space to assert its digital sovereignty by quelling domestic dissent, it mouth-feeds dissent in Western liberal society to destabilize their information environment.\nTurning toward the international legal debate on disruptive cyber-espionage operations, UNGGE participants agreed in 2015, that “states should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity that intentionally damages critical infrastructure.” In terms of cyber-espionage, even the probing of foreign critical infrastructures appears to be prohibited under the UNGGE agreement because energy grids or similar entities are no plausible targets of espionage for national security reasons but always suggest a potential disruptive escalation in its aftermath.\nChinese role behavior during the second period also reflects a critical shift regarding sovereignty norms and alter expectations in particular by the US government. Between 2012 (the year, Xi took office) and 2015 (the year of the Obama-Xi-Agreement), cyber-espionage operations against US targets were attributed twenty-three times to Chinese state actors or their proxies. Among them were four operations against political targets, ten against commercial entities and four that targeted both receiver types (amongst others).\nUnder the Obama administration, US-responses to Chinese operations diverged sharply depending on the targets affected: While political espionage was deemed permissive by Washington economic espionage was not, with exceptions in cases of national security concerns. As the then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper stated in 2015 about the OPM-Hack: “you have to kind of salute the Chinese for what they did” and added, that the US ”would have done the same thing if they had the opportunity to do so.”\nIn contrast, the Obama administration grew ever more concerned about Chinese economic cyber-espionage in 2013. In February, the IT-Security Company Mandiant issued a detailed report about a specific Chinese cyber-attack unit in Shanghai (PLA Unit 61398), claiming that this group was responsible for several operations against the US and other Five Eyes member states since 2006. In June 2013, President Obama raised the issue of Chinese\ncyber-operations directly with President Xi, to be followed by official indictments against the PLA officers (May 2014) and an Executive Order (March 2015) which provided the legal groundwork for sanctioning Chinese companies in the run-up to the State visit of President Xi to the US in September 2015. At the summit both sides signed the so-called “U.S. China-Cyber-Agreement”, committing to:^{72} Provide timely responses to requests for information and assistance concerning malicious cyber-activities,refrain from conducting or knowingly supporting cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, pursue efforts to further identify and promote appropriate norms of state behavior in cyber-space within the international community, and establish a high-level joint dialogue mechanism on fighting cyber-crime and related issues.\nParticularly noteworthy is Point 2 of the agreement, a public bilateral commitment to cease permanently economically motivated cyber-espionage. Through this agreement between the most prevalent target of economic espionage and arguably the most notorious perpetrator they sent an important signal to third countries, explicitly distinguishing acceptable from not-acceptable state behavior. Significantly, the PRC government acknowledged for the first time the legitimacy of the prohibition of economic cyber-espionage when stating that “the Chinese government will not, in whatever form, engage in commercial theft or encourage or support such attempts by anyone.”^{73} Moreover, after the first meeting of the new US-Sino cyber-dialogue in December 2015 Xinhua News agency reported that the group had discussed alleged theft of data of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management by Chinese hackers, noting that „through investigation, the case turned out to be a criminal case rather than a state-sponsored cyber attack as the U.S side has previously suspected”, thereby acknowledging that an offensive cyber-operation had occurred from Chinese territory.^{74}\nWhile Chinese compliance with the accord rescinded in 2017, the two governments reaffirmed their commitment to “further solidifying, developing, and maintaining the Dialogue mechanism and continuing to strengthen bilateral cooperation in cybersecurity” in the framework of the third US-China joint dialogue on cyber-crime at the end of 2016.^{75}\nNotably, the US-China agreement also fertilized similar undertakings between China and other democratic countries: a similar agreement was reached between Great Britain and China, but Germany and China have been unable to settle their discord.^{76} However, in November 2015, the G20 followed suit, including Russia, in accepting the norm against conducting or supporting economically motivated cyber-espionage.^{77}\nIn sum, in this phase the Obama administrations propagated an approach to cyber-espionage norms, which rested on an intricate distinction between illegitimate vs. legitimate use of the affected information and not the target type per se. In doing so, the United States tried to legalize its own state practice as permissible and the actions of its adversaries as impermissible.\nThe Obama administration's approach also explicitly extended to more disruptive campaigns: the US put several (if not all) governments on notice, most notably non-nuclear weapon states under the Nonprolifeation Treaty, that it regards their sovereignty in the cyber-realm as permeable when it comes to the national security of the United States. The administration thus altercasted those countries into a hierarchy at the top of which the United States decides what kind of behavior is acceptable or not. When legitimizing unidentified US counter-operations against the malicious North Korean attacks on Sony Pictures in 2014, President Obama thus declared affirmatively: We cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the US”.^{78}\nIn the aftermath of the Snowden revelations, as other countries, such as China, started to make similar arguments, e.g. that China's economic espionage was for a national security purpose and not for economic gains.^{79} It follows that no stabilization of respective expectations between the United States and other great powers occurred, leaving norm evolution stalled during this period.\nThe failure of the UNGGE in 2017 to come up with a consensus report stems from these deep-seated disagreements. The strategic use of secrecy as a tool for prioritizing one's own domestic priorities could no longer conceal the incompatibility of the respective international role conceptions: whereas the United States did not regard other nations as sovereign in the traditional sense when it comes to US national security, Russia and China reciprocated with political and or economic espionage to advance their interpretation of information sovereignty, often by undermining the US' sovereignty as a democratic republic.\n## Cyber-espionage norms and forward action: the strategic neglect of secrecy (2017-2021)\nWith the incoming Trump administration, the US foreign and cyber-security role taking shifted markedly. Most notably, under President Trump the United States started to ascribe rival and/or enemy roles to former allies and foes alike by insisting on a transactionalist agenda, which prioritized one-time interactions over longer-term relationships. By altercasting China as a direct threat to US national security and hegemony, the Trump administration addressed the expanding territorial and economic sovereignty claims by the communist regime and identified them as violations of US-sovereignty. Focussing on bilateral vis-à-vis\nmultilateral negotiations, and favoring relative positioning vis-á-vis other great powers rather than a functional US leadership position in the international community, became the hallmarks of US foreign and security policy. The Trump administration's offensive cyber-strategy also featured some interesting, if illiberal, characteristics. With the so-called “Clean Network Initiative,” which was described by some observers as a “watershed” for the US internet policy, the administration moved closer to an authoritarian approach of protecting national information spaces and thus fragmenting global digital communication networks. In doing so, the United States also moved closer to resemble those democratic “swing-states” that cast their vote issue-dependent within the UN, thereby aligning with the “sovereigntist” vis-à-vis the “liberal sphere” in the internet governance debate.\nThe Trump administration changed tracks in domestic and external cyber-role taking behavior by more assertively applying the concept of “defending forward”: domestically, control and oversight functions in the executive branch and between the administration and Congress were reduced; externally, the United States proactively embedded US espionage malware in foreign infrastructure networks and started to publicly attribute nefarious attacks on US soil more systematically, thereby lifting the veil of secrecy in operational terms. This partial lifting of secrecy, however, may also be identified in the cyber-policies of democracies, e.g. in joint attribution statements in the aftermath of the Microsoft Exchange Hack 2021 or even the growing number of increasingly detailed National Cyber (Security) Strategies.\nThus, for the period of 2017-2021 the dataset and further case-investigations indicate nine US cyber-operations abroad which were directly or indirectly disclosed by US actors (2017-2019: six; 2020: two, 2021: one case). These pro-active signaling efforts were paralleled by a new offensive cyber-strategy, allegedly imposing higher costs on cyber-adversaries permanently to deter future actions. It comes as no surprise then that four of the nine US offensive operations were directed against Russian targets, four against Iran and one against North Korea. All but one of these US-operations allegedly had disruptive effects. When compared to the Obama administration, which had focused its response to the DNC-hack on domestic measures, the Trump administration employed external measures, such as the offensive cyber-operation to block the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll farm, from carrying out a cyber-enabled influence operation against the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. Notably, however, when targeting the Kremlin-associated troll factory instead of attacking Russia's military intelligence agency (GRU) directly, which was ultimately deemed responsible for most of state-based Russia's offensive cyber-operations, the Trump administration deliberately chose a target with less escalation potential. In a similar vein, when a US Global Hawk drone was shot down by Iranian forces in 2019, the\nTrump administration reportedly executed a cyber-response by using malware that had been implanted in Iranian networks before the attack on the U.S. drone.^{87}\nDisruptive US cyber-operations had started in 2013 as a reconnaissance campaign against the Russian electrical grid. However, these earlier operations were expanded in 2017 mounting to the “placement of potentially crippling malware inside the Russian system at a depth and with an aggressiveness that had never been tried before.”^{88} Moreover, through extensive public reporting, the Trump administration reiterated its capacity and willingness to exploit the infiltration of foreign networks for acts of sabotage, thereby reminding potential foes of similar earlier campaigns during peacetime, such as Stuxnet and Operation Nitro Zeus.^{89} Given these circumstances, an absolute ban on any form of cyber-operations against critical infrastructure, such as enshrined in the 2015 UNGGE report, appeared to be illusory.\nNotably, and in contrast to Russia, Chinese targets were absent from the US list for disruptive operations during this period, raising the question whether the communist regimes' cyber-operations did not require any proactive forward defense even though the administration escalated its offline conflicts with Beijing during the same period.\nInterestingly, the dataset also suggests that the intensified defending forward strategy was unsuccessful if not counterproductive: First, while the US expanded its offensive cyber-capacity, the Trump administration did neglect US defenses, thereby presenting Russian and Chinese operations ample reasons and a target-rich US domestic cyber-environment for escalating their offensive cyber-operations. Thus, in the period from 2017 to 2019, our dataset currently records thirteen operations with Chinese, ten operations with Russian, nine with Iranian and six with North Korean state involvement against US targets. Initial estimates for the years 2020 and 2021 do not indicate a decline in these operations. Rather, Chinese cyber-operations against (among others) U.S. targets appear to increase in intensity, as the Microsoft Exchange hack from 2021 suggests. As these numbers only reflect publicly known incidents at this time, they are bound to grow due to delayed detection and attribution processes. Arguably, with the Biden administration still assessing the damages from the SolarWinds, Microsoft Exchange and various other data compromise campaigns directed at US targets and attributed to Russian and Chinese operatives, the full extent of the blowback of the US forward cyber-defense strategy is still to be determined.^{90} And yet, given that the Biden administration has already declared its determination to respond to the SolarWinds operation, a new and more escalatory phase in disruptive operation may be in the making.\nIn diplomatic terms Russia also intensified its role taking as a dissident in the liberal international order: after the failed UNGGE consensus in 2017, the country proposed a resolution to the UN General Assembly (UNGA)\nthat advocated a separate and more inclusive negotiation forum, an Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG), to discuss the “possible measures that could be taken by the international community to strengthen information security at the global level.” In the end, the UNGA voted for the initiation of a new OEWG that established an alternative negotiation track to the sixth UNGGE, but on a similar, shared mandate, both starting in 2019. Andrey Krutskikh, the Special Representative of the President of the Russian Federation for International Cooperation on Information Security, explained Russia's opposition to the UNGGE process: “Russia has come in conflict with the position of certain countries that seek to impose on the whole world their own game rules in the information space, which would only serve their own interests.”\nFrom a role theoretical perspective, the statement ascribes the role of a technologically dominant and hypocritical hegemon to the US, trying to legitimize its own superiority and respective aggressive actions through international law. Amb. Krutskikh also reaffirmed Russia`s position, that the western-favored focus on “humanitarian aspects” in cyber-space is nothing more than an attempt to legitimize its own use of cyber-force.\nThe first OEWG concluded with its Final Draft report in March 2021. The report reaffirmed that international law, and in particular the Charter of the UN, is applicable in the cyber-domain. But the report lacks any concrete recommendations concerning its actual application. It merely states that future discussions on the topic will be necessary. Moreover, and resembling the failed UNGGE consensus in 2017, it does not contain references to international humanitarian law, human rights law, and customary law, as well as principles of the UN Charter.\nIn the annex of the Chair`s Summary of the OEWG Final Draft report in 2021, China reiterates its strong conceptual support of national sovereignty and information security, noting that “states should refrain from using ICTs to interfere in internal affairs of other states and undermine their political, economic and social stability.” Moreover, China declared that “states should not exploit their dominant position in ICTs, [...] to undermine other states' right to independent control of ICT goods and services as well as their security,” thereby rejecting the Trump administration`s role ascription as a systemic rival and claiming China's role as an enhancer of prosperity on an international level.\nIn sum, the third phase saw an open confrontation between democratic vs. autocratic dominated state camps at the UN-level, resulting in two parallel institutional tracks for norm evolution. While Russia more actively took over the role of a dissident, the Chinese government chose the more accommodative role as an opponent in the current order. Responding to the forward defense strategy of the US, both Russia and China did not alter their role behavior but rather escalated their cyber-espionage operations. The Trump administration's reaction, to increase public attribution through indictment\nprocedures did not change this trend, rather it has strengthened the Russian (and partially Chinese determination) to openly challenge the US government's hypocrisy and to attack its legitimacy as the hegemon of the current liberal international order.\n## Conclusion\nTo explain the absence of the emergence of cyber-espionage norms we have eschewed the notion that this stems from a lack of hegemonic stability or incompatible preferences of domestic groups in the most powerful states. Instead, our role theoretical argument has been guided by two conceptual premises: the co-constitution of domestic and international roles of governments vis-á-vis internal and external others, and the effects of secrecy on role taking and subsequent norm evolution. Our aim has been to better understand how government's use secrecy to obfuscate role conflicts resulting from internal and external expectations and their bearing on international norm evolution.\nThe sovereignty-role nexus applied here zoomed in the intricate two-level role conflicts emanating from two autocratic powers trying to bolster their domestic and foreign sovereignty in the face of an increasingly pro-active democratic power that seeks to protect its expansive national security concerns through proactive cyber-espionage measures. By acting clandestinely, both proponents of the “Web of the Free” as well as the “Web of Sovereigns” to hide information that does undermine their respective normative claims about their role in the international order: While comprehensive clandestine surveillance programs allow the US government to obfuscate the violation of privacy concerns, both in the US and abroad, through extensive proxy use autocratic governments try to obfuscate the violation of sovereign rights of other (mostly democratic) nations.\nWhen cyber-espionage operations became public over the past two decades, norm evolution started but dissipated soon: After the Snowden revelation, the Obama administration rejected to establish a binding norm, even among allies. In the German case, this resulted in the adaptation of domestic security law which legalized future US-German intelligence cooperation even when German citizen's data privacy is concerned. In the case of the US-China economic espionage agreement, China at first complied with the bilateral norm, but only so long as to avoid painful economic sanction against its tech giants. Since the onset of the US-trade war and open struggle for IT and AI dominance under the Trump administration, there appears to be less incentive on either side for self-restraint.\nMore generally speaking, recent role changes in cyber-espionage behavior by the US, China and Russia appear to result in norm nanism not only because secrecy prevents stable behavioral and discursive expectations over time. As\nthe case of Russian infowar and disinformation campaigns shows, liberal mimickry, using Western concepts superficially and filling them with dissentient content, has become a powerful tool to undermine the legitimacy on which democratic societies rest. However, Ukrainian information operations during the recent war with Russia indicate that even autocratic regimes are not immune against reputational losses, bolstered by the use of information communication technologies, addressing their own population. Furthermore, the leak of internal communication of the cyber crime outlet “Conti” by an alleged Ukrainian researcher is further evidence for the use of typical Russian disinformation tactics, now utilised by its usual victims against Russian-affiliated cyber actors themselves.\nConsistent with the role theoretical literature which asserts that roles bridge the gap between agents and structure, we have shown here that specific sovereignty claims by the US -- political sovereignty may be limited through legitimate cyber-espionage at all times -- and Russia as well as Chinese -- cyber-sovereignty must be asserted both externally and domestically -- have a direct (negative) bearing on norm evolution.\nCompared to more structural approaches toward norm evolution, our role theoretical perspective emphasizes the role of agency and the role conflicts emanating from a diverse set of expectations toward that agency. As such, our perspective should be also able to accommodate norm setting practices by other governmental or non-governmental institutions than the political leadership, e.g. intelligence services. When doing so, it would provide a more nuanced view why intelligence agencies may have some or no incentive to support the evolution of inter-state norms and may opt to establish loose forms of expected behavior -- in what has been called “normalization” -- between intelligence operatives of a few selected states.\nPace what has been portrayed as norm nanism may (only) be the stillbirth of liberal cyber-espionage norms. Liberal cyber-espionage norms rest on the assumption that responsive governments may use secrecy only in a few restricted cases because secrecy undermines public scrutiny and thus official responsibility. It follows that Russian dissidence and China's opposition in combination with the United States' growing appetite for political espionage may well lead to the effective stabilization of illiberal cyber-espionage norms. With the OEWG process on its way to supplant the less inclusive UNGGE group, a majority of governments in the OEWG group may find the Russian and Chinese concept of information sovereignty more appealing. Controlling information helps governments in fending off domestic claims of transparency and participation as well as international encroachments, e.g. by US security and intelligence agencies doxing incriminating informations, against their regime. However, current Russian efforts to implement a new cyber crime convention within the UN may be stalled, due to Russian violation of Ukraine`s sovereignty, as it is perceived by many countries worldwide. In theoretical terms, Russia's\naction in the offline-sphere could hinder its ambitions to fill the role of a widely accepted norm promoter of state sovereignty in cyber-space. At this stage, it remains to be seen what long-term impact Russia`s war against Ukraine will also have on cyber-espionage and its international regulation.\nIn this article, we have not set out to trace how and in what direction domestic roles change over time. In the United States, the new Biden administration has declared that it may strengthen the political leadership in cyber-espionage and interagency procedures as the country faces the fallout of several of the worst cyber-espionage operations in recent US history, but also heavily disruptive ransomware operations. The U.S. Cyber-Space Solarium Commission has also made substantial recommendations as to how the United States may restructure its domestic policy process in order to reduce cyber-vulnerabilities and effectuate rational cyber-governing behavior. We thus suspect that the domestic assertion of leadership vis-á-vis a Republican minority in Congress as well as US international leadership vis-á-vis Russia and China will have lasting, if unintended consequences, for the evolution of cyber-espionage norms. It seems that these norms need more transparency about present and past behavior and less hypocrisy about stated goals in order to grow.",

In this article, we contend that governments take on roles vis-à-vis both domestic and foreign audiences, often resulting in conflicts between crosscutting internal and external role expectations. To alleviate these role conflicts, governments use various secret instruments of statecraft that, in turn, shape international norm development. We theorize the nexus between domestic and foreign role play and secrecy, thereby extending the understanding of role taking in international relations to the cyber-space. We argue that whereas the role conceptions of autocratic powers China and Russia have been geared toward cyber-sovereignty of the regime vis-à-vis internal and external others, the United States, as a democratic power, has sought cyber-security for both state and non-state actors in the international realm. Trying to hide some of their cyber-operations, the interaction between China, Russia and the US has resulted in a distinct pattern of cyber-proxy use and state-based surveillance interaction that has facilitated the stabilization of illiberal cyber-espionage norms and the spread of diverging notions of information sovereignty.\n## KEYWORDS\ncyber-espionage; sovereignty; proxies; norms; secrecy\n## Introduction\nThe emergence of international norms in cyber-space are bound up with the ways in which states specify and act upon norms in gestation. The extent scholarship on cyber-norms has recognized the importance of Great Power rivalry, competing political systems, sub-state actors and uncertainty about new technologies as probable causes of norm emergence.¹ So far, however, little work has explored the nexus between the validity and facticity of an emerging norm on cyber-espionage.² And yet, linking discursive specification and (identifiable) practices to the robustness of a norm offers a distinct perspective on the social purchase of an emerging norm, thus providing a broad conception of the co-constitutive effects of agency actions and norms.³\nCONTACT Kerstin Zettl-Schabath  kerstin.zettl@ipw.uni-heidelberg.de  @kerstin_zettl  Institute of Political Science, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany\n© 2022 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC\nIn this article, we develop the concept of a discursive and practice-based norm evolution nexus through a role theoretical lens. In doing so, we examine the potential formation of a cyber-espionage norm by focusing on processes of verbal and practical norm contestation and concealment that may shape, stall and even reverse, the emergence of a norm. The cyber-espionage norm complex is unique since there is not even an uncontested overarching and explicit offline norm baring political or economic espionage. We also suggest that the norm dynamics identified in the field of espionage may spill over into other cyber-norm evolution cases as well, so that the non-emergence of cyber-espionage norms may tell us about norm evolution in the cyber-realm more broadly.\nConstructivist research has explored the social origin norm evolution for a long time, highlighting the co-constitutive nature as “collective expectations for the proper behavior of actors with a given identity”. Conceptually, constructivists do tie an actor's identity to the standards of a given group even if these standards are still in gestation. Since developing and enacting norms do involve discursive action, most notably speech acts and practices, norm contestation may be understood as a social process in which competing norms are expressed and acted upon, but also as social processes in which actors explicitly claim the validity of a norm while challenging the facticity of the norm through adverse action. In particular, actors may challenge whether and how the norm may apply in a given context (applicatory contestation), they may also question the exact meaning of the norm (meaning contestation), and they may challenge the righteousness of the norm (validity contestation), thereby signaling different levels of opposition or dissidence toward the international order constituted by that (and/or other) norm(s).\nThus far, the extent literature on cyber-espionage has focussed on the development of competing normative visions of cyber-security vs. information-security by Great Powers. But little attention has been payed to the question of how far the differences between explicit norm creation, through explicit speech acts, and implicit norm creation, through cyber-practices shapes the very form and direction of cyber-espionage norms. We address this gap by examining the discursive and practice interaction dynamics as revealed in the cyber-espionage norm evolution over the past two decades. To do so, we employ a role theoretical perspective on secrecy, noting that key differences in norm evolution processes result from crosscutting domestic and international expectation pressure to obfuscate the actor's own identity and behavior. We contend that secrecy implies a far greater significance for cyber-espionage in contrast to other forms of potentially impermissible operations in cyber-space: on the one hand, the effectiveness of a cyber-intrusion is (more) dependent upon staying undetected than in the offline world. On the other hand, keeping an intrusion secret may have reputational, financial, political or legal benefits for a victim, too. It follows then that secrecy constitutes a buffer\nfor both perpetrators and victims of cyber-espionage to address role conflicts in the domestic and international realm. In keeping offensive operations secret, both victims and offenders can manipulate their respective information environments, protecting information about their capacities and vulnerabilities as well as their intentions and respective reputation.\nRole theory is particular well suited to address concerns of secretive behavior in international politics. With deep roots in anthropology, social psychology and the philosophical school of American pragmatism, it suggests that roles are interbehavioural phenomena that emerge in social settings between individuals, groups and states, once social interactions result in dense and permanent expectations so that relatively stable patterns of a division of labor among role beholders emerge. In this reading, international roles are „functional positions emanating from ego and alter expectations directed toward a (common) purpose of a group“ as they pertain to states, so that substantial changes in state roles are directly tied to the norms of the international community. It follows that norm contestation, i.e. diverging expectations as to which behavior is appropriate, and role conflict, either interrole conflict -- which role should be pursued by an actor -- or intrarole conflict -- what does the role mean to the actor and significant other actors -- provide for constitutive mechanism as to how and why some norms may or may not develop and in which shape or form they do. Thus far, role theory has been used successfully to explain the emergence and fluctuation of sovereignty norms, but it has not been explored how secretive behavior, role conduct and norm emergence conceptually may fit together.\nIn this article, we argue that role theory advances our understanding of the cyber-espionage norm emergence process in several significant ways: First, role theory priviledges agency properties and actions over structures, i.e. norms, which is especially suitable to social situations in which uncertainty is high (as is the case for cyber-espionage), and institutionalization is low and norms are, if at all, in their infancy. In the cyber-realm, some progress has been made over the past decade to devise a catalog of norms and practices, e.g. the Tallinn Manuals. Here, however, we focus on actual state practice, which either underpins or undermines the verbal claims by governments to comply with extant norms, thereby strengthening the facticity (verbal recognition of norm) and validity (behavioral compliance with the norm). As Bruce Biddle and other role theoreticians have noted: “norms are said to provide merely a set of broad imperatives within which the details of roles can be worked out. Actual roles, then, are thought to reflect norms, attitudes, contextual demands, negotiation, and the evolving definition of the situation as understood by the actors.” Secondly, we contend that great powers which deem themselves as tied in asymmetrical hierarchical power relationships and in situations of high uncertainty, prefer using a combination of “frontstage” public signals to establish themselves as respectable leading members of international society\nwhile also utilizing “backstage” signals, i.e. making use of ‘proxy actors' and or clandestine intelligence operations, to reap the domestic benefits of cyber-espionage while avoiding the reputation costs of questionable operations. Thirdly, role theory does not purport a single and/or fixed national identity or strategic culture to direct cyber-behavior such as other theoretical approaches do. Rather, role theory allows for vertical contestation, i.e. through societal actors and groups, and horizontal contestation, e.g. in government-opposition relations, intra-governing coalition and between governmental bureaucracies. Crosscutting role expectations towards a government on how to behave domestically and/or internationally may then result in “split behavior”: on the frontstage, behavior is directed to preserve a country`s international reputation as a respected member of the international community, most notably, safeguarding its sovereignty and autonomy vis-á-vis more powerful or more determined other states, institutions and non-state actors. However, on the backstage, governments may want to utilize covert actions by proxies or intelligence operatives, to mask international behavior that is deemed inappropriate on the frontstage but which is necessary to meet domestic or intra-governing coalition expectations, i.e. to advance, political, commercial or development interests or to display the superiority of one's own political system. In short, secrecy allows governments to speak with a “split voice” and address the expectations of two, often times diverging, audiences at the same time.\nOur role theoretical treatment of the norm evolution follows established practices in role theoretical research, using both speech acts and physical (non-) acts as representations of discursive and practical role behavior. Specifically, we do not purport that speech acts reflect genuine intentions nor do we claim that our quantitative data set has identified all the cases of (illicit) soft- or hardware infringements. Rather, we would like to stress from our symbolic interactionist (and constitutive) perspective, that the meaning of an action, speech act or otherwise, is revealed or concealed by the reaction or non-reaction of others that imbues or deprives to imbue meaning into an action. In more concrete terms, if a role is taken on, it depends on the taking up of a commensurate role by other actors whether the social group and its purpose of which the original role taking process is a part of, is stabilized. If commensurate roles are not taken up, though, or if respective role taking behavior is concealed, then no stabilization of respective role expectations can occur.\nIn the remainder of the article, we proceed as follows: First, we conceptualize the role theoretical nexus between secrecy and norm emergence. (Secret) role taking behavior may vary along two axes: domestic vs. international role expectations and the political vs. economic role taking. Respective discourses and practices, of course, may and do change over time. The second section presents the role behavior by Russia, China and\nthe United States in three distinct phases, highlighting shifts in rhetorical and practical front- and backstage action (1998-2013, 2014-2016, 2017-2021). To analyze their cyber-espionage conduct, a new cyber-conflict-dataset (HD-CY.CON) is used, indicating distinctive patterns in which governments used different types of secrecy to meet expectations. We conclude with a summary of our findings, demonstrating how secrecy concerns shape role taking behavior which in turn facilitate or hamper cyber-espionage norm formation.\n## The Secrecy-Role-Norm Nexus\nGrounded in symbolic interactionism international roles are constituted through Ego, i.e. domestically generated, and Alter, i.e. international, expectations toward the appropriate behavior of an actor in a group (of states). Sovereignty norms, as foundational rules of the international society, proscribe sovereignty roles to state actors which in turn require recognition of these actors, e.g. states, as “sovereign”. Through recognition as sovereign, sovereign powers are ascribed which may or may not be exerted, e.g. treaty making, joining international institutions etc. It follows that governments strive for recognition as legitimate sovereigns in the international realm as well as domestic realm, providing for various political, i.e. participation, security etc. and economic, i.e. wellbeing, goods to the international and national society.\nWhen doing so, cyber-operations may trigger a focus on one of the resulting role expectation types: First, if a government is challenged by an external actor that threatens its domestic sovereignty, e.g. through a misinformation campaign, the respective government may want to strengthen its domestic sovereignty by reasserting its control over information distribution. However, by restricting information distribution, a government, particularly democratic governments, may disregard societal expectations for freedom of speech, resulting in an adversarial two-level expectation game situation. Second, if the dominant (liberal) sovereignty norms collide with domestic expectations toward the international role of a country, the government has several options: to accept the international order (and respective external role expectations) and to adapt domestic expectations accordingly. Or the government accepts the international order but may want to change the country's role in it, e.g. by joining a new status group. Alternatively, the country may want to change the international order altogether, seeking a new role in a new order, thereby changing the social purpose and or hierarchy in the respective international society. In the latter case, countries (and their governments) become “revisionist powers,” seeking to change the international order and their country's role in it, thereby meeting domestic expectations about the country's purpose and role in the international order.\nThe case of cyber-espionage norms with different sub-specifications offers particular benefits for developing the Secrecy-Role-Norm nexus. Here, we are focussing on the question whether the discursive and practical enactment of sovereignty roles on the two axes include the right to “the non-consensual collection of confidential information that is under the control of another actor”, i.e. espionage. Specifically, we highlight the potential role conflicts resulting from three distinct contexts: First, even in the offline world, espionage norms, particularly their scope, communality and obligation, in war- and peace-time have been contested so that analogical reasoning between the existing international law and the emergence of respective cyber-norms is complicated. Second, in cyber-space undetected intrusion is a necessary condition for any kind of non-consensual access to a network. This is also true in cases of cyber-espionage that are supplemented by more disruptive actions, i.e. so-called “hack-and-leak” operations (or “doxing”), because these operations require secrecy before the disruptive effects become known to the victim and the public, in order to achieve their intended purpose(s). This severely complicates the question whether an intrusion serves intelligence gathering only or more nefarious purposes and whether it constitutes a violation of sovereignty. Third, while sovereignty norms are imbued with notions of equality, autonomous choice and the physical integrity among states, depending on the state's relative material and immaterial position vis-á-vis the majority of the international society, a state's government may feel entitled to exert its freedom of action to the detriment of other states (lesser or stronger powers, threatening or non-threatening states). This establishes a legal ambivalence: the government may accept the ascribed power to act autonomously by others as an equal right for all, but it may also use that same right to infringe upon the sovereign right of others. This is particularly true for cyber-espionage operations where the legal delineations between permissible and impermissible actions vary not only over time, but also depending on the targets and data involved and their subsequent instrumentalization.\nDrawing on recent advances in the study of secrecy, we argue that role conflicts emanating from crosscutting domestic and international expectations toward cyber-security vs. cyber-sovereignty have become so prevalent that they have a direct bearing on the emergence or non-emergence of cyber-espionage norms. In particular, we contend that as long as words and deeds lack publicity in the respective audiences, actors can avoid being held accountable for each of them or inconsistencies between them, thereby being able to act without incurring domestic or international reputational losses, i.e. impunity. It follows that governments may forego stabilizing their behavioral patterns, i.e. roles, by not tying their identifiably role behavior to explicit standards of approriate behavior, i.e. norms. In these cases, covert cyber-operations may be visible to the adversary's government but that this government may withhold information about the operation or its impact too, depending on the domestic and international reputational costs incured when not responding. In order to alleviate the reputational\ncosts domestically and internationally as well as the probability of a punishing counter role taking, i.e. a public or covert counter attack, the attacking government also often uses a proxy, non-state actors used by state actors for covert purposes. It follows that a government of a country under attack may blame a proxy, rather than a responsible government, in order to avoid domestic and/or international reputational costs when not standing up to the attacking government. The attribution through a proxy also allows for more moderate forms of political responses, such as indictments against individual hackers (whose arrest in most cases is more than unlikely), or sanctions against technological front-companies, serving as proxies. These types of actions do not constitute counter-measures under international law, which presuppose the official attribution of respective state agencies and which are regularly more escalatory in nature.\nAs a consequence, we contend that cyber-rivals may tacitly cooperate to steer conflicts to a “backstage”, i.e. conduct cyber-operations clandestinely, to leave an external impression to third parties that their cyber-conflict remains limited and even regulated by tacit if not obligatory rules. From a legal perspective, this “backstage” approach is not necessary as most cyber-norms are still in their infancy. Nevertheless, governments appear to still prefer the “backstage” so as to limit political, reputational and economic costs. Under these circumstances, clandestine role behavior resulting from intra-role conflicts does not lead to further, particularly multilateral norm evolution. Rather, as the adversarial interaction between two partners remains (partially) undetected among them and invisible to third parties, offensive cyber-behavior becomes regularized in a given dyad without becoming to be expected by the larger international society because it is not yet tied to intersubjective roles.\nIn , we illustrate this nexus between a states' verbal role taking and its role behavior by introducing the predominant democratic role conception, the guardian of the “Web of the Free.” We contrast it with the predominant autocratic role conception, the guardian of the “Web of Sovereigns.” In cases of conflicting domestic and international role expectations, we argue, that governments have a (strong) incentive to use different forms of secrecy. In doing so, they can avoid that intra- or inter-role conflicts turn into conflict escalation dynamics on the international level and de-legitimization dynamics on the domestic level.\nMore specifically, if information about a cyber-espionage-operation is revealed which calls a government's public stand into question, the government may react in (at least) two ways: First, it may deny any wrongdoing, rejecting any responsibility or forwarding it to cyber-proxies; second, it may acknowledge espionage operations and shift the narrative post-hoc toward claiming secret operations as legitimate (and less aggressive) expressions of its own role conception. Thus, shielding information from one's own public may be answered by similar behavior of the opponent, as both actor's “share” an interest in controlling conflict escalation dynamics emanating from domestic role expectations.\nDEMOCRACY AND SECURITY\n#\nGraph 1. Categorizing states' role behavior (words vs. deeds) in cyber-space. Annotations: Source: Own figure.\n\"WoF\"  $\\rightarrow$  \"Web of the Free\"\n\"WoS\"  $\\rightarrow$  \"Web of Sovereigns\"\n$\\neq \\rightarrow$  Incompatibility between words &amp; deeds, secrecy needed\n$= \\rightarrow$  Compatibility between words &amp; deeds, no secrecy needed\nConsistent with the assumption that the current liberal international cyber-order creates disadvantageous hierarchies and potential of intra-role conflicts for autocratic powers, we examine Russian and Chinese efforts for ideational and material counterbalancing to advance their ontological security as autocratic powers by protecting their status in the international society. In empirical terms, we contend that Russia and China act as what has been called \"frustrated sovereigns\" in cyber-space, i.e. agents that strive for (ever) more recognition of what they themselves claim as a legitimate (autocratic) cyber-sovereignty in a liberal-dominated international cyber-order.\nAs Bettiza and Lewis (2020) have found, these practices regularly include \"liberal performance\", i.e. adopting and reproducing liberal norms in shape and form while turning them against liberal regimes themselves, such as human rights or cyber-incidents or disinformation reports, \"liberal mimicry\", i.e. adopting liberal practices while filling them with dissentient content, such as \"Responsibility-to-Protect\" to legitimize Russian-identity based interventions in the Post-Soviet space; \"civilizational essentialization\", i.e. a practice by which Western norms are presented as an \"other\" vis-à-vis a primordial civilization, and \"counter-norm entrepreneurship,\" a practice to positively promote illiberal norms, ideas and institutions, such as \"cyber\nsovereignty” (see below) and “illiberal good governance”, i.e. controls on internet access, for which even inter-autocratic learning processes seem to emerge.\nIn sum, while sharing some common normative concepts and practices, we contend that Russian and Chinese cyber-espionage discourses and practices display distinct patterns of adversarial role taking or making patterns that have led them to pursue diverging forms of regularized espionage interaction vis-à-vis each other as well as toward the United States. The different types of secrecy matter because the resulting interaction patterns with the United States shape the evolution of either dyadic or multilateral expectation patterns, i.e. dyadic or international cyber-espionage roles.\n## Cyber-espionage norm emergence: secrecy & initial consensus (1998-2013)\nAt the end of the 20^{th} century, cyber-espionage campaigns, such as the alleged Russian Operation Moonlight Maze, indicated that the traditional cold war espionage tactics would be increasingly “going cyber.” To shape the new conflict domain, the Russian Federation launched a proposal for an international treaty for information security in 1998, complemented by a cooperation agreement of the member states of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The initiative indicated Russia's aspiration as a norm entrepreneur of a lex specialis for the cyber-space even before the US and its allies advocated the application of existing international law to cyber-space. From a role theoretical perspective, the Russian government thus took on a new role, making a role in a new setting geared toward a “Web of Sovereigns” rather than taking a role in the existing “Web of the Free.” This new role was tied to the concept of “information security,” which represents efforts by (autoractic) governments to control and censor the flow of information within national intranets, often legitimized by national security concerns. In contrast, democratic governments tend to promote the concept of “cyber security,” which focuses on the effective regulation of malicious cyber-operations rather than restrictions on the access and distribution of information. It follows that these diverging concepts and the respective roles taken to promote them hamper the emergence of common norms in the international community.\nFounded in 2004, the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security (UNGGE) acknowledged the need for an international negotiation forum, in order to sound the pathway of cyber-norm development. The final consensus reports in 2010 and 2013 emphasized the need for a common understanding of acceptable behavior in cyber-space (2010) and the need to strengthen the general applicability of international law in the cyber-realm (2013). Even though Russia and China finally agreed to these\nreports, they also consistently promoted the concepts of “information security” and “cyber-sovereignty”. Both of these concepts stress that the content of the information and the technological handling through soft and hardware need to be protected, thereby ascribing the government the role as a sovereign guardian of a “national information space” which must be protected from nefarious foreign and domestic influences.\nSpecifically, this role conception entails and legitimizes various forms of foreign espionage and domestic surveillance including data collection, storage and analysis to bolster autocratic regime authority. Specific targets are human rights activists, dissidents or ethnic minorities in and outside the national jurisdiction. Whereas domestic surveillances system, such as China's social credit system, are not kept secret to attract or deter commensurate role taking by citizens, foreign surveillance pratices are mostly kept secret to comply with international privacy standards, except for cases of “tainted leaks” when illegally obtained information is leaked to discredit either the source of content of that information, thereby spreading mistrust or disinformation about opponents of an autocratic regime.\nRussia and China also cooperated bilaterally and multilaterally through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and other interstate fora, such as the International Telecommunication Union“ (ITU), to promote the “Web of Sovereigns” as a viable alternative to the US-led multistake-holder based “Web of the Free”.\nApart from this frontstage role behavior as would-be autocratic normmakers, Russia and China started to move to the backstage. Our cyber-conflict data shows for the period from the year 2000 on that Russia's operational pattern focused on political espionage in its regional neighborhood (five out of eleven cases) and vis-á-vis the US (five out of eleven from 2000 to 2013). Secrecy enabled the Russian government to meet nationalist domestic expectations -- putting Russia on par with other Great Powers by conducting political espionage -- while mitigating escalation risks with the highly capable US -- by using proxies for most of its espionage operations (eight out of eleven cyber-espionage cases). Pundits on Russian foreign policy agree that despite disagreements over specific foreign policy goals, Russia's foreign policy elites all advocate “that Russia is, and should remain, a power with global interest and global reach.” Notably, Russian secrecy patterns shifted over time: In early cyber-espionage operations the obfuscation of the perpetrator's identity mixed with clandestine actions, resulting in the absence of signaling intentions by Russia. In later operations, clandestine operations decreased and more open, provocative proxy action with lower deniability increased. We suggest that the motivation for obtaining plausible deniability resulted from the shift in the ambivalent relationship between Russia and the United States at the time: Russian-US relations oscillated clearly between verbal confrontation\n(Putin in 2007 at the Munich Security Conference), de facto cooperation (overflight rights for U.S. forces in the Afghanistan war), and rhetorical truce during the so-called reset phase between 2009 and 2013.\nIn contrast, in this early phase Chinese operational patterns focused on promoting economic growth by the theft of intellectual property through conventional offline and cyber-espionage. The dataset currently records 59 cases of Chinese cyber-espionage with alleged state-involvement between 2003 and 2013. Among the targets attacked, the US stands out with 39 operations. China's operational pattern resembles that of an autocratic developing country: the government allegedly used cyber-proxies in 37 espionage-operations, mostly against technologically superior democracies, such as the US, to leap-frog toward technological superiority while addressing domestic role expectation to further the wellbeing of the Chinese people. In political terms, the Chinese regime shadowed both Russia's bilateral and regional pro-autocratic normentrepeneurship-efforts in the SCO and in- and outside the UNGGE process.\nThe US government started in 2009 to respond to this latter pattern. It communicated a legal position that while cyber-espionage in general was tolerable state behavior if carried out to protect national security was deemed non-permissible if economically motivated, i.e. if the stolen data was handed to corporations to give them a head start over their US competitors. Pace, secrecy about US cyber-espionage and surveillance gained enormous conflict potential in the summer of 2013 when the revelations by Edward Snowden took place. The revelations attested to a massive, global US surveillance network that targeted governments and citizens of allies, rivals and enemies to address US national security concerns broadly defined in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks.\nThe Snowden revelations forced the Obama administration to reconcile its public rhetoric about the “Web of the Free” and the protection of civil liberties with the US' vast secret surveillance programs. It did so by arguing that national security concerns, including those by allied governments and citizens, required the US government to act secretly, thereby evoking conflicting domestic role expectations in democratic societies concerning crosscutting security and liberty concerns.\nInterestingly, instead of addressing the Snowden revelations diplomatically and calling for a multilateral (legal) solution, the Russian government chose to scold the US government of hypocrisy and double standards publicly, thereby mimicring Western concerns about data privacy on the “frontstage” and simultaneously avoiding restrictions on its own “backstage” espionage behavior. In contrast, China's official reaction was circumspect, merely asking the Obama administration to address international concerns squarely. Inofficially, however, the extent and depth of the NSA programs shocked the Chinese government, setting in motion\nan immediate change in (secret) commercial and governmental activities:^{56} Commercially, US IT corporations suffered significant market losses from respective security concerns in China, leading up to a full-blown Chinese-government effort to reduce dependency on US-technology and corporations. Politically, the Chinese government substantially revamped its cyber-security capacities and institutions, establishing both advanced defensive and offensive capacities as well as a host of new governing bodies, institutions and regulations, which as President Xi promised, would make China a “Cyber Superpower.”^{57}\nIn sum, the early phase of cyber-espionage norm development was shaped by verbal confrontations between the two main camps within the UNGGE process with a fragile and partial consensus emerging regarding the applicability of international law in cyber-space. All three states conducted substantial cyber-espionage for either political (US & Russia) or economic (China) reasons. Each government used secrecy extensively to reconcile crosscutting internal and external role expectations. When concealed operations were revealed, government's reactions varied considerably because of domestic and foreign expectations: Addressing domestic and allied concerns for democratic transparency and rule of law, the Obama administration sought to legitimize the secret NSA surveillance programs by pointing at the tradeoff between (substantial) national security gains and (limited) privacy losses. In contrast, autocratic governments in Russia and China stuck to their plausible deniability claims about (non-)use of proxies, thereby addressing domestic expectations about regime security and economic wellbeing while evading international concerns.\nMore specifically, during this period, the US government did not recognize respective espionage-operations as directly threatening to US domestic order: with Russia being altercasted as a regional power in decline, its cyber-espionage activities did not attract much American attention, the “agent.btz” malware use in 2008 being one of the few exceptions.^{58} A similar pattern of US reactions can be detected with regard to Chinese commercial espionage, the Operations Titan Rain and Operation Aurora being the exceptions to the rule.^{59} However, both the Russian and Chinese government reacted strongly to the revelations of the NSA surveillance activities in 2013, substantially revamping their respective cyber-capacities and postures which resulted in a much more asymmetrical and aggressive approach toward the United States.\n## Cyber-espionage norms in turmoil: secrecy & missing normative validity (2014-2016)\nThe second phase of cyber-espionage norm evolution from 2014 to 2016 was crucial. In this period, Russian and Chinese discursive role taking and cyber-espionage operations severely circumscribed US domestic and\ninternational role taking. To begin with, Russia, together with Chinese and Cuban delegations, challenged the notion by the United States and other Western states that International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and the right to self-defense (Art. 51) is applicable in cyber-space, holding on to a strict textual reading in the UNGGE process. In turn, both countries -- together with other SCO member states -- submitted a draft document to the UN Secretary General to facilitate an international consensus on international norms and rules guiding the behavior of states in the information space. The Russian government has presented Russia as a “responsible cyber-power” which has an obligation to mitigate US destructive actions and protect traditional norms, such as sovereignty and institutions, such as the UN Security Council, against the Western notion of a “rules-based international order.” The latter being based on informal institutions, including “private or multistakeholder actors,” and “inclusive and consensus-based deliberation” processes which are detrimental to the interests of most autocracies and illiberal democracies. In the offline domain, Russia also challenged the EU -- through its open intervention in Ukraine -- the United States, Turkey and NATO -- through its interventions in Syria and Libya, thereby rebuffing the Obama administration's ascription as a “regional power.”\nFor the period 2014 to 2016, the dataset lists 30 cyber-espionage operations with attributed Russian state involvement. Notably, seven of them were publicity-seeking information warfare operations, i.e. doxing. Nearly all of these doxing-cases affected western democracies or international institutions, such as WADA, that -- in one way or the other -- had contested Russia's sovereignty conception.\nThe most important Russian information warfare operation was the so-called DNC-Hack, attributed to the APT Fancy Bear, which in turn was directly tied to the military intelligence agency GRU. There is substantial evidence that the DNC-Hack and later disinformation campaigns have been “liberal mimickry operations” by the Russian government, adopting the form of a liberal discourse -- transparency about the nefarious actions of the DNC leadership against Bernie Sanders -- while combining it with non-liberal content, such as data tampering, time sensitive publication or outright disinformation and fake news. As President Putin has argued repeatedly, the Russian government regards publications by Western non-governmental organizations, such as the Soros Foundation or the publication of the so-called Panama Papers, i.e. incriminating reports about corruption in the Russian elite, as US-led information campaigns to topple the Russian government.\nIn our role theoretical perspective, the DNC-hack demonstrates Russia's growing role as a dissident in a liberal and Western-dominated international society, as it -- from a Kremlin perspective -- responds to direct Western\nviolations of its own sovereignty. Viewed this way, secrecy is no longer functional because the Russian government wants the world to know that it has the means and wherewithal to hurt Western states and governments whenever it chooses to do so. Arguably, this is an effect of the Snowden revelations, as the United States government lost its ability to act hypocritically and get away with it.\nThus, from a Russian perspective, doxing operations merely turn the table on Western states, mimicking liberal values, such as free speech and open elections, by superficially complying with liberal norms while filling them with dissentient content. Accordingly, while Russia is closing its own information space to assert its digital sovereignty by quelling domestic dissent, it mouth-feeds dissent in Western liberal society to destabilize their information environment.\nTurning toward the international legal debate on disruptive cyber-espionage operations, UNGGE participants agreed in 2015, that “states should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity that intentionally damages critical infrastructure.” In terms of cyber-espionage, even the probing of foreign critical infrastructures appears to be prohibited under the UNGGE agreement because energy grids or similar entities are no plausible targets of espionage for national security reasons but always suggest a potential disruptive escalation in its aftermath.\nChinese role behavior during the second period also reflects a critical shift regarding sovereignty norms and alter expectations in particular by the US government. Between 2012 (the year, Xi took office) and 2015 (the year of the Obama-Xi-Agreement), cyber-espionage operations against US targets were attributed twenty-three times to Chinese state actors or their proxies. Among them were four operations against political targets, ten against commercial entities and four that targeted both receiver types (amongst others).\nUnder the Obama administration, US-responses to Chinese operations diverged sharply depending on the targets affected: While political espionage was deemed permissive by Washington economic espionage was not, with exceptions in cases of national security concerns. As the then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper stated in 2015 about the OPM-Hack: “you have to kind of salute the Chinese for what they did” and added, that the US ”would have done the same thing if they had the opportunity to do so.”\nIn contrast, the Obama administration grew ever more concerned about Chinese economic cyber-espionage in 2013. In February, the IT-Security Company Mandiant issued a detailed report about a specific Chinese cyber-attack unit in Shanghai (PLA Unit 61398), claiming that this group was responsible for several operations against the US and other Five Eyes member states since 2006. In June 2013, President Obama raised the issue of Chinese\ncyber-operations directly with President Xi, to be followed by official indictments against the PLA officers (May 2014) and an Executive Order (March 2015) which provided the legal groundwork for sanctioning Chinese companies in the run-up to the State visit of President Xi to the US in September 2015. At the summit both sides signed the so-called “U.S. China-Cyber-Agreement”, committing to:^{72} Provide timely responses to requests for information and assistance concerning malicious cyber-activities,refrain from conducting or knowingly supporting cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, pursue efforts to further identify and promote appropriate norms of state behavior in cyber-space within the international community, and establish a high-level joint dialogue mechanism on fighting cyber-crime and related issues.\nParticularly noteworthy is Point 2 of the agreement, a public bilateral commitment to cease permanently economically motivated cyber-espionage. Through this agreement between the most prevalent target of economic espionage and arguably the most notorious perpetrator they sent an important signal to third countries, explicitly distinguishing acceptable from not-acceptable state behavior. Significantly, the PRC government acknowledged for the first time the legitimacy of the prohibition of economic cyber-espionage when stating that “the Chinese government will not, in whatever form, engage in commercial theft or encourage or support such attempts by anyone.”^{73} Moreover, after the first meeting of the new US-Sino cyber-dialogue in December 2015 Xinhua News agency reported that the group had discussed alleged theft of data of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management by Chinese hackers, noting that „through investigation, the case turned out to be a criminal case rather than a state-sponsored cyber attack as the U.S side has previously suspected”, thereby acknowledging that an offensive cyber-operation had occurred from Chinese territory.^{74}\nWhile Chinese compliance with the accord rescinded in 2017, the two governments reaffirmed their commitment to “further solidifying, developing, and maintaining the Dialogue mechanism and continuing to strengthen bilateral cooperation in cybersecurity” in the framework of the third US-China joint dialogue on cyber-crime at the end of 2016.^{75}\nNotably, the US-China agreement also fertilized similar undertakings between China and other democratic countries: a similar agreement was reached between Great Britain and China, but Germany and China have been unable to settle their discord.^{76} However, in November 2015, the G20 followed suit, including Russia, in accepting the norm against conducting or supporting economically motivated cyber-espionage.^{77}\nIn sum, in this phase the Obama administrations propagated an approach to cyber-espionage norms, which rested on an intricate distinction between illegitimate vs. legitimate use of the affected information and not the target type per se. In doing so, the United States tried to legalize its own state practice as permissible and the actions of its adversaries as impermissible.\nThe Obama administration's approach also explicitly extended to more disruptive campaigns: the US put several (if not all) governments on notice, most notably non-nuclear weapon states under the Nonprolifeation Treaty, that it regards their sovereignty in the cyber-realm as permeable when it comes to the national security of the United States. The administration thus altercasted those countries into a hierarchy at the top of which the United States decides what kind of behavior is acceptable or not. When legitimizing unidentified US counter-operations against the malicious North Korean attacks on Sony Pictures in 2014, President Obama thus declared affirmatively: We cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the US”.^{78}\nIn the aftermath of the Snowden revelations, as other countries, such as China, started to make similar arguments, e.g. that China's economic espionage was for a national security purpose and not for economic gains.^{79} It follows that no stabilization of respective expectations between the United States and other great powers occurred, leaving norm evolution stalled during this period.\nThe failure of the UNGGE in 2017 to come up with a consensus report stems from these deep-seated disagreements. The strategic use of secrecy as a tool for prioritizing one's own domestic priorities could no longer conceal the incompatibility of the respective international role conceptions: whereas the United States did not regard other nations as sovereign in the traditional sense when it comes to US national security, Russia and China reciprocated with political and or economic espionage to advance their interpretation of information sovereignty, often by undermining the US' sovereignty as a democratic republic.\n## Cyber-espionage norms and forward action: the strategic neglect of secrecy (2017-2021)\nWith the incoming Trump administration, the US foreign and cyber-security role taking shifted markedly. Most notably, under President Trump the United States started to ascribe rival and/or enemy roles to former allies and foes alike by insisting on a transactionalist agenda, which prioritized one-time interactions over longer-term relationships. By altercasting China as a direct threat to US national security and hegemony, the Trump administration addressed the expanding territorial and economic sovereignty claims by the communist regime and identified them as violations of US-sovereignty. Focussing on bilateral vis-à-vis\nmultilateral negotiations, and favoring relative positioning vis-á-vis other great powers rather than a functional US leadership position in the international community, became the hallmarks of US foreign and security policy. The Trump administration's offensive cyber-strategy also featured some interesting, if illiberal, characteristics. With the so-called “Clean Network Initiative,” which was described by some observers as a “watershed” for the US internet policy, the administration moved closer to an authoritarian approach of protecting national information spaces and thus fragmenting global digital communication networks. In doing so, the United States also moved closer to resemble those democratic “swing-states” that cast their vote issue-dependent within the UN, thereby aligning with the “sovereigntist” vis-à-vis the “liberal sphere” in the internet governance debate.\nThe Trump administration changed tracks in domestic and external cyber-role taking behavior by more assertively applying the concept of “defending forward”: domestically, control and oversight functions in the executive branch and between the administration and Congress were reduced; externally, the United States proactively embedded US espionage malware in foreign infrastructure networks and started to publicly attribute nefarious attacks on US soil more systematically, thereby lifting the veil of secrecy in operational terms. This partial lifting of secrecy, however, may also be identified in the cyber-policies of democracies, e.g. in joint attribution statements in the aftermath of the Microsoft Exchange Hack 2021 or even the growing number of increasingly detailed National Cyber (Security) Strategies.\nThus, for the period of 2017-2021 the dataset and further case-investigations indicate nine US cyber-operations abroad which were directly or indirectly disclosed by US actors (2017-2019: six; 2020: two, 2021: one case). These pro-active signaling efforts were paralleled by a new offensive cyber-strategy, allegedly imposing higher costs on cyber-adversaries permanently to deter future actions. It comes as no surprise then that four of the nine US offensive operations were directed against Russian targets, four against Iran and one against North Korea. All but one of these US-operations allegedly had disruptive effects. When compared to the Obama administration, which had focused its response to the DNC-hack on domestic measures, the Trump administration employed external measures, such as the offensive cyber-operation to block the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll farm, from carrying out a cyber-enabled influence operation against the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. Notably, however, when targeting the Kremlin-associated troll factory instead of attacking Russia's military intelligence agency (GRU) directly, which was ultimately deemed responsible for most of state-based Russia's offensive cyber-operations, the Trump administration deliberately chose a target with less escalation potential. In a similar vein, when a US Global Hawk drone was shot down by Iranian forces in 2019, the\nTrump administration reportedly executed a cyber-response by using malware that had been implanted in Iranian networks before the attack on the U.S. drone.^{87}\nDisruptive US cyber-operations had started in 2013 as a reconnaissance campaign against the Russian electrical grid. However, these earlier operations were expanded in 2017 mounting to the “placement of potentially crippling malware inside the Russian system at a depth and with an aggressiveness that had never been tried before.”^{88} Moreover, through extensive public reporting, the Trump administration reiterated its capacity and willingness to exploit the infiltration of foreign networks for acts of sabotage, thereby reminding potential foes of similar earlier campaigns during peacetime, such as Stuxnet and Operation Nitro Zeus.^{89} Given these circumstances, an absolute ban on any form of cyber-operations against critical infrastructure, such as enshrined in the 2015 UNGGE report, appeared to be illusory.\nNotably, and in contrast to Russia, Chinese targets were absent from the US list for disruptive operations during this period, raising the question whether the communist regimes' cyber-operations did not require any proactive forward defense even though the administration escalated its offline conflicts with Beijing during the same period.\nInterestingly, the dataset also suggests that the intensified defending forward strategy was unsuccessful if not counterproductive: First, while the US expanded its offensive cyber-capacity, the Trump administration did neglect US defenses, thereby presenting Russian and Chinese operations ample reasons and a target-rich US domestic cyber-environment for escalating their offensive cyber-operations. Thus, in the period from 2017 to 2019, our dataset currently records thirteen operations with Chinese, ten operations with Russian, nine with Iranian and six with North Korean state involvement against US targets. Initial estimates for the years 2020 and 2021 do not indicate a decline in these operations. Rather, Chinese cyber-operations against (among others) U.S. targets appear to increase in intensity, as the Microsoft Exchange hack from 2021 suggests. As these numbers only reflect publicly known incidents at this time, they are bound to grow due to delayed detection and attribution processes. Arguably, with the Biden administration still assessing the damages from the SolarWinds, Microsoft Exchange and various other data compromise campaigns directed at US targets and attributed to Russian and Chinese operatives, the full extent of the blowback of the US forward cyber-defense strategy is still to be determined.^{90} And yet, given that the Biden administration has already declared its determination to respond to the SolarWinds operation, a new and more escalatory phase in disruptive operation may be in the making.\nIn diplomatic terms Russia also intensified its role taking as a dissident in the liberal international order: after the failed UNGGE consensus in 2017, the country proposed a resolution to the UN General Assembly (UNGA)\nthat advocated a separate and more inclusive negotiation forum, an Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG), to discuss the “possible measures that could be taken by the international community to strengthen information security at the global level.” In the end, the UNGA voted for the initiation of a new OEWG that established an alternative negotiation track to the sixth UNGGE, but on a similar, shared mandate, both starting in 2019. Andrey Krutskikh, the Special Representative of the President of the Russian Federation for International Cooperation on Information Security, explained Russia's opposition to the UNGGE process: “Russia has come in conflict with the position of certain countries that seek to impose on the whole world their own game rules in the information space, which would only serve their own interests.”\nFrom a role theoretical perspective, the statement ascribes the role of a technologically dominant and hypocritical hegemon to the US, trying to legitimize its own superiority and respective aggressive actions through international law. Amb. Krutskikh also reaffirmed Russia`s position, that the western-favored focus on “humanitarian aspects” in cyber-space is nothing more than an attempt to legitimize its own use of cyber-force.\nThe first OEWG concluded with its Final Draft report in March 2021. The report reaffirmed that international law, and in particular the Charter of the UN, is applicable in the cyber-domain. But the report lacks any concrete recommendations concerning its actual application. It merely states that future discussions on the topic will be necessary. Moreover, and resembling the failed UNGGE consensus in 2017, it does not contain references to international humanitarian law, human rights law, and customary law, as well as principles of the UN Charter.\nIn the annex of the Chair`s Summary of the OEWG Final Draft report in 2021, China reiterates its strong conceptual support of national sovereignty and information security, noting that “states should refrain from using ICTs to interfere in internal affairs of other states and undermine their political, economic and social stability.” Moreover, China declared that “states should not exploit their dominant position in ICTs, [...] to undermine other states' right to independent control of ICT goods and services as well as their security,” thereby rejecting the Trump administration`s role ascription as a systemic rival and claiming China's role as an enhancer of prosperity on an international level.\nIn sum, the third phase saw an open confrontation between democratic vs. autocratic dominated state camps at the UN-level, resulting in two parallel institutional tracks for norm evolution. While Russia more actively took over the role of a dissident, the Chinese government chose the more accommodative role as an opponent in the current order. Responding to the forward defense strategy of the US, both Russia and China did not alter their role behavior but rather escalated their cyber-espionage operations. The Trump administration's reaction, to increase public attribution through indictment\nprocedures did not change this trend, rather it has strengthened the Russian (and partially Chinese determination) to openly challenge the US government's hypocrisy and to attack its legitimacy as the hegemon of the current liberal international order.\n## Conclusion\nTo explain the absence of the emergence of cyber-espionage norms we have eschewed the notion that this stems from a lack of hegemonic stability or incompatible preferences of domestic groups in the most powerful states. Instead, our role theoretical argument has been guided by two conceptual premises: the co-constitution of domestic and international roles of governments vis-á-vis internal and external others, and the effects of secrecy on role taking and subsequent norm evolution. Our aim has been to better understand how government's use secrecy to obfuscate role conflicts resulting from internal and external expectations and their bearing on international norm evolution.\nThe sovereignty-role nexus applied here zoomed in the intricate two-level role conflicts emanating from two autocratic powers trying to bolster their domestic and foreign sovereignty in the face of an increasingly pro-active democratic power that seeks to protect its expansive national security concerns through proactive cyber-espionage measures. By acting clandestinely, both proponents of the “Web of the Free” as well as the “Web of Sovereigns” to hide information that does undermine their respective normative claims about their role in the international order: While comprehensive clandestine surveillance programs allow the US government to obfuscate the violation of privacy concerns, both in the US and abroad, through extensive proxy use autocratic governments try to obfuscate the violation of sovereign rights of other (mostly democratic) nations.\nWhen cyber-espionage operations became public over the past two decades, norm evolution started but dissipated soon: After the Snowden revelation, the Obama administration rejected to establish a binding norm, even among allies. In the German case, this resulted in the adaptation of domestic security law which legalized future US-German intelligence cooperation even when German citizen's data privacy is concerned. In the case of the US-China economic espionage agreement, China at first complied with the bilateral norm, but only so long as to avoid painful economic sanction against its tech giants. Since the onset of the US-trade war and open struggle for IT and AI dominance under the Trump administration, there appears to be less incentive on either side for self-restraint.\nMore generally speaking, recent role changes in cyber-espionage behavior by the US, China and Russia appear to result in norm nanism not only because secrecy prevents stable behavioral and discursive expectations over time. As\nthe case of Russian infowar and disinformation campaigns shows, liberal mimickry, using Western concepts superficially and filling them with dissentient content, has become a powerful tool to undermine the legitimacy on which democratic societies rest. However, Ukrainian information operations during the recent war with Russia indicate that even autocratic regimes are not immune against reputational losses, bolstered by the use of information communication technologies, addressing their own population. Furthermore, the leak of internal communication of the cyber crime outlet “Conti” by an alleged Ukrainian researcher is further evidence for the use of typical Russian disinformation tactics, now utilised by its usual victims against Russian-affiliated cyber actors themselves.\nConsistent with the role theoretical literature which asserts that roles bridge the gap between agents and structure, we have shown here that specific sovereignty claims by the US -- political sovereignty may be limited through legitimate cyber-espionage at all times -- and Russia as well as Chinese -- cyber-sovereignty must be asserted both externally and domestically -- have a direct (negative) bearing on norm evolution.\nCompared to more structural approaches toward norm evolution, our role theoretical perspective emphasizes the role of agency and the role conflicts emanating from a diverse set of expectations toward that agency. As such, our perspective should be also able to accommodate norm setting practices by other governmental or non-governmental institutions than the political leadership, e.g. intelligence services. When doing so, it would provide a more nuanced view why intelligence agencies may have some or no incentive to support the evolution of inter-state norms and may opt to establish loose forms of expected behavior -- in what has been called “normalization” -- between intelligence operatives of a few selected states.\nPace what has been portrayed as norm nanism may (only) be the stillbirth of liberal cyber-espionage norms. Liberal cyber-espionage norms rest on the assumption that responsive governments may use secrecy only in a few restricted cases because secrecy undermines public scrutiny and thus official responsibility. It follows that Russian dissidence and China's opposition in combination with the United States' growing appetite for political espionage may well lead to the effective stabilization of illiberal cyber-espionage norms. With the OEWG process on its way to supplant the less inclusive UNGGE group, a majority of governments in the OEWG group may find the Russian and Chinese concept of information sovereignty more appealing. Controlling information helps governments in fending off domestic claims of transparency and participation as well as international encroachments, e.g. by US security and intelligence agencies doxing incriminating informations, against their regime. However, current Russian efforts to implement a new cyber crime convention within the UN may be stalled, due to Russian violation of Ukraine`s sovereignty, as it is perceived by many countries worldwide. In theoretical terms, Russia's\naction in the offline-sphere could hinder its ambitions to fill the role of a widely accepted norm promoter of state sovereignty in cyber-space. At this stage, it remains to be seen what long-term impact Russia`s war against Ukraine will also have on cyber-espionage and its international regulation.\nIn this article, we have not set out to trace how and in what direction domestic roles change over time. In the United States, the new Biden administration has declared that it may strengthen the political leadership in cyber-espionage and interagency procedures as the country faces the fallout of several of the worst cyber-espionage operations in recent US history, but also heavily disruptive ransomware operations. The U.S. Cyber-Space Solarium Commission has also made substantial recommendations as to how the United States may restructure its domestic policy process in order to reduce cyber-vulnerabilities and effectuate rational cyber-governing behavior. We thus suspect that the domestic assertion of leadership vis-á-vis a Republican minority in Congress as well as US international leadership vis-á-vis Russia and China will have lasting, if unintended consequences, for the evolution of cyber-espionage norms. It seems that these norms need more transparency about present and past behavior and less hypocrisy about stated goals in order to grow.",

The US, China and Russia Interaction and the Governance of Cyber-Espionage\nSebastian Harnisch and Kerstin Zettl-Schabath\nInstitute of Political Science, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany\n## ABSTRACT\nWhen and how does state interaction in cyber-space result in norm development? In this article, we contend that governments take on roles vis-à-vis both domestic and foreign audiences, often resulting in conflicts between crosscutting internal and external role expectations. To alleviate these role conflicts, governments use various secret instruments of statecraft that, in turn, shape international norm development. We theorize the nexus between domestic and foreign role play and secrecy, thereby extending the understanding of role taking in international relations to the cyber-space. We argue that whereas the role conceptions of autocratic powers China and Russia have been geared toward cyber-sovereignty of the regime vis-à-vis internal and external others, the United States, as a democratic power, has sought cyber-security for both state and non-state actors in the international realm. Trying to hide some of their cyber-operations, the interaction between China, Russia and the US has resulted in a distinct pattern of cyber-proxy use and state-based surveillance interaction that has facilitated the stabilization of illiberal cyber-espionage norms and the spread of diverging notions of information sovereignty.\n## KEYWORDS\ncyber-espionage; sovereignty; proxies; norms; secrecy\n## Introduction\nThe emergence of international norms in cyber-space are bound up with the ways in which states specify and act upon norms in gestation. The extent scholarship on cyber-norms has recognized the importance of Great Power rivalry, competing political systems, sub-state actors and uncertainty about new technologies as probable causes of norm emergence.¹ So far, however, little work has explored the nexus between the validity and facticity of an emerging norm on cyber-espionage.² And yet, linking discursive specification and (identifiable) practices to the robustness of a norm offers a distinct perspective on the social purchase of an emerging norm, thus providing a broad conception of the co-constitutive effects of agency actions and norms.³\nCONTACT Kerstin Zettl-Schabath  kerstin.zettl@ipw.uni-heidelberg.de  @kerstin_zettl  Institute of Political Science, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany\n© 2022 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC\nIn this article, we develop the concept of a discursive and practice-based norm evolution nexus through a role theoretical lens. In doing so, we examine the potential formation of a cyber-espionage norm by focusing on processes of verbal and practical norm contestation and concealment that may shape, stall and even reverse, the emergence of a norm. The cyber-espionage norm complex is unique since there is not even an uncontested overarching and explicit offline norm baring political or economic espionage. We also suggest that the norm dynamics identified in the field of espionage may spill over into other cyber-norm evolution cases as well, so that the non-emergence of cyber-espionage norms may tell us about norm evolution in the cyber-realm more broadly.\nConstructivist research has explored the social origin norm evolution for a long time, highlighting the co-constitutive nature as “collective expectations for the proper behavior of actors with a given identity”. Conceptually, constructivists do tie an actor's identity to the standards of a given group even if these standards are still in gestation. Since developing and enacting norms do involve discursive action, most notably speech acts and practices, norm contestation may be understood as a social process in which competing norms are expressed and acted upon, but also as social processes in which actors explicitly claim the validity of a norm while challenging the facticity of the norm through adverse action. In particular, actors may challenge whether and how the norm may apply in a given context (applicatory contestation), they may also question the exact meaning of the norm (meaning contestation), and they may challenge the righteousness of the norm (validity contestation), thereby signaling different levels of opposition or dissidence toward the international order constituted by that (and/or other) norm(s).\nThus far, the extent literature on cyber-espionage has focussed on the development of competing normative visions of cyber-security vs. information-security by Great Powers. But little attention has been payed to the question of how far the differences between explicit norm creation, through explicit speech acts, and implicit norm creation, through cyber-practices shapes the very form and direction of cyber-espionage norms. We address this gap by examining the discursive and practice interaction dynamics as revealed in the cyber-espionage norm evolution over the past two decades. To do so, we employ a role theoretical perspective on secrecy, noting that key differences in norm evolution processes result from crosscutting domestic and international expectation pressure to obfuscate the actor's own identity and behavior. We contend that secrecy implies a far greater significance for cyber-espionage in contrast to other forms of potentially impermissible operations in cyber-space: on the one hand, the effectiveness of a cyber-intrusion is (more) dependent upon staying undetected than in the offline world. On the other hand, keeping an intrusion secret may have reputational, financial, political or legal benefits for a victim, too. It follows then that secrecy constitutes a buffer\nfor both perpetrators and victims of cyber-espionage to address role conflicts in the domestic and international realm. In keeping offensive operations secret, both victims and offenders can manipulate their respective information environments, protecting information about their capacities and vulnerabilities as well as their intentions and respective reputation.\nRole theory is particular well suited to address concerns of secretive behavior in international politics. With deep roots in anthropology, social psychology and the philosophical school of American pragmatism, it suggests that roles are interbehavioural phenomena that emerge in social settings between individuals, groups and states, once social interactions result in dense and permanent expectations so that relatively stable patterns of a division of labor among role beholders emerge. In this reading, international roles are „functional positions emanating from ego and alter expectations directed toward a (common) purpose of a group“ as they pertain to states, so that substantial changes in state roles are directly tied to the norms of the international community. It follows that norm contestation, i.e. diverging expectations as to which behavior is appropriate, and role conflict, either interrole conflict -- which role should be pursued by an actor -- or intrarole conflict -- what does the role mean to the actor and significant other actors -- provide for constitutive mechanism as to how and why some norms may or may not develop and in which shape or form they do. Thus far, role theory has been used successfully to explain the emergence and fluctuation of sovereignty norms, but it has not been explored how secretive behavior, role conduct and norm emergence conceptually may fit together.\nIn this article, we argue that role theory advances our understanding of the cyber-espionage norm emergence process in several significant ways: First, role theory priviledges agency properties and actions over structures, i.e. norms, which is especially suitable to social situations in which uncertainty is high (as is the case for cyber-espionage), and institutionalization is low and norms are, if at all, in their infancy. In the cyber-realm, some progress has been made over the past decade to devise a catalog of norms and practices, e.g. the Tallinn Manuals. Here, however, we focus on actual state practice, which either underpins or undermines the verbal claims by governments to comply with extant norms, thereby strengthening the facticity (verbal recognition of norm) and validity (behavioral compliance with the norm). As Bruce Biddle and other role theoreticians have noted: “norms are said to provide merely a set of broad imperatives within which the details of roles can be worked out. Actual roles, then, are thought to reflect norms, attitudes, contextual demands, negotiation, and the evolving definition of the situation as understood by the actors.” Secondly, we contend that great powers which deem themselves as tied in asymmetrical hierarchical power relationships and in situations of high uncertainty, prefer using a combination of “frontstage” public signals to establish themselves as respectable leading members of international society\nwhile also utilizing “backstage” signals, i.e. making use of ‘proxy actors' and or clandestine intelligence operations, to reap the domestic benefits of cyber-espionage while avoiding the reputation costs of questionable operations. Thirdly, role theory does not purport a single and/or fixed national identity or strategic culture to direct cyber-behavior such as other theoretical approaches do. Rather, role theory allows for vertical contestation, i.e. through societal actors and groups, and horizontal contestation, e.g. in government-opposition relations, intra-governing coalition and between governmental bureaucracies. Crosscutting role expectations towards a government on how to behave domestically and/or internationally may then result in “split behavior”: on the frontstage, behavior is directed to preserve a country`s international reputation as a respected member of the international community, most notably, safeguarding its sovereignty and autonomy vis-á-vis more powerful or more determined other states, institutions and non-state actors. However, on the backstage, governments may want to utilize covert actions by proxies or intelligence operatives, to mask international behavior that is deemed inappropriate on the frontstage but which is necessary to meet domestic or intra-governing coalition expectations, i.e. to advance, political, commercial or development interests or to display the superiority of one's own political system. In short, secrecy allows governments to speak with a “split voice” and address the expectations of two, often times diverging, audiences at the same time.\nOur role theoretical treatment of the norm evolution follows established practices in role theoretical research, using both speech acts and physical (non-) acts as representations of discursive and practical role behavior. Specifically, we do not purport that speech acts reflect genuine intentions nor do we claim that our quantitative data set has identified all the cases of (illicit) soft- or hardware infringements. Rather, we would like to stress from our symbolic interactionist (and constitutive) perspective, that the meaning of an action, speech act or otherwise, is revealed or concealed by the reaction or non-reaction of others that imbues or deprives to imbue meaning into an action. In more concrete terms, if a role is taken on, it depends on the taking up of a commensurate role by other actors whether the social group and its purpose of which the original role taking process is a part of, is stabilized. If commensurate roles are not taken up, though, or if respective role taking behavior is concealed, then no stabilization of respective role expectations can occur.\nIn the remainder of the article, we proceed as follows: First, we conceptualize the role theoretical nexus between secrecy and norm emergence. (Secret) role taking behavior may vary along two axes: domestic vs. international role expectations and the political vs. economic role taking. Respective discourses and practices, of course, may and do change over time. The second section presents the role behavior by Russia, China and\nthe United States in three distinct phases, highlighting shifts in rhetorical and practical front- and backstage action (1998-2013, 2014-2016, 2017-2021). To analyze their cyber-espionage conduct, a new cyber-conflict-dataset (HD-CY.CON) is used, indicating distinctive patterns in which governments used different types of secrecy to meet expectations. We conclude with a summary of our findings, demonstrating how secrecy concerns shape role taking behavior which in turn facilitate or hamper cyber-espionage norm formation.\n## The Secrecy-Role-Norm Nexus\nGrounded in symbolic interactionism international roles are constituted through Ego, i.e. domestically generated, and Alter, i.e. international, expectations toward the appropriate behavior of an actor in a group (of states). Sovereignty norms, as foundational rules of the international society, proscribe sovereignty roles to state actors which in turn require recognition of these actors, e.g. states, as “sovereign”. Through recognition as sovereign, sovereign powers are ascribed which may or may not be exerted, e.g. treaty making, joining international institutions etc. It follows that governments strive for recognition as legitimate sovereigns in the international realm as well as domestic realm, providing for various political, i.e. participation, security etc. and economic, i.e. wellbeing, goods to the international and national society.\nWhen doing so, cyber-operations may trigger a focus on one of the resulting role expectation types: First, if a government is challenged by an external actor that threatens its domestic sovereignty, e.g. through a misinformation campaign, the respective government may want to strengthen its domestic sovereignty by reasserting its control over information distribution. However, by restricting information distribution, a government, particularly democratic governments, may disregard societal expectations for freedom of speech, resulting in an adversarial two-level expectation game situation. Second, if the dominant (liberal) sovereignty norms collide with domestic expectations toward the international role of a country, the government has several options: to accept the international order (and respective external role expectations) and to adapt domestic expectations accordingly. Or the government accepts the international order but may want to change the country's role in it, e.g. by joining a new status group. Alternatively, the country may want to change the international order altogether, seeking a new role in a new order, thereby changing the social purpose and or hierarchy in the respective international society. In the latter case, countries (and their governments) become “revisionist powers,” seeking to change the international order and their country's role in it, thereby meeting domestic expectations about the country's purpose and role in the international order.\nThe case of cyber-espionage norms with different sub-specifications offers particular benefits for developing the Secrecy-Role-Norm nexus. Here, we are focussing on the question whether the discursive and practical enactment of sovereignty roles on the two axes include the right to “the non-consensual collection of confidential information that is under the control of another actor”, i.e. espionage. Specifically, we highlight the potential role conflicts resulting from three distinct contexts: First, even in the offline world, espionage norms, particularly their scope, communality and obligation, in war- and peace-time have been contested so that analogical reasoning between the existing international law and the emergence of respective cyber-norms is complicated. Second, in cyber-space undetected intrusion is a necessary condition for any kind of non-consensual access to a network. This is also true in cases of cyber-espionage that are supplemented by more disruptive actions, i.e. so-called “hack-and-leak” operations (or “doxing”), because these operations require secrecy before the disruptive effects become known to the victim and the public, in order to achieve their intended purpose(s). This severely complicates the question whether an intrusion serves intelligence gathering only or more nefarious purposes and whether it constitutes a violation of sovereignty. Third, while sovereignty norms are imbued with notions of equality, autonomous choice and the physical integrity among states, depending on the state's relative material and immaterial position vis-á-vis the majority of the international society, a state's government may feel entitled to exert its freedom of action to the detriment of other states (lesser or stronger powers, threatening or non-threatening states). This establishes a legal ambivalence: the government may accept the ascribed power to act autonomously by others as an equal right for all, but it may also use that same right to infringe upon the sovereign right of others. This is particularly true for cyber-espionage operations where the legal delineations between permissible and impermissible actions vary not only over time, but also depending on the targets and data involved and their subsequent instrumentalization.\nDrawing on recent advances in the study of secrecy, we argue that role conflicts emanating from crosscutting domestic and international expectations toward cyber-security vs. cyber-sovereignty have become so prevalent that they have a direct bearing on the emergence or non-emergence of cyber-espionage norms. In particular, we contend that as long as words and deeds lack publicity in the respective audiences, actors can avoid being held accountable for each of them or inconsistencies between them, thereby being able to act without incurring domestic or international reputational losses, i.e. impunity. It follows that governments may forego stabilizing their behavioral patterns, i.e. roles, by not tying their identifiably role behavior to explicit standards of approriate behavior, i.e. norms. In these cases, covert cyber-operations may be visible to the adversary's government but that this government may withhold information about the operation or its impact too, depending on the domestic and international reputational costs incured when not responding. In order to alleviate the reputational\ncosts domestically and internationally as well as the probability of a punishing counter role taking, i.e. a public or covert counter attack, the attacking government also often uses a proxy, non-state actors used by state actors for covert purposes. It follows that a government of a country under attack may blame a proxy, rather than a responsible government, in order to avoid domestic and/or international reputational costs when not standing up to the attacking government. The attribution through a proxy also allows for more moderate forms of political responses, such as indictments against individual hackers (whose arrest in most cases is more than unlikely), or sanctions against technological front-companies, serving as proxies. These types of actions do not constitute counter-measures under international law, which presuppose the official attribution of respective state agencies and which are regularly more escalatory in nature.\nAs a consequence, we contend that cyber-rivals may tacitly cooperate to steer conflicts to a “backstage”, i.e. conduct cyber-operations clandestinely, to leave an external impression to third parties that their cyber-conflict remains limited and even regulated by tacit if not obligatory rules. From a legal perspective, this “backstage” approach is not necessary as most cyber-norms are still in their infancy. Nevertheless, governments appear to still prefer the “backstage” so as to limit political, reputational and economic costs. Under these circumstances, clandestine role behavior resulting from intra-role conflicts does not lead to further, particularly multilateral norm evolution. Rather, as the adversarial interaction between two partners remains (partially) undetected among them and invisible to third parties, offensive cyber-behavior becomes regularized in a given dyad without becoming to be expected by the larger international society because it is not yet tied to intersubjective roles.\nIn , we illustrate this nexus between a states' verbal role taking and its role behavior by introducing the predominant democratic role conception, the guardian of the “Web of the Free.” We contrast it with the predominant autocratic role conception, the guardian of the “Web of Sovereigns.” In cases of conflicting domestic and international role expectations, we argue, that governments have a (strong) incentive to use different forms of secrecy. In doing so, they can avoid that intra- or inter-role conflicts turn into conflict escalation dynamics on the international level and de-legitimization dynamics on the domestic level.\nMore specifically, if information about a cyber-espionage-operation is revealed which calls a government's public stand into question, the government may react in (at least) two ways: First, it may deny any wrongdoing, rejecting any responsibility or forwarding it to cyber-proxies; second, it may acknowledge espionage operations and shift the narrative post-hoc toward claiming secret operations as legitimate (and less aggressive) expressions of its own role conception. Thus, shielding information from one's own public may be answered by similar behavior of the opponent, as both actor's “share” an interest in controlling conflict escalation dynamics emanating from domestic role expectations.\nDEMOCRACY AND SECURITY\n#\nGraph 1. Categorizing states' role behavior (words vs. deeds) in cyber-space. Annotations: Source: Own figure.\n\"WoF\"  $\\rightarrow$  \"Web of the Free\"\n\"WoS\"  $\\rightarrow$  \"Web of Sovereigns\"\n$\\neq \\rightarrow$  Incompatibility between words &amp; deeds, secrecy needed\n$= \\rightarrow$  Compatibility between words &amp; deeds, no secrecy needed\nConsistent with the assumption that the current liberal international cyber-order creates disadvantageous hierarchies and potential of intra-role conflicts for autocratic powers, we examine Russian and Chinese efforts for ideational and material counterbalancing to advance their ontological security as autocratic powers by protecting their status in the international society. In empirical terms, we contend that Russia and China act as what has been called \"frustrated sovereigns\" in cyber-space, i.e. agents that strive for (ever) more recognition of what they themselves claim as a legitimate (autocratic) cyber-sovereignty in a liberal-dominated international cyber-order.\nAs Bettiza and Lewis (2020) have found, these practices regularly include \"liberal performance\", i.e. adopting and reproducing liberal norms in shape and form while turning them against liberal regimes themselves, such as human rights or cyber-incidents or disinformation reports, \"liberal mimicry\", i.e. adopting liberal practices while filling them with dissentient content, such as \"Responsibility-to-Protect\" to legitimize Russian-identity based interventions in the Post-Soviet space; \"civilizational essentialization\", i.e. a practice by which Western norms are presented as an \"other\" vis-à-vis a primordial civilization, and \"counter-norm entrepreneurship,\" a practice to positively promote illiberal norms, ideas and institutions, such as \"cyber\nsovereignty” (see below) and “illiberal good governance”, i.e. controls on internet access, for which even inter-autocratic learning processes seem to emerge.\nIn sum, while sharing some common normative concepts and practices, we contend that Russian and Chinese cyber-espionage discourses and practices display distinct patterns of adversarial role taking or making patterns that have led them to pursue diverging forms of regularized espionage interaction vis-à-vis each other as well as toward the United States. The different types of secrecy matter because the resulting interaction patterns with the United States shape the evolution of either dyadic or multilateral expectation patterns, i.e. dyadic or international cyber-espionage roles.\n## Cyber-espionage norm emergence: secrecy & initial consensus (1998-2013)\nAt the end of the 20^{th} century, cyber-espionage campaigns, such as the alleged Russian Operation Moonlight Maze, indicated that the traditional cold war espionage tactics would be increasingly “going cyber.” To shape the new conflict domain, the Russian Federation launched a proposal for an international treaty for information security in 1998, complemented by a cooperation agreement of the member states of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The initiative indicated Russia's aspiration as a norm entrepreneur of a lex specialis for the cyber-space even before the US and its allies advocated the application of existing international law to cyber-space. From a role theoretical perspective, the Russian government thus took on a new role, making a role in a new setting geared toward a “Web of Sovereigns” rather than taking a role in the existing “Web of the Free.” This new role was tied to the concept of “information security,” which represents efforts by (autoractic) governments to control and censor the flow of information within national intranets, often legitimized by national security concerns. In contrast, democratic governments tend to promote the concept of “cyber security,” which focuses on the effective regulation of malicious cyber-operations rather than restrictions on the access and distribution of information. It follows that these diverging concepts and the respective roles taken to promote them hamper the emergence of common norms in the international community.\nFounded in 2004, the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security (UNGGE) acknowledged the need for an international negotiation forum, in order to sound the pathway of cyber-norm development. The final consensus reports in 2010 and 2013 emphasized the need for a common understanding of acceptable behavior in cyber-space (2010) and the need to strengthen the general applicability of international law in the cyber-realm (2013). Even though Russia and China finally agreed to these\nreports, they also consistently promoted the concepts of “information security” and “cyber-sovereignty”. Both of these concepts stress that the content of the information and the technological handling through soft and hardware need to be protected, thereby ascribing the government the role as a sovereign guardian of a “national information space” which must be protected from nefarious foreign and domestic influences.\nSpecifically, this role conception entails and legitimizes various forms of foreign espionage and domestic surveillance including data collection, storage and analysis to bolster autocratic regime authority. Specific targets are human rights activists, dissidents or ethnic minorities in and outside the national jurisdiction. Whereas domestic surveillances system, such as China's social credit system, are not kept secret to attract or deter commensurate role taking by citizens, foreign surveillance pratices are mostly kept secret to comply with international privacy standards, except for cases of “tainted leaks” when illegally obtained information is leaked to discredit either the source of content of that information, thereby spreading mistrust or disinformation about opponents of an autocratic regime.\nRussia and China also cooperated bilaterally and multilaterally through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and other interstate fora, such as the International Telecommunication Union“ (ITU), to promote the “Web of Sovereigns” as a viable alternative to the US-led multistake-holder based “Web of the Free”.\nApart from this frontstage role behavior as would-be autocratic normmakers, Russia and China started to move to the backstage. Our cyber-conflict data shows for the period from the year 2000 on that Russia's operational pattern focused on political espionage in its regional neighborhood (five out of eleven cases) and vis-á-vis the US (five out of eleven from 2000 to 2013). Secrecy enabled the Russian government to meet nationalist domestic expectations -- putting Russia on par with other Great Powers by conducting political espionage -- while mitigating escalation risks with the highly capable US -- by using proxies for most of its espionage operations (eight out of eleven cyber-espionage cases). Pundits on Russian foreign policy agree that despite disagreements over specific foreign policy goals, Russia's foreign policy elites all advocate “that Russia is, and should remain, a power with global interest and global reach.” Notably, Russian secrecy patterns shifted over time: In early cyber-espionage operations the obfuscation of the perpetrator's identity mixed with clandestine actions, resulting in the absence of signaling intentions by Russia. In later operations, clandestine operations decreased and more open, provocative proxy action with lower deniability increased. We suggest that the motivation for obtaining plausible deniability resulted from the shift in the ambivalent relationship between Russia and the United States at the time: Russian-US relations oscillated clearly between verbal confrontation\n(Putin in 2007 at the Munich Security Conference), de facto cooperation (overflight rights for U.S. forces in the Afghanistan war), and rhetorical truce during the so-called reset phase between 2009 and 2013.\nIn contrast, in this early phase Chinese operational patterns focused on promoting economic growth by the theft of intellectual property through conventional offline and cyber-espionage. The dataset currently records 59 cases of Chinese cyber-espionage with alleged state-involvement between 2003 and 2013. Among the targets attacked, the US stands out with 39 operations. China's operational pattern resembles that of an autocratic developing country: the government allegedly used cyber-proxies in 37 espionage-operations, mostly against technologically superior democracies, such as the US, to leap-frog toward technological superiority while addressing domestic role expectation to further the wellbeing of the Chinese people. In political terms, the Chinese regime shadowed both Russia's bilateral and regional pro-autocratic normentrepeneurship-efforts in the SCO and in- and outside the UNGGE process.\nThe US government started in 2009 to respond to this latter pattern. It communicated a legal position that while cyber-espionage in general was tolerable state behavior if carried out to protect national security was deemed non-permissible if economically motivated, i.e. if the stolen data was handed to corporations to give them a head start over their US competitors. Pace, secrecy about US cyber-espionage and surveillance gained enormous conflict potential in the summer of 2013 when the revelations by Edward Snowden took place. The revelations attested to a massive, global US surveillance network that targeted governments and citizens of allies, rivals and enemies to address US national security concerns broadly defined in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks.\nThe Snowden revelations forced the Obama administration to reconcile its public rhetoric about the “Web of the Free” and the protection of civil liberties with the US' vast secret surveillance programs. It did so by arguing that national security concerns, including those by allied governments and citizens, required the US government to act secretly, thereby evoking conflicting domestic role expectations in democratic societies concerning crosscutting security and liberty concerns.\nInterestingly, instead of addressing the Snowden revelations diplomatically and calling for a multilateral (legal) solution, the Russian government chose to scold the US government of hypocrisy and double standards publicly, thereby mimicring Western concerns about data privacy on the “frontstage” and simultaneously avoiding restrictions on its own “backstage” espionage behavior. In contrast, China's official reaction was circumspect, merely asking the Obama administration to address international concerns squarely. Inofficially, however, the extent and depth of the NSA programs shocked the Chinese government, setting in motion\nan immediate change in (secret) commercial and governmental activities:^{56} Commercially, US IT corporations suffered significant market losses from respective security concerns in China, leading up to a full-blown Chinese-government effort to reduce dependency on US-technology and corporations. Politically, the Chinese government substantially revamped its cyber-security capacities and institutions, establishing both advanced defensive and offensive capacities as well as a host of new governing bodies, institutions and regulations, which as President Xi promised, would make China a “Cyber Superpower.”^{57}\nIn sum, the early phase of cyber-espionage norm development was shaped by verbal confrontations between the two main camps within the UNGGE process with a fragile and partial consensus emerging regarding the applicability of international law in cyber-space. All three states conducted substantial cyber-espionage for either political (US & Russia) or economic (China) reasons. Each government used secrecy extensively to reconcile crosscutting internal and external role expectations. When concealed operations were revealed, government's reactions varied considerably because of domestic and foreign expectations: Addressing domestic and allied concerns for democratic transparency and rule of law, the Obama administration sought to legitimize the secret NSA surveillance programs by pointing at the tradeoff between (substantial) national security gains and (limited) privacy losses. In contrast, autocratic governments in Russia and China stuck to their plausible deniability claims about (non-)use of proxies, thereby addressing domestic expectations about regime security and economic wellbeing while evading international concerns.\nMore specifically, during this period, the US government did not recognize respective espionage-operations as directly threatening to US domestic order: with Russia being altercasted as a regional power in decline, its cyber-espionage activities did not attract much American attention, the “agent.btz” malware use in 2008 being one of the few exceptions.^{58} A similar pattern of US reactions can be detected with regard to Chinese commercial espionage, the Operations Titan Rain and Operation Aurora being the exceptions to the rule.^{59} However, both the Russian and Chinese government reacted strongly to the revelations of the NSA surveillance activities in 2013, substantially revamping their respective cyber-capacities and postures which resulted in a much more asymmetrical and aggressive approach toward the United States.\n## Cyber-espionage norms in turmoil: secrecy & missing normative validity (2014-2016)\nThe second phase of cyber-espionage norm evolution from 2014 to 2016 was crucial. In this period, Russian and Chinese discursive role taking and cyber-espionage operations severely circumscribed US domestic and\ninternational role taking. To begin with, Russia, together with Chinese and Cuban delegations, challenged the notion by the United States and other Western states that International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and the right to self-defense (Art. 51) is applicable in cyber-space, holding on to a strict textual reading in the UNGGE process. In turn, both countries -- together with other SCO member states -- submitted a draft document to the UN Secretary General to facilitate an international consensus on international norms and rules guiding the behavior of states in the information space. The Russian government has presented Russia as a “responsible cyber-power” which has an obligation to mitigate US destructive actions and protect traditional norms, such as sovereignty and institutions, such as the UN Security Council, against the Western notion of a “rules-based international order.” The latter being based on informal institutions, including “private or multistakeholder actors,” and “inclusive and consensus-based deliberation” processes which are detrimental to the interests of most autocracies and illiberal democracies. In the offline domain, Russia also challenged the EU -- through its open intervention in Ukraine -- the United States, Turkey and NATO -- through its interventions in Syria and Libya, thereby rebuffing the Obama administration's ascription as a “regional power.”\nFor the period 2014 to 2016, the dataset lists 30 cyber-espionage operations with attributed Russian state involvement. Notably, seven of them were publicity-seeking information warfare operations, i.e. doxing. Nearly all of these doxing-cases affected western democracies or international institutions, such as WADA, that -- in one way or the other -- had contested Russia's sovereignty conception.\nThe most important Russian information warfare operation was the so-called DNC-Hack, attributed to the APT Fancy Bear, which in turn was directly tied to the military intelligence agency GRU. There is substantial evidence that the DNC-Hack and later disinformation campaigns have been “liberal mimickry operations” by the Russian government, adopting the form of a liberal discourse -- transparency about the nefarious actions of the DNC leadership against Bernie Sanders -- while combining it with non-liberal content, such as data tampering, time sensitive publication or outright disinformation and fake news. As President Putin has argued repeatedly, the Russian government regards publications by Western non-governmental organizations, such as the Soros Foundation or the publication of the so-called Panama Papers, i.e. incriminating reports about corruption in the Russian elite, as US-led information campaigns to topple the Russian government.\nIn our role theoretical perspective, the DNC-hack demonstrates Russia's growing role as a dissident in a liberal and Western-dominated international society, as it -- from a Kremlin perspective -- responds to direct Western\nviolations of its own sovereignty. Viewed this way, secrecy is no longer functional because the Russian government wants the world to know that it has the means and wherewithal to hurt Western states and governments whenever it chooses to do so. Arguably, this is an effect of the Snowden revelations, as the United States government lost its ability to act hypocritically and get away with it.\nThus, from a Russian perspective, doxing operations merely turn the table on Western states, mimicking liberal values, such as free speech and open elections, by superficially complying with liberal norms while filling them with dissentient content. Accordingly, while Russia is closing its own information space to assert its digital sovereignty by quelling domestic dissent, it mouth-feeds dissent in Western liberal society to destabilize their information environment.\nTurning toward the international legal debate on disruptive cyber-espionage operations, UNGGE participants agreed in 2015, that “states should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity that intentionally damages critical infrastructure.” In terms of cyber-espionage, even the probing of foreign critical infrastructures appears to be prohibited under the UNGGE agreement because energy grids or similar entities are no plausible targets of espionage for national security reasons but always suggest a potential disruptive escalation in its aftermath.\nChinese role behavior during the second period also reflects a critical shift regarding sovereignty norms and alter expectations in particular by the US government. Between 2012 (the year, Xi took office) and 2015 (the year of the Obama-Xi-Agreement), cyber-espionage operations against US targets were attributed twenty-three times to Chinese state actors or their proxies. Among them were four operations against political targets, ten against commercial entities and four that targeted both receiver types (amongst others).\nUnder the Obama administration, US-responses to Chinese operations diverged sharply depending on the targets affected: While political espionage was deemed permissive by Washington economic espionage was not, with exceptions in cases of national security concerns. As the then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper stated in 2015 about the OPM-Hack: “you have to kind of salute the Chinese for what they did” and added, that the US ”would have done the same thing if they had the opportunity to do so.”\nIn contrast, the Obama administration grew ever more concerned about Chinese economic cyber-espionage in 2013. In February, the IT-Security Company Mandiant issued a detailed report about a specific Chinese cyber-attack unit in Shanghai (PLA Unit 61398), claiming that this group was responsible for several operations against the US and other Five Eyes member states since 2006. In June 2013, President Obama raised the issue of Chinese\ncyber-operations directly with President Xi, to be followed by official indictments against the PLA officers (May 2014) and an Executive Order (March 2015) which provided the legal groundwork for sanctioning Chinese companies in the run-up to the State visit of President Xi to the US in September 2015. At the summit both sides signed the so-called “U.S. China-Cyber-Agreement”, committing to:^{72} Provide timely responses to requests for information and assistance concerning malicious cyber-activities,refrain from conducting or knowingly supporting cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, pursue efforts to further identify and promote appropriate norms of state behavior in cyber-space within the international community, and establish a high-level joint dialogue mechanism on fighting cyber-crime and related issues.\nParticularly noteworthy is Point 2 of the agreement, a public bilateral commitment to cease permanently economically motivated cyber-espionage. Through this agreement between the most prevalent target of economic espionage and arguably the most notorious perpetrator they sent an important signal to third countries, explicitly distinguishing acceptable from not-acceptable state behavior. Significantly, the PRC government acknowledged for the first time the legitimacy of the prohibition of economic cyber-espionage when stating that “the Chinese government will not, in whatever form, engage in commercial theft or encourage or support such attempts by anyone.”^{73} Moreover, after the first meeting of the new US-Sino cyber-dialogue in December 2015 Xinhua News agency reported that the group had discussed alleged theft of data of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management by Chinese hackers, noting that „through investigation, the case turned out to be a criminal case rather than a state-sponsored cyber attack as the U.S side has previously suspected”, thereby acknowledging that an offensive cyber-operation had occurred from Chinese territory.^{74}\nWhile Chinese compliance with the accord rescinded in 2017, the two governments reaffirmed their commitment to “further solidifying, developing, and maintaining the Dialogue mechanism and continuing to strengthen bilateral cooperation in cybersecurity” in the framework of the third US-China joint dialogue on cyber-crime at the end of 2016.^{75}\nNotably, the US-China agreement also fertilized similar undertakings between China and other democratic countries: a similar agreement was reached between Great Britain and China, but Germany and China have been unable to settle their discord.^{76} However, in November 2015, the G20 followed suit, including Russia, in accepting the norm against conducting or supporting economically motivated cyber-espionage.^{77}\nIn sum, in this phase the Obama administrations propagated an approach to cyber-espionage norms, which rested on an intricate distinction between illegitimate vs. legitimate use of the affected information and not the target type per se. In doing so, the United States tried to legalize its own state practice as permissible and the actions of its adversaries as impermissible.\nThe Obama administration's approach also explicitly extended to more disruptive campaigns: the US put several (if not all) governments on notice, most notably non-nuclear weapon states under the Nonprolifeation Treaty, that it regards their sovereignty in the cyber-realm as permeable when it comes to the national security of the United States. The administration thus altercasted those countries into a hierarchy at the top of which the United States decides what kind of behavior is acceptable or not. When legitimizing unidentified US counter-operations against the malicious North Korean attacks on Sony Pictures in 2014, President Obama thus declared affirmatively: We cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the US”.^{78}\nIn the aftermath of the Snowden revelations, as other countries, such as China, started to make similar arguments, e.g. that China's economic espionage was for a national security purpose and not for economic gains.^{79} It follows that no stabilization of respective expectations between the United States and other great powers occurred, leaving norm evolution stalled during this period.\nThe failure of the UNGGE in 2017 to come up with a consensus report stems from these deep-seated disagreements. The strategic use of secrecy as a tool for prioritizing one's own domestic priorities could no longer conceal the incompatibility of the respective international role conceptions: whereas the United States did not regard other nations as sovereign in the traditional sense when it comes to US national security, Russia and China reciprocated with political and or economic espionage to advance their interpretation of information sovereignty, often by undermining the US' sovereignty as a democratic republic.\n## Cyber-espionage norms and forward action: the strategic neglect of secrecy (2017-2021)\nWith the incoming Trump administration, the US foreign and cyber-security role taking shifted markedly. Most notably, under President Trump the United States started to ascribe rival and/or enemy roles to former allies and foes alike by insisting on a transactionalist agenda, which prioritized one-time interactions over longer-term relationships. By altercasting China as a direct threat to US national security and hegemony, the Trump administration addressed the expanding territorial and economic sovereignty claims by the communist regime and identified them as violations of US-sovereignty. Focussing on bilateral vis-à-vis\nmultilateral negotiations, and favoring relative positioning vis-á-vis other great powers rather than a functional US leadership position in the international community, became the hallmarks of US foreign and security policy. The Trump administration's offensive cyber-strategy also featured some interesting, if illiberal, characteristics. With the so-called “Clean Network Initiative,” which was described by some observers as a “watershed” for the US internet policy, the administration moved closer to an authoritarian approach of protecting national information spaces and thus fragmenting global digital communication networks. In doing so, the United States also moved closer to resemble those democratic “swing-states” that cast their vote issue-dependent within the UN, thereby aligning with the “sovereigntist” vis-à-vis the “liberal sphere” in the internet governance debate.\nThe Trump administration changed tracks in domestic and external cyber-role taking behavior by more assertively applying the concept of “defending forward”: domestically, control and oversight functions in the executive branch and between the administration and Congress were reduced; externally, the United States proactively embedded US espionage malware in foreign infrastructure networks and started to publicly attribute nefarious attacks on US soil more systematically, thereby lifting the veil of secrecy in operational terms. This partial lifting of secrecy, however, may also be identified in the cyber-policies of democracies, e.g. in joint attribution statements in the aftermath of the Microsoft Exchange Hack 2021 or even the growing number of increasingly detailed National Cyber (Security) Strategies.\nThus, for the period of 2017-2021 the dataset and further case-investigations indicate nine US cyber-operations abroad which were directly or indirectly disclosed by US actors (2017-2019: six; 2020: two, 2021: one case). These pro-active signaling efforts were paralleled by a new offensive cyber-strategy, allegedly imposing higher costs on cyber-adversaries permanently to deter future actions. It comes as no surprise then that four of the nine US offensive operations were directed against Russian targets, four against Iran and one against North Korea. All but one of these US-operations allegedly had disruptive effects. When compared to the Obama administration, which had focused its response to the DNC-hack on domestic measures, the Trump administration employed external measures, such as the offensive cyber-operation to block the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll farm, from carrying out a cyber-enabled influence operation against the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. Notably, however, when targeting the Kremlin-associated troll factory instead of attacking Russia's military intelligence agency (GRU) directly, which was ultimately deemed responsible for most of state-based Russia's offensive cyber-operations, the Trump administration deliberately chose a target with less escalation potential. In a similar vein, when a US Global Hawk drone was shot down by Iranian forces in 2019, the\nTrump administration reportedly executed a cyber-response by using malware that had been implanted in Iranian networks before the attack on the U.S. drone.^{87}\nDisruptive US cyber-operations had started in 2013 as a reconnaissance campaign against the Russian electrical grid. However, these earlier operations were expanded in 2017 mounting to the “placement of potentially crippling malware inside the Russian system at a depth and with an aggressiveness that had never been tried before.”^{88} Moreover, through extensive public reporting, the Trump administration reiterated its capacity and willingness to exploit the infiltration of foreign networks for acts of sabotage, thereby reminding potential foes of similar earlier campaigns during peacetime, such as Stuxnet and Operation Nitro Zeus.^{89} Given these circumstances, an absolute ban on any form of cyber-operations against critical infrastructure, such as enshrined in the 2015 UNGGE report, appeared to be illusory.\nNotably, and in contrast to Russia, Chinese targets were absent from the US list for disruptive operations during this period, raising the question whether the communist regimes' cyber-operations did not require any proactive forward defense even though the administration escalated its offline conflicts with Beijing during the same period.\nInterestingly, the dataset also suggests that the intensified defending forward strategy was unsuccessful if not counterproductive: First, while the US expanded its offensive cyber-capacity, the Trump administration did neglect US defenses, thereby presenting Russian and Chinese operations ample reasons and a target-rich US domestic cyber-environment for escalating their offensive cyber-operations. Thus, in the period from 2017 to 2019, our dataset currently records thirteen operations with Chinese, ten operations with Russian, nine with Iranian and six with North Korean state involvement against US targets. Initial estimates for the years 2020 and 2021 do not indicate a decline in these operations. Rather, Chinese cyber-operations against (among others) U.S. targets appear to increase in intensity, as the Microsoft Exchange hack from 2021 suggests. As these numbers only reflect publicly known incidents at this time, they are bound to grow due to delayed detection and attribution processes. Arguably, with the Biden administration still assessing the damages from the SolarWinds, Microsoft Exchange and various other data compromise campaigns directed at US targets and attributed to Russian and Chinese operatives, the full extent of the blowback of the US forward cyber-defense strategy is still to be determined.^{90} And yet, given that the Biden administration has already declared its determination to respond to the SolarWinds operation, a new and more escalatory phase in disruptive operation may be in the making.\nIn diplomatic terms Russia also intensified its role taking as a dissident in the liberal international order: after the failed UNGGE consensus in 2017, the country proposed a resolution to the UN General Assembly (UNGA)\nthat advocated a separate and more inclusive negotiation forum, an Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG), to discuss the “possible measures that could be taken by the international community to strengthen information security at the global level.” In the end, the UNGA voted for the initiation of a new OEWG that established an alternative negotiation track to the sixth UNGGE, but on a similar, shared mandate, both starting in 2019. Andrey Krutskikh, the Special Representative of the President of the Russian Federation for International Cooperation on Information Security, explained Russia's opposition to the UNGGE process: “Russia has come in conflict with the position of certain countries that seek to impose on the whole world their own game rules in the information space, which would only serve their own interests.”\nFrom a role theoretical perspective, the statement ascribes the role of a technologically dominant and hypocritical hegemon to the US, trying to legitimize its own superiority and respective aggressive actions through international law. Amb. Krutskikh also reaffirmed Russia`s position, that the western-favored focus on “humanitarian aspects” in cyber-space is nothing more than an attempt to legitimize its own use of cyber-force.\nThe first OEWG concluded with its Final Draft report in March 2021. The report reaffirmed that international law, and in particular the Charter of the UN, is applicable in the cyber-domain. But the report lacks any concrete recommendations concerning its actual application. It merely states that future discussions on the topic will be necessary. Moreover, and resembling the failed UNGGE consensus in 2017, it does not contain references to international humanitarian law, human rights law, and customary law, as well as principles of the UN Charter.\nIn the annex of the Chair`s Summary of the OEWG Final Draft report in 2021, China reiterates its strong conceptual support of national sovereignty and information security, noting that “states should refrain from using ICTs to interfere in internal affairs of other states and undermine their political, economic and social stability.” Moreover, China declared that “states should not exploit their dominant position in ICTs, [...] to undermine other states' right to independent control of ICT goods and services as well as their security,” thereby rejecting the Trump administration`s role ascription as a systemic rival and claiming China's role as an enhancer of prosperity on an international level.\nIn sum, the third phase saw an open confrontation between democratic vs. autocratic dominated state camps at the UN-level, resulting in two parallel institutional tracks for norm evolution. While Russia more actively took over the role of a dissident, the Chinese government chose the more accommodative role as an opponent in the current order. Responding to the forward defense strategy of the US, both Russia and China did not alter their role behavior but rather escalated their cyber-espionage operations. The Trump administration's reaction, to increase public attribution through indictment\nprocedures did not change this trend, rather it has strengthened the Russian (and partially Chinese determination) to openly challenge the US government's hypocrisy and to attack its legitimacy as the hegemon of the current liberal international order.\n## Conclusion\nTo explain the absence of the emergence of cyber-espionage norms we have eschewed the notion that this stems from a lack of hegemonic stability or incompatible preferences of domestic groups in the most powerful states. Instead, our role theoretical argument has been guided by two conceptual premises: the co-constitution of domestic and international roles of governments vis-á-vis internal and external others, and the effects of secrecy on role taking and subsequent norm evolution. Our aim has been to better understand how government's use secrecy to obfuscate role conflicts resulting from internal and external expectations and their bearing on international norm evolution.\nThe sovereignty-role nexus applied here zoomed in the intricate two-level role conflicts emanating from two autocratic powers trying to bolster their domestic and foreign sovereignty in the face of an increasingly pro-active democratic power that seeks to protect its expansive national security concerns through proactive cyber-espionage measures. By acting clandestinely, both proponents of the “Web of the Free” as well as the “Web of Sovereigns” to hide information that does undermine their respective normative claims about their role in the international order: While comprehensive clandestine surveillance programs allow the US government to obfuscate the violation of privacy concerns, both in the US and abroad, through extensive proxy use autocratic governments try to obfuscate the violation of sovereign rights of other (mostly democratic) nations.\nWhen cyber-espionage operations became public over the past two decades, norm evolution started but dissipated soon: After the Snowden revelation, the Obama administration rejected to establish a binding norm, even among allies. In the German case, this resulted in the adaptation of domestic security law which legalized future US-German intelligence cooperation even when German citizen's data privacy is concerned. In the case of the US-China economic espionage agreement, China at first complied with the bilateral norm, but only so long as to avoid painful economic sanction against its tech giants. Since the onset of the US-trade war and open struggle for IT and AI dominance under the Trump administration, there appears to be less incentive on either side for self-restraint.\nMore generally speaking, recent role changes in cyber-espionage behavior by the US, China and Russia appear to result in norm nanism not only because secrecy prevents stable behavioral and discursive expectations over time. As\nthe case of Russian infowar and disinformation campaigns shows, liberal mimickry, using Western concepts superficially and filling them with dissentient content, has become a powerful tool to undermine the legitimacy on which democratic societies rest. However, Ukrainian information operations during the recent war with Russia indicate that even autocratic regimes are not immune against reputational losses, bolstered by the use of information communication technologies, addressing their own population. Furthermore, the leak of internal communication of the cyber crime outlet “Conti” by an alleged Ukrainian researcher is further evidence for the use of typical Russian disinformation tactics, now utilised by its usual victims against Russian-affiliated cyber actors themselves.\nConsistent with the role theoretical literature which asserts that roles bridge the gap between agents and structure, we have shown here that specific sovereignty claims by the US -- political sovereignty may be limited through legitimate cyber-espionage at all times -- and Russia as well as Chinese -- cyber-sovereignty must be asserted both externally and domestically -- have a direct (negative) bearing on norm evolution.\nCompared to more structural approaches toward norm evolution, our role theoretical perspective emphasizes the role of agency and the role conflicts emanating from a diverse set of expectations toward that agency. As such, our perspective should be also able to accommodate norm setting practices by other governmental or non-governmental institutions than the political leadership, e.g. intelligence services. When doing so, it would provide a more nuanced view why intelligence agencies may have some or no incentive to support the evolution of inter-state norms and may opt to establish loose forms of expected behavior -- in what has been called “normalization” -- between intelligence operatives of a few selected states.\nPace what has been portrayed as norm nanism may (only) be the stillbirth of liberal cyber-espionage norms. Liberal cyber-espionage norms rest on the assumption that responsive governments may use secrecy only in a few restricted cases because secrecy undermines public scrutiny and thus official responsibility. It follows that Russian dissidence and China's opposition in combination with the United States' growing appetite for political espionage may well lead to the effective stabilization of illiberal cyber-espionage norms. With the OEWG process on its way to supplant the less inclusive UNGGE group, a majority of governments in the OEWG group may find the Russian and Chinese concept of information sovereignty more appealing. Controlling information helps governments in fending off domestic claims of transparency and participation as well as international encroachments, e.g. by US security and intelligence agencies doxing incriminating informations, against their regime. However, current Russian efforts to implement a new cyber crime convention within the UN may be stalled, due to Russian violation of Ukraine`s sovereignty, as it is perceived by many countries worldwide. In theoretical terms, Russia's\naction in the offline-sphere could hinder its ambitions to fill the role of a widely accepted norm promoter of state sovereignty in cyber-space. At this stage, it remains to be seen what long-term impact Russia`s war against Ukraine will also have on cyber-espionage and its international regulation.\nIn this article, we have not set out to trace how and in what direction domestic roles change over time. In the United States, the new Biden administration has declared that it may strengthen the political leadership in cyber-espionage and interagency procedures as the country faces the fallout of several of the worst cyber-espionage operations in recent US history, but also heavily disruptive ransomware operations. The U.S. Cyber-Space Solarium Commission has also made substantial recommendations as to how the United States may restructure its domestic policy process in order to reduce cyber-vulnerabilities and effectuate rational cyber-governing behavior. We thus suspect that the domestic assertion of leadership vis-á-vis a Republican minority in Congress as well as US international leadership vis-á-vis Russia and China will have lasting, if unintended consequences, for the evolution of cyber-espionage norms. It seems that these norms need more transparency about present and past behavior and less hypocrisy about stated goals in order to grow."

In this article, we contend that governments take on roles vis-à-vis both domestic and foreign audiences, often resulting in conflicts between crosscutting internal and external role expectations. To alleviate these role conflicts, governments use various secret instruments of statecraft that, in turn, shape international norm development. We theorize the nexus between domestic and foreign role play and secrecy, thereby extending the understanding of role taking in international relations to the cyber-space. We argue that whereas the role conceptions of autocratic powers China and Russia have been geared toward cyber-sovereignty of the regime vis-à-vis internal and external others, the United States, as a democratic power, has sought cyber-security for both state and non-state actors in the international realm. Trying to hide some of their cyber-operations, the interaction between China, Russia and the US has resulted in a distinct pattern of cyber-proxy use and state-based surveillance interaction that has facilitated the stabilization of illiberal cyber-espionage norms and the spread of diverging notions of information sovereignty.\n## KEYWORDS\ncyber-espionage; sovereignty; proxies; norms; secrecy\n## Introduction\nThe emergence of international norms in cyber-space are bound up with the ways in which states specify and act upon norms in gestation. The extent scholarship on cyber-norms has recognized the importance of Great Power rivalry, competing political systems, sub-state actors and uncertainty about new technologies as probable causes of norm emergence.¹ So far, however, little work has explored the nexus between the validity and facticity of an emerging norm on cyber-espionage.² And yet, linking discursive specification and (identifiable) practices to the robustness of a norm offers a distinct perspective on the social purchase of an emerging norm, thus providing a broad conception of the co-constitutive effects of agency actions and norms.³\nCONTACT Kerstin Zettl-Schabath  kerstin.zettl@ipw.uni-heidelberg.de  @kerstin_zettl  Institute of Political Science, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany\n© 2022 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC\nIn this article, we develop the concept of a discursive and practice-based norm evolution nexus through a role theoretical lens. In doing so, we examine the potential formation of a cyber-espionage norm by focusing on processes of verbal and practical norm contestation and concealment that may shape, stall and even reverse, the emergence of a norm. The cyber-espionage norm complex is unique since there is not even an uncontested overarching and explicit offline norm baring political or economic espionage. We also suggest that the norm dynamics identified in the field of espionage may spill over into other cyber-norm evolution cases as well, so that the non-emergence of cyber-espionage norms may tell us about norm evolution in the cyber-realm more broadly.\nConstructivist research has explored the social origin norm evolution for a long time, highlighting the co-constitutive nature as “collective expectations for the proper behavior of actors with a given identity”. Conceptually, constructivists do tie an actor's identity to the standards of a given group even if these standards are still in gestation. Since developing and enacting norms do involve discursive action, most notably speech acts and practices, norm contestation may be understood as a social process in which competing norms are expressed and acted upon, but also as social processes in which actors explicitly claim the validity of a norm while challenging the facticity of the norm through adverse action. In particular, actors may challenge whether and how the norm may apply in a given context (applicatory contestation), they may also question the exact meaning of the norm (meaning contestation), and they may challenge the righteousness of the norm (validity contestation), thereby signaling different levels of opposition or dissidence toward the international order constituted by that (and/or other) norm(s).\nThus far, the extent literature on cyber-espionage has focussed on the development of competing normative visions of cyber-security vs. information-security by Great Powers. But little attention has been payed to the question of how far the differences between explicit norm creation, through explicit speech acts, and implicit norm creation, through cyber-practices shapes the very form and direction of cyber-espionage norms. We address this gap by examining the discursive and practice interaction dynamics as revealed in the cyber-espionage norm evolution over the past two decades. To do so, we employ a role theoretical perspective on secrecy, noting that key differences in norm evolution processes result from crosscutting domestic and international expectation pressure to obfuscate the actor's own identity and behavior. We contend that secrecy implies a far greater significance for cyber-espionage in contrast to other forms of potentially impermissible operations in cyber-space: on the one hand, the effectiveness of a cyber-intrusion is (more) dependent upon staying undetected than in the offline world. On the other hand, keeping an intrusion secret may have reputational, financial, political or legal benefits for a victim, too. It follows then that secrecy constitutes a buffer\nfor both perpetrators and victims of cyber-espionage to address role conflicts in the domestic and international realm. In keeping offensive operations secret, both victims and offenders can manipulate their respective information environments, protecting information about their capacities and vulnerabilities as well as their intentions and respective reputation.\nRole theory is particular well suited to address concerns of secretive behavior in international politics. With deep roots in anthropology, social psychology and the philosophical school of American pragmatism, it suggests that roles are interbehavioural phenomena that emerge in social settings between individuals, groups and states, once social interactions result in dense and permanent expectations so that relatively stable patterns of a division of labor among role beholders emerge. In this reading, international roles are „functional positions emanating from ego and alter expectations directed toward a (common) purpose of a group“ as they pertain to states, so that substantial changes in state roles are directly tied to the norms of the international community. It follows that norm contestation, i.e. diverging expectations as to which behavior is appropriate, and role conflict, either interrole conflict -- which role should be pursued by an actor -- or intrarole conflict -- what does the role mean to the actor and significant other actors -- provide for constitutive mechanism as to how and why some norms may or may not develop and in which shape or form they do. Thus far, role theory has been used successfully to explain the emergence and fluctuation of sovereignty norms, but it has not been explored how secretive behavior, role conduct and norm emergence conceptually may fit together.\nIn this article, we argue that role theory advances our understanding of the cyber-espionage norm emergence process in several significant ways: First, role theory priviledges agency properties and actions over structures, i.e. norms, which is especially suitable to social situations in which uncertainty is high (as is the case for cyber-espionage), and institutionalization is low and norms are, if at all, in their infancy. In the cyber-realm, some progress has been made over the past decade to devise a catalog of norms and practices, e.g. the Tallinn Manuals. Here, however, we focus on actual state practice, which either underpins or undermines the verbal claims by governments to comply with extant norms, thereby strengthening the facticity (verbal recognition of norm) and validity (behavioral compliance with the norm). As Bruce Biddle and other role theoreticians have noted: “norms are said to provide merely a set of broad imperatives within which the details of roles can be worked out. Actual roles, then, are thought to reflect norms, attitudes, contextual demands, negotiation, and the evolving definition of the situation as understood by the actors.” Secondly, we contend that great powers which deem themselves as tied in asymmetrical hierarchical power relationships and in situations of high uncertainty, prefer using a combination of “frontstage” public signals to establish themselves as respectable leading members of international society\nwhile also utilizing “backstage” signals, i.e. making use of ‘proxy actors' and or clandestine intelligence operations, to reap the domestic benefits of cyber-espionage while avoiding the reputation costs of questionable operations. Thirdly, role theory does not purport a single and/or fixed national identity or strategic culture to direct cyber-behavior such as other theoretical approaches do. Rather, role theory allows for vertical contestation, i.e. through societal actors and groups, and horizontal contestation, e.g. in government-opposition relations, intra-governing coalition and between governmental bureaucracies. Crosscutting role expectations towards a government on how to behave domestically and/or internationally may then result in “split behavior”: on the frontstage, behavior is directed to preserve a country`s international reputation as a respected member of the international community, most notably, safeguarding its sovereignty and autonomy vis-á-vis more powerful or more determined other states, institutions and non-state actors. However, on the backstage, governments may want to utilize covert actions by proxies or intelligence operatives, to mask international behavior that is deemed inappropriate on the frontstage but which is necessary to meet domestic or intra-governing coalition expectations, i.e. to advance, political, commercial or development interests or to display the superiority of one's own political system. In short, secrecy allows governments to speak with a “split voice” and address the expectations of two, often times diverging, audiences at the same time.\nOur role theoretical treatment of the norm evolution follows established practices in role theoretical research, using both speech acts and physical (non-) acts as representations of discursive and practical role behavior. Specifically, we do not purport that speech acts reflect genuine intentions nor do we claim that our quantitative data set has identified all the cases of (illicit) soft- or hardware infringements. Rather, we would like to stress from our symbolic interactionist (and constitutive) perspective, that the meaning of an action, speech act or otherwise, is revealed or concealed by the reaction or non-reaction of others that imbues or deprives to imbue meaning into an action. In more concrete terms, if a role is taken on, it depends on the taking up of a commensurate role by other actors whether the social group and its purpose of which the original role taking process is a part of, is stabilized. If commensurate roles are not taken up, though, or if respective role taking behavior is concealed, then no stabilization of respective role expectations can occur.\nIn the remainder of the article, we proceed as follows: First, we conceptualize the role theoretical nexus between secrecy and norm emergence. (Secret) role taking behavior may vary along two axes: domestic vs. international role expectations and the political vs. economic role taking. Respective discourses and practices, of course, may and do change over time. The second section presents the role behavior by Russia, China and\nthe United States in three distinct phases, highlighting shifts in rhetorical and practical front- and backstage action (1998-2013, 2014-2016, 2017-2021). To analyze their cyber-espionage conduct, a new cyber-conflict-dataset (HD-CY.CON) is used, indicating distinctive patterns in which governments used different types of secrecy to meet expectations. We conclude with a summary of our findings, demonstrating how secrecy concerns shape role taking behavior which in turn facilitate or hamper cyber-espionage norm formation.\n## The Secrecy-Role-Norm Nexus\nGrounded in symbolic interactionism international roles are constituted through Ego, i.e. domestically generated, and Alter, i.e. international, expectations toward the appropriate behavior of an actor in a group (of states). Sovereignty norms, as foundational rules of the international society, proscribe sovereignty roles to state actors which in turn require recognition of these actors, e.g. states, as “sovereign”. Through recognition as sovereign, sovereign powers are ascribed which may or may not be exerted, e.g. treaty making, joining international institutions etc. It follows that governments strive for recognition as legitimate sovereigns in the international realm as well as domestic realm, providing for various political, i.e. participation, security etc. and economic, i.e. wellbeing, goods to the international and national society.\nWhen doing so, cyber-operations may trigger a focus on one of the resulting role expectation types: First, if a government is challenged by an external actor that threatens its domestic sovereignty, e.g. through a misinformation campaign, the respective government may want to strengthen its domestic sovereignty by reasserting its control over information distribution. However, by restricting information distribution, a government, particularly democratic governments, may disregard societal expectations for freedom of speech, resulting in an adversarial two-level expectation game situation. Second, if the dominant (liberal) sovereignty norms collide with domestic expectations toward the international role of a country, the government has several options: to accept the international order (and respective external role expectations) and to adapt domestic expectations accordingly. Or the government accepts the international order but may want to change the country's role in it, e.g. by joining a new status group. Alternatively, the country may want to change the international order altogether, seeking a new role in a new order, thereby changing the social purpose and or hierarchy in the respective international society. In the latter case, countries (and their governments) become “revisionist powers,” seeking to change the international order and their country's role in it, thereby meeting domestic expectations about the country's purpose and role in the international order.\nThe case of cyber-espionage norms with different sub-specifications offers particular benefits for developing the Secrecy-Role-Norm nexus. Here, we are focussing on the question whether the discursive and practical enactment of sovereignty roles on the two axes include the right to “the non-consensual collection of confidential information that is under the control of another actor”, i.e. espionage. Specifically, we highlight the potential role conflicts resulting from three distinct contexts: First, even in the offline world, espionage norms, particularly their scope, communality and obligation, in war- and peace-time have been contested so that analogical reasoning between the existing international law and the emergence of respective cyber-norms is complicated. Second, in cyber-space undetected intrusion is a necessary condition for any kind of non-consensual access to a network. This is also true in cases of cyber-espionage that are supplemented by more disruptive actions, i.e. so-called “hack-and-leak” operations (or “doxing”), because these operations require secrecy before the disruptive effects become known to the victim and the public, in order to achieve their intended purpose(s). This severely complicates the question whether an intrusion serves intelligence gathering only or more nefarious purposes and whether it constitutes a violation of sovereignty. Third, while sovereignty norms are imbued with notions of equality, autonomous choice and the physical integrity among states, depending on the state's relative material and immaterial position vis-á-vis the majority of the international society, a state's government may feel entitled to exert its freedom of action to the detriment of other states (lesser or stronger powers, threatening or non-threatening states). This establishes a legal ambivalence: the government may accept the ascribed power to act autonomously by others as an equal right for all, but it may also use that same right to infringe upon the sovereign right of others. This is particularly true for cyber-espionage operations where the legal delineations between permissible and impermissible actions vary not only over time, but also depending on the targets and data involved and their subsequent instrumentalization.\nDrawing on recent advances in the study of secrecy, we argue that role conflicts emanating from crosscutting domestic and international expectations toward cyber-security vs. cyber-sovereignty have become so prevalent that they have a direct bearing on the emergence or non-emergence of cyber-espionage norms. In particular, we contend that as long as words and deeds lack publicity in the respective audiences, actors can avoid being held accountable for each of them or inconsistencies between them, thereby being able to act without incurring domestic or international reputational losses, i.e. impunity. It follows that governments may forego stabilizing their behavioral patterns, i.e. roles, by not tying their identifiably role behavior to explicit standards of approriate behavior, i.e. norms. In these cases, covert cyber-operations may be visible to the adversary's government but that this government may withhold information about the operation or its impact too, depending on the domestic and international reputational costs incured when not responding. In order to alleviate the reputational\ncosts domestically and internationally as well as the probability of a punishing counter role taking, i.e. a public or covert counter attack, the attacking government also often uses a proxy, non-state actors used by state actors for covert purposes. It follows that a government of a country under attack may blame a proxy, rather than a responsible government, in order to avoid domestic and/or international reputational costs when not standing up to the attacking government. The attribution through a proxy also allows for more moderate forms of political responses, such as indictments against individual hackers (whose arrest in most cases is more than unlikely), or sanctions against technological front-companies, serving as proxies. These types of actions do not constitute counter-measures under international law, which presuppose the official attribution of respective state agencies and which are regularly more escalatory in nature.\nAs a consequence, we contend that cyber-rivals may tacitly cooperate to steer conflicts to a “backstage”, i.e. conduct cyber-operations clandestinely, to leave an external impression to third parties that their cyber-conflict remains limited and even regulated by tacit if not obligatory rules. From a legal perspective, this “backstage” approach is not necessary as most cyber-norms are still in their infancy. Nevertheless, governments appear to still prefer the “backstage” so as to limit political, reputational and economic costs. Under these circumstances, clandestine role behavior resulting from intra-role conflicts does not lead to further, particularly multilateral norm evolution. Rather, as the adversarial interaction between two partners remains (partially) undetected among them and invisible to third parties, offensive cyber-behavior becomes regularized in a given dyad without becoming to be expected by the larger international society because it is not yet tied to intersubjective roles.\nIn , we illustrate this nexus between a states' verbal role taking and its role behavior by introducing the predominant democratic role conception, the guardian of the “Web of the Free.” We contrast it with the predominant autocratic role conception, the guardian of the “Web of Sovereigns.” In cases of conflicting domestic and international role expectations, we argue, that governments have a (strong) incentive to use different forms of secrecy. In doing so, they can avoid that intra- or inter-role conflicts turn into conflict escalation dynamics on the international level and de-legitimization dynamics on the domestic level.\nMore specifically, if information about a cyber-espionage-operation is revealed which calls a government's public stand into question, the government may react in (at least) two ways: First, it may deny any wrongdoing, rejecting any responsibility or forwarding it to cyber-proxies; second, it may acknowledge espionage operations and shift the narrative post-hoc toward claiming secret operations as legitimate (and less aggressive) expressions of its own role conception. Thus, shielding information from one's own public may be answered by similar behavior of the opponent, as both actor's “share” an interest in controlling conflict escalation dynamics emanating from domestic role expectations.\nDEMOCRACY AND SECURITY\n#\nGraph 1.

In empirical terms, we contend that Russia and China act as what has been called \"frustrated sovereigns\" in cyber-space, i.e. agents that strive for (ever) more recognition of what they themselves claim as a legitimate (autocratic) cyber-sovereignty in a liberal-dominated international cyber-order.\nAs Bettiza and Lewis (2020) have found, these practices regularly include \"liberal performance\", i.e. adopting and reproducing liberal norms in shape and form while turning them against liberal regimes themselves, such as human rights or cyber-incidents or disinformation reports, \"liberal mimicry\", i.e. adopting liberal practices while filling them with dissentient content, such as \"Responsibility-to-Protect\" to legitimize Russian-identity based interventions in the Post-Soviet space; \"civilizational essentialization\", i.e. a practice by which Western norms are presented as an \"other\" vis-à-vis a primordial civilization, and \"counter-norm entrepreneurship,\" a practice to positively promote illiberal norms, ideas and institutions, such as \"cyber\nsovereignty” (see below) and “illiberal good governance”, i.e. controls on internet access, for which even inter-autocratic learning processes seem to emerge.\nIn sum, while sharing some common normative concepts and practices, we contend that Russian and Chinese cyber-espionage discourses and practices display distinct patterns of adversarial role taking or making patterns that have led them to pursue diverging forms of regularized espionage interaction vis-à-vis each other as well as toward the United States. The different types of secrecy matter because the resulting interaction patterns with the United States shape the evolution of either dyadic or multilateral expectation patterns, i.e. dyadic or international cyber-espionage roles.\n## Cyber-espionage norm emergence: secrecy & initial consensus (1998-2013)\nAt the end of the 20^{th} century, cyber-espionage campaigns, such as the alleged Russian Operation Moonlight Maze, indicated that the traditional cold war espionage tactics would be increasingly “going cyber.” To shape the new conflict domain, the Russian Federation launched a proposal for an international treaty for information security in 1998, complemented by a cooperation agreement of the member states of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The initiative indicated Russia's aspiration as a norm entrepreneur of a lex specialis for the cyber-space even before the US and its allies advocated the application of existing international law to cyber-space. From a role theoretical perspective, the Russian government thus took on a new role, making a role in a new setting geared toward a “Web of Sovereigns” rather than taking a role in the existing “Web of the Free.” This new role was tied to the concept of “information security,” which represents efforts by (autoractic) governments to control and censor the flow of information within national intranets, often legitimized by national security concerns. In contrast, democratic governments tend to promote the concept of “cyber security,” which focuses on the effective regulation of malicious cyber-operations rather than restrictions on the access and distribution of information. It follows that these diverging concepts and the respective roles taken to promote them hamper the emergence of common norms in the international community.\nFounded in 2004, the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security (UNGGE) acknowledged the need for an international negotiation forum, in order to sound the pathway of cyber-norm development. The final consensus reports in 2010 and 2013 emphasized the need for a common understanding of acceptable behavior in cyber-space (2010) and the need to strengthen the general applicability of international law in the cyber-realm (2013). Even though Russia and China finally agreed to these\nreports, they also consistently promoted the concepts of “information security” and “cyber-sovereignty”. Both of these concepts stress that the content of the information and the technological handling through soft and hardware need to be protected, thereby ascribing the government the role as a sovereign guardian of a “national information space” which must be protected from nefarious foreign and domestic influences.\nSpecifically, this role conception entails and legitimizes various forms of foreign espionage and domestic surveillance including data collection, storage and analysis to bolster autocratic regime authority. Specific targets are human rights activists, dissidents or ethnic minorities in and outside the national jurisdiction. Whereas domestic surveillances system, such as China's social credit system, are not kept secret to attract or deter commensurate role taking by citizens, foreign surveillance pratices are mostly kept secret to comply with international privacy standards, except for cases of “tainted leaks” when illegally obtained information is leaked to discredit either the source of content of that information, thereby spreading mistrust or disinformation about opponents of an autocratic regime.\nRussia and China also cooperated bilaterally and multilaterally through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and other interstate fora, such as the International Telecommunication Union“ (ITU), to promote the “Web of Sovereigns” as a viable alternative to the US-led multistake-holder based “Web of the Free”.\nApart from this frontstage role behavior as would-be autocratic normmakers, Russia and China started to move to the backstage. Our cyber-conflict data shows for the period from the year 2000 on that Russia's operational pattern focused on political espionage in its regional neighborhood (five out of eleven cases) and vis-á-vis the US (five out of eleven from 2000 to 2013). Secrecy enabled the Russian government to meet nationalist domestic expectations -- putting Russia on par with other Great Powers by conducting political espionage -- while mitigating escalation risks with the highly capable US -- by using proxies for most of its espionage operations (eight out of eleven cyber-espionage cases). Pundits on Russian foreign policy agree that despite disagreements over specific foreign policy goals, Russia's foreign policy elites all advocate “that Russia is, and should remain, a power with global interest and global reach.” Notably, Russian secrecy patterns shifted over time: In early cyber-espionage operations the obfuscation of the perpetrator's identity mixed with clandestine actions, resulting in the absence of signaling intentions by Russia. In later operations, clandestine operations decreased and more open, provocative proxy action with lower deniability increased. We suggest that the motivation for obtaining plausible deniability resulted from the shift in the ambivalent relationship between Russia and the United States at the time: Russian-US relations oscillated clearly between verbal confrontation\n(Putin in 2007 at the Munich Security Conference), de facto cooperation (overflight rights for U.S. forces in the Afghanistan war), and rhetorical truce during the so-called reset phase between 2009 and 2013.\nIn contrast, in this early phase Chinese operational patterns focused on promoting economic growth by the theft of intellectual property through conventional offline and cyber-espionage. The dataset currently records 59 cases of Chinese cyber-espionage with alleged state-involvement between 2003 and 2013. Among the targets attacked, the US stands out with 39 operations. China's operational pattern resembles that of an autocratic developing country: the government allegedly used cyber-proxies in 37 espionage-operations, mostly against technologically superior democracies, such as the US, to leap-frog toward technological superiority while addressing domestic role expectation to further the wellbeing of the Chinese people. In political terms, the Chinese regime shadowed both Russia's bilateral and regional pro-autocratic normentrepeneurship-efforts in the SCO and in- and outside the UNGGE process.\nThe US government started in 2009 to respond to this latter pattern. It communicated a legal position that while cyber-espionage in general was tolerable state behavior if carried out to protect national security was deemed non-permissible if economically motivated, i.e. if the stolen data was handed to corporations to give them a head start over their US competitors. Pace, secrecy about US cyber-espionage and surveillance gained enormous conflict potential in the summer of 2013 when the revelations by Edward Snowden took place. The revelations attested to a massive, global US surveillance network that targeted governments and citizens of allies, rivals and enemies to address US national security concerns broadly defined in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks.\nThe Snowden revelations forced the Obama administration to reconcile its public rhetoric about the “Web of the Free” and the protection of civil liberties with the US' vast secret surveillance programs. It did so by arguing that national security concerns, including those by allied governments and citizens, required the US government to act secretly, thereby evoking conflicting domestic role expectations in democratic societies concerning crosscutting security and liberty concerns.\nInterestingly, instead of addressing the Snowden revelations diplomatically and calling for a multilateral (legal) solution, the Russian government chose to scold the US government of hypocrisy and double standards publicly, thereby mimicring Western concerns about data privacy on the “frontstage” and simultaneously avoiding restrictions on its own “backstage” espionage behavior. In contrast, China's official reaction was circumspect, merely asking the Obama administration to address international concerns squarely. Inofficially, however, the extent and depth of the NSA programs shocked the Chinese government, setting in motion\nan immediate change in (secret) commercial and governmental activities:^{56} Commercially, US IT corporations suffered significant market losses from respective security concerns in China, leading up to a full-blown Chinese-government effort to reduce dependency on US-technology and corporations. Politically, the Chinese government substantially revamped its cyber-security capacities and institutions, establishing both advanced defensive and offensive capacities as well as a host of new governing bodies, institutions and regulations, which as President Xi promised, would make China a “Cyber Superpower.”^{57}\nIn sum, the early phase of cyber-espionage norm development was shaped by verbal confrontations between the two main camps within the UNGGE process with a fragile and partial consensus emerging regarding the applicability of international law in cyber-space. All three states conducted substantial cyber-espionage for either political (US & Russia) or economic (China) reasons. Each government used secrecy extensively to reconcile crosscutting internal and external role expectations. When concealed operations were revealed, government's reactions varied considerably because of domestic and foreign expectations: Addressing domestic and allied concerns for democratic transparency and rule of law, the Obama administration sought to legitimize the secret NSA surveillance programs by pointing at the tradeoff between (substantial) national security gains and (limited) privacy losses. In contrast, autocratic governments in Russia and China stuck to their plausible deniability claims about (non-)use of proxies, thereby addressing domestic expectations about regime security and economic wellbeing while evading international concerns.\nMore specifically, during this period, the US government did not recognize respective espionage-operations as directly threatening to US domestic order: with Russia being altercasted as a regional power in decline, its cyber-espionage activities did not attract much American attention, the “agent.btz” malware use in 2008 being one of the few exceptions.^{58} A similar pattern of US reactions can be detected with regard to Chinese commercial espionage, the Operations Titan Rain and Operation Aurora being the exceptions to the rule.^{59} However, both the Russian and Chinese government reacted strongly to the revelations of the NSA surveillance activities in 2013, substantially revamping their respective cyber-capacities and postures which resulted in a much more asymmetrical and aggressive approach toward the United States.\n## Cyber-espionage norms in turmoil: secrecy & missing normative validity (2014-2016)\nThe second phase of cyber-espionage norm evolution from 2014 to 2016 was crucial. In this period, Russian and Chinese discursive role taking and cyber-espionage operations severely circumscribed US domestic and\ninternational role taking. To begin with, Russia, together with Chinese and Cuban delegations, challenged the notion by the United States and other Western states that International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and the right to self-defense (Art. 51) is applicable in cyber-space, holding on to a strict textual reading in the UNGGE process. In turn, both countries -- together with other SCO member states -- submitted a draft document to the UN Secretary General to facilitate an international consensus on international norms and rules guiding the behavior of states in the information space. The Russian government has presented Russia as a “responsible cyber-power” which has an obligation to mitigate US destructive actions and protect traditional norms, such as sovereignty and institutions, such as the UN Security Council, against the Western notion of a “rules-based international order.” The latter being based on informal institutions, including “private or multistakeholder actors,” and “inclusive and consensus-based deliberation” processes which are detrimental to the interests of most autocracies and illiberal democracies. In the offline domain, Russia also challenged the EU -- through its open intervention in Ukraine -- the United States, Turkey and NATO -- through its interventions in Syria and Libya, thereby rebuffing the Obama administration's ascription as a “regional power.”\nFor the period 2014 to 2016, the dataset lists 30 cyber-espionage operations with attributed Russian state involvement. Notably, seven of them were publicity-seeking information warfare operations, i.e. doxing. Nearly all of these doxing-cases affected western democracies or international institutions, such as WADA, that -- in one way or the other -- had contested Russia's sovereignty conception.\nThe most important Russian information warfare operation was the so-called DNC-Hack, attributed to the APT Fancy Bear, which in turn was directly tied to the military intelligence agency GRU. There is substantial evidence that the DNC-Hack and later disinformation campaigns have been “liberal mimickry operations” by the Russian government, adopting the form of a liberal discourse -- transparency about the nefarious actions of the DNC leadership against Bernie Sanders -- while combining it with non-liberal content, such as data tampering, time sensitive publication or outright disinformation and fake news. As President Putin has argued repeatedly, the Russian government regards publications by Western non-governmental organizations, such as the Soros Foundation or the publication of the so-called Panama Papers, i.e. incriminating reports about corruption in the Russian elite, as US-led information campaigns to topple the Russian government.\nIn our role theoretical perspective, the DNC-hack demonstrates Russia's growing role as a dissident in a liberal and Western-dominated international society, as it -- from a Kremlin perspective -- responds to direct Western\nviolations of its own sovereignty. Viewed this way, secrecy is no longer functional because the Russian government wants the world to know that it has the means and wherewithal to hurt Western states and governments whenever it chooses to do so. Arguably, this is an effect of the Snowden revelations, as the United States government lost its ability to act hypocritically and get away with it.\nThus, from a Russian perspective, doxing operations merely turn the table on Western states, mimicking liberal values, such as free speech and open elections, by superficially complying with liberal norms while filling them with dissentient content. Accordingly, while Russia is closing its own information space to assert its digital sovereignty by quelling domestic dissent, it mouth-feeds dissent in Western liberal society to destabilize their information environment.\nTurning toward the international legal debate on disruptive cyber-espionage operations, UNGGE participants agreed in 2015, that “states should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity that intentionally damages critical infrastructure.” In terms of cyber-espionage, even the probing of foreign critical infrastructures appears to be prohibited under the UNGGE agreement because energy grids or similar entities are no plausible targets of espionage for national security reasons but always suggest a potential disruptive escalation in its aftermath.\nChinese role behavior during the second period also reflects a critical shift regarding sovereignty norms and alter expectations in particular by the US government. Between 2012 (the year, Xi took office) and 2015 (the year of the Obama-Xi-Agreement), cyber-espionage operations against US targets were attributed twenty-three times to Chinese state actors or their proxies. Among them were four operations against political targets, ten against commercial entities and four that targeted both receiver types (amongst others).\nUnder the Obama administration, US-responses to Chinese operations diverged sharply depending on the targets affected: While political espionage was deemed permissive by Washington economic espionage was not, with exceptions in cases of national security concerns. As the then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper stated in 2015 about the OPM-Hack: “you have to kind of salute the Chinese for what they did” and added, that the US ”would have done the same thing if they had the opportunity to do so.”\nIn contrast, the Obama administration grew ever more concerned about Chinese economic cyber-espionage in 2013. In February, the IT-Security Company Mandiant issued a detailed report about a specific Chinese cyber-attack unit in Shanghai (PLA Unit 61398), claiming that this group was responsible for several operations against the US and other Five Eyes member states since 2006. In June 2013, President Obama raised the issue of Chinese\ncyber-operations directly with President Xi, to be followed by official indictments against the PLA officers (May 2014) and an Executive Order (March 2015) which provided the legal groundwork for sanctioning Chinese companies in the run-up to the State visit of President Xi to the US in September 2015. At the summit both sides signed the so-called “U.S. China-Cyber-Agreement”, committing to:^{72} Provide timely responses to requests for information and assistance concerning malicious cyber-activities,refrain from conducting or knowingly supporting cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, pursue efforts to further identify and promote appropriate norms of state behavior in cyber-space within the international community, and establish a high-level joint dialogue mechanism on fighting cyber-crime and related issues.\nParticularly noteworthy is Point 2 of the agreement, a public bilateral commitment to cease permanently economically motivated cyber-espionage. Through this agreement between the most prevalent target of economic espionage and arguably the most notorious perpetrator they sent an important signal to third countries, explicitly distinguishing acceptable from not-acceptable state behavior. Significantly, the PRC government acknowledged for the first time the legitimacy of the prohibition of economic cyber-espionage when stating that “the Chinese government will not, in whatever form, engage in commercial theft or encourage or support such attempts by anyone.”^{73} Moreover, after the first meeting of the new US-Sino cyber-dialogue in December 2015 Xinhua News agency reported that the group had discussed alleged theft of data of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management by Chinese hackers, noting that „through investigation, the case turned out to be a criminal case rather than a state-sponsored cyber attack as the U.S side has previously suspected”, thereby acknowledging that an offensive cyber-operation had occurred from Chinese territory.^{74}\nWhile Chinese compliance with the accord rescinded in 2017, the two governments reaffirmed their commitment to “further solidifying, developing, and maintaining the Dialogue mechanism and continuing to strengthen bilateral cooperation in cybersecurity” in the framework of the third US-China joint dialogue on cyber-crime at the end of 2016.^{75}\nNotably, the US-China agreement also fertilized similar undertakings between China and other democratic countries: a similar agreement was reached between Great Britain and China, but Germany and China have been unable to settle their discord.^{76} However, in November 2015, the G20 followed suit, including Russia, in accepting the norm against conducting or supporting economically motivated cyber-espionage.^{77}\nIn sum, in this phase the Obama administrations propagated an approach to cyber-espionage norms, which rested on an intricate distinction between illegitimate vs. legitimate use of the affected information and not the target type per se. In doing so, the United States tried to legalize its own state practice as permissible and the actions of its adversaries as impermissible.\nThe Obama administration's approach also explicitly extended to more disruptive campaigns: the US put several (if not all) governments on notice, most notably non-nuclear weapon states under the Nonprolifeation Treaty, that it regards their sovereignty in the cyber-realm as permeable when it comes to the national security of the United States. The administration thus altercasted those countries into a hierarchy at the top of which the United States decides what kind of behavior is acceptable or not. When legitimizing unidentified US counter-operations against the malicious North Korean attacks on Sony Pictures in 2014, President Obama thus declared affirmatively: We cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the US”.^{78}\nIn the aftermath of the Snowden revelations, as other countries, such as China, started to make similar arguments, e.g. that China's economic espionage was for a national security purpose and not for economic gains.^{79} It follows that no stabilization of respective expectations between the United States and other great powers occurred, leaving norm evolution stalled during this period.\nThe failure of the UNGGE in 2017 to come up with a consensus report stems from these deep-seated disagreements. The strategic use of secrecy as a tool for prioritizing one's own domestic priorities could no longer conceal the incompatibility of the respective international role conceptions: whereas the United States did not regard other nations as sovereign in the traditional sense when it comes to US national security, Russia and China reciprocated with political and or economic espionage to advance their interpretation of information sovereignty, often by undermining the US' sovereignty as a democratic republic.\n## Cyber-espionage norms and forward action: the strategic neglect of secrecy (2017-2021)\nWith the incoming Trump administration, the US foreign and cyber-security role taking shifted markedly. Most notably, under President Trump the United States started to ascribe rival and/or enemy roles to former allies and foes alike by insisting on a transactionalist agenda, which prioritized one-time interactions over longer-term relationships. By altercasting China as a direct threat to US national security and hegemony, the Trump administration addressed the expanding territorial and economic sovereignty claims by the communist regime and identified them as violations of US-sovereignty. Focussing on bilateral vis-à-vis\nmultilateral negotiations, and favoring relative positioning vis-á-vis other great powers rather than a functional US leadership position in the international community, became the hallmarks of US foreign and security policy. The Trump administration's offensive cyber-strategy also featured some interesting, if illiberal, characteristics. With the so-called “Clean Network Initiative,” which was described by some observers as a “watershed” for the US internet policy, the administration moved closer to an authoritarian approach of protecting national information spaces and thus fragmenting global digital communication networks. In doing so, the United States also moved closer to resemble those democratic “swing-states” that cast their vote issue-dependent within the UN, thereby aligning with the “sovereigntist” vis-à-vis the “liberal sphere” in the internet governance debate.\nThe Trump administration changed tracks in domestic and external cyber-role taking behavior by more assertively applying the concept of “defending forward”: domestically, control and oversight functions in the executive branch and between the administration and Congress were reduced; externally, the United States proactively embedded US espionage malware in foreign infrastructure networks and started to publicly attribute nefarious attacks on US soil more systematically, thereby lifting the veil of secrecy in operational terms. This partial lifting of secrecy, however, may also be identified in the cyber-policies of democracies, e.g. in joint attribution statements in the aftermath of the Microsoft Exchange Hack 2021 or even the growing number of increasingly detailed National Cyber (Security) Strategies.\nThus, for the period of 2017-2021 the dataset and further case-investigations indicate nine US cyber-operations abroad which were directly or indirectly disclosed by US actors (2017-2019: six; 2020: two, 2021: one case). These pro-active signaling efforts were paralleled by a new offensive cyber-strategy, allegedly imposing higher costs on cyber-adversaries permanently to deter future actions. It comes as no surprise then that four of the nine US offensive operations were directed against Russian targets, four against Iran and one against North Korea. All but one of these US-operations allegedly had disruptive effects. When compared to the Obama administration, which had focused its response to the DNC-hack on domestic measures, the Trump administration employed external measures, such as the offensive cyber-operation to block the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll farm, from carrying out a cyber-enabled influence operation against the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. Notably, however, when targeting the Kremlin-associated troll factory instead of attacking Russia's military intelligence agency (GRU) directly, which was ultimately deemed responsible for most of state-based Russia's offensive cyber-operations, the Trump administration deliberately chose a target with less escalation potential. In a similar vein, when a US Global Hawk drone was shot down by Iranian forces in 2019, the\nTrump administration reportedly executed a cyber-response by using malware that had been implanted in Iranian networks before the attack on the U.S. drone.^{87}\nDisruptive US cyber-operations had started in 2013 as a reconnaissance campaign against the Russian electrical grid. However, these earlier operations were expanded in 2017 mounting to the “placement of potentially crippling malware inside the Russian system at a depth and with an aggressiveness that had never been tried before.”^{88} Moreover, through extensive public reporting, the Trump administration reiterated its capacity and willingness to exploit the infiltration of foreign networks for acts of sabotage, thereby reminding potential foes of similar earlier campaigns during peacetime, such as Stuxnet and Operation Nitro Zeus.^{89} Given these circumstances, an absolute ban on any form of cyber-operations against critical infrastructure, such as enshrined in the 2015 UNGGE report, appeared to be illusory.\nNotably, and in contrast to Russia, Chinese targets were absent from the US list for disruptive operations during this period, raising the question whether the communist regimes' cyber-operations did not require any proactive forward defense even though the administration escalated its offline conflicts with Beijing during the same period.\nInterestingly, the dataset also suggests that the intensified defending forward strategy was unsuccessful if not counterproductive: First, while the US expanded its offensive cyber-capacity, the Trump administration did neglect US defenses, thereby presenting Russian and Chinese operations ample reasons and a target-rich US domestic cyber-environment for escalating their offensive cyber-operations. Thus, in the period from 2017 to 2019, our dataset currently records thirteen operations with Chinese, ten operations with Russian, nine with Iranian and six with North Korean state involvement against US targets. Initial estimates for the years 2020 and 2021 do not indicate a decline in these operations. Rather, Chinese cyber-operations against (among others) U.S. targets appear to increase in intensity, as the Microsoft Exchange hack from 2021 suggests. As these numbers only reflect publicly known incidents at this time, they are bound to grow due to delayed detection and attribution processes. Arguably, with the Biden administration still assessing the damages from the SolarWinds, Microsoft Exchange and various other data compromise campaigns directed at US targets and attributed to Russian and Chinese operatives, the full extent of the blowback of the US forward cyber-defense strategy is still to be determined.^{90} And yet, given that the Biden administration has already declared its determination to respond to the SolarWinds operation, a new and more escalatory phase in disruptive operation may be in the making.\nIn diplomatic terms Russia also intensified its role taking as a dissident in the liberal international order: after the failed UNGGE consensus in 2017, the country proposed a resolution to the UN General Assembly (UNGA)\nthat advocated a separate and more inclusive negotiation forum, an Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG), to discuss the “possible measures that could be taken by the international community to strengthen information security at the global level.” In the end, the UNGA voted for the initiation of a new OEWG that established an alternative negotiation track to the sixth UNGGE, but on a similar, shared mandate, both starting in 2019. Andrey Krutskikh, the Special Representative of the President of the Russian Federation for International Cooperation on Information Security, explained Russia's opposition to the UNGGE process: “Russia has come in conflict with the position of certain countries that seek to impose on the whole world their own game rules in the information space, which would only serve their own interests.”\nFrom a role theoretical perspective, the statement ascribes the role of a technologically dominant and hypocritical hegemon to the US, trying to legitimize its own superiority and respective aggressive actions through international law. Amb. Krutskikh also reaffirmed Russia`s position, that the western-favored focus on “humanitarian aspects” in cyber-space is nothing more than an attempt to legitimize its own use of cyber-force.\nThe first OEWG concluded with its Final Draft report in March 2021. The report reaffirmed that international law, and in particular the Charter of the UN, is applicable in the cyber-domain. But the report lacks any concrete recommendations concerning its actual application. It merely states that future discussions on the topic will be necessary. Moreover, and resembling the failed UNGGE consensus in 2017, it does not contain references to international humanitarian law, human rights law, and customary law, as well as principles of the UN Charter.\nIn the annex of the Chair`s Summary of the OEWG Final Draft report in 2021, China reiterates its strong conceptual support of national sovereignty and information security, noting that “states should refrain from using ICTs to interfere in internal affairs of other states and undermine their political, economic and social stability.” Moreover, China declared that “states should not exploit their dominant position in ICTs, [...] to undermine other states' right to independent control of ICT goods and services as well as their security,” thereby rejecting the Trump administration`s role ascription as a systemic rival and claiming China's role as an enhancer of prosperity on an international level.\nIn sum, the third phase saw an open confrontation between democratic vs. autocratic dominated state camps at the UN-level, resulting in two parallel institutional tracks for norm evolution. While Russia more actively took over the role of a dissident, the Chinese government chose the more accommodative role as an opponent in the current order. Responding to the forward defense strategy of the US, both Russia and China did not alter their role behavior but rather escalated their cyber-espionage operations. The Trump administration's reaction, to increase public attribution through indictment\nprocedures did not change this trend, rather it has strengthened the Russian (and partially Chinese determination) to openly challenge the US government's hypocrisy and to attack its legitimacy as the hegemon of the current liberal international order.\n## Conclusion\nTo explain the absence of the emergence of cyber-espionage norms we have eschewed the notion that this stems from a lack of hegemonic stability or incompatible preferences of domestic groups in the most powerful states. Instead, our role theoretical argument has been guided by two conceptual premises: the co-constitution of domestic and international roles of governments vis-á-vis internal and external others, and the effects of secrecy on role taking and subsequent norm evolution. Our aim has been to better understand how government's use secrecy to obfuscate role conflicts resulting from internal and external expectations and their bearing on international norm evolution.\nThe sovereignty-role nexus applied here zoomed in the intricate two-level role conflicts emanating from two autocratic powers trying to bolster their domestic and foreign sovereignty in the face of an increasingly pro-active democratic power that seeks to protect its expansive national security concerns through proactive cyber-espionage measures. By acting clandestinely, both proponents of the “Web of the Free” as well as the “Web of Sovereigns” to hide information that does undermine their respective normative claims about their role in the international order: While comprehensive clandestine surveillance programs allow the US government to obfuscate the violation of privacy concerns, both in the US and abroad, through extensive proxy use autocratic governments try to obfuscate the violation of sovereign rights of other (mostly democratic) nations.\nWhen cyber-espionage operations became public over the past two decades, norm evolution started but dissipated soon: After the Snowden revelation, the Obama administration rejected to establish a binding norm, even among allies. In the German case, this resulted in the adaptation of domestic security law which legalized future US-German intelligence cooperation even when German citizen's data privacy is concerned. In the case of the US-China economic espionage agreement, China at first complied with the bilateral norm, but only so long as to avoid painful economic sanction against its tech giants. Since the onset of the US-trade war and open struggle for IT and AI dominance under the Trump administration, there appears to be less incentive on either side for self-restraint.\nMore generally speaking, recent role changes in cyber-espionage behavior by the US, China and Russia appear to result in norm nanism not only because secrecy prevents stable behavioral and discursive expectations over time. As\nthe case of Russian infowar and disinformation campaigns shows, liberal mimickry, using Western concepts superficially and filling them with dissentient content, has become a powerful tool to undermine the legitimacy on which democratic societies rest. However, Ukrainian information operations during the recent war with Russia indicate that even autocratic regimes are not immune against reputational losses, bolstered by the use of information communication technologies, addressing their own population. Furthermore, the leak of internal communication of the cyber crime outlet “Conti” by an alleged Ukrainian researcher is further evidence for the use of typical Russian disinformation tactics, now utilised by its usual victims against Russian-affiliated cyber actors themselves.\nConsistent with the role theoretical literature which asserts that roles bridge the gap between agents and structure, we have shown here that specific sovereignty claims by the US -- political sovereignty may be limited through legitimate cyber-espionage at all times -- and Russia as well as Chinese -- cyber-sovereignty must be asserted both externally and domestically -- have a direct (negative) bearing on norm evolution.\nCompared to more structural approaches toward norm evolution, our role theoretical perspective emphasizes the role of agency and the role conflicts emanating from a diverse set of expectations toward that agency. As such, our perspective should be also able to accommodate norm setting practices by other governmental or non-governmental institutions than the political leadership, e.g. intelligence services. When doing so, it would provide a more nuanced view why intelligence agencies may have some or no incentive to support the evolution of inter-state norms and may opt to establish loose forms of expected behavior -- in what has been called “normalization” -- between intelligence operatives of a few selected states.\nPace what has been portrayed as norm nanism may (only) be the stillbirth of liberal cyber-espionage norms. Liberal cyber-espionage norms rest on the assumption that responsive governments may use secrecy only in a few restricted cases because secrecy undermines public scrutiny and thus official responsibility. It follows that Russian dissidence and China's opposition in combination with the United States' growing appetite for political espionage may well lead to the effective stabilization of illiberal cyber-espionage norms. With the OEWG process on its way to supplant the less inclusive UNGGE group, a majority of governments in the OEWG group may find the Russian and Chinese concept of information sovereignty more appealing. Controlling information helps governments in fending off domestic claims of transparency and participation as well as international encroachments, e.g. by US security and intelligence agencies doxing incriminating informations, against their regime. However, current Russian efforts to implement a new cyber crime convention within the UN may be stalled, due to Russian violation of Ukraine`s sovereignty, as it is perceived by many countries worldwide. In theoretical terms, Russia's\naction in the offline-sphere could hinder its ambitions to fill the role of a widely accepted norm promoter of state sovereignty in cyber-space. At this stage, it remains to be seen what long-term impact Russia`s war against Ukraine will also have on cyber-espionage and its international regulation.\nIn this article, we have not set out to trace how and in what direction domestic roles change over time. In the United States, the new Biden administration has declared that it may strengthen the political leadership in cyber-espionage and interagency procedures as the country faces the fallout of several of the worst cyber-espionage operations in recent US history, but also heavily disruptive ransomware operations. The U.S. Cyber-Space Solarium Commission has also made substantial recommendations as to how the United States may restructure its domestic policy process in order to reduce cyber-vulnerabilities and effectuate rational cyber-governing behavior. We thus suspect that the domestic assertion of leadership vis-á-vis a Republican minority in Congress as well as US international leadership vis-á-vis Russia and China will have lasting, if unintended consequences, for the evolution of cyber-espionage norms. It seems that these norms need more transparency about present and past behavior and less hypocrisy about stated goals in order to grow."

The US, China and Russia Interaction and the Governance of Cyber-Espionage Sebastian Harnisch and Kerstin Zettl-Schabath Institute of Political Science, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany ## ABSTRACT When and how does state interaction in cyber-space result in norm development? In this article, we contend that governments take on roles vis-à-vis both domestic and foreign audiences, often resulting in conflicts between crosscutting internal and external role expectations. To alleviate these role conflicts, governments use various secret instruments of statecraft that, in turn, shape international norm development. We theorize the nexus between domestic and foreign role play and secrecy, thereby extending the understanding of role taking in international relations to the cyber-space. We argue that whereas the role conceptions of autocratic powers China and Russia have been geared toward cyber-sovereignty of the regime vis-à-vis internal and external others, the United States, as a democratic power, has sought cyber-security for both state and non-state actors in the international realm. Trying to hide some of their cyber-operations, the interaction between China, Russia and the US has resulted in a distinct pattern of cyber-proxy use and state-based surveillance interaction that has facilitated the stabilization of illiberal cyber-espionage norms and the spread of diverging notions of information sovereignty.\n## KEYWORDS cyber-espionage; sovereignty; proxies; norms; secrecy ## Introduction The emergence of international norms in cyber-space are bound up with the ways in which states specify and act upon norms in gestation. The extent scholarship on cyber-norms has recognized the importance of Great Power rivalry, competing political systems, sub-state actors and uncertainty about new technologies as probable causes of norm emergence.¹ So far, however, little work has explored the nexus between the validity and facticity of an emerging norm on cyber-espionage.² And yet, linking discursive specification and (identifiable) practices to the robustness of a norm offers a distinct perspective on the social purchase of an emerging norm, thus providing a broad conception of the co-constitutive effects of agency actions and norms.³ CONTACT Kerstin Zettl-Schabath kerstin.zettl@ipw.uni-heidelberg.de @kerstin_zettl Institute of Political Science, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany © 2022 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC In this article, we develop the concept of a discursive and practice-based norm evolution nexus through a role theoretical lens. In doing so, we examine the potential formation of a cyber-espionage norm by focusing on processes of verbal and practical norm contestation and concealment that may shape, stall and even reverse, the emergence of a norm. The cyber-espionage norm complex is unique since there is not even an uncontested overarching and explicit offline norm baring political or economic espionage. We also suggest that the norm dynamics identified in the field of espionage may spill over into other cyber-norm evolution cases as well, so that the non-emergence of cyber-espionage norms may tell us about norm evolution in the cyber-realm more broadly.\nConstructivist research has explored the social origin norm evolution for a long time, highlighting the co-constitutive nature as “collective expectations for the proper behavior of actors with a given identity”. Conceptually, constructivists do tie an actor's identity to the standards of a given group even if these standards are still in gestation. Since developing and enacting norms do involve discursive action, most notably speech acts and practices, norm contestation may be understood as a social process in which competing norms are expressed and acted upon, but also as social processes in which actors explicitly claim the validity of a norm while challenging the facticity of the norm through adverse action. In particular, actors may challenge whether and how the norm may apply in a given context (applicatory contestation), they may also question the exact meaning of the norm (meaning contestation), and they may challenge the righteousness of the norm (validity contestation), thereby signaling different levels of opposition or dissidence toward the international order constituted by that (and/or other) norm(s).\nThus far, the extent literature on cyber-espionage has focussed on the development of competing normative visions of cyber-security vs. information-security by Great Powers. But little attention has been payed to the question of how far the differences between explicit norm creation, through explicit speech acts, and implicit norm creation, through cyber-practices shapes the very form and direction of cyber-espionage norms. We address this gap by examining the discursive and practice interaction dynamics as revealed in the cyber-espionage norm evolution over the past two decades. To do so, we employ a role theoretical perspective on secrecy, noting that key differences in norm evolution processes result from crosscutting domestic and international expectation pressure to obfuscate the actor's own identity and behavior. We contend that secrecy implies a far greater significance for cyber-espionage in contrast to other forms of potentially impermissible operations in cyber-space: on the one hand, the effectiveness of a cyber-intrusion is (more) dependent upon staying undetected than in the offline world. On the other hand, keeping an intrusion secret may have reputational, financial, political or legal benefits for a victim, too. It follows then that secrecy constitutes a buffer for both perpetrators and victims of cyber-espionage to address role conflicts in the domestic and international realm. In keeping offensive operations secret, both victims and offenders can manipulate their respective information environments, protecting information about their capacities and vulnerabilities as well as their intentions and respective reputation.\nRole theory is particular well suited to address concerns of secretive behavior in international politics. With deep roots in anthropology, social psychology and the philosophical school of American pragmatism, it suggests that roles are interbehavioural phenomena that emerge in social settings between individuals, groups and states, once social interactions result in dense and permanent expectations so that relatively stable patterns of a division of labor among role beholders emerge. In this reading, international roles are „functional positions emanating from ego and alter expectations directed toward a (common) purpose of a group “as they pertain to states, so that substantial changes in state roles are directly tied to the norms of the international community. It follows that norm contestation, i.e. diverging expectations as to which behavior is appropriate, and role conflict, either interrole conflict -- which role should be pursued by an actor -- or intrarole conflict -- what does the role mean to the actor and significant other actors -- provide for constitutive mechanism as to how and why some norms may or may not develop and in which shape or form they do. Thus far, role theory has been used successfully to explain the emergence and fluctuation of sovereignty norms, but it has not been explored how secretive behavior, role conduct and norm emergence conceptually may fit together.\nIn this article, we argue that role theory advances our understanding of the cyber-espionage norm emergence process in several significant ways: First, role theory priviledges agency properties and actions over structures, i.e. norms, which is especially suitable to social situations in which uncertainty is high (as is the case for cyber-espionage), and institutionalization is low and norms are, if at all, in their infancy. In the cyber-realm, some progress has been made over the past decade to devise a catalog of norms and practices, e.g. the Tallinn Manuals. Here, however, we focus on actual state practice, which either underpins or undermines the verbal claims by governments to comply with extant norms, thereby strengthening the facticity (verbal recognition of norm) and validity (behavioral compliance with the norm). As Bruce Biddle and other role theoreticians have noted: “norms are said to provide merely a set of broad imperatives within which the details of roles can be worked out. Actual roles, then, are thought to reflect norms, attitudes, contextual demands, negotiation, and the evolving definition of the situation as understood by the actors.” Secondly, we contend that great powers which deem themselves as tied in asymmetrical hierarchical power relationships and in situations of high uncertainty, prefer using a combination of “frontstage” public signals to establish themselves as respectable leading members of international society while also utilizing “backstage” signals, i.e. making use of ‘proxy actors' and or clandestine intelligence operations, to reap the domestic benefits of cyber-espionage while avoiding the reputation costs of questionable operations. Thirdly, role theory does not purport a single and/or fixed national identity or strategic culture to direct cyber-behavior such as other theoretical approaches do. Rather, role theory allows for vertical contestation, i.e. through societal actors and groups, and horizontal contestation, e.g. in government-opposition relations, intra-governing coalition and between governmental bureaucracies. Crosscutting role expectations towards a government on how to behave domestically and/or internationally may then result in “split behavior”: on the frontstage, behavior is directed to preserve a country`s international reputation as a respected member of the international community, most notably, safeguarding its sovereignty and autonomy vis-á-vis more powerful or more determined other states, institutions and non-state actors. However, on the backstage, governments may want to utilize covert actions by proxies or intelligence operatives, to mask international behavior that is deemed inappropriate on the frontstage but which is necessary to meet domestic or intra-governing coalition expectations, i.e. to advance, political, commercial or development interests or to display the superiority of one's own political system. In short, secrecy allows governments to speak with a “split voice” and address the expectations of two, often times diverging, audiences at the same time.\nOur role theoretical treatment of the norm evolution follows established practices in role theoretical research, using both speech acts and physical (non-) acts as representations of discursive and practical role behavior. Specifically, we do not purport that speech acts reflect genuine intentions nor do we claim that our quantitative data set has identified all the cases of (illicit) soft- or hardware infringements. Rather, we would like to stress from our symbolic interactionist (and constitutive) perspective, that the meaning of an action, speech act or otherwise, is revealed or concealed by the reaction or non-reaction of others that imbues or deprives to imbue meaning into an action. In more concrete terms, if a role is taken on, it depends on the taking up of a commensurate role by other actors whether the social group and its purpose of which the original role taking process is a part of, is stabilized. If commensurate roles are not taken up, though, or if respective role taking behavior is concealed, then no stabilization of respective role expectations can occur.\nIn the remainder of the article, we proceed as follows: First, we conceptualize the role theoretical nexus between secrecy and norm emergence. (Secret) role taking behavior may vary along two axes: domestic vs. international role expectations and the political vs. economic role taking. Respective discourses and practices, of course, may and do change over time. The second section presents the role behavior by Russia, China and the United States in three distinct phases, highlighting shifts in rhetorical and practical front- and backstage action (1998-2013, 2014-2016, 2017-2021). To analyze their cyber-espionage conduct, a new cyber-conflict-dataset (HD-CY.CON) is used, indicating distinctive patterns in which governments used different types of secrecy to meet expectations. We conclude with a summary of our findings, demonstrating how secrecy concerns shape role taking behavior which in turn facilitate or hamper cyber-espionage norm formation.\n## The Secrecy-Role-Norm Nexus Grounded in symbolic interactionism international roles are constituted through Ego, i.e. domestically generated, and Alter, i.e. international, expectations toward the appropriate behavior of an actor in a group (of states). Sovereignty norms, as foundational rules of the international society, proscribe sovereignty roles to state actors which in turn require recognition of these actors, e.g. states, as “sovereign”. Through recognition as sovereign, sovereign powers are ascribed which may or may not be exerted, e.g. treaty making, joining international institutions etc. It follows that governments strive for recognition as legitimate sovereigns in the international realm as well as domestic realm, providing for various political, i.e. participation, security etc. and economic, i.e. wellbeing, goods to the international and national society.\nWhen doing so, cyber-operations may trigger a focus on one of the resulting role expectation types: First, if a government is challenged by an external actor that threatens its domestic sovereignty, e.g. through a misinformation campaign, the respective government may want to strengthen its domestic sovereignty by reasserting its control over information distribution. However, by restricting information distribution, a government, particularly democratic governments, may disregard societal expectations for freedom of speech, resulting in an adversarial two-level expectation game situation. Second, if the dominant (liberal) sovereignty norms collide with domestic expectations toward the international role of a country, the government has several options: to accept the international order (and respective external role expectations) and to adapt domestic expectations accordingly. Or the government accepts the international order but may want to change the country's role in it, e.g. by joining a new status group. Alternatively, the country may want to change the international order altogether, seeking a new role in a new order, thereby changing the social purpose and or hierarchy in the respective international society. In the latter case, countries (and their governments) become “revisionist powers,” seeking to change the international order and their country's role in it, thereby meeting domestic expectations about the country's purpose and role in the international order.\nThe case of cyber-espionage norms with different sub-specifications offers particular benefits for developing the Secrecy-Role-Norm nexus. Here, we are focussing on the question whether the discursive and practical enactment of sovereignty roles on the two axes include the right to “the non-consensual collection of confidential information that is under the control of another actor”, i.e. espionage. Specifically, we highlight the potential role conflicts resulting from three distinct contexts: First, even in the offline world, espionage norms, particularly their scope, communality and obligation, in war- and peace-time have been contested so that analogical reasoning between the existing international law and the emergence of respective cyber-norms is complicated. Second, in cyber-space undetected intrusion is a necessary condition for any kind of non-consensual access to a network. This is also true in cases of cyber-espionage that are supplemented by more disruptive actions, i.e. so-called “hack-and-leak” operations (or “doxing”), because these operations require secrecy before the disruptive effects become known to the victim and the public, in order to achieve their intended purpose(s). This severely complicates the question whether an intrusion serves intelligence gathering only or more nefarious purposes and whether it constitutes a violation of sovereignty. Third, while sovereignty norms are imbued with notions of equality, autonomous choice and the physical integrity among states, depending on the state's relative material and immaterial position vis-á-vis the majority of the international society, a state's government may feel entitled to exert its freedom of action to the detriment of other states (lesser or stronger powers, threatening or non-threatening states). This establishes a legal ambivalence: the government may accept the ascribed power to act autonomously by others as an equal right for all, but it may also use that same right to infringe upon the sovereign right of others. This is particularly true for cyber-espionage operations where the legal delineations between permissible and impermissible actions vary not only over time, but also depending on the targets and data involved and their subsequent instrumentalization.\nDrawing on recent advances in the study of secrecy, we argue that role conflicts emanating from crosscutting domestic and international expectations toward cyber-security vs. cyber-sovereignty have become so prevalent that they have a direct bearing on the emergence or non-emergence of cyber-espionage norms. In particular, we contend that as long as words and deeds lack publicity in the respective audiences, actors can avoid being held accountable for each of them or inconsistencies between them, thereby being able to act without incurring domestic or international reputational losses, i.e. impunity. It follows that governments may forego stabilizing their behavioral patterns, i.e. roles, by not tying their identifiably role behavior to explicit standards of approriate behavior, i.e. norms. In these cases, covert cyber-operations may be visible to the adversary's government but that this government may withhold information about the operation or its impact too, depending on the domestic and international reputational costs incured when not responding. In order to alleviate the reputational costs domestically and internationally as well as the probability of a punishing counter role taking, i.e. a public or covert counter attack, the attacking government also often uses a proxy, non-state actors used by state actors for covert purposes. It follows that a government of a country under attack may blame a proxy, rather than a responsible government, in order to avoid domestic and/or international reputational costs when not standing up to the attacking government. The attribution through a proxy also allows for more moderate forms of political responses, such as indictments against individual hackers (whose arrest in most cases is more than unlikely), or sanctions against technological front-companies, serving as proxies. These types of actions do not constitute counter-measures under international law, which presuppose the official attribution of respective state agencies and which are regularly more escalatory in nature.\nAs a consequence, we contend that cyber-rivals may tacitly cooperate to steer conflicts to a “backstage”, i.e. conduct cyber-operations clandestinely, to leave an external impression to third parties that their cyber-conflict remains limited and even regulated by tacit if not obligatory rules. From a legal perspective, this “backstage” approach is not necessary as most cyber-norms are still in their infancy. Nevertheless, governments appear to still prefer the “backstage” so as to limit political, reputational and economic costs. Under these circumstances, clandestine role behavior resulting from intra-role conflicts does not lead to further, particularly multilateral norm evolution. Rather, as the adversarial interaction between two partners remains (partially) undetected among them and invisible to third parties, offensive cyber-behavior becomes regularized in a given dyad without becoming to be expected by the larger international society because it is not yet tied to intersubjective roles.\nIn, we illustrate this nexus between a states' verbal role taking and its role behavior by introducing the predominant democratic role conception, the guardian of the “Web of the Free.” We contrast it with the predominant autocratic role conception, the guardian of the “Web of Sovereigns.” In cases of conflicting domestic and international role expectations, we argue, that governments have a (strong) incentive to use different forms of secrecy. In doing so, they can avoid that intra- or inter-role conflicts turn into conflict escalation dynamics on the international level and de-legitimization dynamics on the domestic level.\nMore specifically, if information about a cyber-espionage-operation is revealed which calls a government's public stand into question, the government may react in (at least) two ways: First, it may deny any wrongdoing, rejecting any responsibility or forwarding it to cyber-proxies; second, it may acknowledge espionage operations and shift the narrative post-hoc toward claiming secret operations as legitimate (and less aggressive) expressions of its own role conception. Thus, shielding information from one's own public may be answered by similar behavior of the opponent, as both actor's “share” an interest in controlling conflict escalation dynamics emanating from domestic role expectations.\nDEMOCRACY AND SECURITY # Graph 1.

In empirical terms, we contend that Russia and China act as what has been called\"frustrated sovereigns\"in cyber-space,[38] i.e. agents that strive for (ever) more recognition of what they themselves claim as a legitimate (autocratic) cyber-sovereignty in a liberal-dominated international cyber-order.[39] As Bettiza and Lewis (2020) have found, these practices regularly include\"liberal performance\", i.e. adopting and reproducing liberal norms in shape and form while turning them against liberal regimes themselves, such as human rights or cyber-incidents or disinformation reports,\"liberal mimicry\", i.e. adopting liberal practices while filling them with dissentient content, such as\"Responsibility-to-Protect\"to legitimize Russian-identity based interventions in the Post-Soviet space;\"civilizational essentialization\", i.e. a practice by which Western norms are presented as an\"other\"vis-à-vis a primordial civilization, and\"counter-norm entrepreneurship,\"a practice to positively promote illiberal norms, ideas and institutions, such as\"cyber sovereignty” (see below) and “illiberal good governance”, i.e. controls on internet access, for which even inter-autocratic learning processes seem to emerge.\nIn sum, while sharing some common normative concepts and practices, we contend that Russian and Chinese cyber-espionage discourses and practices display distinct patterns of adversarial role taking or making patterns that have led them to pursue diverging forms of regularized espionage interaction vis-à-vis each other as well as toward the United States. The different types of secrecy matter because the resulting interaction patterns with the United States shape the evolution of either dyadic or multilateral expectation patterns, i.e. dyadic or international cyber-espionage roles.\n## Cyber-espionage norm emergence: secrecy & initial consensus (1998-2013) At the end of the 20^{th} century, cyber-espionage campaigns, such as the alleged Russian Operation Moonlight Maze, indicated that the traditional cold war espionage tactics would be increasingly “going cyber.” To shape the new conflict domain, the Russian Federation launched a proposal for an international treaty for information security in 1998, complemented by a cooperation agreement of the member states of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The initiative indicated Russia's aspiration as a norm entrepreneur of a lex specialis for the cyber-space even before the US and its allies advocated the application of existing international law to cyber-space. From a role theoretical perspective, the Russian government thus took on a new role, making a role in a new setting geared toward a “Web of Sovereigns” rather than taking a role in the existing “Web of the Free.” This new role was tied to the concept of “information security,” which represents efforts by (autoractic) governments to control and censor the flow of information within national intranets, often legitimized by national security concerns. In contrast, democratic governments tend to promote the concept of “cyber security,” which focuses on the effective regulation of malicious cyber-operations rather than restrictions on the access and distribution of information. It follows that these diverging concepts and the respective roles taken to promote them hamper the emergence of common norms in the international community.\nFounded in 2004, the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security (UNGGE) acknowledged the need for an international negotiation forum, in order to sound the pathway of cyber-norm development. The final consensus reports in 2010 and 2013 emphasized the need for a common understanding of acceptable behavior in cyber-space (2010) and the need to strengthen the general applicability of international law in the cyber-realm (2013). Even though Russia and China finally agreed to these reports, they also consistently promoted the concepts of “information security” and “cyber-sovereignty”. Both of these concepts stress that the content of the information and the technological handling through soft and hardware need to be protected, thereby ascribing the government the role as a sovereign guardian of a “national information space” which must be protected from nefarious foreign and domestic influences.\nSpecifically, this role conception entails and legitimizes various forms of foreign espionage and domestic surveillance including data collection, storage and analysis to bolster autocratic regime authority. Specific targets are human rights activists, dissidents or ethnic minorities in and outside the national jurisdiction. Whereas domestic surveillances system, such as China's social credit system, are not kept secret to attract or deter commensurate role taking by citizens, foreign surveillance pratices are mostly kept secret to comply with international privacy standards, except for cases of “tainted leaks” when illegally obtained information is leaked to discredit either the source of content of that information, thereby spreading mistrust or disinformation about opponents of an autocratic regime.\nRussia and China also cooperated bilaterally and multilaterally through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and other interstate fora, such as the International Telecommunication Union “(ITU), to promote the “Web of Sovereigns” as a viable alternative to the US-led multistake-holder based “Web of the Free”.\nApart from this frontstage role behavior as would-be autocratic normmakers, Russia and China started to move to the backstage. Our cyber-conflict data shows for the period from the year 2000 on that Russia's operational pattern focused on political espionage in its regional neighborhood (five out of eleven cases) and vis-á-vis the US (five out of eleven from 2000 to 2013). Secrecy enabled the Russian government to meet nationalist domestic expectations -- putting Russia on par with other Great Powers by conducting political espionage -- while mitigating escalation risks with the highly capable US -- by using proxies for most of its espionage operations (eight out of eleven cyber-espionage cases). Pundits on Russian foreign policy agree that despite disagreements over specific foreign policy goals, Russia's foreign policy elites all advocate “that Russia is, and should remain, a power with global interest and global reach.” Notably, Russian secrecy patterns shifted over time: In early cyber-espionage operations the obfuscation of the perpetrator's identity mixed with clandestine actions, resulting in the absence of signaling intentions by Russia. In later operations, clandestine operations decreased and more open, provocative proxy action with lower deniability increased. We suggest that the motivation for obtaining plausible deniability resulted from the shift in the ambivalent relationship between Russia and the United States at the time: Russian-US relations oscillated clearly between verbal confrontation (Putin in 2007 at the Munich Security Conference), de facto cooperation (overflight rights for U.S. forces in the Afghanistan war), and rhetorical truce during the so-called reset phase between 2009 and 2013.\nIn contrast, in this early phase Chinese operational patterns focused on promoting economic growth by the theft of intellectual property through conventional offline and cyber-espionage. The dataset currently records 59 cases of Chinese cyber-espionage with alleged state-involvement between 2003 and 2013. Among the targets attacked, the US stands out with 39 operations. China's operational pattern resembles that of an autocratic developing country: the government allegedly used cyber-proxies in 37 espionage-operations, mostly against technologically superior democracies, such as the US, to leap-frog toward technological superiority while addressing domestic role expectation to further the wellbeing of the Chinese people. In political terms, the Chinese regime shadowed both Russia's bilateral and regional pro-autocratic normentrepeneurship-efforts in the SCO and in- and outside the UNGGE process.\nThe US government started in 2009 to respond to this latter pattern. It communicated a legal position that while cyber-espionage in general was tolerable state behavior if carried out to protect national security was deemed non-permissible if economically motivated, i.e. if the stolen data was handed to corporations to give them a head start over their US competitors. Pace, secrecy about US cyber-espionage and surveillance gained enormous conflict potential in the summer of 2013 when the revelations by Edward Snowden took place. The revelations attested to a massive, global US surveillance network that targeted governments and citizens of allies, rivals and enemies to address US national security concerns broadly defined in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks.\nThe Snowden revelations forced the Obama administration to reconcile its public rhetoric about the “Web of the Free” and the protection of civil liberties with the US' vast secret surveillance programs. It did so by arguing that national security concerns, including those by allied governments and citizens, required the US government to act secretly, thereby evoking conflicting domestic role expectations in democratic societies concerning crosscutting security and liberty concerns.\nInterestingly, instead of addressing the Snowden revelations diplomatically and calling for a multilateral (legal) solution, the Russian government chose to scold the US government of hypocrisy and double standards publicly, thereby mimicring Western concerns about data privacy on the “frontstage” and simultaneously avoiding restrictions on its own “backstage” espionage behavior. In contrast, China's official reaction was circumspect, merely asking the Obama administration to address international concerns squarely. Inofficially, however, the extent and depth of the NSA programs shocked the Chinese government, setting in motion an immediate change in (secret) commercial and governmental activities: Commercially, US IT corporations suffered significant market losses from respective security concerns in China, leading up to a full-blown Chinese-government effort to reduce dependency on US-technology and corporations. Politically, the Chinese government substantially revamped its cyber-security capacities and institutions, establishing both advanced defensive and offensive capacities as well as a host of new governing bodies, institutions and regulations, which as President Xi promised, would make China a “Cyber Superpower.”\nIn sum, the early phase of cyber-espionage norm development was shaped by verbal confrontations between the two main camps within the UNGGE process with a fragile and partial consensus emerging regarding the applicability of international law in cyber-space. All three states conducted substantial cyber-espionage for either political (US & Russia) or economic (China) reasons. Each government used secrecy extensively to reconcile crosscutting internal and external role expectations. When concealed operations were revealed, government's reactions varied considerably because of domestic and foreign expectations: Addressing domestic and allied concerns for democratic transparency and rule of law, the Obama administration sought to legitimize the secret NSA surveillance programs by pointing at the tradeoff between (substantial) national security gains and (limited) privacy losses. In contrast, autocratic governments in Russia and China stuck to their plausible deniability claims about (non-)use of proxies, thereby addressing domestic expectations about regime security and economic wellbeing while evading international concerns.\nMore specifically, during this period, the US government did not recognize respective espionage-operations as directly threatening to US domestic order: with Russia being altercasted as a regional power in decline, its cyber-espionage activities did not attract much American attention, the “agent.btz” malware use in 2008 being one of the few exceptions. A similar pattern of US reactions can be detected with regard to Chinese commercial espionage, the Operations Titan Rain and Operation Aurora being the exceptions to the rule. However, both the Russian and Chinese government reacted strongly to the revelations of the NSA surveillance activities in 2013, substantially revamping their respective cyber-capacities and postures which resulted in a much more asymmetrical and aggressive approach toward the United States.\n## Cyber-espionage norms in turmoil: secrecy & missing normative validity (2014-2016) The second phase of cyber-espionage norm evolution from 2014 to 2016 was crucial. In this period, Russian and Chinese discursive role taking and cyber-espionage operations severely circumscribed US domestic and international role taking. To begin with, Russia, together with Chinese and Cuban delegations, challenged the notion by the United States and other Western states that International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and the right to self-defense (Art. 51) is applicable in cyber-space, holding on to a strict textual reading in the UNGGE process. In turn, both countries -- together with other SCO member states -- submitted a draft document to the UN Secretary General to facilitate an international consensus on international norms and rules guiding the behavior of states in the information space. The Russian government has presented Russia as a “responsible cyber-power” which has an obligation to mitigate US destructive actions and protect traditional norms, such as sovereignty and institutions, such as the UN Security Council, against the Western notion of a “rules-based international order.” The latter being based on informal institutions, including “private or multistakeholder actors,” and “inclusive and consensus-based deliberation” processes which are detrimental to the interests of most autocracies and illiberal democracies. In the offline domain, Russia also challenged the EU -- through its open intervention in Ukraine -- the United States, Turkey and NATO -- through its interventions in Syria and Libya, thereby rebuffing the Obama administration's ascription as a “regional power.”\nFor the period 2014 to 2016, the dataset lists 30 cyber-espionage operations with attributed Russian state involvement. Notably, seven of them were publicity-seeking information warfare operations, i.e. doxing. Nearly all of these doxing-cases affected western democracies or international institutions, such as WADA, that -- in one way or the other -- had contested Russia's sovereignty conception.\nThe most important Russian information warfare operation was the so-called DNC-Hack, attributed to the APT Fancy Bear, which in turn was directly tied to the military intelligence agency GRU. There is substantial evidence that the DNC-Hack and later disinformation campaigns have been “liberal mimickry operations” by the Russian government, adopting the form of a liberal discourse -- transparency about the nefarious actions of the DNC leadership against Bernie Sanders -- while combining it with non-liberal content, such as data tampering, time sensitive publication or outright disinformation and fake news. As President Putin has argued repeatedly, the Russian government regards publications by Western non-governmental organizations, such as the Soros Foundation or the publication of the so-called Panama Papers, i.e. incriminating reports about corruption in the Russian elite, as US-led information campaigns to topple the Russian government.\nIn our role theoretical perspective, the DNC-hack demonstrates Russia's growing role as a dissident in a liberal and Western-dominated international society, as it -- from a Kremlin perspective -- responds to direct Western violations of its own sovereignty. Viewed this way, secrecy is no longer functional because the Russian government wants the world to know that it has the means and wherewithal to hurt Western states and governments whenever it chooses to do so. Arguably, this is an effect of the Snowden revelations, as the United States government lost its ability to act hypocritically and get away with it.\nThus, from a Russian perspective, doxing operations merely turn the table on Western states, mimicking liberal values, such as free speech and open elections, by superficially complying with liberal norms while filling them with dissentient content. Accordingly, while Russia is closing its own information space to assert its digital sovereignty by quelling domestic dissent, it mouth-feeds dissent in Western liberal society to destabilize their information environment.\nTurning toward the international legal debate on disruptive cyber-espionage operations, UNGGE participants agreed in 2015, that “states should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity that intentionally damages critical infrastructure.” In terms of cyber-espionage, even the probing of foreign critical infrastructures appears to be prohibited under the UNGGE agreement because energy grids or similar entities are no plausible targets of espionage for national security reasons but always suggest a potential disruptive escalation in its aftermath.\nChinese role behavior during the second period also reflects a critical shift regarding sovereignty norms and alter expectations in particular by the US government. Between 2012 (the year, Xi took office) and 2015 (the year of the Obama-Xi-Agreement), cyber-espionage operations against US targets were attributed twenty-three times to Chinese state actors or their proxies. Among them were four operations against political targets, ten against commercial entities and four that targeted both receiver types (amongst others).\nUnder the Obama administration, US-responses to Chinese operations diverged sharply depending on the targets affected: While political espionage was deemed permissive by Washington economic espionage was not, with exceptions in cases of national security concerns. As the then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper stated in 2015 about the OPM-Hack: “you have to kind of salute the Chinese for what they did” and added, that the US”would have done the same thing if they had the opportunity to do so.”\nIn contrast, the Obama administration grew ever more concerned about Chinese economic cyber-espionage in 2013. In February, the IT-Security Company Mandiant issued a detailed report about a specific Chinese cyber-attack unit in Shanghai (PLA Unit 61398), claiming that this group was responsible for several operations against the US and other Five Eyes member states since 2006. In June 2013, President Obama raised the issue of Chinese cyber-operations directly with President Xi, to be followed by official indictments against the PLA officers and an Executive Order which provided the legal groundwork for sanctioning Chinese companies in the run-up to the State visit of President Xi to the US in September 2015. At the summit both sides signed the so-called “U.S. China-Cyber-Agreement”, committing to: Provide timely responses to requests for information and assistance concerning malicious cyber-activities,refrain from conducting or knowingly supporting cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, pursue efforts to further identify and promote appropriate norms of state behavior in cyber-space within the international community, and establish a high-level joint dialogue mechanism on fighting cyber-crime and related issues.\nParticularly noteworthy is Point 2 of the agreement, a public bilateral commitment to cease permanently economically motivated cyber-espionage. Through this agreement between the most prevalent target of economic espionage and arguably the most notorious perpetrator they sent an important signal to third countries, explicitly distinguishing acceptable from not-acceptable state behavior. Significantly, the PRC government acknowledged for the first time the legitimacy of the prohibition of economic cyber-espionage when stating that “the Chinese government will not, in whatever form, engage in commercial theft or encourage or support such attempts by anyone.” Moreover, after the first meeting of the new US-Sino cyber-dialogue in December 2015 Xinhua News agency reported that the group had discussed alleged theft of data of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management by Chinese hackers, noting that „through investigation, the case turned out to be a criminal case rather than a state-sponsored cyber attack as the U.S side has previously suspected”, thereby acknowledging that an offensive cyber-operation had occurred from Chinese territory.\nWhile Chinese compliance with the accord rescinded in 2017, the two governments reaffirmed their commitment to “further solidifying, developing, and maintaining the Dialogue mechanism and continuing to strengthen bilateral cooperation in cybersecurity” in the framework of the third US-China joint dialogue on cyber-crime at the end of 2016.\nNotably, the US-China agreement also fertilized similar undertakings between China and other democratic countries: a similar agreement was reached between Great Britain and China, but Germany and China have been unable to settle their discord. However, in November 2015, the G20 followed suit, including Russia, in accepting the norm against conducting or supporting economically motivated cyber-espionage.\nIn sum, in this phase the Obama administrations propagated an approach to cyber-espionage norms, which rested on an intricate distinction between illegitimate vs. legitimate use of the affected information and not the target type per se. In doing so, the United States tried to legalize its own state practice as permissible and the actions of its adversaries as impermissible.\nThe Obama administration's approach also explicitly extended to more disruptive campaigns: the US put several (if not all) governments on notice, most notably non-nuclear weapon states under the Nonprolifeation Treaty, that it regards their sovereignty in the cyber-realm as permeable when it comes to the national security of the United States. The administration thus altercasted those countries into a hierarchy at the top of which the United States decides what kind of behavior is acceptable or not. When legitimizing unidentified US counter-operations against the malicious North Korean attacks on Sony Pictures in 2014, President Obama thus declared affirmatively: We cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the US”.\nIn the aftermath of the Snowden revelations, as other countries, such as China, started to make similar arguments, e.g. that China's economic espionage was for a national security purpose and not for economic gains. It follows that no stabilization of respective expectations between the United States and other great powers occurred, leaving norm evolution stalled during this period.\nThe failure of the UNGGE in 2017 to come up with a consensus report stems from these deep-seated disagreements. The strategic use of secrecy as a tool for prioritizing one's own domestic priorities could no longer conceal the incompatibility of the respective international role conceptions: whereas the United States did not regard other nations as sovereign in the traditional sense when it comes to US national security, Russia and China reciprocated with political and or economic espionage to advance their interpretation of information sovereignty, often by undermining the US' sovereignty as a democratic republic.\n## Cyber-espionage norms and forward action: the strategic neglect of secrecy (2017-2021) With the incoming Trump administration, the US foreign and cyber-security role taking shifted markedly. Most notably, under President Trump the United States started to ascribe rival and/or enemy roles to former allies and foes alike by insisting on a transactionalist agenda, which prioritized one-time interactions over longer-term relationships. By altercasting China as a direct threat to US national security and hegemony, the Trump administration addressed the expanding territorial and economic sovereignty claims by the communist regime and identified them as violations of US-sovereignty. Focussing on bilateral vis-à-vis multilateral negotiations, and favoring relative positioning vis-á-vis other great powers rather than a functional US leadership position in the international community, became the hallmarks of US foreign and security policy. The Trump administration's offensive cyber-strategy also featured some interesting, if illiberal, characteristics. With the so-called “Clean Network Initiative,” which was described by some observers as a “watershed” for the US internet policy, the administration moved closer to an authoritarian approach of protecting national information spaces and thus fragmenting global digital communication networks. In doing so, the United States also moved closer to resemble those democratic “swing-states” that cast their vote issue-dependent within the UN, thereby aligning with the “sovereigntist” vis-à-vis the “liberal sphere” in the internet governance debate.\nThe Trump administration changed tracks in domestic and external cyber-role taking behavior by more assertively applying the concept of “defending forward”: domestically, control and oversight functions in the executive branch and between the administration and Congress were reduced; externally, the United States proactively embedded US espionage malware in foreign infrastructure networks and started to publicly attribute nefarious attacks on US soil more systematically, thereby lifting the veil of secrecy in operational terms. This partial lifting of secrecy, however, may also be identified in the cyber-policies of democracies, e.g. in joint attribution statements in the aftermath of the Microsoft Exchange Hack 2021 or even the growing number of increasingly detailed National Cyber (Security) Strategies.\nThus, for the period of 2017-2021 the dataset and further case-investigations indicate nine US cyber-operations abroad which were directly or indirectly disclosed by US actors (2017-2019: six; 2020: two, 2021: one case). These pro-active signaling efforts were paralleled by a new offensive cyber-strategy, allegedly imposing higher costs on cyber-adversaries permanently to deter future actions. It comes as no surprise then that four of the nine US offensive operations were directed against Russian targets, four against Iran and one against North Korea. All but one of these US-operations allegedly had disruptive effects. When compared to the Obama administration, which had focused its response to the DNC-hack on domestic measures, the Trump administration employed external measures, such as the offensive cyber-operation to block the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll farm, from carrying out a cyber-enabled influence operation against the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. Notably, however, when targeting the Kremlin-associated troll factory instead of attacking Russia's military intelligence agency (GRU) directly, which was ultimately deemed responsible for most of state-based Russia's offensive cyber-operations, the Trump administration deliberately chose a target with less escalation potential. In a similar vein, when a US Global Hawk drone was shot down by Iranian forces in 2019, the Trump administration reportedly executed a cyber-response by using malware that had been implanted in Iranian networks before the attack on the U.S. drone.\nDisruptive US cyber-operations had started in 2013 as a reconnaissance campaign against the Russian electrical grid. However, these earlier operations were expanded in 2017 mounting to the “placement of potentially crippling malware inside the Russian system at a depth and with an aggressiveness that had never been tried before.” Moreover, through extensive public reporting, the Trump administration reiterated its capacity and willingness to exploit the infiltration of foreign networks for acts of sabotage, thereby reminding potential foes of similar earlier campaigns during peacetime, such as Stuxnet and Operation Nitro Zeus. Given these circumstances, an absolute ban on any form of cyber-operations against critical infrastructure, such as enshrined in the 2015 UNGGE report, appeared to be illusory.\nNotably, and in contrast to Russia, Chinese targets were absent from the US list for disruptive operations during this period, raising the question whether the communist regimes' cyber-operations did not require any proactive forward defense even though the administration escalated its offline conflicts with Beijing during the same period.\nInterestingly, the dataset also suggests that the intensified defending forward strategy was unsuccessful if not counterproductive: First, while the US expanded its offensive cyber-capacity, the Trump administration did neglect US defenses, thereby presenting Russian and Chinese operations ample reasons and a target-rich US domestic cyber-environment for escalating their offensive cyber-operations. Thus, in the period from 2017 to 2019, our dataset currently records thirteen operations with Chinese, ten operations with Russian, nine with Iranian and six with North Korean state involvement against US targets. Initial estimates for the years 2020 and 2021 do not indicate a decline in these operations. Rather, Chinese cyber-operations against (among others) U.S. targets appear to increase in intensity, as the Microsoft Exchange hack from 2021 suggests. As these numbers only reflect publicly known incidents at this time, they are bound to grow due to delayed detection and attribution processes. Arguably, with the Biden administration still assessing the damages from the SolarWinds, Microsoft Exchange and various other data compromise campaigns directed at US targets and attributed to Russian and Chinese operatives, the full extent of the blowback of the US forward cyber-defense strategy is still to be determined. And yet, given that the Biden administration has already declared its determination to respond to the SolarWinds operation, a new and more escalatory phase in disruptive operation may be in the making.\nIn diplomatic terms Russia also intensified its role taking as a dissident in the liberal international order: after the failed UNGGE consensus in 2017, the country proposed a resolution to the UN General Assembly (UNGA) that advocated a separate and more inclusive negotiation forum, an Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG), to discuss the “possible measures that could be taken by the international community to strengthen information security at the global level.” In the end, the UNGA voted for the initiation of a new OEWG that established an alternative negotiation track to the sixth UNGGE, but on a similar, shared mandate, both starting in 2019. Andrey Krutskikh, the Special Representative of the President of the Russian Federation for International Cooperation on Information Security, explained Russia's opposition to the UNGGE process: “Russia has come in conflict with the position of certain countries that seek to impose on the whole world their own game rules in the information space, which would only serve their own interests.”\nFrom a role theoretical perspective, the statement ascribes the role of a technologically dominant and hypocritical hegemon to the US, trying to legitimize its own superiority and respective aggressive actions through international law. Amb. Krutskikh also reaffirmed Russia`s position, that the western-favored focus on “humanitarian aspects” in cyber-space is nothing more than an attempt to legitimize its own use of cyber-force.\nThe first OEWG concluded with its Final Draft report in March 2021. The report reaffirmed that international law, and in particular the Charter of the UN, is applicable in the cyber-domain. But the report lacks any concrete recommendations concerning its actual application. It merely states that future discussions on the topic will be necessary. Moreover, and resembling the failed UNGGE consensus in 2017, it does not contain references to international humanitarian law, human rights law, and customary law, as well as principles of the UN Charter.\nIn the annex of the Chair`s Summary of the OEWG Final Draft report in 2021, China reiterates its strong conceptual support of national sovereignty and information security, noting that “states should refrain from using ICTs to interfere in internal affairs of other states and undermine their political, economic and social stability.” Moreover, China declared that “states should not exploit their dominant position in ICTs, [...] to undermine other states' right to independent control of ICT goods and services as well as their security,” thereby rejecting the Trump administration`s role ascription as a systemic rival and claiming China's role as an enhancer of prosperity on an international level.\nIn sum, the third phase saw an open confrontation between democratic vs. autocratic dominated state camps at the UN-level, resulting in two parallel institutional tracks for norm evolution. While Russia more actively took over the role of a dissident, the Chinese government chose the more accommodative role as an opponent in the current order. Responding to the forward defense strategy of the US, both Russia and China did not alter their role behavior but rather escalated their cyber-espionage operations. The Trump administration's reaction, to increase public attribution through indictment procedures did not change this trend, rather it has strengthened the Russian (and partially Chinese determination) to openly challenge the US government's hypocrisy and to attack its legitimacy as the hegemon of the current liberal international order.\n## Conclusion To explain the absence of the emergence of cyber-espionage norms we have eschewed the notion that this stems from a lack of hegemonic stability or incompatible preferences of domestic groups in the most powerful states. Instead, our role theoretical argument has been guided by two conceptual premises: the co-constitution of domestic and international roles of governments vis-á-vis internal and external others, and the effects of secrecy on role taking and subsequent norm evolution. Our aim has been to better understand how government's use secrecy to obfuscate role conflicts resulting from internal and external expectations and their bearing on international norm evolution.\nThe sovereignty-role nexus applied here zoomed in the intricate two-level role conflicts emanating from two autocratic powers trying to bolster their domestic and foreign sovereignty in the face of an increasingly pro-active democratic power that seeks to protect its expansive national security concerns through proactive cyber-espionage measures. By acting clandestinely, both proponents of the “Web of the Free” as well as the “Web of Sovereigns” to hide information that does undermine their respective normative claims about their role in the international order: While comprehensive clandestine surveillance programs allow the US government to obfuscate the violation of privacy concerns, both in the US and abroad, through extensive proxy use autocratic governments try to obfuscate the violation of sovereign rights of other (mostly democratic) nations.\nWhen cyber-espionage operations became public over the past two decades, norm evolution started but dissipated soon: After the Snowden revelation, the Obama administration rejected to establish a binding norm, even among allies. In the German case, this resulted in the adaptation of domestic security law which legalized future US-German intelligence cooperation even when German citizen's data privacy is concerned. In the case of the US-China economic espionage agreement, China at first complied with the bilateral norm, but only so long as to avoid painful economic sanction against its tech giants. Since the onset of the US-trade war and open struggle for IT and AI dominance under the Trump administration, there appears to be less incentive on either side for self-restraint.\nMore generally speaking, recent role changes in cyber-espionage behavior by the US, China and Russia appear to result in norm nanism not only because secrecy prevents stable behavioral and discursive expectations over time. As the case of Russian infowar and disinformation campaigns shows, liberal mimickry, using Western concepts superficially and filling them with dissentient content, has become a powerful tool to undermine the legitimacy on which democratic societies rest. However, Ukrainian information operations during the recent war with Russia indicate that even autocratic regimes are not immune against reputational losses, bolstered by the use of information communication technologies, addressing their own population. Furthermore, the leak of internal communication of the cyber crime outlet “Conti” by an alleged Ukrainian researcher is further evidence for the use of typical Russian disinformation tactics, now utilised by its usual victims against Russian-affiliated cyber actors themselves.\nConsistent with the role theoretical literature which asserts that roles bridge the gap between agents and structure, we have shown here that specific sovereignty claims by the US -- political sovereignty may be limited through legitimate cyber-espionage at all times -- and Russia as well as Chinese -- cyber-sovereignty must be asserted both externally and domestically -- have a direct (negative) bearing on norm evolution.\nCompared to more structural approaches toward norm evolution, our role theoretical perspective emphasizes the role of agency and the role conflicts emanating from a diverse set of expectations toward that agency. As such, our perspective should be also able to accommodate norm setting practices by other governmental or non-governmental institutions than the political leadership, e.g. intelligence services. When doing so, it would provide a more nuanced view why intelligence agencies may have some or no incentive to support the evolution of inter-state norms and may opt to establish loose forms of expected behavior -- in what has been called “normalization” -- between intelligence operatives of a few selected states.\nPace what has been portrayed as norm nanism may (only) be the stillbirth of liberal cyber-espionage norms. Liberal cyber-espionage norms rest on the assumption that responsive governments may use secrecy only in a few restricted cases because secrecy undermines public scrutiny and thus official responsibility. It follows that Russian dissidence and China's opposition in combination with the United States' growing appetite for political espionage may well lead to the effective stabilization of illiberal cyber-espionage norms. With the OEWG process on its way to supplant the less inclusive UNGGE group, a majority of governments in the OEWG group may find the Russian and Chinese concept of information sovereignty more appealing. Controlling information helps governments in fending off domestic claims of transparency and participation as well as international encroachments, e.g. by US security and intelligence agencies doxing incriminating informations, against their regime. However, current Russian efforts to implement a new cyber crime convention within the UN may be stalled, due to Russian violation of Ukraine`s sovereignty, as it is perceived by many countries worldwide. In theoretical terms, Russia's action in the offline-sphere could hinder its ambitions to fill the role of a widely accepted norm promoter of state sovereignty in cyber-space. At this stage, it remains to be seen what long-term impact Russia`s war against Ukraine will also have on cyber-espionage and its international regulation.\nIn this article, we have not set out to trace how and in what direction domestic roles change over time. In the United States, the new Biden administration has declared that it may strengthen the political leadership in cyber-espionage and interagency procedures as the country faces the fallout of several of the worst cyber-espionage operations in recent US history, but also heavily disruptive ransomware operations. The U.S. Cyber-Space Solarium Commission has also made substantial recommendations as to how the United States may restructure its domestic policy process in order to reduce cyber-vulnerabilities and effectuate rational cyber-governing behavior. We thus suspect that the domestic assertion of leadership vis-á-vis a Republican minority in Congress as well as US international leadership vis-á-vis Russia and China will have lasting, if unintended consequences, for the evolution of cyber-espionage norms. It seems that these norms need more transparency about present and past behavior and less hypocrisy about stated goals in order to grow."

    "abstract": "When and how does state interaction in cyber-space result in norm development? In this article, we contend that governments take on roles vis-à-vis both domestic and foreign audiences, often resulting in conflicts between crosscutting internal and external role expectations. To alleviate these role conflicts, governments use various secret instruments of statecraft that, in turn, shape international norm development. We theorize the nexus between domestic and foreign role play and secrecy, thereby extending the understanding of role taking in international relations to the cyber-space. We argue that whereas the role conceptions of autocratic powers China and Russia have been geared toward cyber-sovereignty of the regime vis-à-vis internal and external others, the United States, as a democratic power, has sought cyber-security for both state and non-state actors in the international realm. Trying to hide some of their cyber-operations, the interaction between China, Russia and the US has resulted in a distinct pattern of cyber-proxy use and state-based surveillance interaction that has facilitated the stabilization of illiberal cyber-espionage norms and the spread of diverging notions of information sovereignty.",
