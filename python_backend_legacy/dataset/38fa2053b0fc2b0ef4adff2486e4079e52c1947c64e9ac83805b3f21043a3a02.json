The conference, the outcome of which is published hereinafter thanks to the efforts of the respective authors as well as those of the editors and the editorial staff of the GYIL for which we are particularly grateful, has been the third in this sequence of conferences, after the conference on “Challenges in Cyber Security – Risks, Strategies and Confidence-Building” held in December 2011,¹ and the one on\n\n* Dr. jur. utr., M.A. (Oxon.), Ambassador of Germany to India; formerly Legal Adviser, Federal Foreign Office, Berlin.\n** Dr. jur., LL.M.

Given that these very principles also constituted the framework and overarching theme of the third 2013 Berlin cyber conference, the content and results of which are hereinafter documented, it is appropriate to quote three main points from his 2012 address, namely that:\n\nFirstly, freedom has to be our overriding priority in internet matters. Respect for the freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, the rights to access to information and the right to personal privacy must be ensured.\n\nSecondly, with freedom comes responsibility. This applies to societies in general. It applies to the global internet society in particular. Self-regulation should be an important principle of its governance. All stakeholders – individuals, companies, governments – have to act responsibly. Therefore, regulation has to step in when our values and rule of law are in danger or democratic legitimation is no longer assured.\n\nFinally, transparency and knowledge will help us to make informed decisions in line with our values. We will continue to share information, to include the global public, and to foster transparent policy dialogue.³\n\n## II.

At the same time, however, there are almost no specific norms of international law that specifically govern ‘cyberspace’ given that the underlying technology is so new.\n\nYet, it is not the first time that international law faces new technological developments. In earlier times, to give but two examples, international law was in a similarly sudden manner confronted with radio waves crossing boundaries, or was confronted with mankind being able to reach extraterrestrial bodies – and each time it was simply taken for granted, and rightly so, that such human behaviour was governed by pre-existing norms of international law.\n\nAnd as in those earlier cases, activities in ‘cyberspace’, too, are governed by international law as such, and be it only by the norm that where no (general or specific) rule prohibiting the behaviour in question exists, States have retained their freedom to act.⁵ This is, inter alia, confirmed by the work of the “Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security”, set up in the framework of the United Nations General Assembly’s First Committee.⁶ As its report of 7 June 2013 in New York quite rightly confirmed in unequivocal terms, “international law, and in particular the U.N. Charter, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT [i.e. information and communications technology] environment.”⁷ What is more is that the report also emphasised that “State sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to State conduct of ICT-related activities, and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory.”⁸\n\n⁵ See generally on that issue Ulrich Fastenrath, Lücken im Völkerrecht: Zu Rechtscharakter, Quellen, Systemzusammenhang, Methodenlehre und Funktionen des Völkerrechts (1991), passim.\n\n⁶ Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, Report of 7 June 2013, UN Doc.

Given however the very general nature of those rules, as well as the lack of generally accepted, efficient, and rule-based inter-State international governance structures concerning the internet, ‘cyberspace’ nevertheless constitutes a major challenge for international law as it currently stands.\n\nIt is against this background that the various papers contained in this very Focus Section of the GYIL attempt to assess the extent to which, and how, human activities in cyberspace are indeed governed by international law, and what the applicable norms are. When studying the relevance of international law for cyberspace at this conference, it was not the primary objective either of its organisers or its participants to define restrictions or limitations for cyberspace freedom. On the contrary, the principal aim was to secure that cyberspace remains a sphere where individual actors exercise their freedom, where economic activity can flourish, and where States can operate effectively.\n\n## III. Notion of ‘Cyberspace’ and its Legal (Ir)relevance\n\nNot infrequently, when discussing which rules of international law apply to ‘cyberspace’, it is referred to as a mere virtual space where computer-mediated communication takes place but which cannot be spatially located.⁹ Yet, to state the obvious, any such communication requires hardware that must be located somewhere. What is more, any such information is then physically routed through the territory of one or more States (and possibly through outer space) before it reaches the addressee, which, again, confirms that there necessarily exists a territorial nexus of any activity in ‘cyberspace’ to at least one State. Accordingly, while ‘cyberspace’ might describe a phenomenon of information being routed through various jurisdictions, it still does not constitute some new form of ‘outer space’ where no State could, as a matter of international law, exercise its jurisdiction.¹⁰ Rather, it is more an issue of technical\n\n⁹ Zimmermann (note 4), 2; see also Nicholas Tsagourias, The Legal Status of Cyberspace, in: id./ Russell Buchan (eds.), Research Handbook on International Law and Cyberspace (2015), 13, 14 et seq.\n\n¹⁰ See generally as to jurisdictional issues related to ‘cyberspace’ Joachim Zekoll, Jurisdiction in Cyberspace, in: Günther Handl/Joachim Zekoll/Peer Zumbansen (eds.), Beyond Territoriality: Trans-",

Challenges for International Law in Cyberspace\n\nAlthough communication in cyberspace is under international law *de jure* subject to the jurisdiction of one or more States, and thus does not constitute a novel phenomenon for international law as such, communication *via* the internet nevertheless, given its specific technical characteristics, does pose new challenges for international law. For one, and more generally, given the speed by which technological developments concerning cyberspace take place, the more traditional ways of creating norms of international law, be it by way of multilateral treaties, be it by way of developing rules of customary international law, run the danger of being the hare in a new form of ‘hare and hedgehog’ race. As a result, most currently existing norms of international law in this field are of a fairly general nature.\n\nThis phenomenon is compounded by an unwillingness of many States, as well as non-State actors such as multinational enterprises that have a technological lead in cyberspace, to have their behaviour in cyberspace regulated by specific treaty-based rules; these actors instead see the lack of effective international regulation of their activities as an advantage to be exploited. By the same token, given the enormous technological gap that exists between highly industrialised States and multinational companies, on the one hand, and smaller States on the other, many States might *de facto* not fully be in a position to exercise even a minimal form of control of cyberspace activities emanating from or affecting their territory; indeed, they might even lack sufficient capabilities to frame an appropriate regulatory (legal) framework governing such activities.\n\nMoreover, both the *de facto* (but *de facto* only!) de-territorialisation of cyberspace activities (in that information is being routed through a large number of States and territories) and the sheer amount of information being produced might lead to a lack\n\nnational Legal Authority in an Age of Globalization (2012), 341–369; Uta Kohl, Jurisdiction in Cyberspace, in: Tsagourias/Buchan (eds.)

Rather, it was the peacetime scenario below the threshold of an armed conflict that this conference focussed upon. Moreover, the conference was not about national security electronic surveillance programmes either, which indeed raise very specific issues beyond the realm of general international law. Indeed, we believe that the overall debate on ‘cyber security’ with its main focus on cyber warfare is, to a large degree, so far at least, somewhat one-sided.¹⁶\n\nWhile, obviously, both jus ad bellum and jus in bello rules do apply, as a matter of course, to activities in cyberspace, such activities do not normally reach, and so far have not reached, the threshold of Article 2 (4) UN Charter.

Whenever such use of force even reaches the threshold of an armed attack, as defined by general rules of international law¹⁷ and, in particular, the case-law of the International Court of Justice (ICJ),¹⁸ in principle, the right of self-defence comes into play.

Namely, the question arises whether, under either customary law or under Article 17 ICCPR, an individual who is not present on the territory of a State collecting the private data of this very individual *via* the internet finds himself “within the jurisdiction” of said State within the meaning of Article 2 (1) ICCPR (or the parallel norm of customary law).

Cyberspace Governance: Which Way Forward?\n\nUnlike most other areas of international law, cyberspace so far lacks any significant inter-governmental governance structure. Rather, key private organisations acting with the aim of preserving the operational stability of the internet, such as ICANN, the “Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers,” as well as interconnection and peering agreements among internet service providers, provide for some form of self-regulatory capabilities of cyberspace. It remains to be seen whether this form of self-regulation will continue to be able to provide sufficient safeguards as to the functioning of the internet, in line with the applicable principles of international law outlined above, or whether one should not aim at some form of intergovernmental internet governance. Yet, recent initiatives within the International Telecommunication Union’s (ITU) system have shown that such attempts of coming up with universally accepted inter-State governance structures might run the risk of being (mis-)used for subjecting cyberspace-based activities to over-broad governmental regulation (or, in other words, censorship), and thus run the risk of limiting rather than protecting the human rights of internet users.\n\n²⁶ GA Res. 68/167 of 18 December 2013.

In order to function in such a way, cyberspace presupposes and requires a certain behaviour of States. The set of rules for such behaviour ought to possess a legally binding character. It is submitted that time has come to identify common legal understandings for cyberspace that serve to prevent direct damages caused by cyber activities, as well as to limit harm and loss resulting from such damages. This indeed is what the conference, which led to the various contributions to be found beneath, was all about. In approaching this question, the guiding (and indeed self-evident) principle must be strict adherence to international law including, in particular, human rights, and the established principles of State responsibility.\n\n## VIII. Cyberspace and Inter-State Due Diligence Obligations\n\nThe starting point for any research into States’ obligations in cyberspace has to be its complexity and its interconnectivity as well as the network character of cyberspace. As in other areas where interests of different States are intrinsically intertwined, this requires that States respect legitimate interests of other States within cyberspace and cooperate in responding to threats to the common sphere of interest.\n\nWithin the international community, there is consensus that there exists a general obligation of States to prevent their territory (and hence also cyberspace-related infrastructure located on their territory) from being used for acts contrary to the rights of other States, unlawfully harming such other States.²⁹ The leading case on this question is, of course, the merits judgment of the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case.³⁰ As the Court then put it, a State breaches this obligation if it fails to act with due diligence.³¹ This principle of international law is referred to as both the “principle of due\n\n²⁹ *Geiß/Lahmann* (note 19), 632 et seq.\n\n³⁰ ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland *v.* Albania), Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 4.\n\n³¹ *Ibid.*, 22, where the Court *inter alia* refers to “every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”.",

States are expected to take preventive measures in their sphere of exclusive control, when internationally unlawful harm is being caused by actions of private persons. The respective invocation of due diligence can be traced back to the Alabama Arbitration of 1872.³⁴\n\nUnder modern international law, the scope of the due diligence principle transcends its historical origins. There seems to be consensus that due diligence constitutes a general principle of law, both in the field of international environmental law³⁵ and in situations of risk of other transboundary harm.³⁶ It accordingly only seems logical to apply the concept of due diligence also when it comes to situations of risk of transboundary harm within cyberspace.\n\nThe application of this principle would mean that all States share a common obligation to ensure that neither their territory, nor hardware and cyber infrastructure situated on their territory or under their effective control, is misused to harm other States or their residents.\n\n³² Timo Koivurova, Due Diligence, Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL), February 2010, paras. 1 et seq., available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 23 September 2015).\n\n³³ Ibid., para. 3.\n\n³⁴ Alabama Claims (United States of America, Great Britain), Arbitral Award of 8 May 1871, Reports of International Arbitral Awards XXIX, 125; see also Tom Bingham, Alabama Arbitration, MPEPIL, October 2006, para. 7, available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 23 September 2015).\n\n³⁵ Koivurova (note 32), para. 9.\n\n³⁶ ICJ, Corfu Channel (note 30), 4, 22; Günther Handl, Transboundary Impact, in: Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of International Environmental Law (2007), 531, 541 (with further references); Pierre-Marie Dupuy, Formation of Customary International Law and General Principles, in: Bodansky/Brunnée/Hey (eds.)

Therefore, the argument can validly be made that due diligence does not necessarily require identical measures from all States. As a matter of fact, a certain lack of economic and technological capacity of a particular State might reduce its due diligence obligations.³⁷ Moreover, the requirements due diligence sets out are context-specific. Different measures might be required in different circumstances. It also seems that there can be different legal requirements for a State depending on whether a harmful activity has its origin or its effect in its territory.\n\nIn all these cases, due diligence could entail both substantive and/or procedural obligations. The latter ones may require States to create specific institutional capacities. Moreover, there could be a duty to cooperate in cases of transboundary harm. Additionally, responsibilities might change during the different stages of harmful activities. Whereas duties of prevention might dominate before any harmful act is committed, during or after such an act, it is cooperation between States that might primarily be required then.\n\nFinally, the concept of ‘harm’ inflicted on other States also needs special attention. It seems that not every harm inflicted on another State automatically entails that due diligence obligations have been violated.³⁸ Rather, there appears to be a threshold triggering such due diligence obligations.\n\nIn light of the results to be found in the various contributions compiled hereinafter as part of this year’s GYIL Focus Section, one might tentatively formulate the following guidelines:\n\nPrior to potentially harmful cyber activities, States could be obliged to take all measures necessary to prevent misuse of the cyber infrastructure under their jurisdiction or their effective control.

At the same time, for one, States can in any event be only obliged to do what is technically feasible in light of their respective abilities – *ultra posse nemo obligatur* – and besides, one must carefully balance any such oversight with legitimate privacy rights of individual internet users.\n\n*During* an ongoing cyber attack, considerations of due diligence might require that the State of origin and/or the transit States take all appropriate measures to stop these activities. In order not to jump from the frying pan into the fire, States should probably ensure that their responsive measures intrude as little as possible on the network communications process necessary to stop the attack.\n\n*In the aftermath* of a cyber attack, all States concerned, in particular the State of origin and possible transit States, could be required to take steps necessary to identify the source of the harmful activity and to prevent a repetition of similar future actions. Possible target States should in turn prepare their network infrastructure to ensure that the impact of an attack remains as limited as possible. Probably, States should in particular do all that is necessary to ensure resilience of their critical infrastructure and to prevent the possibility of negative repercussions on critical civil infrastructure, including electricity networks, water supplies, or nuclear power plants.\n\nFinally, due diligence might also require States to disclose intelligence concerning harmful acts against their cyber infrastructure, at least as long as national security interests are not compromised. Thereby, a State would enable other States to implement effective preventive measures before becoming the target of similar attacks. This might require establishing national points of contact facilitating the exchange of information between affected States.\n\nAt the same time two important points warrant underlining: First, none of the principles introduced here should in any way impede the application of the prohibition of the use of force, the right to self-defence, the rules of international humanitarian law, if applicable, or the principles of State responsibility in case damaging activities can be attributed to a specific State.\n\nSecond, whatever obligations States might have in preventing or minimising harm caused by cyber attacks, it should not be forgotten that cyberspace must remain a place where individual actors exercise their freedom, where economic activity can",

Responsible State practice adhering to due diligence could provide a durable and solid basis to ensure such a cyberspace.\n\n## IX. Structure and Content of the Focus Section\n\nIt is in light of these considerations that the conveners of the conference, whose papers are published in this Focus Section, have requested the various authors to address some of the crucial, so far largely unanswered legal questions deriving from the applicability of this generally accepted, but very general concept of due diligence to ‘cyberspace’.\n\nMore specifically, the opening piece by Christian Walter considers the “Obligations of States Before, During, and After a Cyber Security Incident” as they arise under general international law and notably the concept of due diligence.³⁹ Oliver Dörr then specifically addresses possible “Obligations of the State of Origin of a Cyber Security Incident”,⁴⁰ while August Reinisch and Markus Beham deal with and analyse the specific obligations of transit States in their contribution entitled “Mitigating Risks: Inter-State Due Diligence Obligations in Case of Harmful Cyber-Incidents and Malicious Cyber-Activity: Obligations of the Transit State”.⁴¹\n\nIn turn Robert Kolb reflects more generally on the concept of due diligence duties and their relevance concerning cyberspace from the standpoint of general international law,⁴² while Jutta Brunnée and Tamar Meshel then consider whether international environmental law, which also deals with an international common good, might serve as a blueprint for cyberspace governance.⁴³ Last but not least, Matthias Herdegen considers the possible international legal framework as well as possible reg-\n\n³⁹ See Christian Walter, Obligations of States Before, During, and After a Cyber Security Incident, GYIL 58 (2015), 67.\n\n⁴⁰ See Dörr (note 13).\n\n⁴¹ See August Reinisch/Markus Beham, Mitigating Risks: Inter-State Due Diligence Obligations in Case of Harmful Cyber-Incidents and Malicious Cyber-Activity: Obligations of the Transit State, GYIL 58 (2015), 101.\n\n⁴² See Kolb (note 13).\n\n⁴³ Brunnée/Meshel (note 13).",

Outlook\n\nAs with other areas of international law which have developed only during the last decades, such as international environmental law,⁴⁵ only time will tell whether the international community of States will be able and willing to come up with specific and adequate rules of international law applicable to ‘cyberspace’. Yet, as mentioned before, this is nothing peculiar to cyberspace. Rather, one has previously seen similar developments in other areas, international environmental law being a particularly relevant example at hand, before specific treaty regimes were later established.\n\nPending such a development, States and other actors can only rely on general, and thus necessarily relatively vague, rules of international law, such as the concept of due diligence, and attempt to apply them to human activities in cyberspace. It is for that reason that the various contributions to this Focus Section have concentrated on this very concept in considerable detail and from various perspectives.\n\nWe hope that this year’s GYIL overall Focus Section, by documenting the outcome of the 2013 cyber conference held in Berlin and organised jointly by the two authors of this brief introduction, may contribute to foster and further develop a legal framework for a peaceful use of cyberspace in the interest of the overall international community.\n\n⁴⁴ *Herdegen* (note 38).\n\n⁴⁵ As to the possibility of transposing principles developed within international environmental law to cyberspace, see, apart from the contribution by *Brunnée/Meshel* in this very Focus Section (note 13), also *Maraubn* (note 38), 465 et seq.",

Introduction\nThis year’s Focus Section of the German Yearbook of International Law (GYIL) contains and documents the results of a scientific conference organised by the German Federal Foreign Office in co-operation with the University of Potsdam in which both legal academics as well as practitioners from around the world participated.\nGiven that Germany has repeatedly underlined that securing the freedom and stability of cyberspace constitutes an important aim of German foreign policy, the German Federal Foreign Office organised (and continues to organise) a series of “Berlin Cyber Conferences”, intending to gather international cutting-edge expertise in the field of cyber security. The conference, the outcome of which is published hereinafter thanks to the efforts of the respective authors as well as those of the editors and the editorial staff of the GYIL for which we are particularly grateful, has been the third in this sequence of conferences, after the conference on “Challenges in Cyber Security – Risks, Strategies and Confidence-Building” held in December 2011,¹ and the one on\n* Dr. jur. utr., M.A. (Oxon.), Ambassador of Germany to India; formerly Legal Adviser, Federal Foreign Office, Berlin.\n** Dr. jur., LL.M.

Given that these very principles also constituted the framework and overarching theme of the third 2013 Berlin cyber conference, the content and results of which are hereinafter documented, it is appropriate to quote three main points from his 2012 address, namely that:\nFirstly, freedom has to be our overriding priority in internet matters. Respect for the freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, the rights to access to information and the right to personal privacy must be ensured.\nSecondly, with freedom comes responsibility. This applies to societies in general. It applies to the global internet society in particular. Self-regulation should be an important principle of its governance. All stakeholders – individuals, companies, governments – have to act responsibly. Therefore, regulation has to step in when our values and rule of law are in danger or democratic legitimation is no longer assured.\nFinally, transparency and knowledge will help us to make informed decisions in line with our values. We will continue to share information, to include the global public, and to foster transparent policy dialogue.³\n## II. Cyberspace and General International Law⁴\nReaders of this very piece will read their newspapers online and might purchase some (or even all) of their gifts in the same manner. These simple examples alone, and\n² See id., Conference on the Internet and Human Rights, 12 September 2012, available at: http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/sid_D911C8E0F05824607E17EFDF3F489C0E/EN/Aussenpolitik/Menschenrechte/Aktuell/120912-Konferenz-Internet-Menschenrechte.html (accessed on 23 September 2015).\n³ Speech by Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle at the conference \"The Internet and Human Rights: Building a Free, Open and Secure Internet\", 14 September 2012, available at: http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/EN/Infoservice/Presse/Reden/2012/120914-BM_Internet_MR.html?nn=648756 (accessed on 23 September 2015).\n⁴ See as to this issue also already Andreas Zimmermann, International Law and 'Cyber Space', ESIL Reflections, 10 January 2014, available at: http://www.esil-sedi.eu/sites/default/files/ESIL%20Reflections%20-%20Andreas%20Zimmermann.pdf (accessed on 23 September 2015).\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE\nmany others could obviously be added, demonstrate to what extent communication via the internet shapes our day-to-day-life, far beyond the news that from time to time make the headlines. At the same time, however, there are almost no specific norms of international law that specifically govern ‘cyberspace’ given that the underlying technology is so new.\nYet, it is not the first time that international law faces new technological developments. In earlier times, to give but two examples, international law was in a similarly sudden manner confronted with radio waves crossing boundaries, or was confronted with mankind being able to reach extraterrestrial bodies – and each time it was simply taken for granted, and rightly so, that such human behaviour was governed by pre-existing norms of international law.\nAnd as in those earlier cases, activities in ‘cyberspace’, too, are governed by international law as such, and be it only by the norm that where no (general or specific) rule prohibiting the behaviour in question exists, States have retained their freedom to act.⁵ This is, inter alia, confirmed by the work of the “Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security”, set up in the framework of the United Nations General Assembly’s First Committee.⁶ As its report of 7 June 2013 in New York quite rightly confirmed in unequivocal terms, “international law, and in particular the U.N. Charter, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT [i.e. information and communications technology] environment.”⁷ What is more is that the report also emphasised that “State sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to State conduct of ICT-related activities, and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory.”⁸\n⁵ See generally on that issue Ulrich Fastenrath, Lücken im Völkerrecht: Zu Rechtscharakter, Quellen, Systemzusammenhang, Methodenlehre und Funktionen des Völkerrechts (1991), passim.\n⁶ Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, Report of 7 June 2013, UN Doc. A/68/98 (2013), available at: http://www.unidir.org/files/medias/pdfs/developments-in-the-field-of-information-and-telecommunications-in-the-context-of-international-security-2012-2013-a-68-98-eng-0-578.pdf (accessed on 23 September 2015).\n⁷ Ibid., 8.\n⁸ Ibid.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nHowever, as in earlier scenarios, it is for lack, for the time being, of more specific rules that the basic and more general norms of international law govern cyber activities, including concepts such as jurisdiction, attribution, or, in particular, the concept of due diligence. Given however the very general nature of those rules, as well as the lack of generally accepted, efficient, and rule-based inter-State international governance structures concerning the internet, ‘cyberspace’ nevertheless constitutes a major challenge for international law as it currently stands.\nIt is against this background that the various papers contained in this very Focus Section of the GYIL attempt to assess the extent to which, and how, human activities in cyberspace are indeed governed by international law, and what the applicable norms are. When studying the relevance of international law for cyberspace at this conference, it was not the primary objective either of its organisers or its participants to define restrictions or limitations for cyberspace freedom. On the contrary, the principal aim was to secure that cyberspace remains a sphere where individual actors exercise their freedom, where economic activity can flourish, and where States can operate effectively.\n## III. Notion of ‘Cyberspace’ and its Legal (Ir)relevance\nNot infrequently, when discussing which rules of international law apply to ‘cyberspace’, it is referred to as a mere virtual space where computer-mediated communication takes place but which cannot be spatially located.⁹ Yet, to state the obvious, any such communication requires hardware that must be located somewhere. What is more, any such information is then physically routed through the territory of one or more States (and possibly through outer space) before it reaches the addressee, which, again, confirms that there necessarily exists a territorial nexus of any activity in ‘cyberspace’ to at least one State. Accordingly, while ‘cyberspace’ might describe a phenomenon of information being routed through various jurisdictions, it still does not constitute some new form of ‘outer space’ where no State could, as a matter of international law, exercise its jurisdiction.¹⁰ Rather, it is more an issue of technical\n⁹ Zimmermann (note 4), 2; see also Nicholas Tsagourias, The Legal Status of Cyberspace, in: id./ Russell Buchan (eds.), Research Handbook on International Law and Cyberspace (2015), 13, 14 et seq.\n¹⁰ See generally as to jurisdictional issues related to ‘cyberspace’ Joachim Zekoll, Jurisdiction in Cyberspace, in: Günther Handl/Joachim Zekoll/Peer Zumbansen (eds.), Beyond Territoriality: Trans-\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE\n55\nfeasibility which State (or international organisation) is in a position to regulate behaviour in ‘cyberspace’, and also an issue of the willingness of States to eventually agree on more specific rules on the matter.\n## IV. Challenges for International Law in Cyberspace\nAlthough communication in cyberspace is under international law *de jure* subject to the jurisdiction of one or more States, and thus does not constitute a novel phenomenon for international law as such, communication *via* the internet nevertheless, given its specific technical characteristics, does pose new challenges for international law. For one, and more generally, given the speed by which technological developments concerning cyberspace take place, the more traditional ways of creating norms of international law, be it by way of multilateral treaties, be it by way of developing rules of customary international law, run the danger of being the hare in a new form of ‘hare and hedgehog’ race. As a result, most currently existing norms of international law in this field are of a fairly general nature.\nThis phenomenon is compounded by an unwillingness of many States, as well as non-State actors such as multinational enterprises that have a technological lead in cyberspace, to have their behaviour in cyberspace regulated by specific treaty-based rules; these actors instead see the lack of effective international regulation of their activities as an advantage to be exploited. By the same token, given the enormous technological gap that exists between highly industrialised States and multinational companies, on the one hand, and smaller States on the other, many States might *de facto* not fully be in a position to exercise even a minimal form of control of cyberspace activities emanating from or affecting their territory; indeed, they might even lack sufficient capabilities to frame an appropriate regulatory (legal) framework governing such activities.\nMoreover, both the *de facto* (but *de facto* only!) de-territorialisation of cyberspace activities (in that information is being routed through a large number of States and territories) and the sheer amount of information being produced might lead to a lack\nnational Legal Authority in an Age of Globalization (2012), 341–369; Uta Kohl, Jurisdiction in Cyberspace, in: Tsagourias/Buchan (eds.) (note 9), 30.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nof effective regulatory mechanisms to be used by States when it comes to detecting, and eventually addressing, harmful activities in cyberspace, regardless of whether they emanate from private actors or from other States.\nAnother aspect of such de facto de-territorialisation of cyberspace activities can be seen in the fact that the effects of activities in cyberspace, even when they emanate from States, often occur abroad, which in many cases raises the question whether the international obligations a State has undertaken (be they treaty-based or of a customary nature) also apply in such cross-boundary and extraterritorial settings.\nMoreover, given the technological environment in which cyberspace activities occur, it will be often, if not always, difficult or even impossible, to trace back any such activities, even when they emanate from actors whose actions would otherwise be attributable to a given State under applicable norms of international law, as codified in the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility.¹¹ Accordingly, in many cases, while the general law on State responsibility is applicable as such, it might not be fully adequate to regulate cyberspace-related activities.¹² This in turn requires international law to either develop specific norms of attribution (including specific evidentiary norms), or to come up with specific primary norms that can adequately address the matter.¹³\nV. Cyberspace, the Prohibition of the Use of Force, and Jus in Bello\nCyber security is, first and foremost, an item of the international law of peace, or, to paraphrase the former German President Gustav Heinemann, who once put it succinctly, albeit in a somewhat different context, ‘peace constitutes the real emergency\n¹¹ GA Res. 56/83 of 28 January 2002, Annex.\n¹² See on this issue Michael N. Schmitt, Cyber Activities and the Law of Countermeasures, in: Katharina Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy (2013), 659, 668 et seq; Constantine Antonopoulos, State Responsibility in Cyberspace, in: Tsagourias/Buchan (eds.) (note 9), 55.\n¹³ See as to this issue also the contributions by Robert Kolb, Reflections on Due Diligence Duties and Cyberspace, German Yearbook of International Law (GYIL) 58 (2015), 113; Oliver Dörr, Obligations of the State of Origin of a Cyber Security Incident, GYIL 58 (2015), 87; Jutta Brunneé/Tamar Meshel, Teaching an Old Law New Tricks: International Environmental Law Lessons for Cyberspace Governance, GYIL 58 (2015), 129.\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE 57\nin which international law has to prove itself.¹⁴ Indeed, it follows from the very Charter of the United Nations (UN Charter)¹⁵ that peace and security take precedence in international relations, and this, obviously, holds also true when it comes to inter-State relations in cyberspace.\nHence, neither issues of the use of armed force (jus ad bellum) nor jus in bello issues were what the conference, whose proceedings are reproduced here, wanted to address. Rather, it was the peacetime scenario below the threshold of an armed conflict that this conference focussed upon. Moreover, the conference was not about national security electronic surveillance programmes either, which indeed raise very specific issues beyond the realm of general international law. Indeed, we believe that the overall debate on ‘cyber security’ with its main focus on cyber warfare is, to a large degree, so far at least, somewhat one-sided.¹⁶\nWhile, obviously, both jus ad bellum and jus in bello rules do apply, as a matter of course, to activities in cyberspace, such activities do not normally reach, and so far have not reached, the threshold of Article 2 (4) UN Charter. Having said this, it is, of course, conceivable that a harmful cyberspace activity that is attributable to a State could amount to a violation of Article 2 (4) UN Charter, given its character and effects. Whenever such use of force even reaches the threshold of an armed attack, as defined by general rules of international law¹⁷ and, in particular, the case-law of the International Court of Justice (ICJ),¹⁸ in principle, the right of self-defence comes into play. In that regard, ‘cyber attacks’ (provided they do amount to armed attacks in the first place, which will probably be the case only rarely), just like other armed attacks, might raise the question whether such attacks, if they emanate from non-\n¹⁴ Gustav Heinemann, Inaugural Address “Dem Frieden dienen”, German Federal Parliament Plenary Protocol No. 05/245 of 1 July 1969, in: Verhandlungen des Deutschen Bundestages 1969, Vol. 70, 13661, 13664, 13665, available at: http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btp/05/05245.pdf (accessed on 5 November 2015): “Nicht der Krieg ist der Ernstfall, [...] sondern der Frieden ist der Ernstfall, in dem wir alle uns zu bewähren haben.” “War is not the quintessential emergency [...] rather, peace is the emergency in which we all have to prove ourselves” (English text available at: http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=169&amp;language=english (accessed on 23 September 2015)).\n¹⁵ Charter of the United Nations, 26 June 1945, UNCIO 15, 335 (UN Charter).\n¹⁶ But see most recently the various contributions in Ziolkowski (ed.)

In these respects, the judgment of the ICJ in the *Oil Platforms* case²⁰ is of particular relevance.\nBy the same token, once the threshold of an (international or non-international) armed conflict has either been reached by a cyber attack as such, or where cyber attacks are being undertaken as part of already ongoing hostilities, applicable norms of international humanitarian law also govern cyberspace-related activities that are undertaken as part of the armed conflict and that constitute an ‘attack’ within the meaning of international humanitarian law. Yet, ‘cyber warfare’ raises significant, and so far largely unresolved, questions, *inter alia* as to the character of cyber installations as military objects as well as to the legal characterisation of persons involved in cyber operations. State practice has not yet fully addressed these questions.²¹\n## VI.

Schmitt (ed.), Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (2013), passim.\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE\ntion.²² Moreover, it also has to ensure the full functioning of cyberspace as a basic pillar of international economic activity and social activity.\nThis is challenged by the ability of States (and indeed private actors) to effectively collect comprehensive information on any given person active on the internet in one way or the other. This reality leads to the question whether human rights standards, and namely guarantees relating to privacy, also apply in ‘cyberspace’ as a matter of their applicability *ratione materiae* and *ratione loci*.\nApart from specific treaty-based norms that may be applicable in a given case (such as e.g. the Council of Europe’s Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data²³), the area lacks specific rules. For one, it might be asked whether *de lege lata* all electronic data available in cyberspace are comprehensively protected by the concepts of ‘privacy’ and/or ‘correspondence’ under Article 17 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),²⁴ one of the issues (not yet conclusively resolved) being whether the 1966 ICCPR (or parallel norms of customary international law) can be interpreted in a manner as to also cover forms of communication not explicitly foreseen in 1966.\nFurthermore (provided one assumes that the relevant rules of international law do apply *ratione materiae* to cyberspace), one has to answer an additional question relating to the extraterritorial applicability of the right of privacy. Namely, the question arises whether, under either customary law or under Article 17 ICCPR, an individual who is not present on the territory of a State collecting the private data of this very individual *via* the internet finds himself “within the jurisdiction” of said State within the meaning of Article 2 (1) ICCPR (or the parallel norm of customary law). It is only if one were to provide a positive answer to this question that the applicability of the right to privacy would be triggered.²⁵\n²² See generally as to this issue also the contribution by Dinah PoKempner, Cyberspace and State Obligations in the Area of Human Rights, in: Ziolkowski (ed.) (note 12), 239; David P. Fidler, Cyberspace and Human Rights, in: Tsagourias/Buchan (eds.)

Cyberspace Governance: Which Way Forward?\nUnlike most other areas of international law, cyberspace so far lacks any significant inter-governmental governance structure. Rather, key private organisations acting with the aim of preserving the operational stability of the internet, such as ICANN, the “Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers,” as well as interconnection and peering agreements among internet service providers, provide for some form of self-regulatory capabilities of cyberspace. It remains to be seen whether this form of self-regulation will continue to be able to provide sufficient safeguards as to the functioning of the internet, in line with the applicable principles of international law outlined above, or whether one should not aim at some form of intergovernmental internet governance. Yet, recent initiatives within the International Telecommunication Union’s (ITU) system have shown that such attempts of coming up with universally accepted inter-State governance structures might run the risk of being (mis-)used for subjecting cyberspace-based activities to over-broad governmental regulation (or, in other words, censorship), and thus run the risk of limiting rather than protecting the human rights of internet users.\n²⁶ GA Res. 68/167 of 18 December 2013.

A/HRC/27/37 (2014).\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE 61\nAt the same time, States share an interest in maintaining cyberspace free from interruptions, *i.e.* a cyberspace which is not misused in a way that unduly affects other States, their infrastructure, or their population. In order to function in such a way, cyberspace presupposes and requires a certain behaviour of States. The set of rules for such behaviour ought to possess a legally binding character. It is submitted that time has come to identify common legal understandings for cyberspace that serve to prevent direct damages caused by cyber activities, as well as to limit harm and loss resulting from such damages. This indeed is what the conference, which led to the various contributions to be found beneath, was all about. In approaching this question, the guiding (and indeed self-evident) principle must be strict adherence to international law including, in particular, human rights, and the established principles of State responsibility.\n## VIII. Cyberspace and Inter-State Due Diligence Obligations\nThe starting point for any research into States’ obligations in cyberspace has to be its complexity and its interconnectivity as well as the network character of cyberspace. As in other areas where interests of different States are intrinsically intertwined, this requires that States respect legitimate interests of other States within cyberspace and cooperate in responding to threats to the common sphere of interest.\nWithin the international community, there is consensus that there exists a general obligation of States to prevent their territory (and hence also cyberspace-related infrastructure located on their territory) from being used for acts contrary to the rights of other States, unlawfully harming such other States.²⁹ The leading case on this question is, of course, the merits judgment of the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case.³⁰ As the Court then put it, a State breaches this obligation if it fails to act with due diligence.³¹ This principle of international law is referred to as both the “principle of due\n²⁹ *Geiß/Lahmann* (note 19), 632 et seq.\n³⁰ ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland *v.* Albania), Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 4.\n³¹ *Ibid.*, 22, where the Court *inter alia* refers to “every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\ndiligence”³² and also the “no harm principle”,³³ describing two elements of one and the same obligation.\nNo matter how this principle is labelled, it is of particular relevance in cases where harmful actions either cannot be attributed to a particular State or where only insufficient proof for such attribution can be provided by the victim State.\nAs is well-known, historically the concept of due diligence was developed with regard to the responsibility of States for the behaviour of private actors. States are expected to take preventive measures in their sphere of exclusive control, when internationally unlawful harm is being caused by actions of private persons. The respective invocation of due diligence can be traced back to the Alabama Arbitration of 1872.³⁴\nUnder modern international law, the scope of the due diligence principle transcends its historical origins. There seems to be consensus that due diligence constitutes a general principle of law, both in the field of international environmental law³⁵ and in situations of risk of other transboundary harm.³⁶ It accordingly only seems logical to apply the concept of due diligence also when it comes to situations of risk of transboundary harm within cyberspace.\nThe application of this principle would mean that all States share a common obligation to ensure that neither their territory, nor hardware and cyber infrastructure situated on their territory or under their effective control, is misused to harm other States or their residents.\n³² Timo Koivurova, Due Diligence, Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL), February 2010, paras. 1 et seq., available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 23 September 2015).\n³³ Ibid., para. 3.\n³⁴ Alabama Claims (United States of America, Great Britain), Arbitral Award of 8 May 1871, Reports of International Arbitral Awards XXIX, 125; see also Tom Bingham, Alabama Arbitration, MPEPIL, October 2006, para. 7, available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 23 September 2015).\n³⁵ Koivurova (note 32), para. 9.\n³⁶ ICJ, Corfu Channel (note 30), 4, 22; Günther Handl, Transboundary Impact, in: Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of International Environmental Law (2007), 531, 541 (with further references); Pierre-Marie Dupuy, Formation of Customary International Law and General Principles, in: Bodansky/Brunnée/Hey (eds.)

A/56/10 (2001), 377, General Commentary, para. 3.\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE 63\nDue diligence could thus be regarded as a minimum standard providing a test whether a specific State conduct is up to what a ‘good government’ would do in such situations of transboundary risk. Therefore, the argument can validly be made that due diligence does not necessarily require identical measures from all States. As a matter of fact, a certain lack of economic and technological capacity of a particular State might reduce its due diligence obligations.³⁷ Moreover, the requirements due diligence sets out are context-specific. Different measures might be required in different circumstances. It also seems that there can be different legal requirements for a State depending on whether a harmful activity has its origin or its effect in its territory.\nIn all these cases, due diligence could entail both substantive and/or procedural obligations. The latter ones may require States to create specific institutional capacities. Moreover, there could be a duty to cooperate in cases of transboundary harm. Additionally, responsibilities might change during the different stages of harmful activities. Whereas duties of prevention might dominate before any harmful act is committed, during or after such an act, it is cooperation between States that might primarily be required then.\nFinally, the concept of ‘harm’ inflicted on other States also needs special attention. It seems that not every harm inflicted on another State automatically entails that due diligence obligations have been violated.³⁸ Rather, there appears to be a threshold triggering such due diligence obligations.\nIn light of the results to be found in the various contributions compiled hereinafter as part of this year’s GYIL Focus Section, one might tentatively formulate the following guidelines:\nPrior to potentially harmful cyber activities, States could be obliged to take all measures necessary to prevent misuse of the cyber infrastructure under their jurisdiction or their effective control. Moreover, they could be required to ensure that any perpe\n³⁷ Patricia Birnie/Alan Boyle/Catherine Redgwell (eds.), International Law and the Environment (3rd ed. 2009), 149; Brunneé/Meshel (note 13), 134 et seq.; Benedikt Pirker, Territorial Sovereignty and Integrity and the Challenge of Cyberspace, in: Ziolkowski (ed.)

This might encompass an obligation to build up specific institutional capacities. At the same time, for one, States can in any event be only obliged to do what is technically feasible in light of their respective abilities – *ultra posse nemo obligatur* – and besides, one must carefully balance any such oversight with legitimate privacy rights of individual internet users.\n*During* an ongoing cyber attack, considerations of due diligence might require that the State of origin and/or the transit States take all appropriate measures to stop these activities. In order not to jump from the frying pan into the fire, States should probably ensure that their responsive measures intrude as little as possible on the network communications process necessary to stop the attack.\n*In the aftermath* of a cyber attack, all States concerned, in particular the State of origin and possible transit States, could be required to take steps necessary to identify the source of the harmful activity and to prevent a repetition of similar future actions. Possible target States should in turn prepare their network infrastructure to ensure that the impact of an attack remains as limited as possible. Probably, States should in particular do all that is necessary to ensure resilience of their critical infrastructure and to prevent the possibility of negative repercussions on critical civil infrastructure, including electricity networks, water supplies, or nuclear power plants.\nFinally, due diligence might also require States to disclose intelligence concerning harmful acts against their cyber infrastructure, at least as long as national security interests are not compromised. Thereby, a State would enable other States to implement effective preventive measures before becoming the target of similar attacks. This might require establishing national points of contact facilitating the exchange of information between affected States.\nAt the same time two important points warrant underlining: First, none of the principles introduced here should in any way impede the application of the prohibition of the use of force, the right to self-defence, the rules of international humanitarian law, if applicable, or the principles of State responsibility in case damaging activities can be attributed to a specific State.\nSecond, whatever obligations States might have in preventing or minimising harm caused by cyber attacks, it should not be forgotten that cyberspace must remain a place where individual actors exercise their freedom, where economic activity can\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE\nflourish, and where States can operate effectively. Responsible State practice adhering to due diligence could provide a durable and solid basis to ensure such a cyberspace.\n## IX. Structure and Content of the Focus Section\nIt is in light of these considerations that the conveners of the conference, whose papers are published in this Focus Section, have requested the various authors to address some of the crucial, so far largely unanswered legal questions deriving from the applicability of this generally accepted, but very general concept of due diligence to ‘cyberspace’.\nMore specifically, the opening piece by Christian Walter considers the “Obligations of States Before, During, and After a Cyber Security Incident” as they arise under general international law and notably the concept of due diligence.³⁹ Oliver Dörr then specifically addresses possible “Obligations of the State of Origin of a Cyber Security Incident”,⁴⁰ while August Reinisch and Markus Beham deal with and analyse the specific obligations of transit States in their contribution entitled “Mitigating Risks: Inter-State Due Diligence Obligations in Case of Harmful Cyber-Incidents and Malicious Cyber-Activity: Obligations of the Transit State”.⁴¹\nIn turn Robert Kolb reflects more generally on the concept of due diligence duties and their relevance concerning cyberspace from the standpoint of general international law,⁴² while Jutta Brunnée and Tamar Meshel then consider whether international environmental law, which also deals with an international common good, might serve as a blueprint for cyberspace governance.⁴³ Last but not least, Matthias Herdegen considers the possible international legal framework as well as possible reg-\n³⁹ See Christian Walter, Obligations of States Before, During, and After a Cyber Security Incident, GYIL 58 (2015), 67.\n⁴⁰ See Dörr (note 13).\n⁴¹ See August Reinisch/Markus Beham, Mitigating Risks: Inter-State Due Diligence Obligations in Case of Harmful Cyber-Incidents and Malicious Cyber-Activity: Obligations of the Transit State, GYIL 58 (2015), 101.\n⁴² See Kolb (note 13).\n⁴³ Brunnée/Meshel (note 13).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nulatory models for cyberspace, taking into account general due diligence obligations, but also institutional models for forms of enhanced inter-State cooperation in cyberspace.⁴⁴\n## X. Outlook\nAs with other areas of international law which have developed only during the last decades, such as international environmental law,⁴⁵ only time will tell whether the international community of States will be able and willing to come up with specific and adequate rules of international law applicable to ‘cyberspace’. Yet, as mentioned before, this is nothing peculiar to cyberspace. Rather, one has previously seen similar developments in other areas, international environmental law being a particularly relevant example at hand, before specific treaty regimes were later established.\nPending such a development, States and other actors can only rely on general, and thus necessarily relatively vague, rules of international law, such as the concept of due diligence, and attempt to apply them to human activities in cyberspace. It is for that reason that the various contributions to this Focus Section have concentrated on this very concept in considerable detail and from various perspectives.\nWe hope that this year’s GYIL overall Focus Section, by documenting the outcome of the 2013 cyber conference held in Berlin and organised jointly by the two authors of this brief introduction, may contribute to foster and further develop a legal framework for a peaceful use of cyberspace in the interest of the overall international community.\n⁴⁴ *Herdegen* (note 38).\n⁴⁵ As to the possibility of transposing principles developed within international environmental law to cyberspace, see, apart from the contribution by *Brunnée/Meshel* in this very Focus Section (note 13), also *Maraubn* (note 38), 465 et seq.",

Introduction\nThis year’s Focus Section of the German Yearbook of International Law (GYIL) contains and documents the results of a scientific conference organised by the German Federal Foreign Office in co-operation with the University of Potsdam in which both legal academics as well as practitioners from around the world participated.\nGiven that Germany has repeatedly underlined that securing the freedom and stability of cyberspace constitutes an important aim of German foreign policy, the German Federal Foreign Office organised (and continues to organise) a series of “Berlin Cyber Conferences”, intending to gather international cutting-edge expertise in the field of cyber security. The conference, the outcome of which is published hereinafter thanks to the efforts of the respective authors as well as those of the editors and the editorial staff of the GYIL for which we are particularly grateful, has been the third in this sequence of conferences, after the conference on “Challenges in Cyber Security – Risks, Strategies and Confidence-Building” held in December 2011, and the one on\n* Dr. jur. utr., M.A. (Oxon.), Ambassador of Germany to India; formerly Legal Adviser, Federal Foreign Office, Berlin.\n** Dr. jur., LL.M.

Given that these very principles also constituted the framework and overarching theme of the third 2013 Berlin cyber conference, the content and results of which are hereinafter documented, it is appropriate to quote three main points from his 2012 address, namely that:\nFirstly, freedom has to be our overriding priority in internet matters. Respect for the freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, the rights to access to information and the right to personal privacy must be ensured.\nSecondly, with freedom comes responsibility. This applies to societies in general. It applies to the global internet society in particular. Self-regulation should be an important principle of its governance. All stakeholders – individuals, companies, governments – have to act responsibly. Therefore, regulation has to step in when our values and rule of law are in danger or democratic legitimation is no longer assured.\nFinally, transparency and knowledge will help us to make informed decisions in line with our values. We will continue to share information, to include the global public, and to foster transparent policy dialogue.\n## II. Cyberspace and General International Law\nReaders of this very piece will read their newspapers online and might purchase some (or even all) of their gifts in the same manner. These simple examples alone, and\n See id., Conference on the Internet and Human Rights, 12 September 2012, available at: http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/sid_D911C8E0F05824607E17EFDF3F489C0E/EN/Aussenpolitik/Menschenrechte/Aktuell/120912-Konferenz-Internet-Menschenrechte.html (accessed on 23 September 2015).\n Speech by Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle at the conference \"The Internet and Human Rights: Building a Free, Open and Secure Internet\", 14 September 2012, available at: http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/EN/Infoservice/Presse/Reden/2012/120914-BM_Internet_MR.html?nn=648756 (accessed on 23 September 2015).\n See as to this issue also already Andreas Zimmermann, International Law and 'Cyber Space', ESIL Reflections, 10 January 2014, available at: http://www.esil-sedi.eu/sites/default/files/ESIL%20Reflections%20-%20Andreas%20Zimmermann.pdf (accessed on 23 September 2015).\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE\nmany others could obviously be added, demonstrate to what extent communication via the internet shapes our day-to-day-life, far beyond the news that from time to time make the headlines. At the same time, however, there are almost no specific norms of international law that specifically govern ‘cyberspace’ given that the underlying technology is so new.\nYet, it is not the first time that international law faces new technological developments. In earlier times, to give but two examples, international law was in a similarly sudden manner confronted with radio waves crossing boundaries, or was confronted with mankind being able to reach extraterrestrial bodies – and each time it was simply taken for granted, and rightly so, that such human behaviour was governed by pre-existing norms of international law.\nAnd as in those earlier cases, activities in ‘cyberspace’, too, are governed by international law as such, and be it only by the norm that where no (general or specific) rule prohibiting the behaviour in question exists, States have retained their freedom to act. This is, inter alia, confirmed by the work of the “Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security”, set up in the framework of the United Nations General Assembly’s First Committee. As its report of 7 June 2013 in New York quite rightly confirmed in unequivocal terms, “international law, and in particular the U.N. Charter, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT [i.e. information and communications technology] environment.” What is more is that the report also emphasised that “State sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to State conduct of ICT-related activities, and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory.”\n See generally on that issue Ulrich Fastenrath, Lücken im Völkerrecht: Zu Rechtscharakter, Quellen, Systemzusammenhang, Methodenlehre und Funktionen des Völkerrechts (1991), passim.\n Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, Report of 7 June 2013, UN Doc. A/68/98 (2013), available at: http://www.unidir.org/files/medias/pdfs/developments-in-the-field-of-information-and-telecommunications-in-the-context-of-international-security-2012-2013-a-68-98-eng-0-578.pdf (accessed on 23 September 2015).\n Ibid., 8.\n Ibid.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nHowever, as in earlier scenarios, it is for lack, for the time being, of more specific rules that the basic and more general norms of international law govern cyber activities, including concepts such as jurisdiction, attribution, or, in particular, the concept of due diligence. Given however the very general nature of those rules, as well as the lack of generally accepted, efficient, and rule-based inter-State international governance structures concerning the internet, ‘cyberspace’ nevertheless constitutes a major challenge for international law as it currently stands.\nIt is against this background that the various papers contained in this very Focus Section of the GYIL attempt to assess the extent to which, and how, human activities in cyberspace are indeed governed by international law, and what the applicable norms are. When studying the relevance of international law for cyberspace at this conference, it was not the primary objective either of its organisers or its participants to define restrictions or limitations for cyberspace freedom. On the contrary, the principal aim was to secure that cyberspace remains a sphere where individual actors exercise their freedom, where economic activity can flourish, and where States can operate effectively.\n## III. Notion of ‘Cyberspace’ and its Legal (Ir)relevance\nNot infrequently, when discussing which rules of international law apply to ‘cyberspace’, it is referred to as a mere virtual space where computer-mediated communication takes place but which cannot be spatially located. Yet, to state the obvious, any such communication requires hardware that must be located somewhere. What is more, any such information is then physically routed through the territory of one or more States (and possibly through outer space) before it reaches the addressee, which, again, confirms that there necessarily exists a territorial nexus of any activity in ‘cyberspace’ to at least one State. Accordingly, while ‘cyberspace’ might describe a phenomenon of information being routed through various jurisdictions, it still does not constitute some new form of ‘outer space’ where no State could, as a matter of international law, exercise its jurisdiction. Rather, it is more an issue of technical\n Zimmermann (note 4), 2; see also Nicholas Tsagourias, The Legal Status of Cyberspace, in: id./ Russell Buchan (eds.), Research Handbook on International Law and Cyberspace (2015), 13, 14 et seq.\n See generally as to jurisdictional issues related to ‘cyberspace’ Joachim Zekoll, Jurisdiction in Cyberspace, in: Günther Handl/Joachim Zekoll/Peer Zumbansen (eds.), Beyond Territoriality: Trans-\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE\n\n## IV. Challenges for International Law in Cyberspace\nAlthough communication in cyberspace is under international law *de jure* subject to the jurisdiction of one or more States, and thus does not constitute a novel phenomenon for international law as such, communication *via* the internet nevertheless, given its specific technical characteristics, does pose new challenges for international law. For one, and more generally, given the speed by which technological developments concerning cyberspace take place, the more traditional ways of creating norms of international law, be it by way of multilateral treaties, be it by way of developing rules of customary international law, run the danger of being the hare in a new form of ‘hare and hedgehog’ race. As a result, most currently existing norms of international law in this field are of a fairly general nature.\nThis phenomenon is compounded by an unwillingness of many States, as well as non-State actors such as multinational enterprises that have a technological lead in cyberspace, to have their behaviour in cyberspace regulated by specific treaty-based rules; these actors instead see the lack of effective international regulation of their activities as an advantage to be exploited. By the same token, given the enormous technological gap that exists between highly industrialised States and multinational companies, on the one hand, and smaller States on the other, many States might *de facto* not fully be in a position to exercise even a minimal form of control of cyberspace activities emanating from or affecting their territory; indeed, they might even lack sufficient capabilities to frame an appropriate regulatory (legal) framework governing such activities.\nMoreover, both the *de facto* (but *de facto* only!) de-territorialisation of cyberspace activities (in that information is being routed through a large number of States and territories) and the sheer amount of information being produced might lead to a lack\nnational Legal Authority in an Age of Globalization (2012), 341–369; Uta Kohl, Jurisdiction in Cyberspace, in: Tsagourias/Buchan (eds.) (note 9), 30.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nof effective regulatory mechanisms to be used by States when it comes to detecting, and eventually addressing, harmful activities in cyberspace, regardless of whether they emanate from private actors or from other States.\nAnother aspect of such de facto de-territorialisation of cyberspace activities can be seen in the fact that the effects of activities in cyberspace, even when they emanate from States, often occur abroad, which in many cases raises the question whether the international obligations a State has undertaken (be they treaty-based or of a customary nature) also apply in such cross-boundary and extraterritorial settings.\nMoreover, given the technological environment in which cyberspace activities occur, it will be often, if not always, difficult or even impossible, to trace back any such activities, even when they emanate from actors whose actions would otherwise be attributable to a given State under applicable norms of international law, as codified in the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility. Accordingly, in many cases, while the general law on State responsibility is applicable as such, it might not be fully adequate to regulate cyberspace-related activities. This in turn requires international law to either develop specific norms of attribution (including specific evidentiary norms), or to come up with specific primary norms that can adequately address the matter.\nV. Cyberspace, the Prohibition of the Use of Force, and Jus in Bello\nCyber security is, first and foremost, an item of the international law of peace, or, to paraphrase the former German President Gustav Heinemann, who once put it succinctly, albeit in a somewhat different context, ‘peace constitutes the real emergency\n GA Res. 56/83 of 28 January 2002, Annex.\n See on this issue Michael N. Schmitt, Cyber Activities and the Law of Countermeasures, in: Katharina Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy (2013), 659, 668 et seq; Constantine Antonopoulos, State Responsibility in Cyberspace, in: Tsagourias/Buchan (eds.) (note 9), 55.\n See as to this issue also the contributions by Robert Kolb, Reflections on Due Diligence Duties and Cyberspace, German Yearbook of International Law (GYIL) 58 (2015), 113; Oliver Dörr, Obligations of the State of Origin of a Cyber Security Incident, GYIL 58 (2015), 87; Jutta Brunneé/Tamar Meshel, Teaching an Old Law New Tricks: International Environmental Law Lessons for Cyberspace Governance, GYIL 58 (2015), 129.\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE 57\nin which international law has to prove itself. Indeed, it follows from the very Charter of the United Nations (UN Charter) that peace and security take precedence in international relations, and this, obviously, holds also true when it comes to inter-State relations in cyberspace.\nHence, neither issues of the use of armed force (jus ad bellum) nor jus in bello issues were what the conference, whose proceedings are reproduced here, wanted to address. Rather, it was the peacetime scenario below the threshold of an armed conflict that this conference focussed upon. Moreover, the conference was not about national security electronic surveillance programmes either, which indeed raise very specific issues beyond the realm of general international law. Indeed, we believe that the overall debate on ‘cyber security’ with its main focus on cyber warfare is, to a large degree, so far at least, somewhat one-sided.\nWhile, obviously, both jus ad bellum and jus in bello rules do apply, as a matter of course, to activities in cyberspace, such activities do not normally reach, and so far have not reached, the threshold of Article 2 (4) UN Charter. Having said this, it is, of course, conceivable that a harmful cyberspace activity that is attributable to a State could amount to a violation of Article 2 (4) UN Charter, given its character and effects. Whenever such use of force even reaches the threshold of an armed attack, as defined by general rules of international law and, in particular, the case-law of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), in principle, the right of self-defence comes into play. In that regard, ‘cyber attacks’ (provided they do amount to armed attacks in the first place, which will probably be the case only rarely), just like other armed attacks, might raise the question whether such attacks, if they emanate from non-\n Gustav Heinemann, Inaugural Address “Dem Frieden dienen”, German Federal Parliament Plenary Protocol No. 05/245 of 1 July 1969, in: Verhandlungen des Deutschen Bundestages 1969, Vol. 70, 13661, 13664, 13665, available at: http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btp/05/05245.pdf (accessed on 5 November 2015): “Nicht der Krieg ist der Ernstfall, [...] sondern der Frieden ist der Ernstfall, in dem wir alle uns zu bewähren haben.” “War is not the quintessential emergency [...] rather, peace is the emergency in which we all have to prove ourselves” (English text available at: http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=169&amp;language=english (accessed on 23 September 2015)).\n Charter of the United Nations, 26 June 1945, UNCIO 15, 335 (UN Charter).\n But see most recently the various contributions in Ziolkowski (ed.)

What is more, in such scenarios the question who carries the burden of proof will usually arise, not only as to the attribution of a given activity to a State or other actor, but also as to its attribution to a specific State. In these respects, the judgment of the ICJ in the *Oil Platforms* case is of particular relevance.\nBy the same token, once the threshold of an (international or non-international) armed conflict has either been reached by a cyber attack as such, or where cyber attacks are being undertaken as part of already ongoing hostilities, applicable norms of international humanitarian law also govern cyberspace-related activities that are undertaken as part of the armed conflict and that constitute an ‘attack’ within the meaning of international humanitarian law. Yet, ‘cyber warfare’ raises significant, and so far largely unresolved, questions, *inter alia* as to the character of cyber installations as military objects as well as to the legal characterisation of persons involved in cyber operations. State practice has not yet fully addressed these questions.\n## VI.

Schmitt (ed.), Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (2013), passim.\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE\ntion. Moreover, it also has to ensure the full functioning of cyberspace as a basic pillar of international economic activity and social activity.\nThis is challenged by the ability of States (and indeed private actors) to effectively collect comprehensive information on any given person active on the internet in one way or the other. This reality leads to the question whether human rights standards, and namely guarantees relating to privacy, also apply in ‘cyberspace’ as a matter of their applicability *ratione materiae* and *ratione loci*.\nApart from specific treaty-based norms that may be applicable in a given case (such as e.g. the Council of Europe’s Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data), the area lacks specific rules. For one, it might be asked whether *de lege lata* all electronic data available in cyberspace are comprehensively protected by the concepts of ‘privacy’ and/or ‘correspondence’ under Article 17 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), one of the issues (not yet conclusively resolved) being whether the 1966 ICCPR (or parallel norms of customary international law) can be interpreted in a manner as to also cover forms of communication not explicitly foreseen in 1966.\nFurthermore (provided one assumes that the relevant rules of international law do apply *ratione materiae* to cyberspace), one has to answer an additional question relating to the extraterritorial applicability of the right of privacy. Namely, the question arises whether, under either customary law or under Article 17 ICCPR, an individual who is not present on the territory of a State collecting the private data of this very individual *via* the internet finds himself “within the jurisdiction” of said State within the meaning of Article 2 (1) ICCPR (or the parallel norm of customary law). It is only if one were to provide a positive answer to this question that the applicability of the right to privacy would be triggered.\n See generally as to this issue also the contribution by Dinah PoKempner, Cyberspace and State Obligations in the Area of Human Rights, in: Ziolkowski (ed.) (note 12), 239; David P. Fidler, Cyberspace and Human Rights, in: Tsagourias/Buchan (eds.)

Cyberspace Governance: Which Way Forward?\nUnlike most other areas of international law, cyberspace so far lacks any significant inter-governmental governance structure. Rather, key private organisations acting with the aim of preserving the operational stability of the internet, such as ICANN, the “Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers,” as well as interconnection and peering agreements among internet service providers, provide for some form of self-regulatory capabilities of cyberspace. It remains to be seen whether this form of self-regulation will continue to be able to provide sufficient safeguards as to the functioning of the internet, in line with the applicable principles of international law outlined above, or whether one should not aim at some form of intergovernmental internet governance. Yet, recent initiatives within the International Telecommunication Union’s (ITU) system have shown that such attempts of coming up with universally accepted inter-State governance structures might run the risk of being (mis-)used for subjecting cyberspace-based activities to over-broad governmental regulation (or, in other words, censorship), and thus run the risk of limiting rather than protecting the human rights of internet users.\n GA Res. 68/167 of 18 December 2013. See also on this Resolution Martin Weiler, The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age: The Commitment to Human Rights Online, GYII. 57 (2014), 651.\n GA Res. 68/167 (note 26), para. 5.\n Human Rights Council, The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age, UN Doc. A/HRC/27/37 (2014).\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE 61\nAt the same time, States share an interest in maintaining cyberspace free from interruptions, *i.e.* a cyberspace which is not misused in a way that unduly affects other States, their infrastructure, or their population. In order to function in such a way, cyberspace presupposes and requires a certain behaviour of States. The set of rules for such behaviour ought to possess a legally binding character. It is submitted that time has come to identify common legal understandings for cyberspace that serve to prevent direct damages caused by cyber activities, as well as to limit harm and loss resulting from such damages. This indeed is what the conference, which led to the various contributions to be found beneath, was all about. In approaching this question, the guiding (and indeed self-evident) principle must be strict adherence to international law including, in particular, human rights, and the established principles of State responsibility.\n## VIII. Cyberspace and Inter-State Due Diligence Obligations\nThe starting point for any research into States’ obligations in cyberspace has to be its complexity and its interconnectivity as well as the network character of cyberspace. As in other areas where interests of different States are intrinsically intertwined, this requires that States respect legitimate interests of other States within cyberspace and cooperate in responding to threats to the common sphere of interest.\nWithin the international community, there is consensus that there exists a general obligation of States to prevent their territory (and hence also cyberspace-related infrastructure located on their territory) from being used for acts contrary to the rights of other States, unlawfully harming such other States. The leading case on this question is, of course, the merits judgment of the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case. As the Court then put it, a State breaches this obligation if it fails to act with due diligence. This principle of international law is referred to as both the “principle of due\n *Geiß/Lahmann* (note 19), 632 et seq.\n ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland *v.* Albania), Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 4.\n *Ibid.*, 22, where the Court *inter alia* refers to “every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\ndiligence” and also the “no harm principle”, describing two elements of one and the same obligation.\nNo matter how this principle is labelled, it is of particular relevance in cases where harmful actions either cannot be attributed to a particular State or where only insufficient proof for such attribution can be provided by the victim State.\nAs is well-known, historically the concept of due diligence was developed with regard to the responsibility of States for the behaviour of private actors. States are expected to take preventive measures in their sphere of exclusive control, when internationally unlawful harm is being caused by actions of private persons. The respective invocation of due diligence can be traced back to the Alabama Arbitration of 1872.\nUnder modern international law, the scope of the due diligence principle transcends its historical origins. There seems to be consensus that due diligence constitutes a general principle of law, both in the field of international environmental law and in situations of risk of other transboundary harm. It accordingly only seems logical to apply the concept of due diligence also when it comes to situations of risk of transboundary harm within cyberspace.\nThe application of this principle would mean that all States share a common obligation to ensure that neither their territory, nor hardware and cyber infrastructure situated on their territory or under their effective control, is misused to harm other States or their residents.\n Timo Koivurova, Due Diligence, Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL), February 2010, paras. 1 et seq., available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 23 September 2015).\n Ibid., para. 3.\n Alabama Claims (United States of America, Great Britain), Arbitral Award of 8 May 1871, Reports of International Arbitral Awards XXIX, 125; see also Tom Bingham, Alabama Arbitration, MPEPIL, October 2006, para. 7, available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 23 September 2015).\n Koivurova (note 32), para. 9.\n ICJ, Corfu Channel (note 30), 4, 22; Günther Handl, Transboundary Impact, in: Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of International Environmental Law (2007), 531, 541 (with further references); Pierre-Marie Dupuy, Formation of Customary International Law and General Principles, in: Bodansky/Brunnée/Hey (eds.)

A/56/10 (2001), 377, General Commentary, para. 3.\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE 63\nDue diligence could thus be regarded as a minimum standard providing a test whether a specific State conduct is up to what a ‘good government’ would do in such situations of transboundary risk. Therefore, the argument can validly be made that due diligence does not necessarily require identical measures from all States. As a matter of fact, a certain lack of economic and technological capacity of a particular State might reduce its due diligence obligations. Moreover, the requirements due diligence sets out are context-specific. Different measures might be required in different circumstances. It also seems that there can be different legal requirements for a State depending on whether a harmful activity has its origin or its effect in its territory.\nIn all these cases, due diligence could entail both substantive and/or procedural obligations. The latter ones may require States to create specific institutional capacities. Moreover, there could be a duty to cooperate in cases of transboundary harm. Additionally, responsibilities might change during the different stages of harmful activities. Whereas duties of prevention might dominate before any harmful act is committed, during or after such an act, it is cooperation between States that might primarily be required then.\nFinally, the concept of ‘harm’ inflicted on other States also needs special attention. It seems that not every harm inflicted on another State automatically entails that due diligence obligations have been violated. Rather, there appears to be a threshold triggering such due diligence obligations.\nIn light of the results to be found in the various contributions compiled hereinafter as part of this year’s GYIL Focus Section, one might tentatively formulate the following guidelines:\nPrior to potentially harmful cyber activities, States could be obliged to take all measures necessary to prevent misuse of the cyber infrastructure under their jurisdiction or their effective control. Moreover, they could be required to ensure that any perpe\n Patricia Birnie/Alan Boyle/Catherine Redgwell (eds.), International Law and the Environment (3rd ed. 2009), 149; Brunneé/Meshel (note 13), 134 et seq.; Benedikt Pirker, Territorial Sovereignty and Integrity and the Challenge of Cyberspace, in: Ziolkowski (ed.)

This might encompass an obligation to build up specific institutional capacities. At the same time, for one, States can in any event be only obliged to do what is technically feasible in light of their respective abilities – *ultra posse nemo obligatur* – and besides, one must carefully balance any such oversight with legitimate privacy rights of individual internet users.\n*During* an ongoing cyber attack, considerations of due diligence might require that the State of origin and/or the transit States take all appropriate measures to stop these activities. In order not to jump from the frying pan into the fire, States should probably ensure that their responsive measures intrude as little as possible on the network communications process necessary to stop the attack.\n*In the aftermath* of a cyber attack, all States concerned, in particular the State of origin and possible transit States, could be required to take steps necessary to identify the source of the harmful activity and to prevent a repetition of similar future actions. Possible target States should in turn prepare their network infrastructure to ensure that the impact of an attack remains as limited as possible. Probably, States should in particular do all that is necessary to ensure resilience of their critical infrastructure and to prevent the possibility of negative repercussions on critical civil infrastructure, including electricity networks, water supplies, or nuclear power plants.\nFinally, due diligence might also require States to disclose intelligence concerning harmful acts against their cyber infrastructure, at least as long as national security interests are not compromised. Thereby, a State would enable other States to implement effective preventive measures before becoming the target of similar attacks. This might require establishing national points of contact facilitating the exchange of information between affected States.\nAt the same time two important points warrant underlining: First, none of the principles introduced here should in any way impede the application of the prohibition of the use of force, the right to self-defence, the rules of international humanitarian law, if applicable, or the principles of State responsibility in case damaging activities can be attributed to a specific State.\nSecond, whatever obligations States might have in preventing or minimising harm caused by cyber attacks, it should not be forgotten that cyberspace must remain a place where individual actors exercise their freedom, where economic activity can\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE\nflourish, and where States can operate effectively. Responsible State practice adhering to due diligence could provide a durable and solid basis to ensure such a cyberspace.\n## IX. Structure and Content of the Focus Section\nIt is in light of these considerations that the conveners of the conference, whose papers are published in this Focus Section, have requested the various authors to address some of the crucial, so far largely unanswered legal questions deriving from the applicability of this generally accepted, but very general concept of due diligence to ‘cyberspace’.\nMore specifically, the opening piece by Christian Walter considers the “Obligations of States Before, During, and After a Cyber Security Incident” as they arise under general international law and notably the concept of due diligence. Oliver Dörr then specifically addresses possible “Obligations of the State of Origin of a Cyber Security Incident”, while August Reinisch and Markus Beham deal with and analyse the specific obligations of transit States in their contribution entitled “Mitigating Risks: Inter-State Due Diligence Obligations in Case of Harmful Cyber-Incidents and Malicious Cyber-Activity: Obligations of the Transit State”.\nIn turn Robert Kolb reflects more generally on the concept of due diligence duties and their relevance concerning cyberspace from the standpoint of general international law, while Jutta Brunnée and Tamar Meshel then consider whether international environmental law, which also deals with an international common good, might serve as a blueprint for cyberspace governance. Last but not least, Matthias Herdegen considers the possible international legal framework as well as possible reg-\n See Christian Walter, Obligations of States Before, During, and After a Cyber Security Incident, GYIL 58 (2015), 67.\n See Dörr (note 13).\n See August Reinisch/Markus Beham, Mitigating Risks: Inter-State Due Diligence Obligations in Case of Harmful Cyber-Incidents and Malicious Cyber-Activity: Obligations of the Transit State, GYIL 58 (2015), 101.\n See Kolb (note 13).\n Brunnée/Meshel (note 13).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nulatory models for cyberspace, taking into account general due diligence obligations, but also institutional models for forms of enhanced inter-State cooperation in cyberspace.\n## X. Outlook\nAs with other areas of international law which have developed only during the last decades, such as international environmental law, only time will tell whether the international community of States will be able and willing to come up with specific and adequate rules of international law applicable to ‘cyberspace’. Yet, as mentioned before, this is nothing peculiar to cyberspace. Rather, one has previously seen similar developments in other areas, international environmental law being a particularly relevant example at hand, before specific treaty regimes were later established.\nPending such a development, States and other actors can only rely on general, and thus necessarily relatively vague, rules of international law, such as the concept of due diligence, and attempt to apply them to human activities in cyberspace. It is for that reason that the various contributions to this Focus Section have concentrated on this very concept in considerable detail and from various perspectives.\nWe hope that this year’s GYIL overall Focus Section, by documenting the outcome of the 2013 cyber conference held in Berlin and organised jointly by the two authors of this brief introduction, may contribute to foster and further develop a legal framework for a peaceful use of cyberspace in the interest of the overall international community.\n *Herdegen* (note 38).\n As to the possibility of transposing principles developed within international environmental law to cyberspace, see, apart from the contribution by *Brunnée/Meshel* in this very Focus Section (note 13), also *Maraubn* (note 38), 465 et seq.",

Introduction\nThis year’s Focus Section of the German Yearbook of International Law (GYIL) contains and documents the results of a scientific conference organised by the German Federal Foreign Office in co-operation with the University of Potsdam in which both legal academics as well as practitioners from around the world participated.\nGiven that Germany has repeatedly underlined that securing the freedom and stability of cyberspace constitutes an important aim of German foreign policy, the German Federal Foreign Office organised (and continues to organise) a series of “Berlin Cyber Conferences”, intending to gather international cutting-edge expertise in the field of cyber security. The conference, the outcome of which is published hereinafter thanks to the efforts of the respective authors as well as those of the editors and the editorial staff of the GYIL for which we are particularly grateful, has been the third in this sequence of conferences, after the conference on “Challenges in Cyber Security – Risks, Strategies and Confidence-Building” held in December 2011, and the one on\n* Dr. jur. utr., M.A. (Oxon.), Ambassador of Germany to India; formerly Legal Adviser, Federal Foreign Office, Berlin.\n** Dr. jur., LL.M.

Given that these very principles also constituted the framework and overarching theme of the third 2013 Berlin cyber conference, the content and results of which are hereinafter documented, it is appropriate to quote three main points from his 2012 address, namely that:\nFirstly, freedom has to be our overriding priority in internet matters. Respect for the freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, the rights to access to information and the right to personal privacy must be ensured.\nSecondly, with freedom comes responsibility. This applies to societies in general. It applies to the global internet society in particular. Self-regulation should be an important principle of its governance. All stakeholders – individuals, companies, governments – have to act responsibly. Therefore, regulation has to step in when our values and rule of law are in danger or democratic legitimation is no longer assured.\nFinally, transparency and knowledge will help us to make informed decisions in line with our values. We will continue to share information, to include the global public, and to foster transparent policy dialogue.\n## II. Cyberspace and General International Law\nReaders of this very piece will read their newspapers online and might purchase some (or even all) of their gifts in the same manner.

At the same time, however, there are almost no specific norms of international law that specifically govern ‘cyberspace’ given that the underlying technology is so new.\nYet, it is not the first time that international law faces new technological developments. In earlier times, to give but two examples, international law was in a similarly sudden manner confronted with radio waves crossing boundaries, or was confronted with mankind being able to reach extraterrestrial bodies – and each time it was simply taken for granted, and rightly so, that such human behaviour was governed by pre-existing norms of international law.\nAnd as in those earlier cases, activities in ‘cyberspace’, too, are governed by international law as such, and be it only by the norm that where no (general or specific) rule prohibiting the behaviour in question exists, States have retained their freedom to act. This is, inter alia, confirmed by the work of the “Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security”, set up in the framework of the United Nations General Assembly’s First Committee. As its report of 7 June 2013 in New York quite rightly confirmed in unequivocal terms, “international law, and in particular the U.N. Charter, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT [i.e. information and communications technology] environment.” What is more is that the report also emphasised that “State sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to State conduct of ICT-related activities, and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory.”\n See generally on that issue Ulrich Fastenrath, Lücken im Völkerrecht: Zu Rechtscharakter, Quellen, Systemzusammenhang, Methodenlehre und Funktionen des Völkerrechts (1991), passim.\n Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, Report of 7 June 2013, UN Doc. A/68/98 (2013), available at: http://www.unidir.org/files/medias/pdfs/developments-in-the-field-of-information-and-telecommunications-in-the-context-of-international-security-2012-2013-a-68-98-eng-0-578.pdf (accessed on 23 September 2015).\n Ibid., 8.\n Ibid.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nHowever, as in earlier scenarios, it is for lack, for the time being, of more specific rules that the basic and more general norms of international law govern cyber activities, including concepts such as jurisdiction, attribution, or, in particular, the concept of due diligence. Given however the very general nature of those rules, as well as the lack of generally accepted, efficient, and rule-based inter-State international governance structures concerning the internet, ‘cyberspace’ nevertheless constitutes a major challenge for international law as it currently stands.\nIt is against this background that the various papers contained in this very Focus Section of the GYIL attempt to assess the extent to which, and how, human activities in cyberspace are indeed governed by international law, and what the applicable norms are. When studying the relevance of international law for cyberspace at this conference, it was not the primary objective either of its organisers or its participants to define restrictions or limitations for cyberspace freedom. On the contrary, the principal aim was to secure that cyberspace remains a sphere where individual actors exercise their freedom, where economic activity can flourish, and where States can operate effectively.\n## III. Notion of ‘Cyberspace’ and its Legal (Ir)relevance\nNot infrequently, when discussing which rules of international law apply to ‘cyberspace’, it is referred to as a mere virtual space where computer-mediated communication takes place but which cannot be spatially located. Yet, to state the obvious, any such communication requires hardware that must be located somewhere. What is more, any such information is then physically routed through the territory of one or more States (and possibly through outer space) before it reaches the addressee, which, again, confirms that there necessarily exists a territorial nexus of any activity in ‘cyberspace’ to at least one State. Accordingly, while ‘cyberspace’ might describe a phenomenon of information being routed through various jurisdictions, it still does not constitute some new form of ‘outer space’ where no State could, as a matter of international law, exercise its jurisdiction. Rather, it is more an issue of technical\n Zimmermann (note 4), 2; see also Nicholas Tsagourias, The Legal Status of Cyberspace, in: id./ Russell Buchan (eds.), Research Handbook on International Law and Cyberspace (2015), 13, 14 et seq.\n See generally as to jurisdictional issues related to ‘cyberspace’ Joachim Zekoll, Jurisdiction in Cyberspace, in: Günther Handl/Joachim Zekoll/Peer Zumbansen (eds.), Beyond Territoriality: Trans-\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE\n\n## IV. Challenges for International Law in Cyberspace\nAlthough communication in cyberspace is under international law *de jure* subject to the jurisdiction of one or more States, and thus does not constitute a novel phenomenon for international law as such, communication *via* the internet nevertheless, given its specific technical characteristics, does pose new challenges for international law. For one, and more generally, given the speed by which technological developments concerning cyberspace take place, the more traditional ways of creating norms of international law, be it by way of multilateral treaties, be it by way of developing rules of customary international law, run the danger of being the hare in a new form of ‘hare and hedgehog’ race. As a result, most currently existing norms of international law in this field are of a fairly general nature.\nThis phenomenon is compounded by an unwillingness of many States, as well as non-State actors such as multinational enterprises that have a technological lead in cyberspace, to have their behaviour in cyberspace regulated by specific treaty-based rules; these actors instead see the lack of effective international regulation of their activities as an advantage to be exploited. By the same token, given the enormous technological gap that exists between highly industrialised States and multinational companies, on the one hand, and smaller States on the other, many States might *de facto* not fully be in a position to exercise even a minimal form of control of cyberspace activities emanating from or affecting their territory; indeed, they might even lack sufficient capabilities to frame an appropriate regulatory (legal) framework governing such activities.\nMoreover, both the *de facto* (but *de facto* only!) de-territorialisation of cyberspace activities (in that information is being routed through a large number of States and territories) and the sheer amount of information being produced might lead to a lack\nnational Legal Authority in an Age of Globalization (2012), 341–369; Uta Kohl, Jurisdiction in Cyberspace, in: Tsagourias/Buchan (eds.) (note 9), 30.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nof effective regulatory mechanisms to be used by States when it comes to detecting, and eventually addressing, harmful activities in cyberspace, regardless of whether they emanate from private actors or from other States.\nAnother aspect of such de facto de-territorialisation of cyberspace activities can be seen in the fact that the effects of activities in cyberspace, even when they emanate from States, often occur abroad, which in many cases raises the question whether the international obligations a State has undertaken (be they treaty-based or of a customary nature) also apply in such cross-boundary and extraterritorial settings.\nMoreover, given the technological environment in which cyberspace activities occur, it will be often, if not always, difficult or even impossible, to trace back any such activities, even when they emanate from actors whose actions would otherwise be attributable to a given State under applicable norms of international law, as codified in the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility. Accordingly, in many cases, while the general law on State responsibility is applicable as such, it might not be fully adequate to regulate cyberspace-related activities. This in turn requires international law to either develop specific norms of attribution (including specific evidentiary norms), or to come up with specific primary norms that can adequately address the matter.\nV. Cyberspace, the Prohibition of the Use of Force, and Jus in Bello\nCyber security is, first and foremost, an item of the international law of peace, or, to paraphrase the former German President Gustav Heinemann, who once put it succinctly, albeit in a somewhat different context, ‘peace constitutes the real emergency\n GA Res. 56/83 of 28 January 2002, Annex.\n See on this issue Michael N.

(note 9), 55.\n See as to this issue also the contributions by Robert Kolb, Reflections on Due Diligence Duties and Cyberspace, German Yearbook of International Law (GYIL) 58 (2015), 113; Oliver Dörr, Obligations of the State of Origin of a Cyber Security Incident, GYIL 58 (2015), 87; Jutta Brunneé/Tamar Meshel, Teaching an Old Law New Tricks: International Environmental Law Lessons for Cyberspace Governance, GYIL 58 (2015), 129.\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE 57\nin which international law has to prove itself. Indeed, it follows from the very Charter of the United Nations (UN Charter) that peace and security take precedence in international relations, and this, obviously, holds also true when it comes to inter-State relations in cyberspace.\nHence, neither issues of the use of armed force (jus ad bellum) nor jus in bello issues were what the conference, whose proceedings are reproduced here, wanted to address. Rather, it was the peacetime scenario below the threshold of an armed conflict that this conference focussed upon. Moreover, the conference was not about national security electronic surveillance programmes either, which indeed raise very specific issues beyond the realm of general international law. Indeed, we believe that the overall debate on ‘cyber security’ with its main focus on cyber warfare is, to a large degree, so far at least, somewhat one-sided.\nWhile, obviously, both jus ad bellum and jus in bello rules do apply, as a matter of course, to activities in cyberspace, such activities do not normally reach, and so far have not reached, the threshold of Article 2 (4) UN Charter. Having said this, it is, of course, conceivable that a harmful cyberspace activity that is attributable to a State could amount to a violation of Article 2 (4) UN Charter, given its character and effects. Whenever such use of force even reaches the threshold of an armed attack, as defined by general rules of international law and, in particular, the case-law of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), in principle, the right of self-defence comes into play. In that regard, ‘cyber attacks’ (provided they do amount to armed attacks in the first place, which will probably be the case only rarely), just like other armed attacks, might raise the question whether such attacks, if they emanate from non-\n Gustav Heinemann, Inaugural Address “Dem Frieden dienen”, German Federal Parliament Plenary Protocol No. 05/245 of 1 July 1969, in: Verhandlungen des Deutschen Bundestages 1969, Vol. 70, 13661, 13664, 13665, available at: http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btp/05/05245.pdf (accessed on 5 November 2015): “Nicht der Krieg ist der Ernstfall, [...] sondern der Frieden ist der Ernstfall, in dem wir alle uns zu bewähren haben.” “War is not the quintessential emergency [...] rather, peace is the emergency in which we all have to prove ourselves” (English text available at: http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=169&amp;language=english (accessed on 23 September 2015)).\n Charter of the United Nations, 26 June 1945, UNCIO 15, 335 (UN Charter).\n But see most recently the various contributions in Ziolkowski (ed.)

What is more, in such scenarios the question who carries the burden of proof will usually arise, not only as to the attribution of a given activity to a State or other actor, but also as to its attribution to a specific State. In these respects, the judgment of the ICJ in the *Oil Platforms* case is of particular relevance.\nBy the same token, once the threshold of an (international or non-international) armed conflict has either been reached by a cyber attack as such, or where cyber attacks are being undertaken as part of already ongoing hostilities, applicable norms of international humanitarian law also govern cyberspace-related activities that are undertaken as part of the armed conflict and that constitute an ‘attack’ within the meaning of international humanitarian law. Yet, ‘cyber warfare’ raises significant, and so far largely unresolved, questions, *inter alia* as to the character of cyber installations as military objects as well as to the legal characterisation of persons involved in cyber operations. State practice has not yet fully addressed these questions.\n## VI. Cyberspace, Human Rights, and Data Protection: The Need to Develop Appropriate Legal Standards\nForeign policy has the responsibility to ensure that cyberspace remains a basis for communicating freely and for enjoying those rights that are fundamental to any democratic society, most notably the freedom of speech and the freedom of informa\n---\n See as to this issue *Peter Margulies*, Sovereignty and Cyber Attacks: Technology’s Challenge to the Law of State Responsibility, Melbourne Journal of International Law 14 (2013), 1; *Dieter Fleck*, Searching for International Rules Applicable to Cyber Warfare: A Critical First Assessment of the New Tallinn Manual, Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law 18 (2013), 331; *Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg*, Chapter 1: The Tallinn Manual and International Cyber Security Law, Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law 15 (2012), 3; *Nicholas Tsagourias*, Chapter 2: The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare: A Commentary on Chapter II: The Use of Force, Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law 15 (2012), 19; *Robin Geiß/Henning Lahmann*, Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention, in: *Ziolkowski (ed.)* (note 12), 621; *Carlo Focarelli*, Self-Defence in Cyberspace, in: *Tsagourias/Buchan* (eds.)

Schmitt (ed.), Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (2013), passim.\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE\ntion. Moreover, it also has to ensure the full functioning of cyberspace as a basic pillar of international economic activity and social activity.\nThis is challenged by the ability of States (and indeed private actors) to effectively collect comprehensive information on any given person active on the internet in one way or the other. This reality leads to the question whether human rights standards, and namely guarantees relating to privacy, also apply in ‘cyberspace’ as a matter of their applicability *ratione materiae* and *ratione loci*.\nApart from specific treaty-based norms that may be applicable in a given case (such as e.g. the Council of Europe’s Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data), the area lacks specific rules. For one, it might be asked whether *de lege lata* all electronic data available in cyberspace are comprehensively protected by the concepts of ‘privacy’ and/or ‘correspondence’ under Article 17 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), one of the issues (not yet conclusively resolved) being whether the 1966 ICCPR (or parallel norms of customary international law) can be interpreted in a manner as to also cover forms of communication not explicitly foreseen in 1966.\nFurthermore (provided one assumes that the relevant rules of international law do apply *ratione materiae* to cyberspace), one has to answer an additional question relating to the extraterritorial applicability of the right of privacy. Namely, the question arises whether, under either customary law or under Article 17 ICCPR, an individual who is not present on the territory of a State collecting the private data of this very individual *via* the internet finds himself “within the jurisdiction” of said State within the meaning of Article 2 (1) ICCPR (or the parallel norm of customary law). It is only if one were to provide a positive answer to this question that the applicability of the right to privacy would be triggered.\n See generally as to this issue also the contribution by Dinah PoKempner, Cyberspace and State Obligations in the Area of Human Rights, in: Ziolkowski (ed.) (note 12), 239; David P. Fidler, Cyberspace and Human Rights, in: Tsagourias/Buchan (eds.)

Cyberspace Governance: Which Way Forward?\nUnlike most other areas of international law, cyberspace so far lacks any significant inter-governmental governance structure. Rather, key private organisations acting with the aim of preserving the operational stability of the internet, such as ICANN, the “Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers,” as well as interconnection and peering agreements among internet service providers, provide for some form of self-regulatory capabilities of cyberspace. It remains to be seen whether this form of self-regulation will continue to be able to provide sufficient safeguards as to the functioning of the internet, in line with the applicable principles of international law outlined above, or whether one should not aim at some form of intergovernmental internet governance. Yet, recent initiatives within the International Telecommunication Union’s (ITU) system have shown that such attempts of coming up with universally accepted inter-State governance structures might run the risk of being (mis-)used for subjecting cyberspace-based activities to over-broad governmental regulation (or, in other words, censorship), and thus run the risk of limiting rather than protecting the human rights of internet users.\n GA Res. 68/167 of 18 December 2013. See also on this Resolution Martin Weiler, The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age: The Commitment to Human Rights Online, GYII. 57 (2014), 651.\n GA Res. 68/167 (note 26), para. 5.\n Human Rights Council, The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age, UN Doc. A/HRC/27/37 (2014).\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE 61\nAt the same time, States share an interest in maintaining cyberspace free from interruptions, *i.e.* a cyberspace which is not misused in a way that unduly affects other States, their infrastructure, or their population. In order to function in such a way, cyberspace presupposes and requires a certain behaviour of States. The set of rules for such behaviour ought to possess a legally binding character. It is submitted that time has come to identify common legal understandings for cyberspace that serve to prevent direct damages caused by cyber activities, as well as to limit harm and loss resulting from such damages. This indeed is what the conference, which led to the various contributions to be found beneath, was all about. In approaching this question, the guiding (and indeed self-evident) principle must be strict adherence to international law including, in particular, human rights, and the established principles of State responsibility.\n## VIII. Cyberspace and Inter-State Due Diligence Obligations\nThe starting point for any research into States’ obligations in cyberspace has to be its complexity and its interconnectivity as well as the network character of cyberspace. As in other areas where interests of different States are intrinsically intertwined, this requires that States respect legitimate interests of other States within cyberspace and cooperate in responding to threats to the common sphere of interest.\nWithin the international community, there is consensus that there exists a general obligation of States to prevent their territory (and hence also cyberspace-related infrastructure located on their territory) from being used for acts contrary to the rights of other States, unlawfully harming such other States. The leading case on this question is, of course, the merits judgment of the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case. As the Court then put it, a State breaches this obligation if it fails to act with due diligence. This principle of international law is referred to as both the “principle of due\n *Geiß/Lahmann* (note 19), 632 et seq.\n ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland *v.* Albania), Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 4.\n *Ibid.*, 22, where the Court *inter alia* refers to “every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\ndiligence” and also the “no harm principle”, describing two elements of one and the same obligation.\nNo matter how this principle is labelled, it is of particular relevance in cases where harmful actions either cannot be attributed to a particular State or where only insufficient proof for such attribution can be provided by the victim State.\nAs is well-known, historically the concept of due diligence was developed with regard to the responsibility of States for the behaviour of private actors. States are expected to take preventive measures in their sphere of exclusive control, when internationally unlawful harm is being caused by actions of private persons. The respective invocation of due diligence can be traced back to the Alabama Arbitration of 1872.\nUnder modern international law, the scope of the due diligence principle transcends its historical origins. There seems to be consensus that due diligence constitutes a general principle of law, both in the field of international environmental law and in situations of risk of other transboundary harm. It accordingly only seems logical to apply the concept of due diligence also when it comes to situations of risk of transboundary harm within cyberspace.\nThe application of this principle would mean that all States share a common obligation to ensure that neither their territory, nor hardware and cyber infrastructure situated on their territory or under their effective control, is misused to harm other States or their residents.\n Timo Koivurova, Due Diligence, Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL), February 2010, paras. 1 et seq., available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 23 September 2015).\n Ibid., para. 3.\n Alabama Claims (United States of America, Great Britain), Arbitral Award of 8 May 1871, Reports of International Arbitral Awards XXIX, 125; see also Tom Bingham, Alabama Arbitration, MPEPIL, October 2006, para. 7, available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 23 September 2015).\n Koivurova (note 32), para. 9.\n ICJ, Corfu Channel (note 30), 4, 22; Günther Handl, Transboundary Impact, in: Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of International Environmental Law (2007), 531, 541 (with further references); Pierre-Marie Dupuy, Formation of Customary International Law and General Principles, in: Bodansky/Brunnée/Hey (eds.)

A/56/10 (2001), 377, General Commentary, para. 3.\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE 63\nDue diligence could thus be regarded as a minimum standard providing a test whether a specific State conduct is up to what a ‘good government’ would do in such situations of transboundary risk. Therefore, the argument can validly be made that due diligence does not necessarily require identical measures from all States. As a matter of fact, a certain lack of economic and technological capacity of a particular State might reduce its due diligence obligations. Moreover, the requirements due diligence sets out are context-specific. Different measures might be required in different circumstances. It also seems that there can be different legal requirements for a State depending on whether a harmful activity has its origin or its effect in its territory.\nIn all these cases, due diligence could entail both substantive and/or procedural obligations. The latter ones may require States to create specific institutional capacities. Moreover, there could be a duty to cooperate in cases of transboundary harm. Additionally, responsibilities might change during the different stages of harmful activities. Whereas duties of prevention might dominate before any harmful act is committed, during or after such an act, it is cooperation between States that might primarily be required then.\nFinally, the concept of ‘harm’ inflicted on other States also needs special attention. It seems that not every harm inflicted on another State automatically entails that due diligence obligations have been violated. Rather, there appears to be a threshold triggering such due diligence obligations.\nIn light of the results to be found in the various contributions compiled hereinafter as part of this year’s GYIL Focus Section, one might tentatively formulate the following guidelines:\nPrior to potentially harmful cyber activities, States could be obliged to take all measures necessary to prevent misuse of the cyber infrastructure under their jurisdiction or their effective control. Moreover, they could be required to ensure that any perpe\n Patricia Birnie/Alan Boyle/Catherine Redgwell (eds.), International Law and the Environment (3rd ed. 2009), 149; Brunneé/Meshel (note 13), 134 et seq.; Benedikt Pirker, Territorial Sovereignty and Integrity and the Challenge of Cyberspace, in: Ziolkowski (ed.)

This might encompass an obligation to build up specific institutional capacities. At the same time, for one, States can in any event be only obliged to do what is technically feasible in light of their respective abilities – *ultra posse nemo obligatur* – and besides, one must carefully balance any such oversight with legitimate privacy rights of individual internet users.\n*During* an ongoing cyber attack, considerations of due diligence might require that the State of origin and/or the transit States take all appropriate measures to stop these activities. In order not to jump from the frying pan into the fire, States should probably ensure that their responsive measures intrude as little as possible on the network communications process necessary to stop the attack.\n*In the aftermath* of a cyber attack, all States concerned, in particular the State of origin and possible transit States, could be required to take steps necessary to identify the source of the harmful activity and to prevent a repetition of similar future actions. Possible target States should in turn prepare their network infrastructure to ensure that the impact of an attack remains as limited as possible. Probably, States should in particular do all that is necessary to ensure resilience of their critical infrastructure and to prevent the possibility of negative repercussions on critical civil infrastructure, including electricity networks, water supplies, or nuclear power plants.\nFinally, due diligence might also require States to disclose intelligence concerning harmful acts against their cyber infrastructure, at least as long as national security interests are not compromised. Thereby, a State would enable other States to implement effective preventive measures before becoming the target of similar attacks. This might require establishing national points of contact facilitating the exchange of information between affected States.\nAt the same time two important points warrant underlining: First, none of the principles introduced here should in any way impede the application of the prohibition of the use of force, the right to self-defence, the rules of international humanitarian law, if applicable, or the principles of State responsibility in case damaging activities can be attributed to a specific State.\nSecond, whatever obligations States might have in preventing or minimising harm caused by cyber attacks, it should not be forgotten that cyberspace must remain a place where individual actors exercise their freedom, where economic activity can\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE\nflourish, and where States can operate effectively. Responsible State practice adhering to due diligence could provide a durable and solid basis to ensure such a cyberspace.\n## IX. Structure and Content of the Focus Section\nIt is in light of these considerations that the conveners of the conference, whose papers are published in this Focus Section, have requested the various authors to address some of the crucial, so far largely unanswered legal questions deriving from the applicability of this generally accepted, but very general concept of due diligence to ‘cyberspace’.\nMore specifically, the opening piece by Christian Walter considers the “Obligations of States Before, During, and After a Cyber Security Incident” as they arise under general international law and notably the concept of due diligence. Oliver Dörr then specifically addresses possible “Obligations of the State of Origin of a Cyber Security Incident”, while August Reinisch and Markus Beham deal with and analyse the specific obligations of transit States in their contribution entitled “Mitigating Risks: Inter-State Due Diligence Obligations in Case of Harmful Cyber-Incidents and Malicious Cyber-Activity: Obligations of the Transit State”.\nIn turn Robert Kolb reflects more generally on the concept of due diligence duties and their relevance concerning cyberspace from the standpoint of general international law, while Jutta Brunnée and Tamar Meshel then consider whether international environmental law, which also deals with an international common good, might serve as a blueprint for cyberspace governance. Last but not least, Matthias Herdegen considers the possible international legal framework as well as possible reg-\n See Christian Walter, Obligations of States Before, During, and After a Cyber Security Incident, GYIL 58 (2015), 67.\n See Dörr (note 13).\n See August Reinisch/Markus Beham, Mitigating Risks: Inter-State Due Diligence Obligations in Case of Harmful Cyber-Incidents and Malicious Cyber-Activity: Obligations of the Transit State, GYIL 58 (2015), 101.\n See Kolb (note 13).\n Brunnée/Meshel (note 13).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nulatory models for cyberspace, taking into account general due diligence obligations, but also institutional models for forms of enhanced inter-State cooperation in cyberspace.\n## X. Outlook\nAs with other areas of international law which have developed only during the last decades, such as international environmental law, only time will tell whether the international community of States will be able and willing to come up with specific and adequate rules of international law applicable to ‘cyberspace’. Yet, as mentioned before, this is nothing peculiar to cyberspace. Rather, one has previously seen similar developments in other areas, international environmental law being a particularly relevant example at hand, before specific treaty regimes were later established.\nPending such a development, States and other actors can only rely on general, and thus necessarily relatively vague, rules of international law, such as the concept of due diligence, and attempt to apply them to human activities in cyberspace. It is for that reason that the various contributions to this Focus Section have concentrated on this very concept in considerable detail and from various perspectives.\nWe hope that this year’s GYIL overall Focus Section, by documenting the outcome of the 2013 cyber conference held in Berlin and organised jointly by the two authors of this brief introduction, may contribute to foster and further develop a legal framework for a peaceful use of cyberspace in the interest of the overall international community.\n *Herdegen* (note 38).\n As to the possibility of transposing principles developed within international environmental law to cyberspace, see, apart from the contribution by *Brunnée/Meshel* in this very Focus Section (note 13), also *Maraubn* (note 38), 465 et seq.",

Introduction\nThis year’s Focus Section of the German Yearbook of International Law (GYIL) contains and documents the results of a scientific conference organised by the German Federal Foreign Office in co-operation with the University of Potsdam in which both legal academics as well as practitioners from around the world participated.\nGiven that Germany has repeatedly underlined that securing the freedom and stability of cyberspace constitutes an important aim of German foreign policy, the German Federal Foreign Office organised (and continues to organise) a series of “Berlin Cyber Conferences”, intending to gather international cutting-edge expertise in the field of cyber security. The conference, the outcome of which is published hereinafter thanks to the efforts of the respective authors as well as those of the editors and the editorial staff of the GYIL for which we are particularly grateful, has been the third in this sequence of conferences, after the conference on “Challenges in Cyber Security – Risks, Strategies and Confidence-Building” held in December 2011, and the one on\n* Dr. jur. utr., M.A. (Oxon.), Ambassador of Germany to India; formerly Legal Adviser, Federal Foreign Office, Berlin.\n** Dr. jur., LL.M.

Given that these very principles also constituted the framework and overarching theme of the third 2013 Berlin cyber conference, the content and results of which are hereinafter documented, it is appropriate to quote three main points from his 2012 address, namely that:\nFirstly, freedom has to be our overriding priority in internet matters. Respect for the freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, the rights to access to information and the right to personal privacy must be ensured.\nSecondly, with freedom comes responsibility. This applies to societies in general. It applies to the global internet society in particular. Self-regulation should be an important principle of its governance. All stakeholders – individuals, companies, governments – have to act responsibly. Therefore, regulation has to step in when our values and rule of law are in danger or democratic legitimation is no longer assured.\nFinally, transparency and knowledge will help us to make informed decisions in line with our values. We will continue to share information, to include the global public, and to foster transparent policy dialogue.\n## II. Cyberspace and General International Law\nReaders of this very piece will read their newspapers online and might purchase some (or even all) of their gifts in the same manner. These simple examples alone, and\n See id., Conference on the Internet and Human Rights, 12 September 2012, available at: http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/sid_D911C8E0F05824607E17EFDF3F489C0E/EN/Aussenpolitik/Menschenrechte/Aktuell/120912-Konferenz-Internet-Menschenrechte.html (accessed on 23 September 2015).\n Speech by Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle at the conference \"The Internet and Human Rights: Building a Free, Open and Secure Internet\", 14 September 2012, available at: http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/EN/Infoservice/Presse/Reden/2012/120914-BM_Internet_MR.html?nn=648756 (accessed on 23 September 2015).\n See as to this issue also already Andreas Zimmermann, International Law and 'Cyber Space', ESIL Reflections, 10 January 2014, available at: http://www.esil-sedi.eu/sites/default/files/ESIL%20Reflections%20-%20Andreas%20Zimmermann.pdf (accessed on 23 September 2015).\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE\nmany others could obviously be added, demonstrate to what extent communication via the internet shapes our day-to-day-life, far beyond the news that from time to time make the headlines. At the same time, however, there are almost no specific norms of international law that specifically govern ‘cyberspace’ given that the underlying technology is so new.\nYet, it is not the first time that international law faces new technological developments. In earlier times, to give but two examples, international law was in a similarly sudden manner confronted with radio waves crossing boundaries, or was confronted with mankind being able to reach extraterrestrial bodies – and each time it was simply taken for granted, and rightly so, that such human behaviour was governed by pre-existing norms of international law.\nAnd as in those earlier cases, activities in ‘cyberspace’, too, are governed by international law as such, and be it only by the norm that where no (general or specific) rule prohibiting the behaviour in question exists, States have retained their freedom to act. This is, inter alia, confirmed by the work of the “Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security”, set up in the framework of the United Nations General Assembly’s First Committee. As its report of 7 June 2013 in New York quite rightly confirmed in unequivocal terms, “international law, and in particular the U.N. Charter, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT [i.e. information and communications technology] environment.” What is more is that the report also emphasised that “State sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to State conduct of ICT-related activities, and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory.”\n See generally on that issue Ulrich Fastenrath, Lücken im Völkerrecht: Zu Rechtscharakter, Quellen, Systemzusammenhang, Methodenlehre und Funktionen des Völkerrechts (1991), passim.\n Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, Report of 7 June 2013, UN Doc. A/68/98 (2013), available at: http://www.unidir.org/files/medias/pdfs/developments-in-the-field-of-information-and-telecommunications-in-the-context-of-international-security-2012-2013-a-68-98-eng-0-578.pdf (accessed on 23 September 2015).\n Ibid., 8.\n Ibid.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nHowever, as in earlier scenarios, it is for lack, for the time being, of more specific rules that the basic and more general norms of international law govern cyber activities, including concepts such as jurisdiction, attribution, or, in particular, the concept of due diligence. Given however the very general nature of those rules, as well as the lack of generally accepted, efficient, and rule-based inter-State international governance structures concerning the internet, ‘cyberspace’ nevertheless constitutes a major challenge for international law as it currently stands.\nIt is against this background that the various papers contained in this very Focus Section of the GYIL attempt to assess the extent to which, and how, human activities in cyberspace are indeed governed by international law, and what the applicable norms are. When studying the relevance of international law for cyberspace at this conference, it was not the primary objective either of its organisers or its participants to define restrictions or limitations for cyberspace freedom. On the contrary, the principal aim was to secure that cyberspace remains a sphere where individual actors exercise their freedom, where economic activity can flourish, and where States can operate effectively.\n## III. Notion of ‘Cyberspace’ and its Legal (Ir)relevance\nNot infrequently, when discussing which rules of international law apply to ‘cyberspace’, it is referred to as a mere virtual space where computer-mediated communication takes place but which cannot be spatially located. Yet, to state the obvious, any such communication requires hardware that must be located somewhere. What is more, any such information is then physically routed through the territory of one or more States (and possibly through outer space) before it reaches the addressee, which, again, confirms that there necessarily exists a territorial nexus of any activity in ‘cyberspace’ to at least one State. Accordingly, while ‘cyberspace’ might describe a phenomenon of information being routed through various jurisdictions, it still does not constitute some new form of ‘outer space’ where no State could, as a matter of international law, exercise its jurisdiction. Rather, it is more an issue of technical\n Zimmermann (note 4), 2; see also Nicholas Tsagourias, The Legal Status of Cyberspace, in: id./ Russell Buchan (eds.), Research Handbook on International Law and Cyberspace (2015), 13, 14 et seq.\n See generally as to jurisdictional issues related to ‘cyberspace’ Joachim Zekoll, Jurisdiction in Cyberspace, in: Günther Handl/Joachim Zekoll/Peer Zumbansen (eds.), Beyond Territoriality: Trans-\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE\n\n## IV. Challenges for International Law in Cyberspace\nAlthough communication in cyberspace is under international law *de jure* subject to the jurisdiction of one or more States, and thus does not constitute a novel phenomenon for international law as such, communication *via* the internet nevertheless, given its specific technical characteristics, does pose new challenges for international law. For one, and more generally, given the speed by which technological developments concerning cyberspace take place, the more traditional ways of creating norms of international law, be it by way of multilateral treaties, be it by way of developing rules of customary international law, run the danger of being the hare in a new form of ‘hare and hedgehog’ race. As a result, most currently existing norms of international law in this field are of a fairly general nature.\nThis phenomenon is compounded by an unwillingness of many States, as well as non-State actors such as multinational enterprises that have a technological lead in cyberspace, to have their behaviour in cyberspace regulated by specific treaty-based rules; these actors instead see the lack of effective international regulation of their activities as an advantage to be exploited. By the same token, given the enormous technological gap that exists between highly industrialised States and multinational companies, on the one hand, and smaller States on the other, many States might *de facto* not fully be in a position to exercise even a minimal form of control of cyberspace activities emanating from or affecting their territory; indeed, they might even lack sufficient capabilities to frame an appropriate regulatory (legal) framework governing such activities.\nMoreover, both the *de facto* (but *de facto* only!) de-territorialisation of cyberspace activities (in that information is being routed through a large number of States and territories) and the sheer amount of information being produced might lead to a lack\nnational Legal Authority in an Age of Globalization (2012), 341–369; Uta Kohl, Jurisdiction in Cyberspace, in: Tsagourias/Buchan (eds.) (note 9), 30.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nof effective regulatory mechanisms to be used by States when it comes to detecting, and eventually addressing, harmful activities in cyberspace, regardless of whether they emanate from private actors or from other States.\nAnother aspect of such de facto de-territorialisation of cyberspace activities can be seen in the fact that the effects of activities in cyberspace, even when they emanate from States, often occur abroad, which in many cases raises the question whether the international obligations a State has undertaken (be they treaty-based or of a customary nature) also apply in such cross-boundary and extraterritorial settings.\nMoreover, given the technological environment in which cyberspace activities occur, it will be often, if not always, difficult or even impossible, to trace back any such activities, even when they emanate from actors whose actions would otherwise be attributable to a given State under applicable norms of international law, as codified in the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility. Accordingly, in many cases, while the general law on State responsibility is applicable as such, it might not be fully adequate to regulate cyberspace-related activities. This in turn requires international law to either develop specific norms of attribution (including specific evidentiary norms), or to come up with specific primary norms that can adequately address the matter.\nV. Cyberspace, the Prohibition of the Use of Force, and Jus in Bello\nCyber security is, first and foremost, an item of the international law of peace, or, to paraphrase the former German President Gustav Heinemann, who once put it succinctly, albeit in a somewhat different context, ‘peace constitutes the real emergency\n GA Res. 56/83 of 28 January 2002, Annex.\n See on this issue Michael N. Schmitt, Cyber Activities and the Law of Countermeasures, in: Katharina Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy (2013), 659, 668 et seq; Constantine Antonopoulos, State Responsibility in Cyberspace, in: Tsagourias/Buchan (eds.) (note 9), 55.\n See as to this issue also the contributions by Robert Kolb, Reflections on Due Diligence Duties and Cyberspace, German Yearbook of International Law (GYIL) 58 (2015), 113; Oliver Dörr, Obligations of the State of Origin of a Cyber Security Incident, GYIL 58 (2015), 87; Jutta Brunneé/Tamar Meshel, Teaching an Old Law New Tricks: International Environmental Law Lessons for Cyberspace Governance, GYIL 58 (2015), 129.\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE 57\nin which international law has to prove itself. Indeed, it follows from the very Charter of the United Nations (UN Charter) that peace and security take precedence in international relations, and this, obviously, holds also true when it comes to inter-State relations in cyberspace.\nHence, neither issues of the use of armed force (jus ad bellum) nor jus in bello issues were what the conference, whose proceedings are reproduced here, wanted to address. Rather, it was the peacetime scenario below the threshold of an armed conflict that this conference focussed upon. Moreover, the conference was not about national security electronic surveillance programmes either, which indeed raise very specific issues beyond the realm of general international law. Indeed, we believe that the overall debate on ‘cyber security’ with its main focus on cyber warfare is, to a large degree, so far at least, somewhat one-sided.\nWhile, obviously, both jus ad bellum and jus in bello rules do apply, as a matter of course, to activities in cyberspace, such activities do not normally reach, and so far have not reached, the threshold of Article 2 (4) UN Charter. Having said this, it is, of course, conceivable that a harmful cyberspace activity that is attributable to a State could amount to a violation of Article 2 (4) UN Charter, given its character and effects. Whenever such use of force even reaches the threshold of an armed attack, as defined by general rules of international law and, in particular, the case-law of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), in principle, the right of self-defence comes into play. In that regard, ‘cyber attacks’ (provided they do amount to armed attacks in the first place, which will probably be the case only rarely), just like other armed attacks, might raise the question whether such attacks, if they emanate from non-\n Gustav Heinemann, Inaugural Address “Dem Frieden dienen”, German Federal Parliament Plenary Protocol No. 05/245 of 1 July 1969, in: Verhandlungen des Deutschen Bundestages 1969, Vol. 70, 13661, 13664, 13665, available at: http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btp/05/05245.pdf (accessed on 5 November 2015): “Nicht der Krieg ist der Ernstfall, [...] sondern der Frieden ist der Ernstfall, in dem wir alle uns zu bewähren haben.” “War is not the quintessential emergency [...] rather, peace is the emergency in which we all have to prove ourselves” (English text available at: http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=169&amp;language=english (accessed on 23 September 2015)).\n Charter of the United Nations, 26 June 1945, UNCIO 15, 335 (UN Charter).\n But see most recently the various contributions in Ziolkowski (ed.) (note 12).\n Albrecht Randelzhofer/Georg Nolte, Article 51, in: Bruno Simma et al. (eds.), The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary (3rd ed. 2012), 1397, MN 17 et seq.\n Ibid., MN 18.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nState actors whose acts are not attributable to a State, do trigger the applicability of Article 51 UN Charter. What is more, in such scenarios the question who carries the burden of proof will usually arise, not only as to the attribution of a given activity to a State or other actor, but also as to its attribution to a specific State. In these respects, the judgment of the ICJ in the *Oil Platforms* case is of particular relevance.\nBy the same token, once the threshold of an (international or non-international) armed conflict has either been reached by a cyber attack as such, or where cyber attacks are being undertaken as part of already ongoing hostilities, applicable norms of international humanitarian law also govern cyberspace-related activities that are undertaken as part of the armed conflict and that constitute an ‘attack’ within the meaning of international humanitarian law. Yet, ‘cyber warfare’ raises significant, and so far largely unresolved, questions, *inter alia* as to the character of cyber installations as military objects as well as to the legal characterisation of persons involved in cyber operations. State practice has not yet fully addressed these questions.\n## VI. Cyberspace, Human Rights, and Data Protection: The Need to Develop Appropriate Legal Standards\nForeign policy has the responsibility to ensure that cyberspace remains a basis for communicating freely and for enjoying those rights that are fundamental to any democratic society, most notably the freedom of speech and the freedom of informa\n---\n See as to this issue *Peter Margulies*, Sovereignty and Cyber Attacks: Technology’s Challenge to the Law of State Responsibility, Melbourne Journal of International Law 14 (2013), 1; *Dieter Fleck*, Searching for International Rules Applicable to Cyber Warfare: A Critical First Assessment of the New Tallinn Manual, Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law 18 (2013), 331; *Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg*, Chapter 1: The Tallinn Manual and International Cyber Security Law, Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law 15 (2012), 3; *Nicholas Tsagourias*, Chapter 2: The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare: A Commentary on Chapter II: The Use of Force, Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law 15 (2012), 19; *Robin Geiß/Henning Lahmann*, Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention, in: *Ziolkowski (ed.)* (note 12), 621; *Carlo Focarelli*, Self-Defence in Cyberspace, in: *Tsagourias/Buchan* (eds.)

Schmitt (ed.), Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (2013), passim.\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE\ntion. Moreover, it also has to ensure the full functioning of cyberspace as a basic pillar of international economic activity and social activity.\nThis is challenged by the ability of States (and indeed private actors) to effectively collect comprehensive information on any given person active on the internet in one way or the other. This reality leads to the question whether human rights standards, and namely guarantees relating to privacy, also apply in ‘cyberspace’ as a matter of their applicability *ratione materiae* and *ratione loci*.\nApart from specific treaty-based norms that may be applicable in a given case (such as e.g. the Council of Europe’s Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data), the area lacks specific rules. For one, it might be asked whether *de lege lata* all electronic data available in cyberspace are comprehensively protected by the concepts of ‘privacy’ and/or ‘correspondence’ under Article 17 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), one of the issues (not yet conclusively resolved) being whether the 1966 ICCPR (or parallel norms of customary international law) can be interpreted in a manner as to also cover forms of communication not explicitly foreseen in 1966.\nFurthermore (provided one assumes that the relevant rules of international law do apply *ratione materiae* to cyberspace), one has to answer an additional question relating to the extraterritorial applicability of the right of privacy. Namely, the question arises whether, under either customary law or under Article 17 ICCPR, an individual who is not present on the territory of a State collecting the private data of this very individual *via* the internet finds himself “within the jurisdiction” of said State within the meaning of Article 2 (1) ICCPR (or the parallel norm of customary law). It is only if one were to provide a positive answer to this question that the applicability of the right to privacy would be triggered.\n See generally as to this issue also the contribution by Dinah PoKempner, Cyberspace and State Obligations in the Area of Human Rights, in: Ziolkowski (ed.) (note 12), 239; David P. Fidler, Cyberspace and Human Rights, in: Tsagourias/Buchan (eds.) (note 9), 94, as well as most recently Marko Milanovic, Human Rights Treaties and Foreign Surveillance: Privacy in the Digital Age, Harvard International Law Journal 56 (2015), 81.\n Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data, 28 January 1981, ETS No. 108.\n International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 19 December 1966, UNTS 999, 177.\n See generally as to the extraterritorial applicability of human rights treaties Marko Milanovic, Extraterritorial Application of Human Rights Treaties (2011), passim.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nIn view of these and other questions, it is fortunate that Brazil and Germany had launched an initiative within the United Nations to further clarify and develop applicable norms of international law, which led the United Nations General Assembly to adopt, by consensus, a resolution requesting the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights\nto present a report on the protection and promotion of the right to privacy in the context of domestic and extraterritorial surveillance and/or interception of digital communications and collection of personal data, including on a mass scale to the Human Rights Council\nwhich in 2014 was submitted to the 27th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council.\n## VII. Cyberspace Governance: Which Way Forward?\nUnlike most other areas of international law, cyberspace so far lacks any significant inter-governmental governance structure. Rather, key private organisations acting with the aim of preserving the operational stability of the internet, such as ICANN, the “Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers,” as well as interconnection and peering agreements among internet service providers, provide for some form of self-regulatory capabilities of cyberspace. It remains to be seen whether this form of self-regulation will continue to be able to provide sufficient safeguards as to the functioning of the internet, in line with the applicable principles of international law outlined above, or whether one should not aim at some form of intergovernmental internet governance. Yet, recent initiatives within the International Telecommunication Union’s (ITU) system have shown that such attempts of coming up with universally accepted inter-State governance structures might run the risk of being (mis-)used for subjecting cyberspace-based activities to over-broad governmental regulation (or, in other words, censorship), and thus run the risk of limiting rather than protecting the human rights of internet users.\n GA Res. 68/167 of 18 December 2013.

A/HRC/27/37 (2014).\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE 61\nAt the same time, States share an interest in maintaining cyberspace free from interruptions, *i.e.* a cyberspace which is not misused in a way that unduly affects other States, their infrastructure, or their population. In order to function in such a way, cyberspace presupposes and requires a certain behaviour of States. The set of rules for such behaviour ought to possess a legally binding character. It is submitted that time has come to identify common legal understandings for cyberspace that serve to prevent direct damages caused by cyber activities, as well as to limit harm and loss resulting from such damages. This indeed is what the conference, which led to the various contributions to be found beneath, was all about. In approaching this question, the guiding (and indeed self-evident) principle must be strict adherence to international law including, in particular, human rights, and the established principles of State responsibility.\n## VIII. Cyberspace and Inter-State Due Diligence Obligations\nThe starting point for any research into States’ obligations in cyberspace has to be its complexity and its interconnectivity as well as the network character of cyberspace. As in other areas where interests of different States are intrinsically intertwined, this requires that States respect legitimate interests of other States within cyberspace and cooperate in responding to threats to the common sphere of interest.\nWithin the international community, there is consensus that there exists a general obligation of States to prevent their territory (and hence also cyberspace-related infrastructure located on their territory) from being used for acts contrary to the rights of other States, unlawfully harming such other States. The leading case on this question is, of course, the merits judgment of the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case. As the Court then put it, a State breaches this obligation if it fails to act with due diligence. This principle of international law is referred to as both the “principle of due\n *Geiß/Lahmann* (note 19), 632 et seq.\n ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland *v.* Albania), Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 4.\n *Ibid.*, 22, where the Court *inter alia* refers to “every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\ndiligence” and also the “no harm principle”, describing two elements of one and the same obligation.\nNo matter how this principle is labelled, it is of particular relevance in cases where harmful actions either cannot be attributed to a particular State or where only insufficient proof for such attribution can be provided by the victim State.\nAs is well-known, historically the concept of due diligence was developed with regard to the responsibility of States for the behaviour of private actors. States are expected to take preventive measures in their sphere of exclusive control, when internationally unlawful harm is being caused by actions of private persons. The respective invocation of due diligence can be traced back to the Alabama Arbitration of 1872.\nUnder modern international law, the scope of the due diligence principle transcends its historical origins. There seems to be consensus that due diligence constitutes a general principle of law, both in the field of international environmental law and in situations of risk of other transboundary harm. It accordingly only seems logical to apply the concept of due diligence also when it comes to situations of risk of transboundary harm within cyberspace.\nThe application of this principle would mean that all States share a common obligation to ensure that neither their territory, nor hardware and cyber infrastructure situated on their territory or under their effective control, is misused to harm other States or their residents.\n Timo Koivurova, Due Diligence, Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL), February 2010, paras. 1 et seq., available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 23 September 2015).\n Ibid., para. 3.\n Alabama Claims (United States of America, Great Britain), Arbitral Award of 8 May 1871, Reports of International Arbitral Awards XXIX, 125; see also Tom Bingham, Alabama Arbitration, MPEPIL, October 2006, para. 7, available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 23 September 2015).\n Koivurova (note 32), para. 9.\n ICJ, Corfu Channel (note 30), 4, 22; Günther Handl, Transboundary Impact, in: Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of International Environmental Law (2007), 531, 541 (with further references); Pierre-Marie Dupuy, Formation of Customary International Law and General Principles, in: Bodansky/Brunnée/Hey (eds.)

A/56/10 (2001), 377, General Commentary, para. 3.\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE 63\nDue diligence could thus be regarded as a minimum standard providing a test whether a specific State conduct is up to what a ‘good government’ would do in such situations of transboundary risk. Therefore, the argument can validly be made that due diligence does not necessarily require identical measures from all States. As a matter of fact, a certain lack of economic and technological capacity of a particular State might reduce its due diligence obligations. Moreover, the requirements due diligence sets out are context-specific. Different measures might be required in different circumstances. It also seems that there can be different legal requirements for a State depending on whether a harmful activity has its origin or its effect in its territory.\nIn all these cases, due diligence could entail both substantive and/or procedural obligations. The latter ones may require States to create specific institutional capacities. Moreover, there could be a duty to cooperate in cases of transboundary harm. Additionally, responsibilities might change during the different stages of harmful activities. Whereas duties of prevention might dominate before any harmful act is committed, during or after such an act, it is cooperation between States that might primarily be required then.\nFinally, the concept of ‘harm’ inflicted on other States also needs special attention. It seems that not every harm inflicted on another State automatically entails that due diligence obligations have been violated. Rather, there appears to be a threshold triggering such due diligence obligations.\nIn light of the results to be found in the various contributions compiled hereinafter as part of this year’s GYIL Focus Section, one might tentatively formulate the following guidelines:\nPrior to potentially harmful cyber activities, States could be obliged to take all measures necessary to prevent misuse of the cyber infrastructure under their jurisdiction or their effective control. Moreover, they could be required to ensure that any perpe\n Patricia Birnie/Alan Boyle/Catherine Redgwell (eds.), International Law and the Environment (3rd ed. 2009), 149; Brunneé/Meshel (note 13), 134 et seq.; Benedikt Pirker, Territorial Sovereignty and Integrity and the Challenge of Cyberspace, in: Ziolkowski (ed.)

This might encompass an obligation to build up specific institutional capacities. At the same time, for one, States can in any event be only obliged to do what is technically feasible in light of their respective abilities – *ultra posse nemo obligatur* – and besides, one must carefully balance any such oversight with legitimate privacy rights of individual internet users.\n*During* an ongoing cyber attack, considerations of due diligence might require that the State of origin and/or the transit States take all appropriate measures to stop these activities. In order not to jump from the frying pan into the fire, States should probably ensure that their responsive measures intrude as little as possible on the network communications process necessary to stop the attack.\n*In the aftermath* of a cyber attack, all States concerned, in particular the State of origin and possible transit States, could be required to take steps necessary to identify the source of the harmful activity and to prevent a repetition of similar future actions. Possible target States should in turn prepare their network infrastructure to ensure that the impact of an attack remains as limited as possible. Probably, States should in particular do all that is necessary to ensure resilience of their critical infrastructure and to prevent the possibility of negative repercussions on critical civil infrastructure, including electricity networks, water supplies, or nuclear power plants.\nFinally, due diligence might also require States to disclose intelligence concerning harmful acts against their cyber infrastructure, at least as long as national security interests are not compromised. Thereby, a State would enable other States to implement effective preventive measures before becoming the target of similar attacks. This might require establishing national points of contact facilitating the exchange of information between affected States.\nAt the same time two important points warrant underlining: First, none of the principles introduced here should in any way impede the application of the prohibition of the use of force, the right to self-defence, the rules of international humanitarian law, if applicable, or the principles of State responsibility in case damaging activities can be attributed to a specific State.\nSecond, whatever obligations States might have in preventing or minimising harm caused by cyber attacks, it should not be forgotten that cyberspace must remain a place where individual actors exercise their freedom, where economic activity can\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE\nflourish, and where States can operate effectively. Responsible State practice adhering to due diligence could provide a durable and solid basis to ensure such a cyberspace.\n## IX. Structure and Content of the Focus Section\nIt is in light of these considerations that the conveners of the conference, whose papers are published in this Focus Section, have requested the various authors to address some of the crucial, so far largely unanswered legal questions deriving from the applicability of this generally accepted, but very general concept of due diligence to ‘cyberspace’.\nMore specifically, the opening piece by Christian Walter considers the “Obligations of States Before, During, and After a Cyber Security Incident” as they arise under general international law and notably the concept of due diligence. Oliver Dörr then specifically addresses possible “Obligations of the State of Origin of a Cyber Security Incident”, while August Reinisch and Markus Beham deal with and analyse the specific obligations of transit States in their contribution entitled “Mitigating Risks: Inter-State Due Diligence Obligations in Case of Harmful Cyber-Incidents and Malicious Cyber-Activity: Obligations of the Transit State”.\nIn turn Robert Kolb reflects more generally on the concept of due diligence duties and their relevance concerning cyberspace from the standpoint of general international law, while Jutta Brunnée and Tamar Meshel then consider whether international environmental law, which also deals with an international common good, might serve as a blueprint for cyberspace governance. Last but not least, Matthias Herdegen considers the possible international legal framework as well as possible reg-\n See Christian Walter, Obligations of States Before, During, and After a Cyber Security Incident, GYIL 58 (2015), 67.\n See Dörr (note 13).\n See August Reinisch/Markus Beham, Mitigating Risks: Inter-State Due Diligence Obligations in Case of Harmful Cyber-Incidents and Malicious Cyber-Activity: Obligations of the Transit State, GYIL 58 (2015), 101.\n See Kolb (note 13).\n Brunnée/Meshel (note 13).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nulatory models for cyberspace, taking into account general due diligence obligations, but also institutional models for forms of enhanced inter-State cooperation in cyberspace.\n## X. Outlook\nAs with other areas of international law which have developed only during the last decades, such as international environmental law, only time will tell whether the international community of States will be able and willing to come up with specific and adequate rules of international law applicable to ‘cyberspace’. Yet, as mentioned before, this is nothing peculiar to cyberspace. Rather, one has previously seen similar developments in other areas, international environmental law being a particularly relevant example at hand, before specific treaty regimes were later established.\nPending such a development, States and other actors can only rely on general, and thus necessarily relatively vague, rules of international law, such as the concept of due diligence, and attempt to apply them to human activities in cyberspace. It is for that reason that the various contributions to this Focus Section have concentrated on this very concept in considerable detail and from various perspectives.\nWe hope that this year’s GYIL overall Focus Section, by documenting the outcome of the 2013 cyber conference held in Berlin and organised jointly by the two authors of this brief introduction, may contribute to foster and further develop a legal framework for a peaceful use of cyberspace in the interest of the overall international community.\n *Herdegen* (note 38).\n As to the possibility of transposing principles developed within international environmental law to cyberspace, see, apart from the contribution by *Brunnée/Meshel* in this very Focus Section (note 13), also *Maraubn* (note 38), 465 et seq."

Introduction\nThis year’s Focus Section of the German Yearbook of International Law (GYIL) contains and documents the results of a scientific conference organised by the German Federal Foreign Office in co-operation with the University of Potsdam in which both legal academics as well as practitioners from around the world participated.\nGiven that Germany has repeatedly underlined that securing the freedom and stability of cyberspace constitutes an important aim of German foreign policy, the German Federal Foreign Office organised (and continues to organise) a series of “Berlin Cyber Conferences”, intending to gather international cutting-edge expertise in the field of cyber security. The conference, the outcome of which is published hereinafter thanks to the efforts of the respective authors as well as those of the editors and the editorial staff of the GYIL for which we are particularly grateful, has been the third in this sequence of conferences, after the conference on “Challenges in Cyber Security – Risks, Strategies and Confidence-Building” held in December 2011,¹ and the one on\n* Dr. jur. utr., M.A. (Oxon.), Ambassador of Germany to India; formerly Legal Adviser, Federal Foreign Office, Berlin.\n** Dr. jur., LL.M.

Given that these very principles also constituted the framework and overarching theme of the third 2013 Berlin cyber conference, the content and results of which are hereinafter documented, it is appropriate to quote three main points from his 2012 address, namely that:\nFirstly, freedom has to be our overriding priority in internet matters. Respect for the freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, the rights to access to information and the right to personal privacy must be ensured.\nSecondly, with freedom comes responsibility. This applies to societies in general. It applies to the global internet society in particular. Self-regulation should be an important principle of its governance. All stakeholders – individuals, companies, governments – have to act responsibly. Therefore, regulation has to step in when our values and rule of law are in danger or democratic legitimation is no longer assured.\nFinally, transparency and knowledge will help us to make informed decisions in line with our values. We will continue to share information, to include the global public, and to foster transparent policy dialogue.³\n## II.

At the same time, however, there are almost no specific norms of international law that specifically govern ‘cyberspace’ given that the underlying technology is so new.\nYet, it is not the first time that international law faces new technological developments. In earlier times, to give but two examples, international law was in a similarly sudden manner confronted with radio waves crossing boundaries, or was confronted with mankind being able to reach extraterrestrial bodies – and each time it was simply taken for granted, and rightly so, that such human behaviour was governed by pre-existing norms of international law.\nAnd as in those earlier cases, activities in ‘cyberspace’, too, are governed by international law as such, and be it only by the norm that where no (general or specific) rule prohibiting the behaviour in question exists, States have retained their freedom to act.⁵ This is, inter alia, confirmed by the work of the “Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security”, set up in the framework of the United Nations General Assembly’s First Committee.⁶ As its report of 7 June 2013 in New York quite rightly confirmed in unequivocal terms, “international law, and in particular the U.N. Charter, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT [i.e. information and communications technology] environment.”⁷ What is more is that the report also emphasised that “State sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to State conduct of ICT-related activities, and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory.”⁸\n⁵ See generally on that issue Ulrich Fastenrath, Lücken im Völkerrecht: Zu Rechtscharakter, Quellen, Systemzusammenhang, Methodenlehre und Funktionen des Völkerrechts (1991), passim.\n⁶ Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, Report of 7 June 2013, UN Doc. A/68/98 (2013), available at: http://www.unidir.org/files/medias/pdfs/developments-in-the-field-of-information-and-telecommunications-in-the-context-of-international-security-2012-2013-a-68-98-eng-0-578.pdf (accessed on 23 September 2015).\n⁷ Ibid., 8.\n⁸ Ibid.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nHowever, as in earlier scenarios, it is for lack, for the time being, of more specific rules that the basic and more general norms of international law govern cyber activities, including concepts such as jurisdiction, attribution, or, in particular, the concept of due diligence. Given however the very general nature of those rules, as well as the lack of generally accepted, efficient, and rule-based inter-State international governance structures concerning the internet, ‘cyberspace’ nevertheless constitutes a major challenge for international law as it currently stands.\nIt is against this background that the various papers contained in this very Focus Section of the GYIL attempt to assess the extent to which, and how, human activities in cyberspace are indeed governed by international law, and what the applicable norms are. When studying the relevance of international law for cyberspace at this conference, it was not the primary objective either of its organisers or its participants to define restrictions or limitations for cyberspace freedom. On the contrary, the principal aim was to secure that cyberspace remains a sphere where individual actors exercise their freedom, where economic activity can flourish, and where States can operate effectively.\n## III. Notion of ‘Cyberspace’ and its Legal (Ir)relevance\nNot infrequently, when discussing which rules of international law apply to ‘cyberspace’, it is referred to as a mere virtual space where computer-mediated communication takes place but which cannot be spatially located.⁹ Yet, to state the obvious, any such communication requires hardware that must be located somewhere. What is more, any such information is then physically routed through the territory of one or more States (and possibly through outer space) before it reaches the addressee, which, again, confirms that there necessarily exists a territorial nexus of any activity in ‘cyberspace’ to at least one State. Accordingly, while ‘cyberspace’ might describe a phenomenon of information being routed through various jurisdictions, it still does not constitute some new form of ‘outer space’ where no State could, as a matter of international law, exercise its jurisdiction.¹⁰ Rather, it is more an issue of technical\n⁹ Zimmermann (note 4), 2; see also Nicholas Tsagourias, The Legal Status of Cyberspace, in: id./ Russell Buchan (eds.), Research Handbook on International Law and Cyberspace (2015), 13, 14 et seq.\n¹⁰ See generally as to jurisdictional issues related to ‘cyberspace’ Joachim Zekoll, Jurisdiction in Cyberspace, in: Günther Handl/Joachim Zekoll/Peer Zumbansen (eds.), Beyond Territoriality: Trans-\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE\n55\nfeasibility which State (or international organisation) is in a position to regulate behaviour in ‘cyberspace’, and also an issue of the willingness of States to eventually agree on more specific rules on the matter.\n## IV. Challenges for International Law in Cyberspace\nAlthough communication in cyberspace is under international law *de jure* subject to the jurisdiction of one or more States, and thus does not constitute a novel phenomenon for international law as such, communication *via* the internet nevertheless, given its specific technical characteristics, does pose new challenges for international law. For one, and more generally, given the speed by which technological developments concerning cyberspace take place, the more traditional ways of creating norms of international law, be it by way of multilateral treaties, be it by way of developing rules of customary international law, run the danger of being the hare in a new form of ‘hare and hedgehog’ race. As a result, most currently existing norms of international law in this field are of a fairly general nature.\nThis phenomenon is compounded by an unwillingness of many States, as well as non-State actors such as multinational enterprises that have a technological lead in cyberspace, to have their behaviour in cyberspace regulated by specific treaty-based rules; these actors instead see the lack of effective international regulation of their activities as an advantage to be exploited. By the same token, given the enormous technological gap that exists between highly industrialised States and multinational companies, on the one hand, and smaller States on the other, many States might *de facto* not fully be in a position to exercise even a minimal form of control of cyberspace activities emanating from or affecting their territory; indeed, they might even lack sufficient capabilities to frame an appropriate regulatory (legal) framework governing such activities.\nMoreover, both the *de facto* (but *de facto* only!) de-territorialisation of cyberspace activities (in that information is being routed through a large number of States and territories) and the sheer amount of information being produced might lead to a lack\nnational Legal Authority in an Age of Globalization (2012), 341–369; Uta Kohl, Jurisdiction in Cyberspace, in: Tsagourias/Buchan (eds.)

Cyberspace, the Prohibition of the Use of Force, and Jus in Bello\nCyber security is, first and foremost, an item of the international law of peace, or, to paraphrase the former German President Gustav Heinemann, who once put it succinctly, albeit in a somewhat different context, ‘peace constitutes the real emergency\n¹¹ GA Res. 56/83 of 28 January 2002, Annex.\n¹² See on this issue Michael N.

Rather, it was the peacetime scenario below the threshold of an armed conflict that this conference focussed upon. Moreover, the conference was not about national security electronic surveillance programmes either, which indeed raise very specific issues beyond the realm of general international law. Indeed, we believe that the overall debate on ‘cyber security’ with its main focus on cyber warfare is, to a large degree, so far at least, somewhat one-sided.¹⁶\nWhile, obviously, both jus ad bellum and jus in bello rules do apply, as a matter of course, to activities in cyberspace, such activities do not normally reach, and so far have not reached, the threshold of Article 2 (4) UN Charter. Having said this, it is, of course, conceivable that a harmful cyberspace activity that is attributable to a State could amount to a violation of Article 2 (4) UN Charter, given its character and effects. Whenever such use of force even reaches the threshold of an armed attack, as defined by general rules of international law¹⁷ and, in particular, the case-law of the International Court of Justice (ICJ),¹⁸ in principle, the right of self-defence comes into play. In that regard, ‘cyber attacks’ (provided they do amount to armed attacks in the first place, which will probably be the case only rarely), just like other armed attacks, might raise the question whether such attacks, if they emanate from non-\n¹⁴ Gustav Heinemann, Inaugural Address “Dem Frieden dienen”, German Federal Parliament Plenary Protocol No. 05/245 of 1 July 1969, in: Verhandlungen des Deutschen Bundestages 1969, Vol. 70, 13661, 13664, 13665, available at: http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btp/05/05245.pdf (accessed on 5 November 2015): “Nicht der Krieg ist der Ernstfall, [...] sondern der Frieden ist der Ernstfall, in dem wir alle uns zu bewähren haben.” “War is not the quintessential emergency [...] rather, peace is the emergency in which we all have to prove ourselves” (English text available at: http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=169&amp;language=english (accessed on 23 September 2015)).\n¹⁵ Charter of the United Nations, 26 June 1945, UNCIO 15, 335 (UN Charter).\n¹⁶ But see most recently the various contributions in Ziolkowski (ed.)

In these respects, the judgment of the ICJ in the *Oil Platforms* case²⁰ is of particular relevance.\nBy the same token, once the threshold of an (international or non-international) armed conflict has either been reached by a cyber attack as such, or where cyber attacks are being undertaken as part of already ongoing hostilities, applicable norms of international humanitarian law also govern cyberspace-related activities that are undertaken as part of the armed conflict and that constitute an ‘attack’ within the meaning of international humanitarian law. Yet, ‘cyber warfare’ raises significant, and so far largely unresolved, questions, *inter alia* as to the character of cyber installations as military objects as well as to the legal characterisation of persons involved in cyber operations. State practice has not yet fully addressed these questions.²¹\n## VI.

Schmitt (ed.), Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (2013), passim.\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE\ntion.²² Moreover, it also has to ensure the full functioning of cyberspace as a basic pillar of international economic activity and social activity.\nThis is challenged by the ability of States (and indeed private actors) to effectively collect comprehensive information on any given person active on the internet in one way or the other. This reality leads to the question whether human rights standards, and namely guarantees relating to privacy, also apply in ‘cyberspace’ as a matter of their applicability *ratione materiae* and *ratione loci*.\nApart from specific treaty-based norms that may be applicable in a given case (such as e.g. the Council of Europe’s Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data²³), the area lacks specific rules. For one, it might be asked whether *de lege lata* all electronic data available in cyberspace are comprehensively protected by the concepts of ‘privacy’ and/or ‘correspondence’ under Article 17 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),²⁴ one of the issues (not yet conclusively resolved) being whether the 1966 ICCPR (or parallel norms of customary international law) can be interpreted in a manner as to also cover forms of communication not explicitly foreseen in 1966.\nFurthermore (provided one assumes that the relevant rules of international law do apply *ratione materiae* to cyberspace), one has to answer an additional question relating to the extraterritorial applicability of the right of privacy. Namely, the question arises whether, under either customary law or under Article 17 ICCPR, an individual who is not present on the territory of a State collecting the private data of this very individual *via* the internet finds himself “within the jurisdiction” of said State within the meaning of Article 2 (1) ICCPR (or the parallel norm of customary law). It is only if one were to provide a positive answer to this question that the applicability of the right to privacy would be triggered.²⁵\n²² See generally as to this issue also the contribution by Dinah PoKempner, Cyberspace and State Obligations in the Area of Human Rights, in: Ziolkowski (ed.) (note 12), 239; David P. Fidler, Cyberspace and Human Rights, in: Tsagourias/Buchan (eds.)

Cyberspace Governance: Which Way Forward?\nUnlike most other areas of international law, cyberspace so far lacks any significant inter-governmental governance structure. Rather, key private organisations acting with the aim of preserving the operational stability of the internet, such as ICANN, the “Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers,” as well as interconnection and peering agreements among internet service providers, provide for some form of self-regulatory capabilities of cyberspace. It remains to be seen whether this form of self-regulation will continue to be able to provide sufficient safeguards as to the functioning of the internet, in line with the applicable principles of international law outlined above, or whether one should not aim at some form of intergovernmental internet governance. Yet, recent initiatives within the International Telecommunication Union’s (ITU) system have shown that such attempts of coming up with universally accepted inter-State governance structures might run the risk of being (mis-)used for subjecting cyberspace-based activities to over-broad governmental regulation (or, in other words, censorship), and thus run the risk of limiting rather than protecting the human rights of internet users.\n²⁶ GA Res. 68/167 of 18 December 2013.

A/HRC/27/37 (2014).\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE 61\nAt the same time, States share an interest in maintaining cyberspace free from interruptions, *i.e.* a cyberspace which is not misused in a way that unduly affects other States, their infrastructure, or their population. In order to function in such a way, cyberspace presupposes and requires a certain behaviour of States. The set of rules for such behaviour ought to possess a legally binding character. It is submitted that time has come to identify common legal understandings for cyberspace that serve to prevent direct damages caused by cyber activities, as well as to limit harm and loss resulting from such damages. This indeed is what the conference, which led to the various contributions to be found beneath, was all about. In approaching this question, the guiding (and indeed self-evident) principle must be strict adherence to international law including, in particular, human rights, and the established principles of State responsibility.\n## VIII. Cyberspace and Inter-State Due Diligence Obligations\nThe starting point for any research into States’ obligations in cyberspace has to be its complexity and its interconnectivity as well as the network character of cyberspace. As in other areas where interests of different States are intrinsically intertwined, this requires that States respect legitimate interests of other States within cyberspace and cooperate in responding to threats to the common sphere of interest.\nWithin the international community, there is consensus that there exists a general obligation of States to prevent their territory (and hence also cyberspace-related infrastructure located on their territory) from being used for acts contrary to the rights of other States, unlawfully harming such other States.²⁹ The leading case on this question is, of course, the merits judgment of the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case.³⁰ As the Court then put it, a State breaches this obligation if it fails to act with due diligence.³¹ This principle of international law is referred to as both the “principle of due\n²⁹ *Geiß/Lahmann* (note 19), 632 et seq.\n³⁰ ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland *v.* Albania), Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 4.\n³¹ *Ibid.*, 22, where the Court *inter alia* refers to “every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\ndiligence”³² and also the “no harm principle”,³³ describing two elements of one and the same obligation.\nNo matter how this principle is labelled, it is of particular relevance in cases where harmful actions either cannot be attributed to a particular State or where only insufficient proof for such attribution can be provided by the victim State.\nAs is well-known, historically the concept of due diligence was developed with regard to the responsibility of States for the behaviour of private actors. States are expected to take preventive measures in their sphere of exclusive control, when internationally unlawful harm is being caused by actions of private persons. The respective invocation of due diligence can be traced back to the Alabama Arbitration of 1872.³⁴\nUnder modern international law, the scope of the due diligence principle transcends its historical origins. There seems to be consensus that due diligence constitutes a general principle of law, both in the field of international environmental law³⁵ and in situations of risk of other transboundary harm.³⁶ It accordingly only seems logical to apply the concept of due diligence also when it comes to situations of risk of transboundary harm within cyberspace.\nThe application of this principle would mean that all States share a common obligation to ensure that neither their territory, nor hardware and cyber infrastructure situated on their territory or under their effective control, is misused to harm other States or their residents.\n³² Timo Koivurova, Due Diligence, Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL), February 2010, paras. 1 et seq., available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 23 September 2015).\n³³ Ibid., para. 3.\n³⁴ Alabama Claims (United States of America, Great Britain), Arbitral Award of 8 May 1871, Reports of International Arbitral Awards XXIX, 125; see also Tom Bingham, Alabama Arbitration, MPEPIL, October 2006, para. 7, available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 23 September 2015).\n³⁵ Koivurova (note 32), para. 9.\n³⁶ ICJ, Corfu Channel (note 30), 4, 22; Günther Handl, Transboundary Impact, in: Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of International Environmental Law (2007), 531, 541 (with further references); Pierre-Marie Dupuy, Formation of Customary International Law and General Principles, in: Bodansky/Brunnée/Hey (eds.)

A/56/10 (2001), 377, General Commentary, para. 3.\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE 63\nDue diligence could thus be regarded as a minimum standard providing a test whether a specific State conduct is up to what a ‘good government’ would do in such situations of transboundary risk. Therefore, the argument can validly be made that due diligence does not necessarily require identical measures from all States. As a matter of fact, a certain lack of economic and technological capacity of a particular State might reduce its due diligence obligations.³⁷ Moreover, the requirements due diligence sets out are context-specific. Different measures might be required in different circumstances. It also seems that there can be different legal requirements for a State depending on whether a harmful activity has its origin or its effect in its territory.\nIn all these cases, due diligence could entail both substantive and/or procedural obligations. The latter ones may require States to create specific institutional capacities. Moreover, there could be a duty to cooperate in cases of transboundary harm. Additionally, responsibilities might change during the different stages of harmful activities. Whereas duties of prevention might dominate before any harmful act is committed, during or after such an act, it is cooperation between States that might primarily be required then.\nFinally, the concept of ‘harm’ inflicted on other States also needs special attention. It seems that not every harm inflicted on another State automatically entails that due diligence obligations have been violated.³⁸ Rather, there appears to be a threshold triggering such due diligence obligations.\nIn light of the results to be found in the various contributions compiled hereinafter as part of this year’s GYIL Focus Section, one might tentatively formulate the following guidelines:\nPrior to potentially harmful cyber activities, States could be obliged to take all measures necessary to prevent misuse of the cyber infrastructure under their jurisdiction or their effective control. Moreover, they could be required to ensure that any perpe\n³⁷ Patricia Birnie/Alan Boyle/Catherine Redgwell (eds.), International Law and the Environment (3rd ed. 2009), 149; Brunneé/Meshel (note 13), 134 et seq.; Benedikt Pirker, Territorial Sovereignty and Integrity and the Challenge of Cyberspace, in: Ziolkowski (ed.)

This might encompass an obligation to build up specific institutional capacities. At the same time, for one, States can in any event be only obliged to do what is technically feasible in light of their respective abilities – *ultra posse nemo obligatur* – and besides, one must carefully balance any such oversight with legitimate privacy rights of individual internet users.\n*During* an ongoing cyber attack, considerations of due diligence might require that the State of origin and/or the transit States take all appropriate measures to stop these activities. In order not to jump from the frying pan into the fire, States should probably ensure that their responsive measures intrude as little as possible on the network communications process necessary to stop the attack.\n*In the aftermath* of a cyber attack, all States concerned, in particular the State of origin and possible transit States, could be required to take steps necessary to identify the source of the harmful activity and to prevent a repetition of similar future actions. Possible target States should in turn prepare their network infrastructure to ensure that the impact of an attack remains as limited as possible. Probably, States should in particular do all that is necessary to ensure resilience of their critical infrastructure and to prevent the possibility of negative repercussions on critical civil infrastructure, including electricity networks, water supplies, or nuclear power plants.\nFinally, due diligence might also require States to disclose intelligence concerning harmful acts against their cyber infrastructure, at least as long as national security interests are not compromised. Thereby, a State would enable other States to implement effective preventive measures before becoming the target of similar attacks. This might require establishing national points of contact facilitating the exchange of information between affected States.\nAt the same time two important points warrant underlining: First, none of the principles introduced here should in any way impede the application of the prohibition of the use of force, the right to self-defence, the rules of international humanitarian law, if applicable, or the principles of State responsibility in case damaging activities can be attributed to a specific State.\nSecond, whatever obligations States might have in preventing or minimising harm caused by cyber attacks, it should not be forgotten that cyberspace must remain a place where individual actors exercise their freedom, where economic activity can\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE\nflourish, and where States can operate effectively. Responsible State practice adhering to due diligence could provide a durable and solid basis to ensure such a cyberspace.\n## IX. Structure and Content of the Focus Section\nIt is in light of these considerations that the conveners of the conference, whose papers are published in this Focus Section, have requested the various authors to address some of the crucial, so far largely unanswered legal questions deriving from the applicability of this generally accepted, but very general concept of due diligence to ‘cyberspace’.\nMore specifically, the opening piece by Christian Walter considers the “Obligations of States Before, During, and After a Cyber Security Incident” as they arise under general international law and notably the concept of due diligence.³⁹ Oliver Dörr then specifically addresses possible “Obligations of the State of Origin of a Cyber Security Incident”,⁴⁰ while August Reinisch and Markus Beham deal with and analyse the specific obligations of transit States in their contribution entitled “Mitigating Risks: Inter-State Due Diligence Obligations in Case of Harmful Cyber-Incidents and Malicious Cyber-Activity: Obligations of the Transit State”.⁴¹\nIn turn Robert Kolb reflects more generally on the concept of due diligence duties and their relevance concerning cyberspace from the standpoint of general international law,⁴² while Jutta Brunnée and Tamar Meshel then consider whether international environmental law, which also deals with an international common good, might serve as a blueprint for cyberspace governance.⁴³ Last but not least, Matthias Herdegen considers the possible international legal framework as well as possible reg-\n³⁹ See Christian Walter, Obligations of States Before, During, and After a Cyber Security Incident, GYIL 58 (2015), 67.\n⁴⁰ See Dörr (note 13).\n⁴¹ See August Reinisch/Markus Beham, Mitigating Risks: Inter-State Due Diligence Obligations in Case of Harmful Cyber-Incidents and Malicious Cyber-Activity: Obligations of the Transit State, GYIL 58 (2015), 101.\n⁴² See Kolb (note 13).\n⁴³ Brunnée/Meshel (note 13).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nulatory models for cyberspace, taking into account general due diligence obligations, but also institutional models for forms of enhanced inter-State cooperation in cyberspace.⁴⁴\n## X. Outlook\nAs with other areas of international law which have developed only during the last decades, such as international environmental law,⁴⁵ only time will tell whether the international community of States will be able and willing to come up with specific and adequate rules of international law applicable to ‘cyberspace’. Yet, as mentioned before, this is nothing peculiar to cyberspace. Rather, one has previously seen similar developments in other areas, international environmental law being a particularly relevant example at hand, before specific treaty regimes were later established.\nPending such a development, States and other actors can only rely on general, and thus necessarily relatively vague, rules of international law, such as the concept of due diligence, and attempt to apply them to human activities in cyberspace. It is for that reason that the various contributions to this Focus Section have concentrated on this very concept in considerable detail and from various perspectives.\nWe hope that this year’s GYIL overall Focus Section, by documenting the outcome of the 2013 cyber conference held in Berlin and organised jointly by the two authors of this brief introduction, may contribute to foster and further develop a legal framework for a peaceful use of cyberspace in the interest of the overall international community.\n⁴⁴ *Herdegen* (note 38).\n⁴⁵ As to the possibility of transposing principles developed within international environmental law to cyberspace, see, apart from the contribution by *Brunnée/Meshel* in this very Focus Section (note 13), also *Maraubn* (note 38), 465 et seq."

Introduction This year’s Focus Section of the German Yearbook of International Law (GYIL) contains and documents the results of a scientific conference organised by the German Federal Foreign Office in co-operation with the University of Potsdam in which both legal academics as well as practitioners from around the world participated.\nGiven that Germany has repeatedly underlined that securing the freedom and stability of cyberspace constitutes an important aim of German foreign policy, the German Federal Foreign Office organised (and continues to organise) a series of “Berlin Cyber Conferences”, intending to gather international cutting-edge expertise in the field of cyber security. The conference, the outcome of which is published hereinafter thanks to the efforts of the respective authors as well as those of the editors and the editorial staff of the GYIL for which we are particularly grateful, has been the third in this sequence of conferences, after the conference on “Challenges in Cyber Security – Risks, Strategies and Confidence-Building” held in December 2011,¹ and the one on * Dr. jur. utr., M.A. (Oxon.), Ambassador of Germany to India; formerly Legal Adviser, Federal Foreign Office, Berlin.\n** Dr. jur., LL.M.

Given that these very principles also constituted the framework and overarching theme of the third 2013 Berlin cyber conference, the content and results of which are hereinafter documented, it is appropriate to quote three main points from his 2012 address, namely that: Firstly, freedom has to be our overriding priority in internet matters. Respect for the freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, the rights to access to information and the right to personal privacy must be ensured.\nSecondly, with freedom comes responsibility. This applies to societies in general. It applies to the global internet society in particular. Self-regulation should be an important principle of its governance. All stakeholders – individuals, companies, governments – have to act responsibly. Therefore, regulation has to step in when our values and rule of law are in danger or democratic legitimation is no longer assured.\nFinally, transparency and knowledge will help us to make informed decisions in line with our values. We will continue to share information, to include the global public, and to foster transparent policy dialogue.³ ## II.

At the same time, however, there are almost no specific norms of international law that specifically govern ‘cyberspace’ given that the underlying technology is so new.\nYet, it is not the first time that international law faces new technological developments. In earlier times, to give but two examples, international law was in a similarly sudden manner confronted with radio waves crossing boundaries, or was confronted with mankind being able to reach extraterrestrial bodies – and each time it was simply taken for granted, and rightly so, that such human behaviour was governed by pre-existing norms of international law.\nAnd as in those earlier cases, activities in ‘cyberspace’, too, are governed by international law as such, and be it only by the norm that where no (general or specific) rule prohibiting the behaviour in question exists, States have retained their freedom to act.⁵ This is, inter alia, confirmed by the work of the “Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security”, set up in the framework of the United Nations General Assembly’s First Committee.⁶ As its report of 7 June 2013 in New York quite rightly confirmed in unequivocal terms, “international law, and in particular the U.N. Charter, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT [i.e. information and communications technology] environment.”⁷ What is more is that the report also emphasised that “State sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to State conduct of ICT-related activities, and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory.”⁸ ⁵ See generally on that issue Ulrich Fastenrath, Lücken im Völkerrecht: Zu Rechtscharakter, Quellen, Systemzusammenhang, Methodenlehre und Funktionen des Völkerrechts (1991), passim.\n⁶ Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, Report of 7 June 2013, UN Doc.

Given however the very general nature of those rules, as well as the lack of generally accepted, efficient, and rule-based inter-State international governance structures concerning the internet, ‘cyberspace’ nevertheless constitutes a major challenge for international law as it currently stands.\nIt is against this background that the various papers contained in this very Focus Section of the GYIL attempt to assess the extent to which, and how, human activities in cyberspace are indeed governed by international law, and what the applicable norms are. When studying the relevance of international law for cyberspace at this conference, it was not the primary objective either of its organisers or its participants to define restrictions or limitations for cyberspace freedom. On the contrary, the principal aim was to secure that cyberspace remains a sphere where individual actors exercise their freedom, where economic activity can flourish, and where States can operate effectively.\n## III. Notion of ‘Cyberspace’ and its Legal (Ir)relevance Not infrequently, when discussing which rules of international law apply to ‘cyberspace’, it is referred to as a mere virtual space where computer-mediated communication takes place but which cannot be spatially located.⁹ Yet, to state the obvious, any such communication requires hardware that must be located somewhere. What is more, any such information is then physically routed through the territory of one or more States (and possibly through outer space) before it reaches the addressee, which, again, confirms that there necessarily exists a territorial nexus of any activity in ‘cyberspace’ to at least one State. Accordingly, while ‘cyberspace’ might describe a phenomenon of information being routed through various jurisdictions, it still does not constitute some new form of ‘outer space’ where no State could, as a matter of international law, exercise its jurisdiction.¹⁰ Rather, it is more an issue of technical ⁹ Zimmermann (note 4), 2; see also Nicholas Tsagourias, The Legal Status of Cyberspace, in: id./ Russell Buchan (eds.), Research Handbook on International Law and Cyberspace (2015), 13, 14 et seq.\n¹⁰ See generally as to jurisdictional issues related to ‘cyberspace’ Joachim Zekoll, Jurisdiction in Cyberspace, in: Günther Handl/Joachim Zekoll/Peer Zumbansen (eds.), Beyond Territoriality: Trans- CYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE\n\n## IV. Challenges for International Law in Cyberspace\nAlthough communication in cyberspace is under international law *de jure* subject to the jurisdiction of one or more States, and thus does not constitute a novel phenomenon for international law as such, communication *via* the internet nevertheless, given its specific technical characteristics, does pose new challenges for international law. For one, and more generally, given the speed by which technological developments concerning cyberspace take place, the more traditional ways of creating norms of international law, be it by way of multilateral treaties, be it by way of developing rules of customary international law, run the danger of being the hare in a new form of ‘hare and hedgehog’ race. As a result, most currently existing norms of international law in this field are of a fairly general nature.\nThis phenomenon is compounded by an unwillingness of many States, as well as non-State actors such as multinational enterprises that have a technological lead in cyberspace, to have their behaviour in cyberspace regulated by specific treaty-based rules; these actors instead see the lack of effective international regulation of their activities as an advantage to be exploited. By the same token, given the enormous technological gap that exists between highly industrialised States and multinational companies, on the one hand, and smaller States on the other, many States might *de facto* not fully be in a position to exercise even a minimal form of control of cyberspace activities emanating from or affecting their territory; indeed, they might even lack sufficient capabilities to frame an appropriate regulatory (legal) framework governing such activities.\nMoreover, both the *de facto* (but *de facto* only!) de-territorialisation of cyberspace activities (in that information is being routed through a large number of States and territories) and the sheer amount of information being produced might lead to a lack\nnational Legal Authority in an Age of Globalization (2012), 341–369; Uta Kohl, Jurisdiction in Cyberspace, in: Tsagourias/Buchan (eds.) (note 9), 30.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nof effective regulatory mechanisms to be used by States when it comes to detecting, and eventually addressing, harmful activities in cyberspace, regardless of whether they emanate from private actors or from other States.\nAnother aspect of such de facto de-territorialisation of cyberspace activities can be seen in the fact that the effects of activities in cyberspace, even when they emanate from States, often occur abroad, which in many cases raises the question whether the international obligations a State has undertaken (be they treaty-based or of a customary nature) also apply in such cross-boundary and extraterritorial settings.\nMoreover, given the technological environment in which cyberspace activities occur, it will be often, if not always, difficult or even impossible, to trace back any such activities, even when they emanate from actors whose actions would otherwise be attributable to a given State under applicable norms of international law, as codified in the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility.¹¹ Accordingly, in many cases, while the general law on State responsibility is applicable as such, it might not be fully adequate to regulate cyberspace-related activities.¹² This in turn requires international law to either develop specific norms of attribution (including specific evidentiary norms), or to come up with specific primary norms that can adequately address the matter.¹³\nV. Cyberspace, the Prohibition of the Use of Force, and Jus in Bello\nCyber security is, first and foremost, an item of the international law of peace, or, to paraphrase the former German President Gustav Heinemann, who once put it succinctly, albeit in a somewhat different context, ‘peace constitutes the real emergency\n¹¹ GA Res. 56/83 of 28 January 2002, Annex.\n¹² See on this issue Michael N. Schmitt, Cyber Activities and the Law of Countermeasures, in: Katharina Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy (2013), 659, 668 et seq; Constantine Antonopoulos, State Responsibility in Cyberspace, in: Tsagourias/Buchan (eds.) (note 9), 55.\n¹³ See as to this issue also the contributions by Robert Kolb, Reflections on Due Diligence Duties and Cyberspace, German Yearbook of International Law (GYIL) 58 (2015), 113; Oliver Dörr, Obligations of the State of Origin of a Cyber Security Incident, GYIL 58 (2015), 87; Jutta Brunneé/Tamar Meshel, Teaching an Old Law New Tricks: International Environmental Law Lessons for Cyberspace Governance, GYIL 58 (2015), 129.\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE 57\nin which international law has to prove itself.¹⁴ Indeed, it follows from the very Charter of the United Nations (UN Charter)¹⁵ that peace and security take precedence in international relations, and this, obviously, holds also true when it comes to inter-State relations in cyberspace.\nHence, neither issues of the use of armed force (jus ad bellum) nor jus in bello issues were what the conference, whose proceedings are reproduced here, wanted to address. Rather, it was the peacetime scenario below the threshold of an armed conflict that this conference focussed upon. Moreover, the conference was not about national security electronic surveillance programmes either, which indeed raise very specific issues beyond the realm of general international law. Indeed, we believe that the overall debate on ‘cyber security’ with its main focus on cyber warfare is, to a large degree, so far at least, somewhat one-sided.¹⁶\nWhile, obviously, both jus ad bellum and jus in bello rules do apply, as a matter of course, to activities in cyberspace, such activities do not normally reach, and so far have not reached, the threshold of Article 2 (4) UN Charter. Having said this, it is, of course, conceivable that a harmful cyberspace activity that is attributable to a State could amount to a violation of Article 2 (4) UN Charter, given its character and effects. Whenever such use of force even reaches the threshold of an armed attack, as defined by general rules of international law¹⁷ and, in particular, the case-law of the International Court of Justice (ICJ),¹⁸ in principle, the right of self-defence comes into play. In that regard, ‘cyber attacks’ (provided they do amount to armed attacks in the first place, which will probably be the case only rarely), just like other armed attacks, might raise the question whether such attacks, if they emanate from non-\n¹⁴ Gustav Heinemann, Inaugural Address “Dem Frieden dienen”, German Federal Parliament Plenary Protocol No. 05/245 of 1 July 1969, in: Verhandlungen des Deutschen Bundestages 1969, Vol. 70, 13661, 13664, 13665, available at: http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btp/05/05245.pdf (accessed on 5 November 2015): “Nicht der Krieg ist der Ernstfall, [...] sondern der Frieden ist der Ernstfall, in dem wir alle uns zu bewähren haben.” “War is not the quintessential emergency [...] rather, peace is the emergency in which we all have to prove ourselves” (English text available at: http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=169&amp;language=english (accessed on 23 September 2015)).\n¹⁵ Charter of the United Nations, 26 June 1945, UNCIO 15, 335 (UN Charter).\n¹⁶ But see most recently the various contributions in Ziolkowski (ed.)

In these respects, the judgment of the ICJ in the *Oil Platforms* case²⁰ is of particular relevance.\nBy the same token, once the threshold of an (international or non-international) armed conflict has either been reached by a cyber attack as such, or where cyber attacks are being undertaken as part of already ongoing hostilities, applicable norms of international humanitarian law also govern cyberspace-related activities that are undertaken as part of the armed conflict and that constitute an ‘attack’ within the meaning of international humanitarian law. Yet, ‘cyber warfare’ raises significant, and so far largely unresolved, questions, *inter alia* as to the character of cyber installations as military objects as well as to the legal characterisation of persons involved in cyber operations. State practice has not yet fully addressed these questions.²¹\n## VI.

Schmitt (ed.), Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (2013), passim.\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE\ntion.²² Moreover, it also has to ensure the full functioning of cyberspace as a basic pillar of international economic activity and social activity.\nThis is challenged by the ability of States (and indeed private actors) to effectively collect comprehensive information on any given person active on the internet in one way or the other. This reality leads to the question whether human rights standards, and namely guarantees relating to privacy, also apply in ‘cyberspace’ as a matter of their applicability *ratione materiae* and *ratione loci*.\nApart from specific treaty-based norms that may be applicable in a given case (such as e.g. the Council of Europe’s Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data²³), the area lacks specific rules. For one, it might be asked whether *de lege lata* all electronic data available in cyberspace are comprehensively protected by the concepts of ‘privacy’ and/or ‘correspondence’ under Article 17 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),²⁴ one of the issues (not yet conclusively resolved) being whether the 1966 ICCPR (or parallel norms of customary international law) can be interpreted in a manner as to also cover forms of communication not explicitly foreseen in 1966.\nFurthermore (provided one assumes that the relevant rules of international law do apply *ratione materiae* to cyberspace), one has to answer an additional question relating to the extraterritorial applicability of the right of privacy. Namely, the question arises whether, under either customary law or under Article 17 ICCPR, an individual who is not present on the territory of a State collecting the private data of this very individual *via* the internet finds himself “within the jurisdiction” of said State within the meaning of Article 2 (1) ICCPR (or the parallel norm of customary law). It is only if one were to provide a positive answer to this question that the applicability of the right to privacy would be triggered.²⁵\n²² See generally as to this issue also the contribution by Dinah PoKempner, Cyberspace and State Obligations in the Area of Human Rights, in: Ziolkowski (ed.) (note 12), 239; David P. Fidler, Cyberspace and Human Rights, in: Tsagourias/Buchan (eds.)

Cyberspace Governance: Which Way Forward?\nUnlike most other areas of international law, cyberspace so far lacks any significant inter-governmental governance structure. Rather, key private organisations acting with the aim of preserving the operational stability of the internet, such as ICANN, the “Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers,” as well as interconnection and peering agreements among internet service providers, provide for some form of self-regulatory capabilities of cyberspace. It remains to be seen whether this form of self-regulation will continue to be able to provide sufficient safeguards as to the functioning of the internet, in line with the applicable principles of international law outlined above, or whether one should not aim at some form of intergovernmental internet governance. Yet, recent initiatives within the International Telecommunication Union’s (ITU) system have shown that such attempts of coming up with universally accepted inter-State governance structures might run the risk of being (mis-)used for subjecting cyberspace-based activities to over-broad governmental regulation (or, in other words, censorship), and thus run the risk of limiting rather than protecting the human rights of internet users.\n²⁶ GA Res. 68/167 of 18 December 2013. See also on this Resolution Martin Weiler, The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age: The Commitment to Human Rights Online, GYII. 57 (2014), 651.\n²⁷ GA Res. 68/167 (note 26), para. 5.\n²⁸ Human Rights Council, The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age, UN Doc. A/HRC/27/37 (2014).\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE 61\nAt the same time, States share an interest in maintaining cyberspace free from interruptions, *i.e.* a cyberspace which is not misused in a way that unduly affects other States, their infrastructure, or their population. In order to function in such a way, cyberspace presupposes and requires a certain behaviour of States. The set of rules for such behaviour ought to possess a legally binding character. It is submitted that time has come to identify common legal understandings for cyberspace that serve to prevent direct damages caused by cyber activities, as well as to limit harm and loss resulting from such damages. This indeed is what the conference, which led to the various contributions to be found beneath, was all about. In approaching this question, the guiding (and indeed self-evident) principle must be strict adherence to international law including, in particular, human rights, and the established principles of State responsibility.\n## VIII. Cyberspace and Inter-State Due Diligence Obligations\nThe starting point for any research into States’ obligations in cyberspace has to be its complexity and its interconnectivity as well as the network character of cyberspace. As in other areas where interests of different States are intrinsically intertwined, this requires that States respect legitimate interests of other States within cyberspace and cooperate in responding to threats to the common sphere of interest.\nWithin the international community, there is consensus that there exists a general obligation of States to prevent their territory (and hence also cyberspace-related infrastructure located on their territory) from being used for acts contrary to the rights of other States, unlawfully harming such other States.²⁹ The leading case on this question is, of course, the merits judgment of the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case.³⁰ As the Court then put it, a State breaches this obligation if it fails to act with due diligence.³¹ This principle of international law is referred to as both the “principle of due\n²⁹ *Geiß/Lahmann* (note 19), 632 et seq.\n³⁰ ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland *v.* Albania), Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 4.\n³¹ *Ibid.*, 22, where the Court *inter alia* refers to “every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\ndiligence”³² and also the “no harm principle”,³³ describing two elements of one and the same obligation.\nNo matter how this principle is labelled, it is of particular relevance in cases where harmful actions either cannot be attributed to a particular State or where only insufficient proof for such attribution can be provided by the victim State.\nAs is well-known, historically the concept of due diligence was developed with regard to the responsibility of States for the behaviour of private actors. States are expected to take preventive measures in their sphere of exclusive control, when internationally unlawful harm is being caused by actions of private persons. The respective invocation of due diligence can be traced back to the Alabama Arbitration of 1872.³⁴\nUnder modern international law, the scope of the due diligence principle transcends its historical origins. There seems to be consensus that due diligence constitutes a general principle of law, both in the field of international environmental law³⁵ and in situations of risk of other transboundary harm.³⁶ It accordingly only seems logical to apply the concept of due diligence also when it comes to situations of risk of transboundary harm within cyberspace.\nThe application of this principle would mean that all States share a common obligation to ensure that neither their territory, nor hardware and cyber infrastructure situated on their territory or under their effective control, is misused to harm other States or their residents.\n³² Timo Koivurova, Due Diligence, Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL), February 2010, paras. 1 et seq., available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 23 September 2015).\n³³ Ibid., para. 3.\n³⁴ Alabama Claims (United States of America, Great Britain), Arbitral Award of 8 May 1871, Reports of International Arbitral Awards XXIX, 125; see also Tom Bingham, Alabama Arbitration, MPEPIL, October 2006, para. 7, available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 23 September 2015).\n³⁵ Koivurova (note 32), para. 9.\n³⁶ ICJ, Corfu Channel (note 30), 4, 22; Günther Handl, Transboundary Impact, in: Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of International Environmental Law (2007), 531, 541 (with further references); Pierre-Marie Dupuy, Formation of Customary International Law and General Principles, in: Bodansky/Brunnée/Hey (eds.)

A/56/10 (2001), 377, General Commentary, para. 3.\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE 63\nDue diligence could thus be regarded as a minimum standard providing a test whether a specific State conduct is up to what a ‘good government’ would do in such situations of transboundary risk. Therefore, the argument can validly be made that due diligence does not necessarily require identical measures from all States. As a matter of fact, a certain lack of economic and technological capacity of a particular State might reduce its due diligence obligations.³⁷ Moreover, the requirements due diligence sets out are context-specific. Different measures might be required in different circumstances. It also seems that there can be different legal requirements for a State depending on whether a harmful activity has its origin or its effect in its territory.\nIn all these cases, due diligence could entail both substantive and/or procedural obligations. The latter ones may require States to create specific institutional capacities. Moreover, there could be a duty to cooperate in cases of transboundary harm. Additionally, responsibilities might change during the different stages of harmful activities. Whereas duties of prevention might dominate before any harmful act is committed, during or after such an act, it is cooperation between States that might primarily be required then.\nFinally, the concept of ‘harm’ inflicted on other States also needs special attention. It seems that not every harm inflicted on another State automatically entails that due diligence obligations have been violated.³⁸ Rather, there appears to be a threshold triggering such due diligence obligations.\nIn light of the results to be found in the various contributions compiled hereinafter as part of this year’s GYIL Focus Section, one might tentatively formulate the following guidelines:\nPrior to potentially harmful cyber activities, States could be obliged to take all measures necessary to prevent misuse of the cyber infrastructure under their jurisdiction or their effective control. Moreover, they could be required to ensure that any perpe\n³⁷ Patricia Birnie/Alan Boyle/Catherine Redgwell (eds.), International Law and the Environment (3rd ed. 2009), 149; Brunneé/Meshel (note 13), 134 et seq.; Benedikt Pirker, Territorial Sovereignty and Integrity and the Challenge of Cyberspace, in: Ziolkowski (ed.)

This might encompass an obligation to build up specific institutional capacities. At the same time, for one, States can in any event be only obliged to do what is technically feasible in light of their respective abilities – *ultra posse nemo obligatur* – and besides, one must carefully balance any such oversight with legitimate privacy rights of individual internet users.\n*During* an ongoing cyber attack, considerations of due diligence might require that the State of origin and/or the transit States take all appropriate measures to stop these activities. In order not to jump from the frying pan into the fire, States should probably ensure that their responsive measures intrude as little as possible on the network communications process necessary to stop the attack.\n*In the aftermath* of a cyber attack, all States concerned, in particular the State of origin and possible transit States, could be required to take steps necessary to identify the source of the harmful activity and to prevent a repetition of similar future actions. Possible target States should in turn prepare their network infrastructure to ensure that the impact of an attack remains as limited as possible. Probably, States should in particular do all that is necessary to ensure resilience of their critical infrastructure and to prevent the possibility of negative repercussions on critical civil infrastructure, including electricity networks, water supplies, or nuclear power plants.\nFinally, due diligence might also require States to disclose intelligence concerning harmful acts against their cyber infrastructure, at least as long as national security interests are not compromised. Thereby, a State would enable other States to implement effective preventive measures before becoming the target of similar attacks. This might require establishing national points of contact facilitating the exchange of information between affected States.\nAt the same time two important points warrant underlining: First, none of the principles introduced here should in any way impede the application of the prohibition of the use of force, the right to self-defence, the rules of international humanitarian law, if applicable, or the principles of State responsibility in case damaging activities can be attributed to a specific State.\nSecond, whatever obligations States might have in preventing or minimising harm caused by cyber attacks, it should not be forgotten that cyberspace must remain a place where individual actors exercise their freedom, where economic activity can\nCYBER-SECURITY BEYOND THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE\nflourish, and where States can operate effectively. Responsible State practice adhering to due diligence could provide a durable and solid basis to ensure such a cyberspace.\n## IX. Structure and Content of the Focus Section\nIt is in light of these considerations that the conveners of the conference, whose papers are published in this Focus Section, have requested the various authors to address some of the crucial, so far largely unanswered legal questions deriving from the applicability of this generally accepted, but very general concept of due diligence to ‘cyberspace’.\nMore specifically, the opening piece by Christian Walter considers the “Obligations of States Before, During, and After a Cyber Security Incident” as they arise under general international law and notably the concept of due diligence.³⁹ Oliver Dörr then specifically addresses possible “Obligations of the State of Origin of a Cyber Security Incident”,⁴⁰ while August Reinisch and Markus Beham deal with and analyse the specific obligations of transit States in their contribution entitled “Mitigating Risks: Inter-State Due Diligence Obligations in Case of Harmful Cyber-Incidents and Malicious Cyber-Activity: Obligations of the Transit State”.⁴¹\nIn turn Robert Kolb reflects more generally on the concept of due diligence duties and their relevance concerning cyberspace from the standpoint of general international law,⁴² while Jutta Brunnée and Tamar Meshel then consider whether international environmental law, which also deals with an international common good, might serve as a blueprint for cyberspace governance.⁴³ Last but not least, Matthias Herdegen considers the possible international legal framework as well as possible reg-\n³⁹ See Christian Walter, Obligations of States Before, During, and After a Cyber Security Incident, GYIL 58 (2015), 67.\n⁴⁰ See Dörr (note 13).\n⁴¹ See August Reinisch/Markus Beham, Mitigating Risks: Inter-State Due Diligence Obligations in Case of Harmful Cyber-Incidents and Malicious Cyber-Activity: Obligations of the Transit State, GYIL 58 (2015), 101.\n⁴² See Kolb (note 13).\n⁴³ Brunnée/Meshel (note 13).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nulatory models for cyberspace, taking into account general due diligence obligations, but also institutional models for forms of enhanced inter-State cooperation in cyberspace.⁴⁴\n## X. Outlook\nAs with other areas of international law which have developed only during the last decades, such as international environmental law,⁴⁵ only time will tell whether the international community of States will be able and willing to come up with specific and adequate rules of international law applicable to ‘cyberspace’. Yet, as mentioned before, this is nothing peculiar to cyberspace. Rather, one has previously seen similar developments in other areas, international environmental law being a particularly relevant example at hand, before specific treaty regimes were later established.\nPending such a development, States and other actors can only rely on general, and thus necessarily relatively vague, rules of international law, such as the concept of due diligence, and attempt to apply them to human activities in cyberspace. It is for that reason that the various contributions to this Focus Section have concentrated on this very concept in considerable detail and from various perspectives.\nWe hope that this year’s GYIL overall Focus Section, by documenting the outcome of the 2013 cyber conference held in Berlin and organised jointly by the two authors of this brief introduction, may contribute to foster and further develop a legal framework for a peaceful use of cyberspace in the interest of the overall international community.\n⁴⁴ *Herdegen* (note 38).\n⁴⁵ As to the possibility of transposing principles developed within international environmental law to cyberspace, see, apart from the contribution by *Brunnée/Meshel* in this very Focus Section (note 13), also *Maraubn* (note 38), 465 et seq."
