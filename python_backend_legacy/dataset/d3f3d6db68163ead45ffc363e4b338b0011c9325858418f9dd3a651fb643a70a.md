To date, however, cybersecurity has generated very little international law. How can this be explained? The article examines the factors underlying the difficult marriage between public international law and the high-tech phenomenon of cyberspace. What can or should the role of the State and/or the private sector in regulating cyberspace be? Should the international level create new laws to regulate cybersecurity or should the existing international legal principles simply be transposed to the new technological context? Today, it has become clear that the vast majority of cyber incidents do not reach the threshold of 'armed attack' in the sense of article 51 of the UN Charter. In reaction, we see that certain international organizations and nation States launched efforts to better protect cybersecurity sensu strictu. In this article, we focus on recent efforts within the UN and the EU. Notably, the article will answer whether the efforts to apply existing international law to cyberspace, undertaken by the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the Context of International Security, suffice. Why did the fifth round of negotiations among the Expert Group fail in 2017, and will there be another momentum to revive this diplomatic exercise? Zooming in on the protection of critical infrastructure specifically, how does the first horizontal and legally binding EU Directive on Network and Information Security (2016) fit in the worldwide effort to better regulate cybersecurity? This is interesting, as the Directive shows awareness of the diverse and complex nature of cybersecurity by imposing binding obligations upon the providers of essential services and digital providers.\nI Introduction\n1. Over the first two decades of this millennium, the risks flowing from each of the many clicks we perform every day became increasingly clear. Cybersecurity has entered the realm of foreign policy: think of the Stuxnet cyberattack by the U.S. and Israel that targeted Iranian\n¹ Anne Verhelst is PhD Researcher in International Law at the Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies and the Institute for International Law, KU Leuven, Belgium. Anne holds a four-year fellowship of the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO).\nnuclear facilities in 2010²; think of the cyberattacks that paralyzed Estonian government services in 2007³, and think of how the Wall Street Journal just this August reported that Iranian hackers are suspected to have pervaded critical infrastructure and government computers in Bahrein.⁴ These cyber threats emanating from State (and other) sources have over recent years brought about efforts to render critical infrastructure more resilient. A few initiatives of which we will highlight in this article. Yet, cybersecurity as a policy concern has generated very little international law up to now.\nA straightforward reason that partially explains this inertia, is that the scope, nature, meaning and terminology of cybersecurity is unclear.⁵ There is little general agreement about what cybersecurity entails, and it seems that individual people use the term differently, depending on the context.⁶ This article will depart from a concept of cybersecurity sensu strictu. In that view, cybersecurity shall mean \"the security of network and information systems; the ability of network and information systems to withstand, with a certain degree of confidence, actions that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored, transmitted or processed data or the related services provided or accessible through those network and information systems\".⁷ This article thus applies a concept of cybersecurity excluding a focus\n2 M.

Futter, 'Cyber semantics: why we should retire the latest buzzword in security studies', Journal of Cyber Policy 2018, 202. The terminological vagueness is not without practical impact: the definition of cybersecurity in a given context is after all contingent upon what and who is being deterred, how, and whether the attribution of capabilities is possible. The vague language means that it can be unclear who should take responsibility for ensuring cybersecurity, leading to various legal and practical obstacles in regulating the issue. See A.

Bashroush and J. Wall, 'Towards a More Representative Definition of Cyber Security', The Journal of Digital Forensics, Security and Law 2017, 53-57.\n7 Art. 4.2 EU Directive 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union, adopted on 6 July 2016, entered into force August 2016, OJ L 194, 1-30.\n2\non the specific threats of cybercrime⁸, cyber terrorism⁹ and cyber warfare¹⁰,¹¹ We opt for this definition as it originates in article 4.2 of the European Network and Information Security Directive (2016) (hereinafter: ‘NIS Directive’), which will form a large part of this study.\nAs the NIS Directive aims to protect critical infrastructure against cyber incidents, this article will pay specific attention to threats directed at critical infrastructure¹², rather than focusing on cyberattacks against the data of private people, against companies (when it has no larger societal effect), etc. Moreover, in this article we exclusively discuss the international regulatory level as viewed by a nation’s perspective, to which cybersecurity can be summarized and clarified to mean the “ability to protect itself and its institutions against cyber threats”.¹³\n2. The purpose of this article is to bring together, analyze and clarify where necessary the most important recent developments in cybersecurity law and initiatives within the United Nations (hereinafter: ‘UN’) and European Union (hereinafter: ‘EU’). The questions addressed in this article are the following. First, on a more abstract level, we will discuss whether international law can adequately regulate issues of cybersecurity. Are there any impediments that law places on the cyber domain (if so, which ones)? And vice versa, can the high-tech phenomenon of cybersecurity be embedded in international law? (Title II) The article then analyzes the most important legal, regulatory, and soft law developments in the field of cybersecurity within the UN, with specific attention paid to the work by the Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the Context\n⁸ Cybercrime can be defined as ‘a criminal activity in which computers or computer networks are the principal means of committing an offense’. Examples include cyber-theft, cyber-trespass, cyber-obscenity, and cyber-extortions. In section IV of this article, we will analyze the European Network and Information Security Directive (2016), which aims to protect critical infrastructure from cyber incidents. Note that some authors and instruments categorize cyberattacks against critical infrastructure under ‘cybercrime’. See N. Kshetri, ‘Global Cybersecurity: Key Issues and Concepts’, 3 and N. Kshetri, ‘Positive externality, increasing returns and the rise in cybercrimes’, Communications of the ACM 2009, 141–144. In this article, we will discuss the European Directive as aiming to protect critical infrastructure, regardless of whether a cyberattack against such infrastructure should be seen as falling under a strict definition of ‘cybercrime’. Specific regional instruments dedicated to cybercrime as such are the Council of Europe’s Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and the African Union’s Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection. See Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime of 23 November 2001, entered into force on 01 July 2004, ETS no 185; African Union, Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection 27 June 2014, entered into force 3 June 2019, online available at https://au.int/sites/default/files/treaties/29560-treaty-0048_-_african_union_convention_on_cyber_security_and_personal_data_protection_e.pdf (last accessed 11 November 2019).\n⁹ E.g.

The conclusion of the article stipulates some forward-looking comments (Title V).\n## II Cybersecurity and international law: irreconcilable?\n3. First and foremost, it should be clear that there is a broad understanding that international law applies in cyberspace to state behavior.¹⁴ This is to say, the rules developed before cybersecurity became a prominent (policy) problem. The same international legal norms that govern the physical space are applicable in cyberspace: the core question is thus not “if” international law applies to cyberspace, but rather “how” it does.¹⁵ How to efficiently translate the pre-cyber existing international law to cyberspace is difficult¹⁶, which can be explained by certain factors scrutinized right below.\n### A. Factors explaining the uneasy marriage between international law and cybersecurity\n4. Law as a system is no stranger to try and regulate rapid technological evolutions, be it developments in outer space, on the high seas, in the data collection domain, artificial intelligence, etc. This is equally so for cyberspace.¹⁷ The uneasy marriage between international law and cybersecurity can be explained by the intrinsic properties of both phenomena.\n¹⁴ In its 2013 Consensual Report (UN Doc. A/68/98, §19) and 2015 Consensual Report (UN Doc. A/70/174, §24), the UN GGE confirmed the applicability of international law, including the UN Charter, in cyberspace. Several States have already confirmed this position in their comments to these reports and in their national cyber defence and security strategies. The G20 states also confirmed this in 2015 (G20 Summit Communiqué, Antalya, 15-16 November 2015).

The digitization of the world is taking place at an unparalleled pace.¹⁸ It is expected that by 2020 there will be more than 20 billion connected devices.¹⁹ In contrast to how the international regulator in the last century was able to respond in a timely manner to certain evolutions, such as the international law of the sea concept 'exclusive economic zone' (EEZ)²⁰ and the protection of the seabed as 'common heritage of mankind'²¹, the cyber revolution is often said to be so fast and unpredictable that international law-making has difficulties catching up.²²\n2° Territoriality, sovereignty, fragmentation of jurisdiction and attribution\n6. It has become evident that the current global challenges cannot be adequately addressed by one single actor. Whether one thinks of climate change, international terrorism or cyber threats, international law offers a framework for international co-operation. Now let it be the case that the core concept on which international law is based, that of state sovereignty, does not effortlessly fit in cyberspace.²³ Although there is agreement that the principle of state sovereignty (UN Charter) applies in cyberspace²⁴, there is no one State that can claim sovereignty over the entire cyberspace.²⁵ The reason being that the many cyber infrastructures that make up cyberspace are located in different sovereign territories²⁶, and in international law, territoriality allocates jurisdiction. Nonetheless, this off and on fragmentation of jurisdiction should not be a reason to give up on regulating cybersecurity all together, we agree with TRACHTMAN, since after all, (cyber)conduct still occurs in a certain territory and effects are still felt in a certain territory.²⁷ Issues that transcend territorial jurisdiction are not new whatsoever to international law (e.g. the law of the high seas, outer space, climate change). The challenge here is linked to the attribution problem, understood as the difficulty to determine\n¹⁸ K.

A third factor that underlies the difficult relationship between cybersecurity and international law is the question of the (extent of the) regulatory role of the State versus that of the private sector in cyberspace.³¹ The alternatively controlled nature of cyberspace is the reason this debate exists³²: cyberspace is a domain in which industry and the private sector play a/the pivotal role. The private sector governs cyberspace in an informal fashion, leaving less room for the formal legislator (the nation State).³³ This informal governance is reminiscent of the *lex mercatoria*, the private economic law of the Middle Ages, according to HOISINGTON. The question is then to what extent the State must or can impose legal obligations on the private sector in regulating cybersecurity. Vice versa, to what extent can cybersecurity regulation be effective if the private sector is not involved in its preparation and implementation?\nThe discussion about the role of the State as legislator in cyberspace is prevalent: on the one hand one can argue that the nation State has the (moral) obligation to enact legislation that regulates or restricts the private sector in its cyber activities.³⁴ The argument here is that the State has to uphold binding obligations under international law, such as the protection of human rights, international peace and security, the customary 'no harm' principle³⁵, the protection of critical infrastructures³⁶ and more. These obligations can then only be (practically) guaranteed in the cyber domain if rights and obligations are imposed on private actors.³⁷\n---\n²⁸ N.

Kittichaisaree, ‘Future Prospects of Public International Law of Cyberspace’, 335-352.\n6\nSome call into question whether the role of the State within the cyber domain can and should be that far-reaching. In this respect, the main arguments in favor of a limited oversight function of the State are that the private sector does not have sufficient incentives to duly cooperate with the State since this could jeopardize its commercial objectives³⁸ (i.e. reputation damage, counter-attacks by competitors using released technology), that regulation will slow down innovation³⁹, that the private sector prefers a private legal system as opposed to public criminal law⁴⁰, etc. An alternative solution is that the governance of cyberspace shall be observed on the basis of (binding or non-binding) codes of conduct originating from the industry itself.⁴¹\n8. We agree that these two opposing sides should not be seen as an and/or question⁴²: whether and to which extent the State should have a regulatory role in cyberspace has to depend on the specific conduct one wishes to regulate. The “institutional choice may begin with determining whether the issue at stake is best taken on by the market, by private firms, by the State government, or by international law”.⁴³ When we will discuss the NIS Directive under section IV, it will become evident that the role of the State in protecting critical infrastructure (from cyber incidents) is still quite clear, uncontroversial and moreover necessary, as the State disposes of the necessary information, tools, legal framework and legitimate measures to do so. Interestingly, the NIS Directive imposes binding obligations onto certain entities in the private sector, acknowledging that cyberspace is a domain in which cooperation between the State and private actors is more than often necessary.\n4° Applying existing law versus creating new law\n9. Is it sufficient to apply existing international law to the cyber domain, or should the international community create new rules specifically designed to address this challenge? Three suggestions prevail⁴⁴:\n38 M. Teplinsky, ‘Fiddling on the Roof: Recent Developments in Cybersecurity’, American University Business Law Review 2013, 225-322, 310.\n39 J. Contreras et al., ‘Mapping Today’s Cybersecurity Landscape’, American University Law Review 2013, 1115, 1119.\n40 D. Wall, Cybercrime: The Transformation of Crime in the Information Age, Cambridge, Polity, 2007, 25-26.\n41 An example of such an influential code of conduct is the \"NIST\" (National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity) framework. This document harmonizes consensus standards and industry best practices to provide, its proponents argue, a flexible and cost-effective approach to enhancing cybersecurity that assists owners and operators of critical infrastructure in assessing and managing cyber risk, as the standard for due diligence. NIST collaborates with i.e. the United Kingdom, Japan, Korea, Estonia, Israel and Germany. A disadvantage of NIST would be that it is less well suited to protect enterprises from sophisticated and targeted cyberattacks, argue S. Shackelford, J. Russell and A. Kuehn in ‘Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors’, 42.\n42 J. Trachtman, ‘Cyberspace and Cybersecurity’, 90.\n43 This choice reflects the “true meaning of subsidiarity”, according to J. Trachtman, ‘Cyberspace and Cybersecurity’, 90.\n44 M. Hoisington, ‘Regulating Cyber Operations Through International Law: In, Out or Against the Box’, 87.\n\"(1) Cybersecurity should be addressed by using existing rules and existing structures under international law;\n(2) Cyberspace is a fundamentally unique concept that requires a whole new set of rules and legal structures;\n(3) Existing law can include the challenge of cybersecurity, but in order to be effective and efficient, those elements that are incompatible with the uniqueness of cyberspace need to be set aside\".\nWhat has been done so far on the international plane can largely be placed under option 1: the UN GGE has declared that international law, including the UN Charter, applies to cyberspace, whereas the Tallinn Manual 2.0 transposes basic concepts of international law to cyberspace in general (notably Rules 1-24), and further on in the book to cyberwarfare.\n## 5° 'Cyber Mania'\n10. Cyber mania is another phenomenon that complicates the relationship between international law and cybersecurity.⁴⁵ While the international developments in the field of cybersecurity sensu strictu have been limited, a considerable amount of academic attention and policy interest has been paid to the specific issue of 'cyberwarfare law'. According to O' CONNELL, it were the highly mediatized cyberattacks that took place in the 00's (Estonia 2007; Russo-Georgian conflict 2008; Stuxnet 2010)⁴⁶ that created this militarized image of cybersecurity law. However, the majority of cyber incidents do not reach the threshold of 'armed attack' in the sense of article 51 of the UN Charter.⁴⁷ In reality, cyber threats are more complex and diverse in nature, and they often target private companies.⁴⁸ Recent legislation, such as the European NIS Directive (which aims to protect providers of essential services and digital services such as online marketplaces) shows awareness of this more complex cyber reality, which we agree cannot be reduced to international war terms.⁴⁹\n## B. Interim conclusion\n11. Given these multiple challenges, of which this article highlighted just five, it is perhaps not surprising - or it is precisely so in view of the imminent need - that there exists no comprehensive international or European legislation in the field of cybersecurity sensu strictu.\n⁴⁵ W. von Heinegg, 'The Tallinn Manual and International Cyber Security Law', in T.

In the next section, the article will analyze the recent developments within the UN, with a specific focus to the work of the UN GGE. In the section thereafter, we will discuss the European NIS Directive.\n## III United Nations\nA. The UN Group of Governmental Experts: paving the way for international cybersecurity law?\n12. As discussed before, because of the nature of cyberspace, it was early on realized that cybersecurity demands for more than purely national regulation. Shortly after Edward Snowed changed the cybersecurity playing field, the UN GGE - established under the auspices of the First Committee of the UN General Assembly - published a report on 24 June 2013. The essence of the non-binding document is that it confirms that international law, and in particular the UN Charter, applies in cyberspace just like in the physical space.^[50]^ This includes the rules on state sovereignty and the principles resulting from the notion of sovereignty: for example, a State has jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure on its territory; and the State is responsible for international unlawful cyber acts that can be attributed to it.^[51]^\nIn its successive consensual report of 2015, the UN GGE put forward i.e. the following principles of the UN Charter and international law as applicable in cyberspace to state behavior: \"sovereignty, sovereign equality, peaceful conflict resolution, the prohibition of the use of or threat of violence against the territorial integrity or political independence of a State, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States\".^[52]^ This transposition to cyberspace of the basic principles of public international law, which almost all constitute binding customary law or have been confirmed by the International Court of Justice, is subject to a reasonable degree of agreement.^[53]^ As expressed before, the question is not really 'if' international law applies to cyberspace, but 'how', and importantly, whether it is translated efficiently and whether this suffices.^[54]^\n^[50] UN General Assembly, Report of Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the context of International Security, UN Doc.

Henriksen, 'The end of the road for the UN GGE process: The future regulation of cyberspace', 2.\n13. The 2013 and 2015 UN GGE reports are non-binding soft law.⁵⁵ In this logic, they reflect that international law applies in cyberspace and they serve as an important indicator.⁵⁶ After all, several States, including certain cyber superpowers, have confirmed this applicability in their comments to the UN GGE reports and in their national cyber security strategies. This applicability was equally confirmed by the G20 states in 2015.⁵⁷ At that point in time, the reports by the UN GGE could be seen as a sign of growing consensus on the matter, and in this sense as evidence of the development of *opinio juris*, which is one of the elements needed to eventually create binding customary international law (art. 38(1)(c) Statute of the International Court of Justice).⁵⁸ Especially in the domain of international cybersecurity law, the manifestation of *opinio juris* can be deemed as imperative if one wants to argue that there exists customary law⁵⁹, as practice on cybersecurity is for the larger part either classified or contradictory, and states have shown to be reluctant to openly declare if and how they regulate cyberspace.⁶⁰ One can find elements that inform *opinio juris* i.e. in reports prepared by international organizations, such as the UN GGE reports. Seeing how international cybersecurity law is still in a formative state, any expressed *opinio juris* displays aspirations rather than commitments⁶¹ – yet they are still of importance. Then, in June 2017, during the fifth meeting of the UN GGE, any meaningful manifestation of the development of *opinio juris* came to an abrupt end. Fundamental differences between the 25 members emerged, mainly on the issue of self-defence rights and on applying international humanitarian law to cyber conflicts. The Cuban delegation refused to recognize the explicit reference in the text to the applicability of self-defence rights in cyberspace. According to the delegation, this would “legitimize an ICT war”.⁶² The Americans interpreted this as undoing all earlier progress made within the UN GGE.⁶³ Geopolitics aside, note that the 2013 UN GGE report confirmed the applicability of the UN Charter to cyberspace, and with this *implicitly* article 51 UN Charter⁶⁴,\n⁵⁵ K.

The Cuban argument is thus not so much legal as it is political. At the end of the 2017 session, no consensus report was adopted. One cannot argue that the UN GGE 2013 and 2015 reports have become *opinio juris*, yet they still constitute an important indication of the applicability of international law to cyberspace, not only because the principal content of the reports has been reiterated by States on multiple occasions, but also precisely because the UN GGE reports restate the international *lex lata*.⁶⁶ The UN GGE is now, writing end of 2019, seemingly defunct⁶⁷: will there be a momentum to revive this exercise of diplomacy?\n## IV. EU Network and Information Security Directive 2016\n14. In parallel to, or following, the deadlock on cybersecurity law discussions on the international level, the European Union issued its first ever horizontal and legally binding instrument on cybersecurity *sensu strictu*, which aims to protect critical infrastructure (essential service providers and digital service providers) from cyber incidents that have a ‘significant disruptive effect’⁶⁸. The NIS Directive was issued in 2016 and had to be implemented in the different national legal orders. As HENRIKSEN professed, the deadlock within the UN GGE may lead to more regional initiatives with like-minded states, much like the European Directive we will now discuss.⁶⁹ The NIS Directive is an example of new rules being created after cybersecurity emerged as a policy problem, and not applying previously existing international law to a new context (e.g. UN GGE 2013 and 2015 reports and Tallinn Manual 2.0).\nOver the last few decades, critical infrastructure has become increasingly more reliant on the Internet, so that it is now essential “to our water, our power, our financial segment, our aviation industry and more”.⁷⁰ Note that the approach taken in the Directive is an “all hazards”\n⁶⁵ Article 51 Charter of the United Nations and Statute of the International Court of Justice, signed in San Francisco on 26 June 1945, entered into force on 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS XVI.\n⁶⁶ As does the Tallinn Manual 2.0.\n⁶⁷ S. Soesanto and F. D'Incau, ‘The UN GGE is dead: Time to fall forward’.\n⁶⁸ Art. 6 NIS Directive.\n⁶⁹ In the wake of the 2017 UN GGE ‘failure’, US Homeland Security advisor Tim Bossart expressed that “it was now time to consider other approaches…and that the U.S. will work with smaller groups of likeminded partners”. See T. Bossart, Remarks at Cyber Week 2017, Tel Aviv, 26 June 2017, online available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-homeland-security-advisor-thomas-p-bossert-cyber-week-2017/ (last accessed 8 November 2019). Think for example of the efforts by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on the Code of Conduct for Information Security or the previously mentioned African Union Convention. According to Henriksen, the regionalization of cybersecurity regulation into legal sub-systems of varying normative depth is unfortunate, given the global nature of the Internet. Yet Henriksen also admits that there are advantages to a more regional approach to cyber regulation, such as avoiding time-consuming negotiations, the perspective of reaching agreement on complex issues rather than just on the low-hanging fruits, etc. See A. Henriksen, ‘The end of the road for the UN GGE process: The future regulation of cyberspace’, 6.\n⁷⁰ Testimony of Admiral Michael Rogers, Hearing of the House Select Intelligence Committee, ‘Cybersecurity Threats: The Way Forward’, 20 November 2014 (Federal News Service Transcript). Other international organizations have equally raised awareness on the issue of cyber threats to critical infrastructure, see e.g. UN General Assembly, Report of Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the context of International Security, UN Doc. A/68/98, 24 June 2013, §9, 26(e), 30; C. Heinl, ‘Regional Cyber Security: Towards a Resilient ASEAN Cyber Security Regime’, RSIS Working Paper No. 263, 9\n11\nstrategy⁷¹: to protect critical infrastructure from a range of cyber ‘incidents’⁷². The question addressed is whether networks are protected against incidents from any source; the Directive does not demarcate on the basis of the category of the threat (contrary to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, and the Tallinn Manual 2.0 rules on cyberwarfare operations in armed conflict).\n## A. Objective and context\n15. The EU launched a strategy for a digital single market in 2015; the NIS Directive, the General Data Protection Regulation (the famous 'GDPR')⁷³ and the eIDAS Regulation⁷⁴ all fall under this strategy.\nThe primary objective of the NIS Directive is mentioned in the preparatory works: “to guarantee a high common level of network and IT security”.⁷⁵ One of the main reasons for the creation of the NIS directive was that some EU member states did not have cybersecurity legislation in place, and even when they did, there were large divergences among nations. This goal is important seeing how \"cyber incidents are increasing in size, frequency and complexity and can result in business inability to do their jobs, significant financial losses to the EU economy and a loss of welfare for society\".⁷⁶ The fact that the Directive imposes obligations on providers of digital services indicates that the European legislator is aware that cyber incidents today are\nSeptember 2013, online available at https://www.rsis.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/rsis-pubs/WP263.pdf (last accessed 7 November 2019); Organization of American States, Critical Infrastructure Protection Programs: Cyber Security, online available at http://www.oas.org/en/sms/ ciche/programs_cyber.asp (last accessed 7 November 2019); Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Critical Information Infrastructures Protection, online available at http://www. oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/ciip.htm (last accessed 7 November 2019); M.

Note how the Shanghai Cooperation Organization went a step further than cooperation and awareness raising, and agreed in a treaty to cooperate on information security within critical infrastructures. The previously mentioned AU Convention obliges parties to undertake action to protect critical infrastructure. See Art. 3, Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of International Information Security, 16 June 2009, online available at https://ccdcoe-admin.aku.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SCO-090616-IISAgreement.pdf (unofficial English translation, last accessed 7 November 2019); Article 25(4) AU Convention on Cyber Security.\n⁷¹ Termed by D.

The NIS Directive is legally binding. It is not particularly difficult to explain why consensus on legally binding measures could be found within the EU on this topic, and why it has proved more difficult within the UN. Apart from the like-minded group argument (supra), the NIS Directive primarily creates measures to protect critical infrastructure; for the latter, the role of the formal legislator is still quite clearly defined.⁷⁸ Moreover, since there exists a manageable working definition of \"critical infrastructures\"⁷⁹ and since this concern has long been voiced within cybersecurity discussions⁸⁰, the NIS Directive ignores some of the obstacles mentioned in numbers 5-10. In addition to this, as a country's critical infrastructure is most often located within its territory (e.g. drink water systems, hospitals, railways)⁸¹, and thus within its jurisdiction, governments can in principle (to a certain extent) protect it without necessarily relying upon public international law.⁸²\n17. Analyzing the NIS Directive is interesting, as the European legislator acknowledges the importance of imposing obligations upon the private sector. There are two entities onto which the Directives imposes obligations: the Member State government (1) and the private sector (2) (notably the providers of essential services mentioned in Annex II of the Directive and the providers of digital services mentioned in Annex II of the Directive).\n⁷⁷ See supra, no 10.\n⁷⁸ Supra, no 8.\n⁷⁹ See art. 2(a) EU Directive 2008/114/EC of the Council of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection, adopted on 8 December 2008, entered into force January 2009, Pb.

Fidler, 'Wither the Web: International Law, Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection', 9-10.\n13\nB. Measures at Member State level and cooperation with EU\n18. The NIS Directive imposes upon Member States obligations that can be summarized under the following three categories⁸³:\n1) Each Member State must ensure a minimum national capacity by designating NIS competent authorities (Art. 8 NIS Directive), by setting up computer crisis teams ('Computer Emergency Response Teams' - CERTs or 'Computer Security Incident Response Teams' - CSIRTs (Art. 9) and national NIS strategies and cooperation plans (Art. 7));\n2) National competent authorities should work together within a network that allows secure and effective coordination, including coordinated information exchange, and detection and response at EU level. Member States must exchange information and collaborate through this network to tackle NIS threats and incidents on the basis of the European NIS cooperation plan (Art. 11);\n3) One of the most important obligations for the Member State is to identify the providers of essential services (Art. 5). A culture of risk management shall be introduced and the private and public sectors shall exchange information with each other.\nC. Specific obligations for stakeholders in the private sector\n19. The Directive focuses on two types of entities in the private sector (Articles 1, 4, 5, 14, 16):\n- the providers of essential services⁸⁴;\n- digital service providers.\n20. In its Annex II, the NIS Directive specifies in a non-exhaustive way the sectors in which the Member States must search for the providers of essential services. These include the following sectors: banks, stock exchanges, transport and distribution of energy, air, rail and maritime transport, health, internet services and the government. Nuclear installations fall outside the scope of the Directive.⁸⁵\n21. \"Digital service providers\", the second private sector entity onto which the Directive imposes obligations, should be understood as online marketplaces, online search engines and cloud computer services. These are exhaustively listed in Annex II of the Directive. Note that\n⁸³ R. Roex, 'EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed', Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016.\n⁸⁴ According to Article 5 (2) NIS Directive, providers of essential services are entities that 'provide services that are essential for the maintenance of critical social and / or economic activities, the provision of that service depending on network and information systems and in which in the event of an incident this would have significant disruptive effects on the provision of that service'.\n⁸⁵ L. Lemmens, 'België werkt aan omzetting NIS-richtlijn voor uniforme beveiliging netwerk- en informatiesystemen', Commentary – Wolters Kluwer Online 22 November 2018.\n14\nduring the legislative process, it was decided that many of the other suggested digital services were not critical enough.⁸⁶\n22. The most important obligations for providers of essential services and providers of digital services can be summarized as follows⁸⁷:\n- take appropriate technical and organizational measures to manage NIS risks;\n- prepare and implement business continuity plans;\n- notify the competent authority or CSIRT of an incident that has a significant impact.\nWhat exactly constitutes a cyber incident with a ‘significant disruptive impact’ is thus quintessential to the implementation of the Directive, yet the meaning of the broad term is unclear at this stage⁸⁸, and it remains to be seen how this will be applied in practice.\nD. Territorial scope\n23. Articles 5 and 18 of the NIS Directive clarify its territorial scope. For providers of essential services, each Member State where the provider has an establishment through which he offers essential services in that Member State will have jurisdiction. For digital service providers, this will be the Member State where the service provider has its headquarters and jurisdiction and its supervisory authority (one stop shop principle). If there are no headquarters in the EU, the provider or service provider must appoint a representative.⁸⁹\nV. Conclusion\n24. This article identified five factors underlying the difficult relationship between cybersecurity and international law. These are the speed at which global digitization is taking place as well as the nature of cyber operations (1), the fragmented jurisdiction and attribution problem (2), the question whether and to which extent the State and/or the private sector should have a regulatory role in cyberspace (3), whether transposing existing law onto the new technological context suffices, and (5) the phenomenon of 'cyber mania'.\n⁸⁶ R. Roex, ‘EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed’, Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016. Under the NIS Directive, Member States are not required to identify digital service providers, allowing for a ‘catch-all approach’. See D. Markopoulou, V. Papakonstantinou and P. de Hert, ‘The new EU cybersecurity framework: The NIS Directive, ENISA’s role and the General Data Protection Regulation’, Computer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 2019, 4.\n⁸⁷ Art. 14 and 16 NIS Directive. Affected Member States are informed when an incident has cross-border consequences. See also D. Markopoulou, V. Papakonstantinou and P. de Hert, ‘The new EU cybersecurity framework: The NIS Directive, ENISA’s role and the General Data Protection Regulation’, 5-6. R. Roex, ‘EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed’, Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016.\n⁸⁸ Some guiding elements to determine what a ‘significant disruptive effect’ is, are mentioned in articles 6, 14 and 16 of the NIS Directive, as well as in its Preamble (27), (28), (38).\n⁸⁹ Art. 5 and 18 NIS Directive; L. Lemmens, ‘België werkt aan omzetting NIS-richtlijn voor uniforme beveiliging netwerk- en informatiesystemen’, Commentary – Wolters Kluwer Online 22 November 2018; R. Roex, ‘EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed’, Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016.\n15\n25. These factors contribute to the difficulties facing the UN GGE. We have made clear that the diplomatic deadlock in which the UN GGE process finds itself goes back to a geopolitical argument rather than a legal one: it was the explicit reference in the 2017 text to the applicability of self-defence rights and humanitarian law in cyberspace that led to the end of the negotiations, even though the previous reports had implicitly done precisely that, by stating that the UN Charter and thus article 51, applies in cyberspace. This article has shown that the 2013 and 2015 UN GGE reports do not constitute opinio juris, yet they are an important indication of the applicability of international law to cyberspace, not only because States, including some cyber superpowers, reiterated this on multiple occasions, but also because the UN GGE reports restate the international lex lata. The UN GGE, as the Tallinn Manual 2.0, is thus a prime example of applying pre-existing law to a new technological context.\nEnter the EU NIS Directive in 2016. As HENRIKSEN points out, the inertia on the international level may lead to more regional initiatives with like-minded States. The NIS Directive is the first horizontal and legally binding EU instrument on cybersecurity. The fact that consensus on legally binding measures could be found is partially because the Directive focuses on the protection of critical infrastructure, a domain in which the role of the State as legislator is still quite clearly defined and necessary, of which there exists a working definition, which is a concern that has long been voiced, and seeing how critical infrastructure such as hospitals, drink water systems and railways (Annex II NIS Directive) are usually located within the territory and thus jurisdiction of a State. Interestingly, the NIS Directive shows awareness of a changing, more complex and diverse cybersecurity landscape, by imposing obligations upon two entities in the private sector. Moreover, this testifies that the European legislator acknowledges that cybersecurity cannot be adequately guaranteed without involving the private sector. However, the fact that consensus on legally binding measures on the topic could be found, does not mean that the EU NIS Directive is a success: it remains to be seen how the nation States will interpret a 'cyber incident with a significant disruptive impact', without which the obligations of the Directive are meaningless. In that sense, one currently cannot overstate the success of the NIS Directive and inversely overstate the failure of the UN GGE: the latter made clear that international law does apply to state behavior in cyberspace, which indeed offers the necessary starting point.⁹⁰ Europe has less cyber superpowers around the table than does the UN GGE, and it may be likely that State actors in the latter forum are guilty of \"fence sitting\": on the international level, cyber superpowers and other nations may want to wait and see \"where the technology is going\", or because it is in the interest of their flexibility to \"maintain the current legal uncertainties\".⁹¹\n⁹⁰ A. Henriksen, ‘The end of the road for the UN GGE process: The future regulation of cyberspace’, 8.\n⁹¹ A. Henriksen, ‘The end of the road for the UN GGE process: The future regulation of cyberspace’, 5.\n16\nWe know that international law applies in cyberspace ('if') – although it would be difficult to argue that the support for this principle has become opinio juris – and while the NIS Directive wanted to answer 'how' law applies in cyberspace, the question remains, depending on the factual interpretation of a 'significant disruptive impact'.\n17",
  "flat_text": "Cybersecurity and international law: a closer look at recent UN and EU initiatives\nAnne Verhelst\nKey words\nCybersecurity, public international law, UN GGE, European Network and Information Security Directive, critical infrastructure, private sector, digital services\nAbstract\nEver since cybersecurity emerged as a policy concern, real life examples have shown how cyberattacks have effectively entered the realm of foreign policy. To date, however, cybersecurity has generated very little international law. How can this be explained? The article examines the factors underlying the difficult marriage between public international law and the high-tech phenomenon of cyberspace. What can or should the role of the State and/or the private sector in regulating cyberspace be? Should the international level create new laws to regulate cybersecurity or should the existing international legal principles simply be transposed to the new technological context? Today, it has become clear that the vast majority of cyber incidents do not reach the threshold of 'armed attack' in the sense of article 51 of the UN Charter. In reaction, we see that certain international organizations and nation States launched efforts to better protect cybersecurity sensu strictu. In this article, we focus on recent efforts within the UN and the EU. Notably, the article will answer whether the efforts to apply existing international law to cyberspace, undertaken by the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the Context of International Security, suffice. Why did the fifth round of negotiations among the Expert Group fail in 2017, and will there be another momentum to revive this diplomatic exercise? Zooming in on the protection of critical infrastructure specifically, how does the first horizontal and legally binding EU Directive on Network and Information Security (2016) fit in the worldwide effort to better regulate cybersecurity? This is interesting, as the Directive shows awareness of the diverse and complex nature of cybersecurity by imposing binding obligations upon the providers of essential services and digital providers.\nI Introduction\n1. Over the first two decades of this millennium, the risks flowing from each of the many clicks we perform every day became increasingly clear. Cybersecurity has entered the realm of foreign policy: think of the Stuxnet cyberattack by the U.S. and Israel that targeted Iranian\n Anne Verhelst is PhD Researcher in International Law at the Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies and the Institute for International Law, KU Leuven, Belgium. Anne holds a four-year fellowship of the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO).\nnuclear facilities in 2010; think of the cyberattacks that paralyzed Estonian government services in 2007, and think of how the Wall Street Journal just this August reported that Iranian hackers are suspected to have pervaded critical infrastructure and government computers in Bahrein. These cyber threats emanating from State (and other) sources have over recent years brought about efforts to render critical infrastructure more resilient. A few initiatives of which we will highlight in this article. Yet, cybersecurity as a policy concern has generated very little international law up to now.\nA straightforward reason that partially explains this inertia, is that the scope, nature, meaning and terminology of cybersecurity is unclear. There is little general agreement about what cybersecurity entails, and it seems that individual people use the term differently, depending on the context. This article will depart from a concept of cybersecurity sensu strictu. In that view, cybersecurity shall mean \"the security of network and information systems; the ability of network and information systems to withstand, with a certain degree of confidence, actions that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored, transmitted or processed data or the related services provided or accessible through those network and information systems\". This article thus applies a concept of cybersecurity excluding a focus\n\nAs the NIS Directive aims to protect critical infrastructure against cyber incidents, this article will pay specific attention to threats directed at critical infrastructure, rather than focusing on cyberattacks against the data of private people, against companies (when it has no larger societal effect), etc. Moreover, in this article we exclusively discuss the international regulatory level as viewed by a nation’s perspective, to which cybersecurity can be summarized and clarified to mean the “ability to protect itself and its institutions against cyber threats”.\n2. The purpose of this article is to bring together, analyze and clarify where necessary the most important recent developments in cybersecurity law and initiatives within the United Nations (hereinafter: ‘UN’) and European Union (hereinafter: ‘EU’). The questions addressed in this article are the following. First, on a more abstract level, we will discuss whether international law can adequately regulate issues of cybersecurity. Are there any impediments that law places on the cyber domain (if so, which ones)? And vice versa, can the high-tech phenomenon of cybersecurity be embedded in international law? (Title II) The article then analyzes the most important legal, regulatory, and soft law developments in the field of cybersecurity within the UN, with specific attention paid to the work by the Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the Context\n Cybercrime can be defined as ‘a criminal activity in which computers or computer networks are the principal means of committing an offense’. Examples include cyber-theft, cyber-trespass, cyber-obscenity, and cyber-extortions. In section IV of this article, we will analyze the European Network and Information Security Directive (2016), which aims to protect critical infrastructure from cyber incidents. Note that some authors and instruments categorize cyberattacks against critical infrastructure under ‘cybercrime’. See N. Kshetri, ‘Global Cybersecurity: Key Issues and Concepts’, 3 and N. Kshetri, ‘Positive externality, increasing returns and the rise in cybercrimes’, Communications of the ACM 2009, 141–144. In this article, we will discuss the European Directive as aiming to protect critical infrastructure, regardless of whether a cyberattack against such infrastructure should be seen as falling under a strict definition of ‘cybercrime’. Specific regional instruments dedicated to cybercrime as such are the Council of Europe’s Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and the African Union’s Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection. See Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime of 23 November 2001, entered into force on 01 July 2004, ETS no 185; African Union, Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection 27 June 2014, entered into force 3 June 2019, online available at https://au.int/sites/default/files/treaties/29560-treaty-0048_-_african_union_convention_on_cyber_security_and_personal_data_protection_e.pdf (last accessed 11 November 2019).\n E.g. D. Fidler, ‘Wither the Web: International Law, Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’, Georgetown Journal of International Affairs 2015, 10-11.\n E.g. Rules 20-95 Tallinn Manual 2.0 in M. Schmitt et al., Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2017.\n We will see in this article that multiple initiatives that try to regulate cybersecurity only address a small portion of the broader legal framework, such as the protection of critical infrastructure (e.g. EU NIS Directive), data protection online (e.g. the famous European GDPR Directive), cyber warfare (e.g. the Tallinn Manual 2.0), and thus the definition or concept of cybersecurity used (if explicitly done so) often varies according to the specific legal domain one tries to capture. See J. Kosseff, ‘Defining Cybersecurity Law’, 985.\n In this article, \"critical infrastructure\" is understood as referred to in the NIS Directive. See infra, footnote 75.\n N. Kshetri, ‘Global Cybersecurity: Key Issues and Concepts’, 3 and N. Choucri, Cyberpolitics in international relations: Context, connectivity, and content, Cambridge, MIT Press, 2012, 39.\nof International Security (hereinafter: ‘UN GGE’) (Title III) and within the EU (Title IV), with specific attention paid to the 2016 NIS Directive. The conclusion of the article stipulates some forward-looking comments (Title V).\n## II Cybersecurity and international law: irreconcilable?\n3. First and foremost, it should be clear that there is a broad understanding that international law applies in cyberspace to state behavior. This is to say, the rules developed before cybersecurity became a prominent (policy) problem. The same international legal norms that govern the physical space are applicable in cyberspace: the core question is thus not “if” international law applies to cyberspace, but rather “how” it does. How to efficiently translate the pre-cyber existing international law to cyberspace is difficult, which can be explained by certain factors scrutinized right below.\n### A. Factors explaining the uneasy marriage between international law and cybersecurity\n4. Law as a system is no stranger to try and regulate rapid technological evolutions, be it developments in outer space, on the high seas, in the data collection domain, artificial intelligence, etc. This is equally so for cyberspace. The uneasy marriage between international law and cybersecurity can be explained by the intrinsic properties of both phenomena.\n In its 2013 Consensual Report (UN Doc. A/68/98, §19) and 2015 Consensual Report (UN Doc. A/70/174, §24), the UN GGE confirmed the applicability of international law, including the UN Charter, in cyberspace. Several States have already confirmed this position in their comments to these reports and in their national cyber defence and security strategies. The G20 states also confirmed this in 2015 (G20 Summit Communiqué, Antalya, 15-16 November 2015). See UN General Assembly, Report of the Secretary-General on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (Addendum), UN Doc. A/68/156/Add.1, 9 September 2013; UN General Assembly, Report of the Secretary-General on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc.

The digitization of the world is taking place at an unparalleled pace. It is expected that by 2020 there will be more than 20 billion connected devices. In contrast to how the international regulator in the last century was able to respond in a timely manner to certain evolutions, such as the international law of the sea concept 'exclusive economic zone' (EEZ) and the protection of the seabed as 'common heritage of mankind', the cyber revolution is often said to be so fast and unpredictable that international law-making has difficulties catching up.\n2° Territoriality, sovereignty, fragmentation of jurisdiction and attribution\n6. It has become evident that the current global challenges cannot be adequately addressed by one single actor. Whether one thinks of climate change, international terrorism or cyber threats, international law offers a framework for international co-operation. Now let it be the case that the core concept on which international law is based, that of state sovereignty, does not effortlessly fit in cyberspace. Although there is agreement that the principle of state sovereignty (UN Charter) applies in cyberspace, there is no one State that can claim sovereignty over the entire cyberspace. The reason being that the many cyber infrastructures that make up cyberspace are located in different sovereign territories, and in international law, territoriality allocates jurisdiction. Nonetheless, this off and on fragmentation of jurisdiction should not be a reason to give up on regulating cybersecurity all together, we agree with TRACHTMAN, since after all, (cyber)conduct still occurs in a certain territory and effects are still felt in a certain territory. Issues that transcend territorial jurisdiction are not new whatsoever to international law (e.g. the law of the high seas, outer space, climate change). The challenge here is linked to the attribution problem, understood as the difficulty to determine\n K.

A third factor that underlies the difficult relationship between cybersecurity and international law is the question of the (extent of the) regulatory role of the State versus that of the private sector in cyberspace. The alternatively controlled nature of cyberspace is the reason this debate exists: cyberspace is a domain in which industry and the private sector play a/the pivotal role. The private sector governs cyberspace in an informal fashion, leaving less room for the formal legislator (the nation State). This informal governance is reminiscent of the *lex mercatoria*, the private economic law of the Middle Ages, according to HOISINGTON. The question is then to what extent the State must or can impose legal obligations on the private sector in regulating cybersecurity. Vice versa, to what extent can cybersecurity regulation be effective if the private sector is not involved in its preparation and implementation?\nThe discussion about the role of the State as legislator in cyberspace is prevalent: on the one hand one can argue that the nation State has the (moral) obligation to enact legislation that regulates or restricts the private sector in its cyber activities. The argument here is that the State has to uphold binding obligations under international law, such as the protection of human rights, international peace and security, the customary 'no harm' principle, the protection of critical infrastructures and more. These obligations can then only be (practically) guaranteed in the cyber domain if rights and obligations are imposed on private actors.\n---\n N.

We agree that these two opposing sides should not be seen as an and/or question: whether and to which extent the State should have a regulatory role in cyberspace has to depend on the specific conduct one wishes to regulate. The “institutional choice may begin with determining whether the issue at stake is best taken on by the market, by private firms, by the State government, or by international law”. When we will discuss the NIS Directive under section IV, it will become evident that the role of the State in protecting critical infrastructure (from cyber incidents) is still quite clear, uncontroversial and moreover necessary, as the State disposes of the necessary information, tools, legal framework and legitimate measures to do so. Interestingly, the NIS Directive imposes binding obligations onto certain entities in the private sector, acknowledging that cyberspace is a domain in which cooperation between the State and private actors is more than often necessary.\n4° Applying existing law versus creating new law\n9. Is it sufficient to apply existing international law to the cyber domain, or should the international community create new rules specifically designed to address this challenge? Three suggestions prevail:\n\n\"(1) Cybersecurity should be addressed by using existing rules and existing structures under international law;\n(2) Cyberspace is a fundamentally unique concept that requires a whole new set of rules and legal structures;\n(3) Existing law can include the challenge of cybersecurity, but in order to be effective and efficient, those elements that are incompatible with the uniqueness of cyberspace need to be set aside\".\nWhat has been done so far on the international plane can largely be placed under option 1: the UN GGE has declared that international law, including the UN Charter, applies to cyberspace, whereas the Tallinn Manual 2.0 transposes basic concepts of international law to cyberspace in general (notably Rules 1-24), and further on in the book to cyberwarfare.\n## 5° 'Cyber Mania'\n10. Cyber mania is another phenomenon that complicates the relationship between international law and cybersecurity. While the international developments in the field of cybersecurity sensu strictu have been limited, a considerable amount of academic attention and policy interest has been paid to the specific issue of 'cyberwarfare law'. According to O' CONNELL, it were the highly mediatized cyberattacks that took place in the 00's (Estonia 2007; Russo-Georgian conflict 2008; Stuxnet 2010) that created this militarized image of cybersecurity law. However, the majority of cyber incidents do not reach the threshold of 'armed attack' in the sense of article 51 of the UN Charter. In reality, cyber threats are more complex and diverse in nature, and they often target private companies. Recent legislation, such as the European NIS Directive (which aims to protect providers of essential services and digital services such as online marketplaces) shows awareness of this more complex cyber reality, which we agree cannot be reduced to international war terms.\n## B. Interim conclusion\n11. Given these multiple challenges, of which this article highlighted just five, it is perhaps not surprising - or it is precisely so in view of the imminent need - that there exists no comprehensive international or European legislation in the field of cybersecurity sensu strictu.\n W. von Heinegg, 'The Tallinn Manual and International Cyber Security Law', in T.

In the next section, the article will analyze the recent developments within the UN, with a specific focus to the work of the UN GGE. In the section thereafter, we will discuss the European NIS Directive.\n## III United Nations\nA. The UN Group of Governmental Experts: paving the way for international cybersecurity law?\n12. As discussed before, because of the nature of cyberspace, it was early on realized that cybersecurity demands for more than purely national regulation. Shortly after Edward Snowed changed the cybersecurity playing field, the UN GGE - established under the auspices of the First Committee of the UN General Assembly - published a report on 24 June 2013. The essence of the non-binding document is that it confirms that international law, and in particular the UN Charter, applies in cyberspace just like in the physical space.^[50]^ This includes the rules on state sovereignty and the principles resulting from the notion of sovereignty: for example, a State has jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure on its territory; and the State is responsible for international unlawful cyber acts that can be attributed to it.^[51]^\nIn its successive consensual report of 2015, the UN GGE put forward i.e. the following principles of the UN Charter and international law as applicable in cyberspace to state behavior: \"sovereignty, sovereign equality, peaceful conflict resolution, the prohibition of the use of or threat of violence against the territorial integrity or political independence of a State, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States\".^[52]^ This transposition to cyberspace of the basic principles of public international law, which almost all constitute binding customary law or have been confirmed by the International Court of Justice, is subject to a reasonable degree of agreement.^[53]^ As expressed before, the question is not really 'if' international law applies to cyberspace, but 'how', and importantly, whether it is translated efficiently and whether this suffices.^[54]^\n^[50] UN General Assembly, Report of Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the context of International Security, UN Doc.

Henriksen, 'The end of the road for the UN GGE process: The future regulation of cyberspace', 2.\n13. The 2013 and 2015 UN GGE reports are non-binding soft law. In this logic, they reflect that international law applies in cyberspace and they serve as an important indicator. After all, several States, including certain cyber superpowers, have confirmed this applicability in their comments to the UN GGE reports and in their national cyber security strategies. This applicability was equally confirmed by the G20 states in 2015. At that point in time, the reports by the UN GGE could be seen as a sign of growing consensus on the matter, and in this sense as evidence of the development of *opinio juris*, which is one of the elements needed to eventually create binding customary international law (art. 38(1)(c) Statute of the International Court of Justice). Especially in the domain of international cybersecurity law, the manifestation of *opinio juris* can be deemed as imperative if one wants to argue that there exists customary law, as practice on cybersecurity is for the larger part either classified or contradictory, and states have shown to be reluctant to openly declare if and how they regulate cyberspace. One can find elements that inform *opinio juris* i.e. in reports prepared by international organizations, such as the UN GGE reports. Seeing how international cybersecurity law is still in a formative state, any expressed *opinio juris* displays aspirations rather than commitments – yet they are still of importance. Then, in June 2017, during the fifth meeting of the UN GGE, any meaningful manifestation of the development of *opinio juris* came to an abrupt end. Fundamental differences between the 25 members emerged, mainly on the issue of self-defence rights and on applying international humanitarian law to cyber conflicts. The Cuban delegation refused to recognize the explicit reference in the text to the applicability of self-defence rights in cyberspace. According to the delegation, this would “legitimize an ICT war”. The Americans interpreted this as undoing all earlier progress made within the UN GGE. Geopolitics aside, note that the 2013 UN GGE report confirmed the applicability of the UN Charter to cyberspace, and with this *implicitly* article 51 UN Charter,\n K. Abbott and D.

In parallel to, or following, the deadlock on cybersecurity law discussions on the international level, the European Union issued its first ever horizontal and legally binding instrument on cybersecurity *sensu strictu*, which aims to protect critical infrastructure (essential service providers and digital service providers) from cyber incidents that have a ‘significant disruptive effect’. The NIS Directive was issued in 2016 and had to be implemented in the different national legal orders. As HENRIKSEN professed, the deadlock within the UN GGE may lead to more regional initiatives with like-minded states, much like the European Directive we will now discuss. The NIS Directive is an example of new rules being created after cybersecurity emerged as a policy problem, and not applying previously existing international law to a new context (e.g. UN GGE 2013 and 2015 reports and Tallinn Manual 2.0).\nOver the last few decades, critical infrastructure has become increasingly more reliant on the Internet, so that it is now essential “to our water, our power, our financial segment, our aviation industry and more”. Note that the approach taken in the Directive is an “all hazards”\n Article 51 Charter of the United Nations and Statute of the International Court of Justice, signed in San Francisco on 26 June 1945, entered into force on 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS XVI.\n As does the Tallinn Manual 2.0.\n S. Soesanto and F. D'Incau, ‘The UN GGE is dead: Time to fall forward’.\n Art. 6 NIS Directive.\n In the wake of the 2017 UN GGE ‘failure’, US Homeland Security advisor Tim Bossart expressed that “it was now time to consider other approaches…and that the U.S. will work with smaller groups of likeminded partners”. See T. Bossart, Remarks at Cyber Week 2017, Tel Aviv, 26 June 2017, online available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-homeland-security-advisor-thomas-p-bossert-cyber-week-2017/ (last accessed 8 November 2019). Think for example of the efforts by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on the Code of Conduct for Information Security or the previously mentioned African Union Convention. According to Henriksen, the regionalization of cybersecurity regulation into legal sub-systems of varying normative depth is unfortunate, given the global nature of the Internet. Yet Henriksen also admits that there are advantages to a more regional approach to cyber regulation, such as avoiding time-consuming negotiations, the perspective of reaching agreement on complex issues rather than just on the low-hanging fruits, etc. See A. Henriksen, ‘The end of the road for the UN GGE process: The future regulation of cyberspace’, 6.\n Testimony of Admiral Michael Rogers, Hearing of the House Select Intelligence Committee, ‘Cybersecurity Threats: The Way Forward’, 20 November 2014 (Federal News Service Transcript). Other international organizations have equally raised awareness on the issue of cyber threats to critical infrastructure, see e.g. UN General Assembly, Report of Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the context of International Security, UN Doc. A/68/98, 24 June 2013, §9, 26(e), 30; C. Heinl, ‘Regional Cyber Security: Towards a Resilient ASEAN Cyber Security Regime’, RSIS Working Paper No. 263, 9\n\n## A. Objective and context\n15. The EU launched a strategy for a digital single market in 2015; the NIS Directive, the General Data Protection Regulation (the famous 'GDPR') and the eIDAS Regulation all fall under this strategy.\nThe primary objective of the NIS Directive is mentioned in the preparatory works: “to guarantee a high common level of network and IT security”. One of the main reasons for the creation of the NIS directive was that some EU member states did not have cybersecurity legislation in place, and even when they did, there were large divergences among nations. This goal is important seeing how \"cyber incidents are increasing in size, frequency and complexity and can result in business inability to do their jobs, significant financial losses to the EU economy and a loss of welfare for society\". The fact that the Directive imposes obligations on providers of digital services indicates that the European legislator is aware that cyber incidents today are\nSeptember 2013, online available at https://www.rsis.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/rsis-pubs/WP263.pdf (last accessed 7 November 2019); Organization of American States, Critical Infrastructure Protection Programs: Cyber Security, online available at http://www.oas.org/en/sms/ ciche/programs_cyber.asp (last accessed 7 November 2019); Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Critical Information Infrastructures Protection, online available at http://www. oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/ciip.htm (last accessed 7 November 2019); M.

Note how the Shanghai Cooperation Organization went a step further than cooperation and awareness raising, and agreed in a treaty to cooperate on information security within critical infrastructures. The previously mentioned AU Convention obliges parties to undertake action to protect critical infrastructure. See Art. 3, Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of International Information Security, 16 June 2009, online available at https://ccdcoe-admin.aku.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SCO-090616-IISAgreement.pdf (unofficial English translation, last accessed 7 November 2019); Article 25(4) AU Convention on Cyber Security.\n Termed by D.

The NIS Directive is legally binding. It is not particularly difficult to explain why consensus on legally binding measures could be found within the EU on this topic, and why it has proved more difficult within the UN. Apart from the like-minded group argument (supra), the NIS Directive primarily creates measures to protect critical infrastructure; for the latter, the role of the formal legislator is still quite clearly defined. Moreover, since there exists a manageable working definition of \"critical infrastructures\" and since this concern has long been voiced within cybersecurity discussions, the NIS Directive ignores some of the obstacles mentioned in numbers 5-10. In addition to this, as a country's critical infrastructure is most often located within its territory (e.g. drink water systems, hospitals, railways), and thus within its jurisdiction, governments can in principle (to a certain extent) protect it without necessarily relying upon public international law.\n17. Analyzing the NIS Directive is interesting, as the European legislator acknowledges the importance of imposing obligations upon the private sector. There are two entities onto which the Directives imposes obligations: the Member State government (1) and the private sector (2) (notably the providers of essential services mentioned in Annex II of the Directive and the providers of digital services mentioned in Annex II of the Directive).\n See supra, no 10.\n Supra, no 8.\n See art. 2(a) EU Directive 2008/114/EC of the Council of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection, adopted on 8 December 2008, entered into force January 2009, Pb.

Fidler, 'Wither the Web: International Law, Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection', 9-10.\n\n18. The NIS Directive imposes upon Member States obligations that can be summarized under the following three categories:\n1) Each Member State must ensure a minimum national capacity by designating NIS competent authorities (Art. 8 NIS Directive), by setting up computer crisis teams ('Computer Emergency Response Teams' - CERTs or 'Computer Security Incident Response Teams' - CSIRTs (Art. 9) and national NIS strategies and cooperation plans (Art. 7));\n2) National competent authorities should work together within a network that allows secure and effective coordination, including coordinated information exchange, and detection and response at EU level. Member States must exchange information and collaborate through this network to tackle NIS threats and incidents on the basis of the European NIS cooperation plan (Art. 11);\n3) One of the most important obligations for the Member State is to identify the providers of essential services (Art. 5). A culture of risk management shall be introduced and the private and public sectors shall exchange information with each other.\nC. Specific obligations for stakeholders in the private sector\n19. The Directive focuses on two types of entities in the private sector (Articles 1, 4, 5, 14, 16):\n- the providers of essential services;\n- digital service providers.\n20. In its Annex II, the NIS Directive specifies in a non-exhaustive way the sectors in which the Member States must search for the providers of essential services. These include the following sectors: banks, stock exchanges, transport and distribution of energy, air, rail and maritime transport, health, internet services and the government. Nuclear installations fall outside the scope of the Directive.\n21. \"Digital service providers\", the second private sector entity onto which the Directive imposes obligations, should be understood as online marketplaces, online search engines and cloud computer services. These are exhaustively listed in Annex II of the Directive. Note that\n R. Roex, 'EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed', Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016.\n According to Article 5 (2) NIS Directive, providers of essential services are entities that 'provide services that are essential for the maintenance of critical social and / or economic activities, the provision of that service depending on network and information systems and in which in the event of an incident this would have significant disruptive effects on the provision of that service'.\n L. Lemmens, 'België werkt aan omzetting NIS-richtlijn voor uniforme beveiliging netwerk- en informatiesystemen', Commentary – Wolters Kluwer Online 22 November 2018.\n\n22. The most important obligations for providers of essential services and providers of digital services can be summarized as follows:\n- take appropriate technical and organizational measures to manage NIS risks;\n- prepare and implement business continuity plans;\n- notify the competent authority or CSIRT of an incident that has a significant impact.\nWhat exactly constitutes a cyber incident with a ‘significant disruptive impact’ is thus quintessential to the implementation of the Directive, yet the meaning of the broad term is unclear at this stage, and it remains to be seen how this will be applied in practice.\nD. Territorial scope\n23. Articles 5 and 18 of the NIS Directive clarify its territorial scope. For providers of essential services, each Member State where the provider has an establishment through which he offers essential services in that Member State will have jurisdiction. For digital service providers, this will be the Member State where the service provider has its headquarters and jurisdiction and its supervisory authority (one stop shop principle). If there are no headquarters in the EU, the provider or service provider must appoint a representative.\nV. Conclusion\n24. This article identified five factors underlying the difficult relationship between cybersecurity and international law. These are the speed at which global digitization is taking place as well as the nature of cyber operations (1), the fragmented jurisdiction and attribution problem (2), the question whether and to which extent the State and/or the private sector should have a regulatory role in cyberspace (3), whether transposing existing law onto the new technological context suffices, and (5) the phenomenon of 'cyber mania'.\n R. Roex, ‘EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed’, Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016. Under the NIS Directive, Member States are not required to identify digital service providers, allowing for a ‘catch-all approach’. See D. Markopoulou, V. Papakonstantinou and P. de Hert, ‘The new EU cybersecurity framework: The NIS Directive, ENISA’s role and the General Data Protection Regulation’, Computer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 2019, 4.\n Art. 14 and 16 NIS Directive. Affected Member States are informed when an incident has cross-border consequences. See also D. Markopoulou, V. Papakonstantinou and P. de Hert, ‘The new EU cybersecurity framework: The NIS Directive, ENISA’s role and the General Data Protection Regulation’, 5-6. R. Roex, ‘EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed’, Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016.\n Some guiding elements to determine what a ‘significant disruptive effect’ is, are mentioned in articles 6, 14 and 16 of the NIS Directive, as well as in its Preamble (27), (28), (38).\n Art. 5 and 18 NIS Directive; L. Lemmens, ‘België werkt aan omzetting NIS-richtlijn voor uniforme beveiliging netwerk- en informatiesystemen’, Commentary – Wolters Kluwer Online 22 November 2018; R. Roex, ‘EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed’, Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016.\n\nEnter the EU NIS Directive in 2016. As HENRIKSEN points out, the inertia on the international level may lead to more regional initiatives with like-minded States. The NIS Directive is the first horizontal and legally binding EU instrument on cybersecurity. The fact that consensus on legally binding measures could be found is partially because the Directive focuses on the protection of critical infrastructure, a domain in which the role of the State as legislator is still quite clearly defined and necessary, of which there exists a working definition, which is a concern that has long been voiced, and seeing how critical infrastructure such as hospitals, drink water systems and railways (Annex II NIS Directive) are usually located within the territory and thus jurisdiction of a State. Interestingly, the NIS Directive shows awareness of a changing, more complex and diverse cybersecurity landscape, by imposing obligations upon two entities in the private sector. Moreover, this testifies that the European legislator acknowledges that cybersecurity cannot be adequately guaranteed without involving the private sector. However, the fact that consensus on legally binding measures on the topic could be found, does not mean that the EU NIS Directive is a success: it remains to be seen how the nation States will interpret a 'cyber incident with a significant disruptive impact', without which the obligations of the Directive are meaningless. In that sense, one currently cannot overstate the success of the NIS Directive and inversely overstate the failure of the UN GGE: the latter made clear that international law does apply to state behavior in cyberspace, which indeed offers the necessary starting point. Europe has less cyber superpowers around the table than does the UN GGE, and it may be likely that State actors in the latter forum are guilty of \"fence sitting\": on the international level, cyber superpowers and other nations may want to wait and see \"where the technology is going\", or because it is in the interest of their flexibility to \"maintain the current legal uncertainties\".\n A.

    "__preamble__": "Cybersecurity and international law: a closer look at recent UN and EU initiatives Anne Verhelst¹ Key words Cybersecurity, public international law, UN GGE, European Network and Information Security Directive, critical infrastructure, private sector, digital services Abstract Ever since cybersecurity emerged as a policy concern, real life examples have shown how cyberattacks have effectively entered the realm of foreign policy. To date, however, cybersecurity has generated very little international law. How can this be explained? The article examines the factors underlying the difficult marriage between public international law and the high-tech phenomenon of cyberspace. What can or should the role of the State and/or the private sector in regulating cyberspace be? Should the international level create new laws to regulate cybersecurity or should the existing international legal principles simply be transposed to the new technological context? Today, it has become clear that the vast majority of cyber incidents do not reach the threshold of 'armed attack' in the sense of article 51 of the UN Charter. In reaction, we see that certain international organizations and nation States launched efforts to better protect cybersecurity sensu strictu. In this article, we focus on recent efforts within the UN and the EU. Notably, the article will answer whether the efforts to apply existing international law to cyberspace, undertaken by the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the Context of International Security, suffice. Why did the fifth round of negotiations among the Expert Group fail in 2017, and will there be another momentum to revive this diplomatic exercise? Zooming in on the protection of critical infrastructure specifically, how does the first horizontal and legally binding EU Directive on Network and Information Security (2016) fit in the worldwide effort to better regulate cybersecurity? This is interesting, as the Directive shows awareness of the diverse and complex nature of cybersecurity by imposing binding obligations upon the providers of essential services and digital providers.\nI Introduction ¹ Anne Verhelst is PhD Researcher in International Law at the Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies and the Institute for International Law, KU Leuven, Belgium. Anne holds a four-year fellowship of the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO).\nnuclear facilities in 2010²; think of the cyberattacks that paralyzed Estonian government services in 2007³, and think of how the Wall Street Journal just this August reported that Iranian hackers are suspected to have pervaded critical infrastructure and government computers in Bahrein.⁴ These cyber threats emanating from State (and other) sources have over recent years brought about efforts to render critical infrastructure more resilient. A few initiatives of which we will highlight in this article. Yet, cybersecurity as a policy concern has generated very little international law up to now.\nA straightforward reason that partially explains this inertia, is that the scope, nature, meaning and terminology of cybersecurity is unclear.⁵ There is little general agreement about what cybersecurity entails, and it seems that individual people use the term differently, depending on the context.⁶ This article will depart from a concept of cybersecurity sensu strictu. In that view, cybersecurity shall mean\"the security of network and information systems; the ability of network and information systems to withstand, with a certain degree of confidence, actions that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored, transmitted or processed data or the related services provided or accessible through those network and information systems\".⁷ This article thus applies a concept of cybersecurity excluding a focus As the NIS Directive aims to protect critical infrastructure against cyber incidents, this article will pay specific attention to threats directed at critical infrastructure¹², rather than focusing on cyberattacks against the data of private people, against companies (when it has no larger societal effect), etc. Moreover, in this article we exclusively discuss the international regulatory level as viewed by a nation’s perspective, to which cybersecurity can be summarized and clarified to mean the “ability to protect itself and its institutions against cyber threats”.¹³ ⁸ Cybercrime can be defined as ‘a criminal activity in which computers or computer networks are the principal means of committing an offense’. Examples include cyber-theft, cyber-trespass, cyber-obscenity, and cyber-extortions. In section IV of this article, we will analyze the European Network and Information Security Directive (2016), which aims to protect critical infrastructure from cyber incidents. Note that some authors and instruments categorize cyberattacks against critical infrastructure under ‘cybercrime’. See N. Kshetri, ‘Global Cybersecurity: Key Issues and Concepts’, 3 and N. Kshetri, ‘Positive externality, increasing returns and the rise in cybercrimes’, Communications of the ACM 2009, 141–144. In this article, we will discuss the European Directive as aiming to protect critical infrastructure, regardless of whether a cyberattack against such infrastructure should be seen as falling under a strict definition of ‘cybercrime’. Specific regional instruments dedicated to cybercrime as such are the Council of Europe’s Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and the African Union’s Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection. See Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime of 23 November 2001, entered into force on 01 July 2004, ETS no 185; African Union, Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection 27 June 2014, entered into force 3 June 2019, online available at https://au.int/sites/default/files/treaties/29560-treaty-0048_-_african_union_convention_on_cyber_security_and_personal_data_protection_e.pdf (last accessed 11 November 2019).\n⁹ E.g.

Schmitt et al., Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2017.\n¹¹ We will see in this article that multiple initiatives that try to regulate cybersecurity only address a small portion of the broader legal framework, such as the protection of critical infrastructure (e.g. EU NIS Directive), data protection online (e.g. the famous European GDPR Directive), cyber warfare (e.g. the Tallinn Manual 2.0), and thus the definition or concept of cybersecurity used (if explicitly done so) often varies according to the specific legal domain one tries to capture.

    "## II Cybersecurity and international law: irreconcilable?": "### A. Factors explaining the uneasy marriage between international law and cybersecurity\n¹⁴ In its 2013 Consensual Report (UN Doc. A/68/98, §19) and 2015 Consensual Report (UN Doc. A/70/174, §24), the UN GGE confirmed the applicability of international law, including the UN Charter, in cyberspace. Several States have already confirmed this position in their comments to these reports and in their national cyber defence and security strategies. The G20 states also confirmed this in 2015 (G20 Summit Communiqué, Antalya, 15-16 November 2015).

    "## 3° Role of the government versus of the private sector": "The discussion about the role of the State as legislator in cyberspace is prevalent: on the one hand one can argue that the nation State has the (moral) obligation to enact legislation that regulates or restricts the private sector in its cyber activities.³⁴ The argument here is that the State has to uphold binding obligations under international law, such as the protection of human rights, international peace and security, the customary 'no harm' principle³⁵, the protection of critical infrastructures³⁶ and more. These obligations can then only be (practically) guaranteed in the cyber domain if rights and obligations are imposed on private actors.³⁷ --- ²⁸ N.

    "## IV. EU Network and Information Security Directive 2016": "Over the last few decades, critical infrastructure has become increasingly more reliant on the Internet, so that it is now essential “to our water, our power, our financial segment, our aviation industry and more”.⁷⁰ Note that the approach taken in the Directive is an “all hazards” ⁶⁵ Article 51 Charter of the United Nations and Statute of the International Court of Justice, signed in San Francisco on 26 June 1945, entered into force on 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS XVI.\n⁶⁶ As does the Tallinn Manual 2.0.\n⁶⁷ S. Soesanto and F. D'Incau, ‘The UN GGE is dead: Time to fall forward’.\n⁶⁸ Art. 6 NIS Directive.\n⁶⁹ In the wake of the 2017 UN GGE ‘failure’, US Homeland Security advisor Tim Bossart expressed that “it was now time to consider other approaches…and that the U.S. will work with smaller groups of likeminded partners”. See T. Bossart, Remarks at Cyber Week 2017, Tel Aviv, 26 June 2017, online available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-homeland-security-advisor-thomas-p-bossert-cyber-week-2017/ (last accessed 8 November 2019). Think for example of the efforts by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on the Code of Conduct for Information Security or the previously mentioned African Union Convention. According to Henriksen, the regionalization of cybersecurity regulation into legal sub-systems of varying normative depth is unfortunate, given the global nature of the Internet. Yet Henriksen also admits that there are advantages to a more regional approach to cyber regulation, such as avoiding time-consuming negotiations, the perspective of reaching agreement on complex issues rather than just on the low-hanging fruits, etc. See A. Henriksen, ‘The end of the road for the UN GGE process: The future regulation of cyberspace’, 6.\n⁷⁰ Testimony of Admiral Michael Rogers, Hearing of the House Select Intelligence Committee, ‘Cybersecurity Threats: The Way Forward’, 20 November 2014 (Federal News Service Transcript). Other international organizations have equally raised awareness on the issue of cyber threats to critical infrastructure, see e.g. UN General Assembly, Report of Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the context of International Security, UN Doc. A/68/98, 24 June 2013, §9, 26(e), 30; C. Heinl, ‘Regional Cyber Security: Towards a Resilient ASEAN Cyber Security Regime’, RSIS Working Paper No. 263, 9",
    "## A. Objective and context": "The primary objective of the NIS Directive is mentioned in the preparatory works: “to guarantee a high common level of network and IT security”.⁷⁵ One of the main reasons for the creation of the NIS directive was that some EU member states did not have cybersecurity legislation in place, and even when they did, there were large divergences among nations. This goal is important seeing how\"cyber incidents are increasing in size, frequency and complexity and can result in business inability to do their jobs, significant financial losses to the EU economy and a loss of welfare for society\".⁷⁶ The fact that the Directive imposes obligations on providers of digital services indicates that the European legislator is aware that cyber incidents today are September 2013, online available at https://www.rsis.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/rsis-pubs/WP263.pdf (last accessed 7 November 2019); Organization of American States, Critical Infrastructure Protection Programs: Cyber Security, online available at http://www.oas.org/en/sms/ ciche/programs_cyber.asp (last accessed 7 November 2019); Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Critical Information Infrastructures Protection, online available at http://www. oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/ciip.htm (last accessed 7 November 2019); M.

As HENRIKSEN points out, the inertia on the international level may lead to more regional initiatives with like-minded States. The NIS Directive is the first horizontal and legally binding EU instrument on cybersecurity. The fact that consensus on legally binding measures could be found is partially because the Directive focuses on the protection of critical infrastructure, a domain in which the role of the State as legislator is still quite clearly defined and necessary, of which there exists a working definition, which is a concern that has long been voiced, and seeing how critical infrastructure such as hospitals, drink water systems and railways (Annex II NIS Directive) are usually located within the territory and thus jurisdiction of a State. Interestingly, the NIS Directive shows awareness of a changing, more complex and diverse cybersecurity landscape, by imposing obligations upon two entities in the private sector. Moreover, this testifies that the European legislator acknowledges that cybersecurity cannot be adequately guaranteed without involving the private sector. However, the fact that consensus on legally binding measures on the topic could be found, does not mean that the EU NIS Directive is a success: it remains to be seen how the nation States will interpret a 'cyber incident with a significant disruptive impact', without which the obligations of the Directive are meaningless. In that sense, one currently cannot overstate the success of the NIS Directive and inversely overstate the failure of the UN GGE: the latter made clear that international law does apply to state behavior in cyberspace, which indeed offers the necessary starting point.⁹⁰ Europe has less cyber superpowers around the table than does the UN GGE, and it may be likely that State actors in the latter forum are guilty of\"fence sitting\": on the international level, cyber superpowers and other nations may want to wait and see\"where the technology is going\", or because it is in the interest of their flexibility to\"maintain the current legal uncertainties\".⁹¹ ⁹⁰ A.

To date, however, cybersecurity has generated very little international law. How can this be explained? The article examines the factors underlying the difficult marriage between public international law and the high-tech phenomenon of cyberspace. What can or should the role of the State and/or the private sector in regulating cyberspace be? Should the international level create new laws to regulate cybersecurity or should the existing international legal principles simply be transposed to the new technological context? Today, it has become clear that the vast majority of cyber incidents do not reach the threshold of 'armed attack' in the sense of article 51 of the UN Charter. In reaction, we see that certain international organizations and nation States launched efforts to better protect cybersecurity sensu strictu. In this article, we focus on recent efforts within the UN and the EU. Notably, the article will answer whether the efforts to apply existing international law to cyberspace, undertaken by the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the Context of International Security, suffice. Why did the fifth round of negotiations among the Expert Group fail in 2017, and will there be another momentum to revive this diplomatic exercise? Zooming in on the protection of critical infrastructure specifically, how does the first horizontal and legally binding EU Directive on Network and Information Security (2016) fit in the worldwide effort to better regulate cybersecurity? This is interesting, as the Directive shows awareness of the diverse and complex nature of cybersecurity by imposing binding obligations upon the providers of essential services and digital providers.\nI Introduction\n1. Over the first two decades of this millennium, the risks flowing from each of the many clicks we perform every day became increasingly clear. Cybersecurity has entered the realm of foreign policy: think of the Stuxnet cyberattack by the U.S. and Israel that targeted Iranian\n Anne Verhelst is PhD Researcher in International Law at the Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies and the Institute for International Law, KU Leuven, Belgium. Anne holds a four-year fellowship of the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO).\nnuclear facilities in 2010; think of the cyberattacks that paralyzed Estonian government services in 2007, and think of how the Wall Street Journal just this August reported that Iranian hackers are suspected to have pervaded critical infrastructure and government computers in Bahrein. These cyber threats emanating from State (and other) sources have over recent years brought about efforts to render critical infrastructure more resilient. A few initiatives of which we will highlight in this article. Yet, cybersecurity as a policy concern has generated very little international law up to now.\nA straightforward reason that partially explains this inertia, is that the scope, nature, meaning and terminology of cybersecurity is unclear. There is little general agreement about what cybersecurity entails, and it seems that individual people use the term differently, depending on the context. This article will depart from a concept of cybersecurity sensu strictu. In that view, cybersecurity shall mean \"the security of network and information systems; the ability of network and information systems to withstand, with a certain degree of confidence, actions that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored, transmitted or processed data or the related services provided or accessible through those network and information systems\". This article thus applies a concept of cybersecurity excluding a focus\n\nAs the NIS Directive aims to protect critical infrastructure against cyber incidents, this article will pay specific attention to threats directed at critical infrastructure, rather than focusing on cyberattacks against the data of private people, against companies (when it has no larger societal effect), etc. Moreover, in this article we exclusively discuss the international regulatory level as viewed by a nation’s perspective, to which cybersecurity can be summarized and clarified to mean the “ability to protect itself and its institutions against cyber threats”.\n2. The purpose of this article is to bring together, analyze and clarify where necessary the most important recent developments in cybersecurity law and initiatives within the United Nations (hereinafter: ‘UN’) and European Union (hereinafter: ‘EU’). The questions addressed in this article are the following. First, on a more abstract level, we will discuss whether international law can adequately regulate issues of cybersecurity. Are there any impediments that law places on the cyber domain (if so, which ones)? And vice versa, can the high-tech phenomenon of cybersecurity be embedded in international law? (Title II) The article then analyzes the most important legal, regulatory, and soft law developments in the field of cybersecurity within the UN, with specific attention paid to the work by the Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the Context\n Cybercrime can be defined as ‘a criminal activity in which computers or computer networks are the principal means of committing an offense’. Examples include cyber-theft, cyber-trespass, cyber-obscenity, and cyber-extortions. In section IV of this article, we will analyze the European Network and Information Security Directive (2016), which aims to protect critical infrastructure from cyber incidents. Note that some authors and instruments categorize cyberattacks against critical infrastructure under ‘cybercrime’. See N. Kshetri, ‘Global Cybersecurity: Key Issues and Concepts’, 3 and N. Kshetri, ‘Positive externality, increasing returns and the rise in cybercrimes’, Communications of the ACM 2009, 141–144. In this article, we will discuss the European Directive as aiming to protect critical infrastructure, regardless of whether a cyberattack against such infrastructure should be seen as falling under a strict definition of ‘cybercrime’. Specific regional instruments dedicated to cybercrime as such are the Council of Europe’s Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and the African Union’s Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection. See Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime of 23 November 2001, entered into force on 01 July 2004, ETS no 185; African Union, Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection 27 June 2014, entered into force 3 June 2019, online available at https://au.int/sites/default/files/treaties/29560-treaty-0048_-_african_union_convention_on_cyber_security_and_personal_data_protection_e.pdf (last accessed 11 November 2019).\n E.g. D. Fidler, ‘Wither the Web: International Law, Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’, Georgetown Journal of International Affairs 2015, 10-11.\n E.g. Rules 20-95 Tallinn Manual 2.0 in M. Schmitt et al., Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2017.\n We will see in this article that multiple initiatives that try to regulate cybersecurity only address a small portion of the broader legal framework, such as the protection of critical infrastructure (e.g. EU NIS Directive), data protection online (e.g. the famous European GDPR Directive), cyber warfare (e.g. the Tallinn Manual 2.0), and thus the definition or concept of cybersecurity used (if explicitly done so) often varies according to the specific legal domain one tries to capture. See J. Kosseff, ‘Defining Cybersecurity Law’, 985.\n In this article, \"critical infrastructure\" is understood as referred to in the NIS Directive. See infra, footnote 75.\n N.

Choucri, Cyberpolitics in international relations: Context, connectivity, and content, Cambridge, MIT Press, 2012, 39.\nof International Security (hereinafter: ‘UN GGE’) (Title III) and within the EU (Title IV), with specific attention paid to the 2016 NIS Directive. The conclusion of the article stipulates some forward-looking comments (Title V).\n## II Cybersecurity and international law: irreconcilable?\n3. First and foremost, it should be clear that there is a broad understanding that international law applies in cyberspace to state behavior. This is to say, the rules developed before cybersecurity became a prominent (policy) problem. The same international legal norms that govern the physical space are applicable in cyberspace: the core question is thus not “if” international law applies to cyberspace, but rather “how” it does. How to efficiently translate the pre-cyber existing international law to cyberspace is difficult, which can be explained by certain factors scrutinized right below.\n### A. Factors explaining the uneasy marriage between international law and cybersecurity\n4. Law as a system is no stranger to try and regulate rapid technological evolutions, be it developments in outer space, on the high seas, in the data collection domain, artificial intelligence, etc. This is equally so for cyberspace. The uneasy marriage between international law and cybersecurity can be explained by the intrinsic properties of both phenomena.\n In its 2013 Consensual Report (UN Doc. A/68/98, §19) and 2015 Consensual Report (UN Doc. A/70/174, §24), the UN GGE confirmed the applicability of international law, including the UN Charter, in cyberspace. Several States have already confirmed this position in their comments to these reports and in their national cyber defence and security strategies. The G20 states also confirmed this in 2015 (G20 Summit Communiqué, Antalya, 15-16 November 2015). See UN General Assembly, Report of the Secretary-General on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (Addendum), UN Doc.

Tranter, ‘Nomology, Ontology, and Phenomenology of Law and Technology’, Minnesota Journal of Law Science &amp; Technology 2007, 449.\n1° Fast and high-tech cyber revolution\n5. The digitization of the world is taking place at an unparalleled pace. It is expected that by 2020 there will be more than 20 billion connected devices. In contrast to how the international regulator in the last century was able to respond in a timely manner to certain evolutions, such as the international law of the sea concept 'exclusive economic zone' (EEZ) and the protection of the seabed as 'common heritage of mankind', the cyber revolution is often said to be so fast and unpredictable that international law-making has difficulties catching up.\n2° Territoriality, sovereignty, fragmentation of jurisdiction and attribution\n6. It has become evident that the current global challenges cannot be adequately addressed by one single actor. Whether one thinks of climate change, international terrorism or cyber threats, international law offers a framework for international co-operation. Now let it be the case that the core concept on which international law is based, that of state sovereignty, does not effortlessly fit in cyberspace. Although there is agreement that the principle of state sovereignty (UN Charter) applies in cyberspace, there is no one State that can claim sovereignty over the entire cyberspace. The reason being that the many cyber infrastructures that make up cyberspace are located in different sovereign territories, and in international law, territoriality allocates jurisdiction. Nonetheless, this off and on fragmentation of jurisdiction should not be a reason to give up on regulating cybersecurity all together, we agree with TRACHTMAN, since after all, (cyber)conduct still occurs in a certain territory and effects are still felt in a certain territory. Issues that transcend territorial jurisdiction are not new whatsoever to international law (e.g. the law of the high seas, outer space, climate change). The challenge here is linked to the attribution problem, understood as the difficulty to determine\n K.

A third factor that underlies the difficult relationship between cybersecurity and international law is the question of the (extent of the) regulatory role of the State versus that of the private sector in cyberspace. The alternatively controlled nature of cyberspace is the reason this debate exists: cyberspace is a domain in which industry and the private sector play a/the pivotal role. The private sector governs cyberspace in an informal fashion, leaving less room for the formal legislator (the nation State). This informal governance is reminiscent of the *lex mercatoria*, the private economic law of the Middle Ages, according to HOISINGTON. The question is then to what extent the State must or can impose legal obligations on the private sector in regulating cybersecurity. Vice versa, to what extent can cybersecurity regulation be effective if the private sector is not involved in its preparation and implementation?\nThe discussion about the role of the State as legislator in cyberspace is prevalent: on the one hand one can argue that the nation State has the (moral) obligation to enact legislation that regulates or restricts the private sector in its cyber activities. The argument here is that the State has to uphold binding obligations under international law, such as the protection of human rights, international peace and security, the customary 'no harm' principle, the protection of critical infrastructures and more. These obligations can then only be (practically) guaranteed in the cyber domain if rights and obligations are imposed on private actors.\n---\n N.

Kittichaisaree, ‘Future Prospects of Public International Law of Cyberspace’, 335-352.\n\n8. We agree that these two opposing sides should not be seen as an and/or question: whether and to which extent the State should have a regulatory role in cyberspace has to depend on the specific conduct one wishes to regulate. The “institutional choice may begin with determining whether the issue at stake is best taken on by the market, by private firms, by the State government, or by international law”. When we will discuss the NIS Directive under section IV, it will become evident that the role of the State in protecting critical infrastructure (from cyber incidents) is still quite clear, uncontroversial and moreover necessary, as the State disposes of the necessary information, tools, legal framework and legitimate measures to do so. Interestingly, the NIS Directive imposes binding obligations onto certain entities in the private sector, acknowledging that cyberspace is a domain in which cooperation between the State and private actors is more than often necessary.\n4° Applying existing law versus creating new law\n9. Is it sufficient to apply existing international law to the cyber domain, or should the international community create new rules specifically designed to address this challenge? Three suggestions prevail:\n\n\"(1) Cybersecurity should be addressed by using existing rules and existing structures under international law;\n(2) Cyberspace is a fundamentally unique concept that requires a whole new set of rules and legal structures;\n(3) Existing law can include the challenge of cybersecurity, but in order to be effective and efficient, those elements that are incompatible with the uniqueness of cyberspace need to be set aside\".\nWhat has been done so far on the international plane can largely be placed under option 1: the UN GGE has declared that international law, including the UN Charter, applies to cyberspace, whereas the Tallinn Manual 2.0 transposes basic concepts of international law to cyberspace in general (notably Rules 1-24), and further on in the book to cyberwarfare.\n## 5° 'Cyber Mania'\n10. Cyber mania is another phenomenon that complicates the relationship between international law and cybersecurity. While the international developments in the field of cybersecurity sensu strictu have been limited, a considerable amount of academic attention and policy interest has been paid to the specific issue of 'cyberwarfare law'. According to O' CONNELL, it were the highly mediatized cyberattacks that took place in the 00's (Estonia 2007; Russo-Georgian conflict 2008; Stuxnet 2010) that created this militarized image of cybersecurity law. However, the majority of cyber incidents do not reach the threshold of 'armed attack' in the sense of article 51 of the UN Charter. In reality, cyber threats are more complex and diverse in nature, and they often target private companies. Recent legislation, such as the European NIS Directive (which aims to protect providers of essential services and digital services such as online marketplaces) shows awareness of this more complex cyber reality, which we agree cannot be reduced to international war terms.\n## B. Interim conclusion\n11. Given these multiple challenges, of which this article highlighted just five, it is perhaps not surprising - or it is precisely so in view of the imminent need - that there exists no comprehensive international or European legislation in the field of cybersecurity sensu strictu.\n W. von Heinegg, 'The Tallinn Manual and International Cyber Security Law', in T.

In the next section, the article will analyze the recent developments within the UN, with a specific focus to the work of the UN GGE. In the section thereafter, we will discuss the European NIS Directive.\n## III United Nations\nA. The UN Group of Governmental Experts: paving the way for international cybersecurity law?\n12. As discussed before, because of the nature of cyberspace, it was early on realized that cybersecurity demands for more than purely national regulation. Shortly after Edward Snowed changed the cybersecurity playing field, the UN GGE - established under the auspices of the First Committee of the UN General Assembly - published a report on 24 June 2013. The essence of the non-binding document is that it confirms that international law, and in particular the UN Charter, applies in cyberspace just like in the physical space.^[50]^ This includes the rules on state sovereignty and the principles resulting from the notion of sovereignty: for example, a State has jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure on its territory; and the State is responsible for international unlawful cyber acts that can be attributed to it.^[51]^\nIn its successive consensual report of 2015, the UN GGE put forward i.e. the following principles of the UN Charter and international law as applicable in cyberspace to state behavior: \"sovereignty, sovereign equality, peaceful conflict resolution, the prohibition of the use of or threat of violence against the territorial integrity or political independence of a State, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States\".^[52]^ This transposition to cyberspace of the basic principles of public international law, which almost all constitute binding customary law or have been confirmed by the International Court of Justice, is subject to a reasonable degree of agreement.^[53]^ As expressed before, the question is not really 'if' international law applies to cyberspace, but 'how', and importantly, whether it is translated efficiently and whether this suffices.^[54]^\n^[50] UN General Assembly, Report of Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the context of International Security, UN Doc.

Henriksen, 'The end of the road for the UN GGE process: The future regulation of cyberspace', 2.\n13. The 2013 and 2015 UN GGE reports are non-binding soft law. In this logic, they reflect that international law applies in cyberspace and they serve as an important indicator. After all, several States, including certain cyber superpowers, have confirmed this applicability in their comments to the UN GGE reports and in their national cyber security strategies. This applicability was equally confirmed by the G20 states in 2015. At that point in time, the reports by the UN GGE could be seen as a sign of growing consensus on the matter, and in this sense as evidence of the development of *opinio juris*, which is one of the elements needed to eventually create binding customary international law (art. 38(1)(c) Statute of the International Court of Justice). Especially in the domain of international cybersecurity law, the manifestation of *opinio juris* can be deemed as imperative if one wants to argue that there exists customary law, as practice on cybersecurity is for the larger part either classified or contradictory, and states have shown to be reluctant to openly declare if and how they regulate cyberspace. One can find elements that inform *opinio juris* i.e. in reports prepared by international organizations, such as the UN GGE reports. Seeing how international cybersecurity law is still in a formative state, any expressed *opinio juris* displays aspirations rather than commitments – yet they are still of importance. Then, in June 2017, during the fifth meeting of the UN GGE, any meaningful manifestation of the development of *opinio juris* came to an abrupt end. Fundamental differences between the 25 members emerged, mainly on the issue of self-defence rights and on applying international humanitarian law to cyber conflicts. The Cuban delegation refused to recognize the explicit reference in the text to the applicability of self-defence rights in cyberspace. According to the delegation, this would “legitimize an ICT war”. The Americans interpreted this as undoing all earlier progress made within the UN GGE. Geopolitics aside, note that the 2013 UN GGE report confirmed the applicability of the UN Charter to cyberspace, and with this *implicitly* article 51 UN Charter,\n K. Abbott and D.

In parallel to, or following, the deadlock on cybersecurity law discussions on the international level, the European Union issued its first ever horizontal and legally binding instrument on cybersecurity *sensu strictu*, which aims to protect critical infrastructure (essential service providers and digital service providers) from cyber incidents that have a ‘significant disruptive effect’. The NIS Directive was issued in 2016 and had to be implemented in the different national legal orders. As HENRIKSEN professed, the deadlock within the UN GGE may lead to more regional initiatives with like-minded states, much like the European Directive we will now discuss. The NIS Directive is an example of new rules being created after cybersecurity emerged as a policy problem, and not applying previously existing international law to a new context (e.g. UN GGE 2013 and 2015 reports and Tallinn Manual 2.0).\nOver the last few decades, critical infrastructure has become increasingly more reliant on the Internet, so that it is now essential “to our water, our power, our financial segment, our aviation industry and more”. Note that the approach taken in the Directive is an “all hazards”\n Article 51 Charter of the United Nations and Statute of the International Court of Justice, signed in San Francisco on 26 June 1945, entered into force on 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS XVI.\n As does the Tallinn Manual 2.0.\n S. Soesanto and F. D'Incau, ‘The UN GGE is dead: Time to fall forward’.\n Art. 6 NIS Directive.\n In the wake of the 2017 UN GGE ‘failure’, US Homeland Security advisor Tim Bossart expressed that “it was now time to consider other approaches…and that the U.S. will work with smaller groups of likeminded partners”. See T. Bossart, Remarks at Cyber Week 2017, Tel Aviv, 26 June 2017, online available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-homeland-security-advisor-thomas-p-bossert-cyber-week-2017/ (last accessed 8 November 2019). Think for example of the efforts by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on the Code of Conduct for Information Security or the previously mentioned African Union Convention. According to Henriksen, the regionalization of cybersecurity regulation into legal sub-systems of varying normative depth is unfortunate, given the global nature of the Internet. Yet Henriksen also admits that there are advantages to a more regional approach to cyber regulation, such as avoiding time-consuming negotiations, the perspective of reaching agreement on complex issues rather than just on the low-hanging fruits, etc. See A. Henriksen, ‘The end of the road for the UN GGE process: The future regulation of cyberspace’, 6.\n Testimony of Admiral Michael Rogers, Hearing of the House Select Intelligence Committee, ‘Cybersecurity Threats: The Way Forward’, 20 November 2014 (Federal News Service Transcript). Other international organizations have equally raised awareness on the issue of cyber threats to critical infrastructure, see e.g. UN General Assembly, Report of Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the context of International Security, UN Doc. A/68/98, 24 June 2013, §9, 26(e), 30; C. Heinl, ‘Regional Cyber Security: Towards a Resilient ASEAN Cyber Security Regime’, RSIS Working Paper No. 263, 9\n\n## A. Objective and context\n15. The EU launched a strategy for a digital single market in 2015; the NIS Directive, the General Data Protection Regulation (the famous 'GDPR') and the eIDAS Regulation all fall under this strategy.\nThe primary objective of the NIS Directive is mentioned in the preparatory works: “to guarantee a high common level of network and IT security”. One of the main reasons for the creation of the NIS directive was that some EU member states did not have cybersecurity legislation in place, and even when they did, there were large divergences among nations. This goal is important seeing how \"cyber incidents are increasing in size, frequency and complexity and can result in business inability to do their jobs, significant financial losses to the EU economy and a loss of welfare for society\". The fact that the Directive imposes obligations on providers of digital services indicates that the European legislator is aware that cyber incidents today are\nSeptember 2013, online available at https://www.rsis.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/rsis-pubs/WP263.pdf (last accessed 7 November 2019); Organization of American States, Critical Infrastructure Protection Programs: Cyber Security, online available at http://www.oas.org/en/sms/ ciche/programs_cyber.asp (last accessed 7 November 2019); Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Critical Information Infrastructures Protection, online available at http://www. oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/ciip.htm (last accessed 7 November 2019); M.

Note how the Shanghai Cooperation Organization went a step further than cooperation and awareness raising, and agreed in a treaty to cooperate on information security within critical infrastructures. The previously mentioned AU Convention obliges parties to undertake action to protect critical infrastructure. See Art. 3, Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of International Information Security, 16 June 2009, online available at https://ccdcoe-admin.aku.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SCO-090616-IISAgreement.pdf (unofficial English translation, last accessed 7 November 2019); Article 25(4) AU Convention on Cyber Security.\n Termed by D. Fidler, 'Wither the Web: International Law, Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection', 13.\n Art. 4(7) NIS Directive.\n Regulation (EU) No 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and repealing directive 95/46/EC, 4 May 2016, OJ L 119, 1-88.\n Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions in the Internal Market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC, 28 August 2014, OJ L 257, 73-114.\n Preamble (4) NIS Directive.\n Preamble (2) NIS Directive.\ndiverse and complex in nature, most of the time not reaching the threshold of ‘armed attack’ (article 51 UN Charter).\n16. The NIS Directive is legally binding. It is not particularly difficult to explain why consensus on legally binding measures could be found within the EU on this topic, and why it has proved more difficult within the UN. Apart from the like-minded group argument (supra), the NIS Directive primarily creates measures to protect critical infrastructure; for the latter, the role of the formal legislator is still quite clearly defined. Moreover, since there exists a manageable working definition of \"critical infrastructures\" and since this concern has long been voiced within cybersecurity discussions, the NIS Directive ignores some of the obstacles mentioned in numbers 5-10. In addition to this, as a country's critical infrastructure is most often located within its territory (e.g. drink water systems, hospitals, railways), and thus within its jurisdiction, governments can in principle (to a certain extent) protect it without necessarily relying upon public international law.\n17. Analyzing the NIS Directive is interesting, as the European legislator acknowledges the importance of imposing obligations upon the private sector. There are two entities onto which the Directives imposes obligations: the Member State government (1) and the private sector (2) (notably the providers of essential services mentioned in Annex II of the Directive and the providers of digital services mentioned in Annex II of the Directive).\n See supra, no 10.\n Supra, no 8.\n See art. 2(a) EU Directive 2008/114/EC of the Council of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection, adopted on 8 December 2008, entered into force January 2009, Pb.

Fidler, 'Wither the Web: International Law, Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection', 9-10.\n\n18. The NIS Directive imposes upon Member States obligations that can be summarized under the following three categories:\n1) Each Member State must ensure a minimum national capacity by designating NIS competent authorities (Art. 8 NIS Directive), by setting up computer crisis teams ('Computer Emergency Response Teams' - CERTs or 'Computer Security Incident Response Teams' - CSIRTs (Art. 9) and national NIS strategies and cooperation plans (Art. 7));\n2) National competent authorities should work together within a network that allows secure and effective coordination, including coordinated information exchange, and detection and response at EU level. Member States must exchange information and collaborate through this network to tackle NIS threats and incidents on the basis of the European NIS cooperation plan (Art. 11);\n3) One of the most important obligations for the Member State is to identify the providers of essential services (Art. 5). A culture of risk management shall be introduced and the private and public sectors shall exchange information with each other.\nC. Specific obligations for stakeholders in the private sector\n19. The Directive focuses on two types of entities in the private sector (Articles 1, 4, 5, 14, 16):\n- the providers of essential services;\n- digital service providers.\n20. In its Annex II, the NIS Directive specifies in a non-exhaustive way the sectors in which the Member States must search for the providers of essential services. These include the following sectors: banks, stock exchanges, transport and distribution of energy, air, rail and maritime transport, health, internet services and the government. Nuclear installations fall outside the scope of the Directive.\n21. \"Digital service providers\", the second private sector entity onto which the Directive imposes obligations, should be understood as online marketplaces, online search engines and cloud computer services. These are exhaustively listed in Annex II of the Directive. Note that\n R. Roex, 'EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed', Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016.\n According to Article 5 (2) NIS Directive, providers of essential services are entities that 'provide services that are essential for the maintenance of critical social and / or economic activities, the provision of that service depending on network and information systems and in which in the event of an incident this would have significant disruptive effects on the provision of that service'.\n L. Lemmens, 'België werkt aan omzetting NIS-richtlijn voor uniforme beveiliging netwerk- en informatiesystemen', Commentary – Wolters Kluwer Online 22 November 2018.\n\n22. The most important obligations for providers of essential services and providers of digital services can be summarized as follows:\n- take appropriate technical and organizational measures to manage NIS risks;\n- prepare and implement business continuity plans;\n- notify the competent authority or CSIRT of an incident that has a significant impact.\nWhat exactly constitutes a cyber incident with a ‘significant disruptive impact’ is thus quintessential to the implementation of the Directive, yet the meaning of the broad term is unclear at this stage, and it remains to be seen how this will be applied in practice.\nD. Territorial scope\n23. Articles 5 and 18 of the NIS Directive clarify its territorial scope. For providers of essential services, each Member State where the provider has an establishment through which he offers essential services in that Member State will have jurisdiction. For digital service providers, this will be the Member State where the service provider has its headquarters and jurisdiction and its supervisory authority (one stop shop principle). If there are no headquarters in the EU, the provider or service provider must appoint a representative.\nV. Conclusion\n24. This article identified five factors underlying the difficult relationship between cybersecurity and international law. These are the speed at which global digitization is taking place as well as the nature of cyber operations (1), the fragmented jurisdiction and attribution problem (2), the question whether and to which extent the State and/or the private sector should have a regulatory role in cyberspace (3), whether transposing existing law onto the new technological context suffices, and (5) the phenomenon of 'cyber mania'.\n R. Roex, ‘EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed’, Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016. Under the NIS Directive, Member States are not required to identify digital service providers, allowing for a ‘catch-all approach’. See D. Markopoulou, V. Papakonstantinou and P. de Hert, ‘The new EU cybersecurity framework: The NIS Directive, ENISA’s role and the General Data Protection Regulation’, Computer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 2019, 4.\n Art. 14 and 16 NIS Directive. Affected Member States are informed when an incident has cross-border consequences. See also D. Markopoulou, V. Papakonstantinou and P. de Hert, ‘The new EU cybersecurity framework: The NIS Directive, ENISA’s role and the General Data Protection Regulation’, 5-6. R. Roex, ‘EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed’, Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016.\n Some guiding elements to determine what a ‘significant disruptive effect’ is, are mentioned in articles 6, 14 and 16 of the NIS Directive, as well as in its Preamble (27), (28), (38).\n Art. 5 and 18 NIS Directive; L. Lemmens, ‘België werkt aan omzetting NIS-richtlijn voor uniforme beveiliging netwerk- en informatiesystemen’, Commentary – Wolters Kluwer Online 22 November 2018; R. Roex, ‘EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed’, Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016.\n\nEnter the EU NIS Directive in 2016. As HENRIKSEN points out, the inertia on the international level may lead to more regional initiatives with like-minded States. The NIS Directive is the first horizontal and legally binding EU instrument on cybersecurity. The fact that consensus on legally binding measures could be found is partially because the Directive focuses on the protection of critical infrastructure, a domain in which the role of the State as legislator is still quite clearly defined and necessary, of which there exists a working definition, which is a concern that has long been voiced, and seeing how critical infrastructure such as hospitals, drink water systems and railways (Annex II NIS Directive) are usually located within the territory and thus jurisdiction of a State. Interestingly, the NIS Directive shows awareness of a changing, more complex and diverse cybersecurity landscape, by imposing obligations upon two entities in the private sector. Moreover, this testifies that the European legislator acknowledges that cybersecurity cannot be adequately guaranteed without involving the private sector. However, the fact that consensus on legally binding measures on the topic could be found, does not mean that the EU NIS Directive is a success: it remains to be seen how the nation States will interpret a 'cyber incident with a significant disruptive impact', without which the obligations of the Directive are meaningless. In that sense, one currently cannot overstate the success of the NIS Directive and inversely overstate the failure of the UN GGE: the latter made clear that international law does apply to state behavior in cyberspace, which indeed offers the necessary starting point. Europe has less cyber superpowers around the table than does the UN GGE, and it may be likely that State actors in the latter forum are guilty of \"fence sitting\": on the international level, cyber superpowers and other nations may want to wait and see \"where the technology is going\", or because it is in the interest of their flexibility to \"maintain the current legal uncertainties\".\n A.

        "1": "Over the first two decades of this millennium, the risks flowing from each of the many clicks we perform every day became increasingly clear. Cybersecurity has entered the realm of foreign policy: think of the Stuxnet cyberattack by the U.S. and Israel that targeted Iranian ¹ Anne Verhelst is PhD Researcher in International Law at the Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies and the Institute for International Law, KU Leuven, Belgium. Anne holds a four-year fellowship of the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO). nuclear facilities in 2010²; think of the cyberattacks that paralyzed Estonian government services in 2007³, and think of how the Wall Street Journal just this August reported that Iranian hackers are suspected to have pervaded critical infrastructure and government computers in Bahrein.⁴ These cyber threats emanating from State (and other) sources have over recent years brought about efforts to render critical infrastructure more resilient. A few initiatives of which we will highlight in this article. Yet, cybersecurity as a policy concern has generated very little international law up to now. A straightforward reason that partially explains this inertia, is that the scope, nature, meaning and terminology of cybersecurity is unclear.⁵ There is little general agreement about what cybersecurity entails, and it seems that individual people use the term differently, depending on the context.⁶ This article will depart from a concept of cybersecurity sensu strictu. In that view, cybersecurity shall mean \"the security of network and information systems; the ability of network and information systems to withstand, with a certain degree of confidence, actions that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored, transmitted or processed data or the related services provided or accessible through those network and information systems\".⁷ This article thus applies a concept of cybersecurity excluding a focus 2 M.

Futter, 'Cyber semantics: why we should retire the latest buzzword in security studies', Journal of Cyber Policy 2018, 202. The terminological vagueness is not without practical impact: the definition of cybersecurity in a given context is after all contingent upon what and who is being deterred, how, and whether the attribution of capabilities is possible. The vague language means that it can be unclear who should take responsibility for ensuring cybersecurity, leading to various legal and practical obstacles in regulating the issue. See A.

As the NIS Directive aims to protect critical infrastructure against cyber incidents, this article will pay specific attention to threats directed at critical infrastructure¹², rather than focusing on cyberattacks against the data of private people, against companies (when it has no larger societal effect), etc. Moreover, in this article we exclusively discuss the international regulatory level as viewed by a nation’s perspective, to which cybersecurity can be summarized and clarified to mean the “ability to protect itself and its institutions against cyber threats”.¹³",
        "2": "The purpose of this article is to bring together, analyze and clarify where necessary the most important recent developments in cybersecurity law and initiatives within the United Nations (hereinafter: ‘UN’) and European Union (hereinafter: ‘EU’). The questions addressed in this article are the following. First, on a more abstract level, we will discuss whether international law can adequately regulate issues of cybersecurity. Are there any impediments that law places on the cyber domain (if so, which ones)? And vice versa, can the high-tech phenomenon of cybersecurity be embedded in international law? (Title II) The article then analyzes the most important legal, regulatory, and soft law developments in the field of cybersecurity within the UN, with specific attention paid to the work by the Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the Context ⁸ Cybercrime can be defined as ‘a criminal activity in which computers or computer networks are the principal means of committing an offense’. Examples include cyber-theft, cyber-trespass, cyber-obscenity, and cyber-extortions. In section IV of this article, we will analyze the European Network and Information Security Directive (2016), which aims to protect critical infrastructure from cyber incidents. Note that some authors and instruments categorize cyberattacks against critical infrastructure under ‘cybercrime’. See N. Kshetri, ‘Global Cybersecurity: Key Issues and Concepts’, 3 and N. Kshetri, ‘Positive externality, increasing returns and the rise in cybercrimes’, Communications of the ACM 2009, 141–144. In this article, we will discuss the European Directive as aiming to protect critical infrastructure, regardless of whether a cyberattack against such infrastructure should be seen as falling under a strict definition of ‘cybercrime’. Specific regional instruments dedicated to cybercrime as such are the Council of Europe’s Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and the African Union’s Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection. See Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime of 23 November 2001, entered into force on 01 July 2004, ETS no 185; African Union, Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection 27 June 2014, entered into force 3 June 2019, online available at https://au.int/sites/default/files/treaties/29560-treaty-0048_-_african_union_convention_on_cyber_security_and_personal_data_protection_e.pdf (last accessed 11 November 2019). ⁹ E.g.

The conclusion of the article stipulates some forward-looking comments (Title V). ## II Cybersecurity and international law: irreconcilable?",
        "3": "First and foremost, it should be clear that there is a broad understanding that international law applies in cyberspace to state behavior.¹⁴ This is to say, the rules developed before cybersecurity became a prominent (policy) problem. The same international legal norms that govern the physical space are applicable in cyberspace: the core question is thus not “if” international law applies to cyberspace, but rather “how” it does.¹⁵ How to efficiently translate the pre-cyber existing international law to cyberspace is difficult¹⁶, which can be explained by certain factors scrutinized right below. ### A. Factors explaining the uneasy marriage between international law and cybersecurity",
        "4": "Law as a system is no stranger to try and regulate rapid technological evolutions, be it developments in outer space, on the high seas, in the data collection domain, artificial intelligence, etc. This is equally so for cyberspace.¹⁷ The uneasy marriage between international law and cybersecurity can be explained by the intrinsic properties of both phenomena. ¹⁴ In its 2013 Consensual Report (UN Doc. A/68/98, §19) and 2015 Consensual Report (UN Doc. A/70/174, §24), the UN GGE confirmed the applicability of international law, including the UN Charter, in cyberspace. Several States have already confirmed this position in their comments to these reports and in their national cyber defence and security strategies. The G20 states also confirmed this in 2015 (G20 Summit Communiqué, Antalya, 15-16 November 2015).

        "5": "The digitization of the world is taking place at an unparalleled pace.¹⁸ It is expected that by 2020 there will be more than 20 billion connected devices.¹⁹ In contrast to how the international regulator in the last century was able to respond in a timely manner to certain evolutions, such as the international law of the sea concept 'exclusive economic zone' (EEZ)²⁰ and the protection of the seabed as 'common heritage of mankind'²¹, the cyber revolution is often said to be so fast and unpredictable that international law-making has difficulties catching up.²² 2° Territoriality, sovereignty, fragmentation of jurisdiction and attribution",
        "6": "It has become evident that the current global challenges cannot be adequately addressed by one single actor. Whether one thinks of climate change, international terrorism or cyber threats, international law offers a framework for international co-operation. Now let it be the case that the core concept on which international law is based, that of state sovereignty, does not effortlessly fit in cyberspace.²³ Although there is agreement that the principle of state sovereignty (UN Charter) applies in cyberspace²⁴, there is no one State that can claim sovereignty over the entire cyberspace.²⁵ The reason being that the many cyber infrastructures that make up cyberspace are located in different sovereign territories²⁶, and in international law, territoriality allocates jurisdiction. Nonetheless, this off and on fragmentation of jurisdiction should not be a reason to give up on regulating cybersecurity all together, we agree with TRACHTMAN, since after all, (cyber)conduct still occurs in a certain territory and effects are still felt in a certain territory.²⁷ Issues that transcend territorial jurisdiction are not new whatsoever to international law (e.g. the law of the high seas, outer space, climate change). The challenge here is linked to the attribution problem, understood as the difficulty to determine ¹⁸ K.

        "7": "A third factor that underlies the difficult relationship between cybersecurity and international law is the question of the (extent of the) regulatory role of the State versus that of the private sector in cyberspace.³¹ The alternatively controlled nature of cyberspace is the reason this debate exists³²: cyberspace is a domain in which industry and the private sector play a/the pivotal role. The private sector governs cyberspace in an informal fashion, leaving less room for the formal legislator (the nation State).³³ This informal governance is reminiscent of the *lex mercatoria*, the private economic law of the Middle Ages, according to HOISINGTON. The question is then to what extent the State must or can impose legal obligations on the private sector in regulating cybersecurity. Vice versa, to what extent can cybersecurity regulation be effective if the private sector is not involved in its preparation and implementation? The discussion about the role of the State as legislator in cyberspace is prevalent: on the one hand one can argue that the nation State has the (moral) obligation to enact legislation that regulates or restricts the private sector in its cyber activities.³⁴ The argument here is that the State has to uphold binding obligations under international law, such as the protection of human rights, international peace and security, the customary 'no harm' principle³⁵, the protection of critical infrastructures³⁶ and more. These obligations can then only be (practically) guaranteed in the cyber domain if rights and obligations are imposed on private actors.³⁷ --- ²⁸ N.

Kittichaisaree, ‘Future Prospects of Public International Law of Cyberspace’, 335-352. 6 Some call into question whether the role of the State within the cyber domain can and should be that far-reaching. In this respect, the main arguments in favor of a limited oversight function of the State are that the private sector does not have sufficient incentives to duly cooperate with the State since this could jeopardize its commercial objectives³⁸ (i.e. reputation damage, counter-attacks by competitors using released technology), that regulation will slow down innovation³⁹, that the private sector prefers a private legal system as opposed to public criminal law⁴⁰, etc. An alternative solution is that the governance of cyberspace shall be observed on the basis of (binding or non-binding) codes of conduct originating from the industry itself.⁴¹",
        "8": "We agree that these two opposing sides should not be seen as an and/or question⁴²: whether and to which extent the State should have a regulatory role in cyberspace has to depend on the specific conduct one wishes to regulate. The “institutional choice may begin with determining whether the issue at stake is best taken on by the market, by private firms, by the State government, or by international law”.⁴³ When we will discuss the NIS Directive under section IV, it will become evident that the role of the State in protecting critical infrastructure (from cyber incidents) is still quite clear, uncontroversial and moreover necessary, as the State disposes of the necessary information, tools, legal framework and legitimate measures to do so. Interestingly, the NIS Directive imposes binding obligations onto certain entities in the private sector, acknowledging that cyberspace is a domain in which cooperation between the State and private actors is more than often necessary. 4° Applying existing law versus creating new law",
        "9": "Is it sufficient to apply existing international law to the cyber domain, or should the international community create new rules specifically designed to address this challenge? Three suggestions prevail⁴⁴: 38 M. Teplinsky, ‘Fiddling on the Roof: Recent Developments in Cybersecurity’, American University Business Law Review 2013, 225-322, 310. 39 J. Contreras et al., ‘Mapping Today’s Cybersecurity Landscape’, American University Law Review 2013, 1115, 1119. 40 D. Wall, Cybercrime: The Transformation of Crime in the Information Age, Cambridge, Polity, 2007, 25-26. 41 An example of such an influential code of conduct is the \"NIST\" (National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity) framework. This document harmonizes consensus standards and industry best practices to provide, its proponents argue, a flexible and cost-effective approach to enhancing cybersecurity that assists owners and operators of critical infrastructure in assessing and managing cyber risk, as the standard for due diligence. NIST collaborates with i.e. the United Kingdom, Japan, Korea, Estonia, Israel and Germany. A disadvantage of NIST would be that it is less well suited to protect enterprises from sophisticated and targeted cyberattacks, argue S. Shackelford, J. Russell and A. Kuehn in ‘Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors’, 42. 42 J. Trachtman, ‘Cyberspace and Cybersecurity’, 90. 43 This choice reflects the “true meaning of subsidiarity”, according to J. Trachtman, ‘Cyberspace and Cybersecurity’, 90. 44 M. Hoisington, ‘Regulating Cyber Operations Through International Law: In, Out or Against the Box’, 87. \"(1) Cybersecurity should be addressed by using existing rules and existing structures under international law; (2) Cyberspace is a fundamentally unique concept that requires a whole new set of rules and legal structures; (3) Existing law can include the challenge of cybersecurity, but in order to be effective and efficient, those elements that are incompatible with the uniqueness of cyberspace need to be set aside\". What has been done so far on the international plane can largely be placed under option 1: the UN GGE has declared that international law, including the UN Charter, applies to cyberspace, whereas the Tallinn Manual 2.0 transposes basic concepts of international law to cyberspace in general (notably Rules 1-24), and further on in the book to cyberwarfare. ## 5° 'Cyber Mania'",
        "10": "Cyber mania is another phenomenon that complicates the relationship between international law and cybersecurity.⁴⁵ While the international developments in the field of cybersecurity sensu strictu have been limited, a considerable amount of academic attention and policy interest has been paid to the specific issue of 'cyberwarfare law'. According to O' CONNELL, it were the highly mediatized cyberattacks that took place in the 00's (Estonia 2007; Russo-Georgian conflict 2008; Stuxnet 2010)⁴⁶ that created this militarized image of cybersecurity law. However, the majority of cyber incidents do not reach the threshold of 'armed attack' in the sense of article 51 of the UN Charter.⁴⁷ In reality, cyber threats are more complex and diverse in nature, and they often target private companies.⁴⁸ Recent legislation, such as the European NIS Directive (which aims to protect providers of essential services and digital services such as online marketplaces) shows awareness of this more complex cyber reality, which we agree cannot be reduced to international war terms.⁴⁹ ## B. Interim conclusion",
        "11": "Given these multiple challenges, of which this article highlighted just five, it is perhaps not surprising - or it is precisely so in view of the imminent need - that there exists no comprehensive international or European legislation in the field of cybersecurity sensu strictu. ⁴⁵ W. von Heinegg, 'The Tallinn Manual and International Cyber Security Law', in T.

In recent years, attention did diversify away from cyberwarfare law, and i.e. the UN, EU, and certain national governments (through the means of National Cybersecurity Strategies) have devoted more attention to the issue. In the next section, the article will analyze the recent developments within the UN, with a specific focus to the work of the UN GGE. In the section thereafter, we will discuss the European NIS Directive. ## III United Nations A. The UN Group of Governmental Experts: paving the way for international cybersecurity law?",
        "12": "As discussed before, because of the nature of cyberspace, it was early on realized that cybersecurity demands for more than purely national regulation. Shortly after Edward Snowed changed the cybersecurity playing field, the UN GGE - established under the auspices of the First Committee of the UN General Assembly - published a report on 24 June 2013. The essence of the non-binding document is that it confirms that international law, and in particular the UN Charter, applies in cyberspace just like in the physical space.^[50]^ This includes the rules on state sovereignty and the principles resulting from the notion of sovereignty: for example, a State has jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure on its territory; and the State is responsible for international unlawful cyber acts that can be attributed to it.^[51]^ In its successive consensual report of 2015, the UN GGE put forward i.e. the following principles of the UN Charter and international law as applicable in cyberspace to state behavior: \"sovereignty, sovereign equality, peaceful conflict resolution, the prohibition of the use of or threat of violence against the territorial integrity or political independence of a State, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States\".^[52]^ This transposition to cyberspace of the basic principles of public international law, which almost all constitute binding customary law or have been confirmed by the International Court of Justice, is subject to a reasonable degree of agreement.^[53]^ As expressed before, the question is not really 'if' international law applies to cyberspace, but 'how', and importantly, whether it is translated efficiently and whether this suffices.^[54]^ ^[50] UN General Assembly, Report of Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the context of International Security, UN Doc. A/68/98, 24 June 2013, §19. ^[51] Ibid, §20. See also Rules 1-13 Tallinn Manual 2.0. ^[52] UN General Assembly, Report of Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the context of International Security, UN Doc. A/70/174, 22 July 2015, §28b. ^[53] A. Henriksen, 'The end of the road for the UN GGE process: The future regulation of cyberspace', 4. These fundamental principles are reiterated throughout the Tallinn Manual 2.0 as being 'black letter rules' applicable in cyberspace. ^[54] A. Henriksen, 'The end of the road for the UN GGE process: The future regulation of cyberspace', 2.",
        "13": "The 2013 and 2015 UN GGE reports are non-binding soft law.⁵⁵ In this logic, they reflect that international law applies in cyberspace and they serve as an important indicator.⁵⁶ After all, several States, including certain cyber superpowers, have confirmed this applicability in their comments to the UN GGE reports and in their national cyber security strategies. This applicability was equally confirmed by the G20 states in 2015.⁵⁷ At that point in time, the reports by the UN GGE could be seen as a sign of growing consensus on the matter, and in this sense as evidence of the development of *opinio juris*, which is one of the elements needed to eventually create binding customary international law (art. 38(1)(c) Statute of the International Court of Justice).⁵⁸ Especially in the domain of international cybersecurity law, the manifestation of *opinio juris* can be deemed as imperative if one wants to argue that there exists customary law⁵⁹, as practice on cybersecurity is for the larger part either classified or contradictory, and states have shown to be reluctant to openly declare if and how they regulate cyberspace.⁶⁰ One can find elements that inform *opinio juris* i.e. in reports prepared by international organizations, such as the UN GGE reports. Seeing how international cybersecurity law is still in a formative state, any expressed *opinio juris* displays aspirations rather than commitments⁶¹ – yet they are still of importance. Then, in June 2017, during the fifth meeting of the UN GGE, any meaningful manifestation of the development of *opinio juris* came to an abrupt end. Fundamental differences between the 25 members emerged, mainly on the issue of self-defence rights and on applying international humanitarian law to cyber conflicts. The Cuban delegation refused to recognize the explicit reference in the text to the applicability of self-defence rights in cyberspace. According to the delegation, this would “legitimize an ICT war”.⁶² The Americans interpreted this as undoing all earlier progress made within the UN GGE.⁶³ Geopolitics aside, note that the 2013 UN GGE report confirmed the applicability of the UN Charter to cyberspace, and with this *implicitly* article 51 UN Charter⁶⁴, ⁵⁵ K.

The Cuban, Russian and Chinese delegations suggested the creation of an entirely new set of international regulations and the creation of a UN General Assembly Working Group, open to all States, where ‘transparency, exclusivity and participation are central to discussion and decision-making’, ibid. ⁶³ O. Bowcott, ‘Dispute along cold war lines led to collapse of UN cyberwarfare talks’, *The Guardian* 23 August 2017, online available at https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/23/un-cyberwarfare-negotiations-collapsed-in-june-it-emerges (last accessed 12 November 2019). ⁶⁴ UN General Assembly, Report of Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the context of International Security, UN Doc. A/68/98, 24 June 2013, §19. 10 which constitutes the right to individual and collective self-defence of a State.⁶⁵ The 2015 UN GGE report did not explicitly stipulate that international humanitarian law applies to the cyber domain. The Cuban argument is thus not so much legal as it is political. At the end of the 2017 session, no consensus report was adopted. One cannot argue that the UN GGE 2013 and 2015 reports have become *opinio juris*, yet they still constitute an important indication of the applicability of international law to cyberspace, not only because the principal content of the reports has been reiterated by States on multiple occasions, but also precisely because the UN GGE reports restate the international *lex lata*.⁶⁶ The UN GGE is now, writing end of 2019, seemingly defunct⁶⁷: will there be a momentum to revive this exercise of diplomacy? ## IV. EU Network and Information Security Directive 2016",
        "14": "In parallel to, or following, the deadlock on cybersecurity law discussions on the international level, the European Union issued its first ever horizontal and legally binding instrument on cybersecurity *sensu strictu*, which aims to protect critical infrastructure (essential service providers and digital service providers) from cyber incidents that have a ‘significant disruptive effect’⁶⁸. The NIS Directive was issued in 2016 and had to be implemented in the different national legal orders. As HENRIKSEN professed, the deadlock within the UN GGE may lead to more regional initiatives with like-minded states, much like the European Directive we will now discuss.⁶⁹ The NIS Directive is an example of new rules being created after cybersecurity emerged as a policy problem, and not applying previously existing international law to a new context (e.g. UN GGE 2013 and 2015 reports and Tallinn Manual 2.0). Over the last few decades, critical infrastructure has become increasingly more reliant on the Internet, so that it is now essential “to our water, our power, our financial segment, our aviation industry and more”.⁷⁰ Note that the approach taken in the Directive is an “all hazards” ⁶⁵ Article 51 Charter of the United Nations and Statute of the International Court of Justice, signed in San Francisco on 26 June 1945, entered into force on 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS XVI. ⁶⁶ As does the Tallinn Manual 2.0. ⁶⁷ S. Soesanto and F. D'Incau, ‘The UN GGE is dead: Time to fall forward’. ⁶⁸ Art. 6 NIS Directive. ⁶⁹ In the wake of the 2017 UN GGE ‘failure’, US Homeland Security advisor Tim Bossart expressed that “it was now time to consider other approaches…and that the U.S. will work with smaller groups of likeminded partners”. See T. Bossart, Remarks at Cyber Week 2017, Tel Aviv, 26 June 2017, online available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-homeland-security-advisor-thomas-p-bossert-cyber-week-2017/ (last accessed 8 November 2019). Think for example of the efforts by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on the Code of Conduct for Information Security or the previously mentioned African Union Convention. According to Henriksen, the regionalization of cybersecurity regulation into legal sub-systems of varying normative depth is unfortunate, given the global nature of the Internet. Yet Henriksen also admits that there are advantages to a more regional approach to cyber regulation, such as avoiding time-consuming negotiations, the perspective of reaching agreement on complex issues rather than just on the low-hanging fruits, etc. See A. Henriksen, ‘The end of the road for the UN GGE process: The future regulation of cyberspace’, 6. ⁷⁰ Testimony of Admiral Michael Rogers, Hearing of the House Select Intelligence Committee, ‘Cybersecurity Threats: The Way Forward’, 20 November 2014 (Federal News Service Transcript). Other international organizations have equally raised awareness on the issue of cyber threats to critical infrastructure, see e.g. UN General Assembly, Report of Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the context of International Security, UN Doc. A/68/98, 24 June 2013, §9, 26(e), 30; C. Heinl, ‘Regional Cyber Security: Towards a Resilient ASEAN Cyber Security Regime’, RSIS Working Paper No. 263, 9 11 strategy⁷¹: to protect critical infrastructure from a range of cyber ‘incidents’⁷². The question addressed is whether networks are protected against incidents from any source; the Directive does not demarcate on the basis of the category of the threat (contrary to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, and the Tallinn Manual 2.0 rules on cyberwarfare operations in armed conflict). ## A. Objective and context",
        "15": "The EU launched a strategy for a digital single market in 2015; the NIS Directive, the General Data Protection Regulation (the famous 'GDPR')⁷³ and the eIDAS Regulation⁷⁴ all fall under this strategy. The primary objective of the NIS Directive is mentioned in the preparatory works: “to guarantee a high common level of network and IT security”.⁷⁵ One of the main reasons for the creation of the NIS directive was that some EU member states did not have cybersecurity legislation in place, and even when they did, there were large divergences among nations. This goal is important seeing how \"cyber incidents are increasing in size, frequency and complexity and can result in business inability to do their jobs, significant financial losses to the EU economy and a loss of welfare for society\".⁷⁶ The fact that the Directive imposes obligations on providers of digital services indicates that the European legislator is aware that cyber incidents today are September 2013, online available at https://www.rsis.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/rsis-pubs/WP263.pdf (last accessed 7 November 2019); Organization of American States, Critical Infrastructure Protection Programs: Cyber Security, online available at http://www.oas.org/en/sms/ ciche/programs_cyber.asp (last accessed 7 November 2019); Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Critical Information Infrastructures Protection, online available at http://www. oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/ciip.htm (last accessed 7 November 2019); M.

Note how the Shanghai Cooperation Organization went a step further than cooperation and awareness raising, and agreed in a treaty to cooperate on information security within critical infrastructures. The previously mentioned AU Convention obliges parties to undertake action to protect critical infrastructure. See Art. 3, Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of International Information Security, 16 June 2009, online available at https://ccdcoe-admin.aku.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SCO-090616-IISAgreement.pdf (unofficial English translation, last accessed 7 November 2019); Article 25(4) AU Convention on Cyber Security. ⁷¹ Termed by D.

        "16": "The NIS Directive is legally binding. It is not particularly difficult to explain why consensus on legally binding measures could be found within the EU on this topic, and why it has proved more difficult within the UN. Apart from the like-minded group argument (supra), the NIS Directive primarily creates measures to protect critical infrastructure; for the latter, the role of the formal legislator is still quite clearly defined.⁷⁸ Moreover, since there exists a manageable working definition of \"critical infrastructures\"⁷⁹ and since this concern has long been voiced within cybersecurity discussions⁸⁰, the NIS Directive ignores some of the obstacles mentioned in numbers 5-10. In addition to this, as a country's critical infrastructure is most often located within its territory (e.g. drink water systems, hospitals, railways)⁸¹, and thus within its jurisdiction, governments can in principle (to a certain extent) protect it without necessarily relying upon public international law.⁸²",
        "17": "Analyzing the NIS Directive is interesting, as the European legislator acknowledges the importance of imposing obligations upon the private sector. There are two entities onto which the Directives imposes obligations: the Member State government (1) and the private sector (2) (notably the providers of essential services mentioned in Annex II of the Directive and the providers of digital services mentioned in Annex II of the Directive). ⁷⁷ See supra, no 10. ⁷⁸ Supra, no 8. ⁷⁹ See art. 2(a) EU Directive 2008/114/EC of the Council of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection, adopted on 8 December 2008, entered into force January 2009, Pb.

        "18": "The NIS Directive imposes upon Member States obligations that can be summarized under the following three categories⁸³: 1) Each Member State must ensure a minimum national capacity by designating NIS competent authorities (Art. 8 NIS Directive), by setting up computer crisis teams ('Computer Emergency Response Teams' - CERTs or 'Computer Security Incident Response Teams' - CSIRTs (Art. 9) and national NIS strategies and cooperation plans (Art. 7)); 2) National competent authorities should work together within a network that allows secure and effective coordination, including coordinated information exchange, and detection and response at EU level. Member States must exchange information and collaborate through this network to tackle NIS threats and incidents on the basis of the European NIS cooperation plan (Art. 11); 3) One of the most important obligations for the Member State is to identify the providers of essential services (Art. 5). A culture of risk management shall be introduced and the private and public sectors shall exchange information with each other. C. Specific obligations for stakeholders in the private sector",
        "19": "The Directive focuses on two types of entities in the private sector (Articles 1, 4, 5, 14, 16): - the providers of essential services⁸⁴; - digital service providers.",
        "20": "In its Annex II, the NIS Directive specifies in a non-exhaustive way the sectors in which the Member States must search for the providers of essential services. These include the following sectors: banks, stock exchanges, transport and distribution of energy, air, rail and maritime transport, health, internet services and the government. Nuclear installations fall outside the scope of the Directive.⁸⁵",
        "21": "\"Digital service providers\", the second private sector entity onto which the Directive imposes obligations, should be understood as online marketplaces, online search engines and cloud computer services. These are exhaustively listed in Annex II of the Directive. Note that ⁸³ R. Roex, 'EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed', Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016. ⁸⁴ According to Article 5 (2) NIS Directive, providers of essential services are entities that 'provide services that are essential for the maintenance of critical social and / or economic activities, the provision of that service depending on network and information systems and in which in the event of an incident this would have significant disruptive effects on the provision of that service'. ⁸⁵ L. Lemmens, 'België werkt aan omzetting NIS-richtlijn voor uniforme beveiliging netwerk- en informatiesystemen', Commentary – Wolters Kluwer Online 22 November 2018. 14 during the legislative process, it was decided that many of the other suggested digital services were not critical enough.⁸⁶",
        "22": "The most important obligations for providers of essential services and providers of digital services can be summarized as follows⁸⁷: - take appropriate technical and organizational measures to manage NIS risks; - prepare and implement business continuity plans; - notify the competent authority or CSIRT of an incident that has a significant impact. What exactly constitutes a cyber incident with a ‘significant disruptive impact’ is thus quintessential to the implementation of the Directive, yet the meaning of the broad term is unclear at this stage⁸⁸, and it remains to be seen how this will be applied in practice. D. Territorial scope",
        "23": "Articles 5 and 18 of the NIS Directive clarify its territorial scope. For providers of essential services, each Member State where the provider has an establishment through which he offers essential services in that Member State will have jurisdiction. For digital service providers, this will be the Member State where the service provider has its headquarters and jurisdiction and its supervisory authority (one stop shop principle). If there are no headquarters in the EU, the provider or service provider must appoint a representative.⁸⁹ V. Conclusion",
        "24": "This article identified five factors underlying the difficult relationship between cybersecurity and international law. These are the speed at which global digitization is taking place as well as the nature of cyber operations (1), the fragmented jurisdiction and attribution problem (2), the question whether and to which extent the State and/or the private sector should have a regulatory role in cyberspace (3), whether transposing existing law onto the new technological context suffices, and (5) the phenomenon of 'cyber mania'. ⁸⁶ R. Roex, ‘EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed’, Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016. Under the NIS Directive, Member States are not required to identify digital service providers, allowing for a ‘catch-all approach’. See D. Markopoulou, V. Papakonstantinou and P. de Hert, ‘The new EU cybersecurity framework: The NIS Directive, ENISA’s role and the General Data Protection Regulation’, Computer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 2019, 4. ⁸⁷ Art. 14 and 16 NIS Directive. Affected Member States are informed when an incident has cross-border consequences. See also D. Markopoulou, V. Papakonstantinou and P. de Hert, ‘The new EU cybersecurity framework: The NIS Directive, ENISA’s role and the General Data Protection Regulation’, 5-6. R. Roex, ‘EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed’, Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016. ⁸⁸ Some guiding elements to determine what a ‘significant disruptive effect’ is, are mentioned in articles 6, 14 and 16 of the NIS Directive, as well as in its Preamble (27), (28), (38). ⁸⁹ Art. 5 and 18 NIS Directive; L. Lemmens, ‘België werkt aan omzetting NIS-richtlijn voor uniforme beveiliging netwerk- en informatiesystemen’, Commentary – Wolters Kluwer Online 22 November 2018; R. Roex, ‘EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed’, Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016. 15",
        "25": "These factors contribute to the difficulties facing the UN GGE. We have made clear that the diplomatic deadlock in which the UN GGE process finds itself goes back to a geopolitical argument rather than a legal one: it was the explicit reference in the 2017 text to the applicability of self-defence rights and humanitarian law in cyberspace that led to the end of the negotiations, even though the previous reports had implicitly done precisely that, by stating that the UN Charter and thus article 51, applies in cyberspace. This article has shown that the 2013 and 2015 UN GGE reports do not constitute opinio juris, yet they are an important indication of the applicability of international law to cyberspace, not only because States, including some cyber superpowers, reiterated this on multiple occasions, but also because the UN GGE reports restate the international lex lata. The UN GGE, as the Tallinn Manual 2.0, is thus a prime example of applying pre-existing law to a new technological context. Enter the EU NIS Directive in 2016. As HENRIKSEN points out, the inertia on the international level may lead to more regional initiatives with like-minded States. The NIS Directive is the first horizontal and legally binding EU instrument on cybersecurity. The fact that consensus on legally binding measures could be found is partially because the Directive focuses on the protection of critical infrastructure, a domain in which the role of the State as legislator is still quite clearly defined and necessary, of which there exists a working definition, which is a concern that has long been voiced, and seeing how critical infrastructure such as hospitals, drink water systems and railways (Annex II NIS Directive) are usually located within the territory and thus jurisdiction of a State. Interestingly, the NIS Directive shows awareness of a changing, more complex and diverse cybersecurity landscape, by imposing obligations upon two entities in the private sector. Moreover, this testifies that the European legislator acknowledges that cybersecurity cannot be adequately guaranteed without involving the private sector. However, the fact that consensus on legally binding measures on the topic could be found, does not mean that the EU NIS Directive is a success: it remains to be seen how the nation States will interpret a 'cyber incident with a significant disruptive impact', without which the obligations of the Directive are meaningless. In that sense, one currently cannot overstate the success of the NIS Directive and inversely overstate the failure of the UN GGE: the latter made clear that international law does apply to state behavior in cyberspace, which indeed offers the necessary starting point.⁹⁰ Europe has less cyber superpowers around the table than does the UN GGE, and it may be likely that State actors in the latter forum are guilty of \"fence sitting\": on the international level, cyber superpowers and other nations may want to wait and see \"where the technology is going\", or because it is in the interest of their flexibility to \"maintain the current legal uncertainties\".⁹¹ ⁹⁰ A. Henriksen, ‘The end of the road for the UN GGE process: The future regulation of cyberspace’, 8. ⁹¹ A. Henriksen, ‘The end of the road for the UN GGE process: The future regulation of cyberspace’, 5. 16 We know that international law applies in cyberspace ('if') – although it would be difficult to argue that the support for this principle has become opinio juris – and while the NIS Directive wanted to answer 'how' law applies in cyberspace, the question remains, depending on the factual interpretation of a 'significant disruptive impact'. 17"

Specific regional instruments dedicated to cybercrime as such are the Council of Europe’s Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and the African Union’s Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection. See Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime of 23 November 2001, entered into force on 01 July 2004, ETS no 185; African Union, Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection 27 June 2014, entered into force 3 June 2019, online available at https://au.int/sites/default/files/treaties/29560-treaty-0048_-_african_union_convention_on_cyber_security_and_personal_data_protection_e.pdf (last accessed 11 November 2019).",

One cannot argue that the UN GGE 2013 and 2015 reports have become *opinio juris*, yet they still constitute an important indication of the applicability of international law to cyberspace, not only because the principal content of the reports has been reiterated by States on multiple occasions, but also precisely because the UN GGE reports restate the international *lex lata*.⁶⁶ The UN GGE is now, writing end of 2019, seemingly defunct⁶⁷: will there be a momentum to revive this exercise of diplomacy?",

To date, however, cybersecurity has generated very little international law. How can this be explained? The article examines the factors underlying the difficult marriage between public international law and the high-tech phenomenon of cyberspace. What can or should the role of the State and/or the private sector in regulating cyberspace be? Should the international level create new laws to regulate cybersecurity or should the existing international legal principles simply be transposed to the new technological context? Today, it has become clear that the vast majority of cyber incidents do not reach the threshold of 'armed attack' in the sense of article 51 of the UN Charter. In reaction, we see that certain international organizations and nation States launched efforts to better protect cybersecurity sensu strictu. In this article, we focus on recent efforts within the UN and the EU. Notably, the article will answer whether the efforts to apply existing international law to cyberspace, undertaken by the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the Context of International Security, suffice. Why did the fifth round of negotiations among the Expert Group fail in 2017, and will there be another momentum to revive this diplomatic exercise? Zooming in on the protection of critical infrastructure specifically, how does the first horizontal and legally binding EU Directive on Network and Information Security (2016) fit in the worldwide effort to better regulate cybersecurity? This is interesting, as the Directive shows awareness of the diverse and complex nature of cybersecurity by imposing binding obligations upon the providers of essential services and digital providers.\nI Introduction\n1. Over the first two decades of this millennium, the risks flowing from each of the many clicks we perform every day became increasingly clear. Cybersecurity has entered the realm of foreign policy: think of the Stuxnet cyberattack by the U.S. and Israel that targeted Iranian\n Anne Verhelst is PhD Researcher in International Law at the Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies and the Institute for International Law, KU Leuven, Belgium. Anne holds a four-year fellowship of the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO).\nnuclear facilities in 2010; think of the cyberattacks that paralyzed Estonian government services in 2007, and think of how the Wall Street Journal just this August reported that Iranian hackers are suspected to have pervaded critical infrastructure and government computers in Bahrein. These cyber threats emanating from State (and other) sources have over recent years brought about efforts to render critical infrastructure more resilient. A few initiatives of which we will highlight in this article. Yet, cybersecurity as a policy concern has generated very little international law up to now.\nA straightforward reason that partially explains this inertia, is that the scope, nature, meaning and terminology of cybersecurity is unclear. There is little general agreement about what cybersecurity entails, and it seems that individual people use the term differently, depending on the context. This article will depart from a concept of cybersecurity sensu strictu. In that view, cybersecurity shall mean \"the security of network and information systems; the ability of network and information systems to withstand, with a certain degree of confidence, actions that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored, transmitted or processed data or the related services provided or accessible through those network and information systems\". This article thus applies a concept of cybersecurity excluding a focus\n\nAs the NIS Directive aims to protect critical infrastructure against cyber incidents, this article will pay specific attention to threats directed at critical infrastructure, rather than focusing on cyberattacks against the data of private people, against companies (when it has no larger societal effect), etc. Moreover, in this article we exclusively discuss the international regulatory level as viewed by a nation’s perspective, to which cybersecurity can be summarized and clarified to mean the “ability to protect itself and its institutions against cyber threats”.\n2. The purpose of this article is to bring together, analyze and clarify where necessary the most important recent developments in cybersecurity law and initiatives within the United Nations (hereinafter: ‘UN’) and European Union (hereinafter: ‘EU’). The questions addressed in this article are the following. First, on a more abstract level, we will discuss whether international law can adequately regulate issues of cybersecurity. Are there any impediments that law places on the cyber domain (if so, which ones)? And vice versa, can the high-tech phenomenon of cybersecurity be embedded in international law? (Title II) The article then analyzes the most important legal, regulatory, and soft law developments in the field of cybersecurity within the UN, with specific attention paid to the work by the Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the Context\n Cybercrime can be defined as ‘a criminal activity in which computers or computer networks are the principal means of committing an offense’. Examples include cyber-theft, cyber-trespass, cyber-obscenity, and cyber-extortions. In section IV of this article, we will analyze the European Network and Information Security Directive (2016), which aims to protect critical infrastructure from cyber incidents. Note that some authors and instruments categorize cyberattacks against critical infrastructure under ‘cybercrime’. See N. Kshetri, ‘Global Cybersecurity: Key Issues and Concepts’, 3 and N. Kshetri, ‘Positive externality, increasing returns and the rise in cybercrimes’, Communications of the ACM 2009, 141–144. In this article, we will discuss the European Directive as aiming to protect critical infrastructure, regardless of whether a cyberattack against such infrastructure should be seen as falling under a strict definition of ‘cybercrime’. Specific regional instruments dedicated to cybercrime as such are the Council of Europe’s Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and the African Union’s Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection. See Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime of 23 November 2001, entered into force on 01 July 2004, ETS no 185; African Union, Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection 27 June 2014, entered into force 3 June 2019, online available at https://au.int/sites/default/files/treaties/29560-treaty-0048_-_african_union_convention_on_cyber_security_and_personal_data_protection_e.pdf (last accessed 11 November 2019).\n E.g. D. Fidler, ‘Wither the Web: International Law, Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’, Georgetown Journal of International Affairs 2015, 10-11.\n E.g. Rules 20-95 Tallinn Manual 2.0 in M. Schmitt et al., Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2017.\n We will see in this article that multiple initiatives that try to regulate cybersecurity only address a small portion of the broader legal framework, such as the protection of critical infrastructure (e.g. EU NIS Directive), data protection online (e.g. the famous European GDPR Directive), cyber warfare (e.g. the Tallinn Manual 2.0), and thus the definition or concept of cybersecurity used (if explicitly done so) often varies according to the specific legal domain one tries to capture. See J. Kosseff, ‘Defining Cybersecurity Law’, 985.\n In this article, \"critical infrastructure\" is understood as referred to in the NIS Directive. See infra, footnote 75.\n N.

The conclusion of the article stipulates some forward-looking comments (Title V).\n## II Cybersecurity and international law: irreconcilable?\n3. First and foremost, it should be clear that there is a broad understanding that international law applies in cyberspace to state behavior. This is to say, the rules developed before cybersecurity became a prominent (policy) problem. The same international legal norms that govern the physical space are applicable in cyberspace: the core question is thus not “if” international law applies to cyberspace, but rather “how” it does. How to efficiently translate the pre-cyber existing international law to cyberspace is difficult, which can be explained by certain factors scrutinized right below.\n### A. Factors explaining the uneasy marriage between international law and cybersecurity\n4. Law as a system is no stranger to try and regulate rapid technological evolutions, be it developments in outer space, on the high seas, in the data collection domain, artificial intelligence, etc. This is equally so for cyberspace. The uneasy marriage between international law and cybersecurity can be explained by the intrinsic properties of both phenomena.\n In its 2013 Consensual Report (UN Doc. A/68/98, §19) and 2015 Consensual Report (UN Doc. A/70/174, §24), the UN GGE confirmed the applicability of international law, including the UN Charter, in cyberspace. Several States have already confirmed this position in their comments to these reports and in their national cyber defence and security strategies. The G20 states also confirmed this in 2015 (G20 Summit Communiqué, Antalya, 15-16 November 2015). See UN General Assembly, Report of the Secretary-General on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (Addendum), UN Doc.

The digitization of the world is taking place at an unparalleled pace. It is expected that by 2020 there will be more than 20 billion connected devices. In contrast to how the international regulator in the last century was able to respond in a timely manner to certain evolutions, such as the international law of the sea concept 'exclusive economic zone' (EEZ) and the protection of the seabed as 'common heritage of mankind', the cyber revolution is often said to be so fast and unpredictable that international law-making has difficulties catching up.\n2° Territoriality, sovereignty, fragmentation of jurisdiction and attribution\n6. It has become evident that the current global challenges cannot be adequately addressed by one single actor. Whether one thinks of climate change, international terrorism or cyber threats, international law offers a framework for international co-operation. Now let it be the case that the core concept on which international law is based, that of state sovereignty, does not effortlessly fit in cyberspace. Although there is agreement that the principle of state sovereignty (UN Charter) applies in cyberspace, there is no one State that can claim sovereignty over the entire cyberspace. The reason being that the many cyber infrastructures that make up cyberspace are located in different sovereign territories, and in international law, territoriality allocates jurisdiction. Nonetheless, this off and on fragmentation of jurisdiction should not be a reason to give up on regulating cybersecurity all together, we agree with TRACHTMAN, since after all, (cyber)conduct still occurs in a certain territory and effects are still felt in a certain territory. Issues that transcend territorial jurisdiction are not new whatsoever to international law (e.g. the law of the high seas, outer space, climate change). The challenge here is linked to the attribution problem, understood as the difficulty to determine\n K.

A third factor that underlies the difficult relationship between cybersecurity and international law is the question of the (extent of the) regulatory role of the State versus that of the private sector in cyberspace. The alternatively controlled nature of cyberspace is the reason this debate exists: cyberspace is a domain in which industry and the private sector play a/the pivotal role. The private sector governs cyberspace in an informal fashion, leaving less room for the formal legislator (the nation State). This informal governance is reminiscent of the *lex mercatoria*, the private economic law of the Middle Ages, according to HOISINGTON. The question is then to what extent the State must or can impose legal obligations on the private sector in regulating cybersecurity. Vice versa, to what extent can cybersecurity regulation be effective if the private sector is not involved in its preparation and implementation?\nThe discussion about the role of the State as legislator in cyberspace is prevalent: on the one hand one can argue that the nation State has the (moral) obligation to enact legislation that regulates or restricts the private sector in its cyber activities. The argument here is that the State has to uphold binding obligations under international law, such as the protection of human rights, international peace and security, the customary 'no harm' principle, the protection of critical infrastructures and more. These obligations can then only be (practically) guaranteed in the cyber domain if rights and obligations are imposed on private actors.\n---\n N.

Kittichaisaree, ‘Future Prospects of Public International Law of Cyberspace’, 335-352.\n\n8. We agree that these two opposing sides should not be seen as an and/or question: whether and to which extent the State should have a regulatory role in cyberspace has to depend on the specific conduct one wishes to regulate. The “institutional choice may begin with determining whether the issue at stake is best taken on by the market, by private firms, by the State government, or by international law”. When we will discuss the NIS Directive under section IV, it will become evident that the role of the State in protecting critical infrastructure (from cyber incidents) is still quite clear, uncontroversial and moreover necessary, as the State disposes of the necessary information, tools, legal framework and legitimate measures to do so. Interestingly, the NIS Directive imposes binding obligations onto certain entities in the private sector, acknowledging that cyberspace is a domain in which cooperation between the State and private actors is more than often necessary.\n4° Applying existing law versus creating new law\n9. Is it sufficient to apply existing international law to the cyber domain, or should the international community create new rules specifically designed to address this challenge? Three suggestions prevail:\n\n\"(1) Cybersecurity should be addressed by using existing rules and existing structures under international law;\n(2) Cyberspace is a fundamentally unique concept that requires a whole new set of rules and legal structures;\n(3) Existing law can include the challenge of cybersecurity, but in order to be effective and efficient, those elements that are incompatible with the uniqueness of cyberspace need to be set aside\".\nWhat has been done so far on the international plane can largely be placed under option 1: the UN GGE has declared that international law, including the UN Charter, applies to cyberspace, whereas the Tallinn Manual 2.0 transposes basic concepts of international law to cyberspace in general (notably Rules 1-24), and further on in the book to cyberwarfare.\n## 5° 'Cyber Mania'\n10. Cyber mania is another phenomenon that complicates the relationship between international law and cybersecurity. While the international developments in the field of cybersecurity sensu strictu have been limited, a considerable amount of academic attention and policy interest has been paid to the specific issue of 'cyberwarfare law'. According to O' CONNELL, it were the highly mediatized cyberattacks that took place in the 00's (Estonia 2007; Russo-Georgian conflict 2008; Stuxnet 2010) that created this militarized image of cybersecurity law. However, the majority of cyber incidents do not reach the threshold of 'armed attack' in the sense of article 51 of the UN Charter. In reality, cyber threats are more complex and diverse in nature, and they often target private companies. Recent legislation, such as the European NIS Directive (which aims to protect providers of essential services and digital services such as online marketplaces) shows awareness of this more complex cyber reality, which we agree cannot be reduced to international war terms.\n## B. Interim conclusion\n11. Given these multiple challenges, of which this article highlighted just five, it is perhaps not surprising - or it is precisely so in view of the imminent need - that there exists no comprehensive international or European legislation in the field of cybersecurity sensu strictu.\n W. von Heinegg, 'The Tallinn Manual and International Cyber Security Law', in T.

In the next section, the article will analyze the recent developments within the UN, with a specific focus to the work of the UN GGE. In the section thereafter, we will discuss the European NIS Directive.\n## III United Nations\nA. The UN Group of Governmental Experts: paving the way for international cybersecurity law?\n12. As discussed before, because of the nature of cyberspace, it was early on realized that cybersecurity demands for more than purely national regulation. Shortly after Edward Snowed changed the cybersecurity playing field, the UN GGE - established under the auspices of the First Committee of the UN General Assembly - published a report on 24 June 2013. The essence of the non-binding document is that it confirms that international law, and in particular the UN Charter, applies in cyberspace just like in the physical space.^[50]^ This includes the rules on state sovereignty and the principles resulting from the notion of sovereignty: for example, a State has jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure on its territory; and the State is responsible for international unlawful cyber acts that can be attributed to it.^[51]^\nIn its successive consensual report of 2015, the UN GGE put forward i.e. the following principles of the UN Charter and international law as applicable in cyberspace to state behavior: \"sovereignty, sovereign equality, peaceful conflict resolution, the prohibition of the use of or threat of violence against the territorial integrity or political independence of a State, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States\".^[52]^ This transposition to cyberspace of the basic principles of public international law, which almost all constitute binding customary law or have been confirmed by the International Court of Justice, is subject to a reasonable degree of agreement.^[53]^ As expressed before, the question is not really 'if' international law applies to cyberspace, but 'how', and importantly, whether it is translated efficiently and whether this suffices.^[54]^\n^[50] UN General Assembly, Report of Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the context of International Security, UN Doc.

Henriksen, 'The end of the road for the UN GGE process: The future regulation of cyberspace', 2.\n13. The 2013 and 2015 UN GGE reports are non-binding soft law. In this logic, they reflect that international law applies in cyberspace and they serve as an important indicator. After all, several States, including certain cyber superpowers, have confirmed this applicability in their comments to the UN GGE reports and in their national cyber security strategies. This applicability was equally confirmed by the G20 states in 2015. At that point in time, the reports by the UN GGE could be seen as a sign of growing consensus on the matter, and in this sense as evidence of the development of *opinio juris*, which is one of the elements needed to eventually create binding customary international law (art. 38(1)(c) Statute of the International Court of Justice). Especially in the domain of international cybersecurity law, the manifestation of *opinio juris* can be deemed as imperative if one wants to argue that there exists customary law, as practice on cybersecurity is for the larger part either classified or contradictory, and states have shown to be reluctant to openly declare if and how they regulate cyberspace. One can find elements that inform *opinio juris* i.e. in reports prepared by international organizations, such as the UN GGE reports. Seeing how international cybersecurity law is still in a formative state, any expressed *opinio juris* displays aspirations rather than commitments – yet they are still of importance. Then, in June 2017, during the fifth meeting of the UN GGE, any meaningful manifestation of the development of *opinio juris* came to an abrupt end. Fundamental differences between the 25 members emerged, mainly on the issue of self-defence rights and on applying international humanitarian law to cyber conflicts. The Cuban delegation refused to recognize the explicit reference in the text to the applicability of self-defence rights in cyberspace. According to the delegation, this would “legitimize an ICT war”. The Americans interpreted this as undoing all earlier progress made within the UN GGE.

In parallel to, or following, the deadlock on cybersecurity law discussions on the international level, the European Union issued its first ever horizontal and legally binding instrument on cybersecurity *sensu strictu*, which aims to protect critical infrastructure (essential service providers and digital service providers) from cyber incidents that have a ‘significant disruptive effect’. The NIS Directive was issued in 2016 and had to be implemented in the different national legal orders. As HENRIKSEN professed, the deadlock within the UN GGE may lead to more regional initiatives with like-minded states, much like the European Directive we will now discuss. The NIS Directive is an example of new rules being created after cybersecurity emerged as a policy problem, and not applying previously existing international law to a new context (e.g. UN GGE 2013 and 2015 reports and Tallinn Manual 2.0).\nOver the last few decades, critical infrastructure has become increasingly more reliant on the Internet, so that it is now essential “to our water, our power, our financial segment, our aviation industry and more”. Note that the approach taken in the Directive is an “all hazards”\n Article 51 Charter of the United Nations and Statute of the International Court of Justice, signed in San Francisco on 26 June 1945, entered into force on 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS XVI.\n As does the Tallinn Manual 2.0.\n S.

D'Incau, ‘The UN GGE is dead: Time to fall forward’.\n Art. 6 NIS Directive.\n In the wake of the 2017 UN GGE ‘failure’, US Homeland Security advisor Tim Bossart expressed that “it was now time to consider other approaches…and that the U.S. will work with smaller groups of likeminded partners”. See T. Bossart, Remarks at Cyber Week 2017, Tel Aviv, 26 June 2017, online available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-homeland-security-advisor-thomas-p-bossert-cyber-week-2017/ (last accessed 8 November 2019). Think for example of the efforts by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on the Code of Conduct for Information Security or the previously mentioned African Union Convention. According to Henriksen, the regionalization of cybersecurity regulation into legal sub-systems of varying normative depth is unfortunate, given the global nature of the Internet. Yet Henriksen also admits that there are advantages to a more regional approach to cyber regulation, such as avoiding time-consuming negotiations, the perspective of reaching agreement on complex issues rather than just on the low-hanging fruits, etc. See A. Henriksen, ‘The end of the road for the UN GGE process: The future regulation of cyberspace’, 6.\n Testimony of Admiral Michael Rogers, Hearing of the House Select Intelligence Committee, ‘Cybersecurity Threats: The Way Forward’, 20 November 2014 (Federal News Service Transcript). Other international organizations have equally raised awareness on the issue of cyber threats to critical infrastructure, see e.g. UN General Assembly, Report of Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the context of International Security, UN Doc. A/68/98, 24 June 2013, §9, 26(e), 30; C. Heinl, ‘Regional Cyber Security: Towards a Resilient ASEAN Cyber Security Regime’, RSIS Working Paper No. 263, 9\n\n## A. Objective and context\n15. The EU launched a strategy for a digital single market in 2015; the NIS Directive, the General Data Protection Regulation (the famous 'GDPR') and the eIDAS Regulation all fall under this strategy.\nThe primary objective of the NIS Directive is mentioned in the preparatory works: “to guarantee a high common level of network and IT security”. One of the main reasons for the creation of the NIS directive was that some EU member states did not have cybersecurity legislation in place, and even when they did, there were large divergences among nations. This goal is important seeing how \"cyber incidents are increasing in size, frequency and complexity and can result in business inability to do their jobs, significant financial losses to the EU economy and a loss of welfare for society\". The fact that the Directive imposes obligations on providers of digital services indicates that the European legislator is aware that cyber incidents today are\nSeptember 2013, online available at https://www.rsis.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/rsis-pubs/WP263.pdf (last accessed 7 November 2019); Organization of American States, Critical Infrastructure Protection Programs: Cyber Security, online available at http://www.oas.org/en/sms/ ciche/programs_cyber.asp (last accessed 7 November 2019); Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Critical Information Infrastructures Protection, online available at http://www. oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/ciip.htm (last accessed 7 November 2019); M.

Note how the Shanghai Cooperation Organization went a step further than cooperation and awareness raising, and agreed in a treaty to cooperate on information security within critical infrastructures. The previously mentioned AU Convention obliges parties to undertake action to protect critical infrastructure. See Art. 3, Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of International Information Security, 16 June 2009, online available at https://ccdcoe-admin.aku.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SCO-090616-IISAgreement.pdf (unofficial English translation, last accessed 7 November 2019); Article 25(4) AU Convention on Cyber Security.\n Termed by D.

The NIS Directive is legally binding. It is not particularly difficult to explain why consensus on legally binding measures could be found within the EU on this topic, and why it has proved more difficult within the UN. Apart from the like-minded group argument (supra), the NIS Directive primarily creates measures to protect critical infrastructure; for the latter, the role of the formal legislator is still quite clearly defined. Moreover, since there exists a manageable working definition of \"critical infrastructures\" and since this concern has long been voiced within cybersecurity discussions, the NIS Directive ignores some of the obstacles mentioned in numbers 5-10. In addition to this, as a country's critical infrastructure is most often located within its territory (e.g. drink water systems, hospitals, railways), and thus within its jurisdiction, governments can in principle (to a certain extent) protect it without necessarily relying upon public international law.\n17. Analyzing the NIS Directive is interesting, as the European legislator acknowledges the importance of imposing obligations upon the private sector. There are two entities onto which the Directives imposes obligations: the Member State government (1) and the private sector (2) (notably the providers of essential services mentioned in Annex II of the Directive and the providers of digital services mentioned in Annex II of the Directive).\n See supra, no 10.\n Supra, no 8.\n See art. 2(a) EU Directive 2008/114/EC of the Council of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection, adopted on 8 December 2008, entered into force January 2009, Pb.

Fidler, 'Wither the Web: International Law, Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection', 9-10.\n\n18. The NIS Directive imposes upon Member States obligations that can be summarized under the following three categories:\n1) Each Member State must ensure a minimum national capacity by designating NIS competent authorities (Art. 8 NIS Directive), by setting up computer crisis teams ('Computer Emergency Response Teams' - CERTs or 'Computer Security Incident Response Teams' - CSIRTs (Art. 9) and national NIS strategies and cooperation plans (Art. 7));\n2) National competent authorities should work together within a network that allows secure and effective coordination, including coordinated information exchange, and detection and response at EU level. Member States must exchange information and collaborate through this network to tackle NIS threats and incidents on the basis of the European NIS cooperation plan (Art. 11);\n3) One of the most important obligations for the Member State is to identify the providers of essential services (Art. 5). A culture of risk management shall be introduced and the private and public sectors shall exchange information with each other.\nC. Specific obligations for stakeholders in the private sector\n19. The Directive focuses on two types of entities in the private sector (Articles 1, 4, 5, 14, 16):\n- the providers of essential services;\n- digital service providers.\n20. In its Annex II, the NIS Directive specifies in a non-exhaustive way the sectors in which the Member States must search for the providers of essential services. These include the following sectors: banks, stock exchanges, transport and distribution of energy, air, rail and maritime transport, health, internet services and the government. Nuclear installations fall outside the scope of the Directive.\n21. \"Digital service providers\", the second private sector entity onto which the Directive imposes obligations, should be understood as online marketplaces, online search engines and cloud computer services. These are exhaustively listed in Annex II of the Directive. Note that\n R. Roex, 'EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed', Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016.\n According to Article 5 (2) NIS Directive, providers of essential services are entities that 'provide services that are essential for the maintenance of critical social and / or economic activities, the provision of that service depending on network and information systems and in which in the event of an incident this would have significant disruptive effects on the provision of that service'.\n L. Lemmens, 'België werkt aan omzetting NIS-richtlijn voor uniforme beveiliging netwerk- en informatiesystemen', Commentary – Wolters Kluwer Online 22 November 2018.\n\n22. The most important obligations for providers of essential services and providers of digital services can be summarized as follows:\n- take appropriate technical and organizational measures to manage NIS risks;\n- prepare and implement business continuity plans;\n- notify the competent authority or CSIRT of an incident that has a significant impact.\nWhat exactly constitutes a cyber incident with a ‘significant disruptive impact’ is thus quintessential to the implementation of the Directive, yet the meaning of the broad term is unclear at this stage, and it remains to be seen how this will be applied in practice.\nD. Territorial scope\n23. Articles 5 and 18 of the NIS Directive clarify its territorial scope. For providers of essential services, each Member State where the provider has an establishment through which he offers essential services in that Member State will have jurisdiction. For digital service providers, this will be the Member State where the service provider has its headquarters and jurisdiction and its supervisory authority (one stop shop principle). If there are no headquarters in the EU, the provider or service provider must appoint a representative.\nV. Conclusion\n24. This article identified five factors underlying the difficult relationship between cybersecurity and international law. These are the speed at which global digitization is taking place as well as the nature of cyber operations (1), the fragmented jurisdiction and attribution problem (2), the question whether and to which extent the State and/or the private sector should have a regulatory role in cyberspace (3), whether transposing existing law onto the new technological context suffices, and (5) the phenomenon of 'cyber mania'.\n R. Roex, ‘EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed’, Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016. Under the NIS Directive, Member States are not required to identify digital service providers, allowing for a ‘catch-all approach’. See D. Markopoulou, V. Papakonstantinou and P. de Hert, ‘The new EU cybersecurity framework: The NIS Directive, ENISA’s role and the General Data Protection Regulation’, Computer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 2019, 4.\n Art. 14 and 16 NIS Directive. Affected Member States are informed when an incident has cross-border consequences. See also D. Markopoulou, V. Papakonstantinou and P. de Hert, ‘The new EU cybersecurity framework: The NIS Directive, ENISA’s role and the General Data Protection Regulation’, 5-6. R. Roex, ‘EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed’, Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016.\n Some guiding elements to determine what a ‘significant disruptive effect’ is, are mentioned in articles 6, 14 and 16 of the NIS Directive, as well as in its Preamble (27), (28), (38).\n Art. 5 and 18 NIS Directive; L. Lemmens, ‘België werkt aan omzetting NIS-richtlijn voor uniforme beveiliging netwerk- en informatiesystemen’, Commentary – Wolters Kluwer Online 22 November 2018; R. Roex, ‘EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed’, Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016.\n\nEnter the EU NIS Directive in 2016. As HENRIKSEN points out, the inertia on the international level may lead to more regional initiatives with like-minded States. The NIS Directive is the first horizontal and legally binding EU instrument on cybersecurity. The fact that consensus on legally binding measures could be found is partially because the Directive focuses on the protection of critical infrastructure, a domain in which the role of the State as legislator is still quite clearly defined and necessary, of which there exists a working definition, which is a concern that has long been voiced, and seeing how critical infrastructure such as hospitals, drink water systems and railways (Annex II NIS Directive) are usually located within the territory and thus jurisdiction of a State. Interestingly, the NIS Directive shows awareness of a changing, more complex and diverse cybersecurity landscape, by imposing obligations upon two entities in the private sector. Moreover, this testifies that the European legislator acknowledges that cybersecurity cannot be adequately guaranteed without involving the private sector. However, the fact that consensus on legally binding measures on the topic could be found, does not mean that the EU NIS Directive is a success: it remains to be seen how the nation States will interpret a 'cyber incident with a significant disruptive impact', without which the obligations of the Directive are meaningless. In that sense, one currently cannot overstate the success of the NIS Directive and inversely overstate the failure of the UN GGE: the latter made clear that international law does apply to state behavior in cyberspace, which indeed offers the necessary starting point. Europe has less cyber superpowers around the table than does the UN GGE, and it may be likely that State actors in the latter forum are guilty of \"fence sitting\": on the international level, cyber superpowers and other nations may want to wait and see \"where the technology is going\", or because it is in the interest of their flexibility to \"maintain the current legal uncertainties\".\n A.

To date, however, cybersecurity has generated very little international law. How can this be explained? The article examines the factors underlying the difficult marriage between public international law and the high-tech phenomenon of cyberspace. What can or should the role of the State and/or the private sector in regulating cyberspace be? Should the international level create new laws to regulate cybersecurity or should the existing international legal principles simply be transposed to the new technological context? Today, it has become clear that the vast majority of cyber incidents do not reach the threshold of 'armed attack' in the sense of article 51 of the UN Charter. In reaction, we see that certain international organizations and nation States launched efforts to better protect cybersecurity sensu strictu. In this article, we focus on recent efforts within the UN and the EU. Notably, the article will answer whether the efforts to apply existing international law to cyberspace, undertaken by the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the Context of International Security, suffice. Why did the fifth round of negotiations among the Expert Group fail in 2017, and will there be another momentum to revive this diplomatic exercise? Zooming in on the protection of critical infrastructure specifically, how does the first horizontal and legally binding EU Directive on Network and Information Security (2016) fit in the worldwide effort to better regulate cybersecurity? This is interesting, as the Directive shows awareness of the diverse and complex nature of cybersecurity by imposing binding obligations upon the providers of essential services and digital providers.\nI Introduction\n1. Over the first two decades of this millennium, the risks flowing from each of the many clicks we perform every day became increasingly clear. Cybersecurity has entered the realm of foreign policy: think of the Stuxnet cyberattack by the U.S. and Israel that targeted Iranian\n¹ Anne Verhelst is PhD Researcher in International Law at the Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies and the Institute for International Law, KU Leuven, Belgium. Anne holds a four-year fellowship of the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO).\nnuclear facilities in 2010²; think of the cyberattacks that paralyzed Estonian government services in 2007³, and think of how the Wall Street Journal just this August reported that Iranian hackers are suspected to have pervaded critical infrastructure and government computers in Bahrein.⁴ These cyber threats emanating from State (and other) sources have over recent years brought about efforts to render critical infrastructure more resilient. A few initiatives of which we will highlight in this article. Yet, cybersecurity as a policy concern has generated very little international law up to now.\nA straightforward reason that partially explains this inertia, is that the scope, nature, meaning and terminology of cybersecurity is unclear.⁵ There is little general agreement about what cybersecurity entails, and it seems that individual people use the term differently, depending on the context.⁶ This article will depart from a concept of cybersecurity sensu strictu. In that view, cybersecurity shall mean \"the security of network and information systems; the ability of network and information systems to withstand, with a certain degree of confidence, actions that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored, transmitted or processed data or the related services provided or accessible through those network and information systems\".⁷ This article thus applies a concept of cybersecurity excluding a focus\n2 M.

Futter, 'Cyber semantics: why we should retire the latest buzzword in security studies', Journal of Cyber Policy 2018, 202. The terminological vagueness is not without practical impact: the definition of cybersecurity in a given context is after all contingent upon what and who is being deterred, how, and whether the attribution of capabilities is possible. The vague language means that it can be unclear who should take responsibility for ensuring cybersecurity, leading to various legal and practical obstacles in regulating the issue. See A. Futter, ibid., 209; J. Nye, 'Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace', International Security 2016-17, 68.\n6 A. Futter, ibid., 205; J.

Bashroush and J. Wall, 'Towards a More Representative Definition of Cyber Security', The Journal of Digital Forensics, Security and Law 2017, 53-57.\n7 Art. 4.2 EU Directive 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union, adopted on 6 July 2016, entered into force August 2016, OJ L 194, 1-30.\n2\non the specific threats of cybercrime⁸, cyber terrorism⁹ and cyber warfare¹⁰,¹¹ We opt for this definition as it originates in article 4.2 of the European Network and Information Security Directive (2016) (hereinafter: ‘NIS Directive’), which will form a large part of this study.\nAs the NIS Directive aims to protect critical infrastructure against cyber incidents, this article will pay specific attention to threats directed at critical infrastructure¹², rather than focusing on cyberattacks against the data of private people, against companies (when it has no larger societal effect), etc. Moreover, in this article we exclusively discuss the international regulatory level as viewed by a nation’s perspective, to which cybersecurity can be summarized and clarified to mean the “ability to protect itself and its institutions against cyber threats”.¹³\n2. The purpose of this article is to bring together, analyze and clarify where necessary the most important recent developments in cybersecurity law and initiatives within the United Nations (hereinafter: ‘UN’) and European Union (hereinafter: ‘EU’). The questions addressed in this article are the following. First, on a more abstract level, we will discuss whether international law can adequately regulate issues of cybersecurity. Are there any impediments that law places on the cyber domain (if so, which ones)? And vice versa, can the high-tech phenomenon of cybersecurity be embedded in international law? (Title II) The article then analyzes the most important legal, regulatory, and soft law developments in the field of cybersecurity within the UN, with specific attention paid to the work by the Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the Context\n⁸ Cybercrime can be defined as ‘a criminal activity in which computers or computer networks are the principal means of committing an offense’. Examples include cyber-theft, cyber-trespass, cyber-obscenity, and cyber-extortions. In section IV of this article, we will analyze the European Network and Information Security Directive (2016), which aims to protect critical infrastructure from cyber incidents. Note that some authors and instruments categorize cyberattacks against critical infrastructure under ‘cybercrime’. See N. Kshetri, ‘Global Cybersecurity: Key Issues and Concepts’, 3 and N. Kshetri, ‘Positive externality, increasing returns and the rise in cybercrimes’, Communications of the ACM 2009, 141–144. In this article, we will discuss the European Directive as aiming to protect critical infrastructure, regardless of whether a cyberattack against such infrastructure should be seen as falling under a strict definition of ‘cybercrime’. Specific regional instruments dedicated to cybercrime as such are the Council of Europe’s Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and the African Union’s Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection. See Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime of 23 November 2001, entered into force on 01 July 2004, ETS no 185; African Union, Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection 27 June 2014, entered into force 3 June 2019, online available at https://au.int/sites/default/files/treaties/29560-treaty-0048_-_african_union_convention_on_cyber_security_and_personal_data_protection_e.pdf (last accessed 11 November 2019).\n⁹ E.g.

Schmitt et al., Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2017.\n¹¹ We will see in this article that multiple initiatives that try to regulate cybersecurity only address a small portion of the broader legal framework, such as the protection of critical infrastructure (e.g. EU NIS Directive), data protection online (e.g. the famous European GDPR Directive), cyber warfare (e.g. the Tallinn Manual 2.0), and thus the definition or concept of cybersecurity used (if explicitly done so) often varies according to the specific legal domain one tries to capture.

The conclusion of the article stipulates some forward-looking comments (Title V).\n## II Cybersecurity and international law: irreconcilable?\n3. First and foremost, it should be clear that there is a broad understanding that international law applies in cyberspace to state behavior.¹⁴ This is to say, the rules developed before cybersecurity became a prominent (policy) problem. The same international legal norms that govern the physical space are applicable in cyberspace: the core question is thus not “if” international law applies to cyberspace, but rather “how” it does.¹⁵ How to efficiently translate the pre-cyber existing international law to cyberspace is difficult¹⁶, which can be explained by certain factors scrutinized right below.\n### A. Factors explaining the uneasy marriage between international law and cybersecurity\n4. Law as a system is no stranger to try and regulate rapid technological evolutions, be it developments in outer space, on the high seas, in the data collection domain, artificial intelligence, etc. This is equally so for cyberspace.¹⁷ The uneasy marriage between international law and cybersecurity can be explained by the intrinsic properties of both phenomena.\n¹⁴ In its 2013 Consensual Report (UN Doc. A/68/98, §19) and 2015 Consensual Report (UN Doc. A/70/174, §24), the UN GGE confirmed the applicability of international law, including the UN Charter, in cyberspace. Several States have already confirmed this position in their comments to these reports and in their national cyber defence and security strategies. The G20 states also confirmed this in 2015 (G20 Summit Communiqué, Antalya, 15-16 November 2015).

The digitization of the world is taking place at an unparalleled pace.¹⁸ It is expected that by 2020 there will be more than 20 billion connected devices.¹⁹ In contrast to how the international regulator in the last century was able to respond in a timely manner to certain evolutions, such as the international law of the sea concept 'exclusive economic zone' (EEZ)²⁰ and the protection of the seabed as 'common heritage of mankind'²¹, the cyber revolution is often said to be so fast and unpredictable that international law-making has difficulties catching up.²²\n2° Territoriality, sovereignty, fragmentation of jurisdiction and attribution\n6. It has become evident that the current global challenges cannot be adequately addressed by one single actor. Whether one thinks of climate change, international terrorism or cyber threats, international law offers a framework for international co-operation. Now let it be the case that the core concept on which international law is based, that of state sovereignty, does not effortlessly fit in cyberspace.²³ Although there is agreement that the principle of state sovereignty (UN Charter) applies in cyberspace²⁴, there is no one State that can claim sovereignty over the entire cyberspace.²⁵ The reason being that the many cyber infrastructures that make up cyberspace are located in different sovereign territories²⁶, and in international law, territoriality allocates jurisdiction. Nonetheless, this off and on fragmentation of jurisdiction should not be a reason to give up on regulating cybersecurity all together, we agree with TRACHTMAN, since after all, (cyber)conduct still occurs in a certain territory and effects are still felt in a certain territory.²⁷ Issues that transcend territorial jurisdiction are not new whatsoever to international law (e.g. the law of the high seas, outer space, climate change). The challenge here is linked to the attribution problem, understood as the difficulty to determine\n¹⁸ K.

A third factor that underlies the difficult relationship between cybersecurity and international law is the question of the (extent of the) regulatory role of the State versus that of the private sector in cyberspace.³¹ The alternatively controlled nature of cyberspace is the reason this debate exists³²: cyberspace is a domain in which industry and the private sector play a/the pivotal role. The private sector governs cyberspace in an informal fashion, leaving less room for the formal legislator (the nation State).³³ This informal governance is reminiscent of the *lex mercatoria*, the private economic law of the Middle Ages, according to HOISINGTON. The question is then to what extent the State must or can impose legal obligations on the private sector in regulating cybersecurity. Vice versa, to what extent can cybersecurity regulation be effective if the private sector is not involved in its preparation and implementation?\nThe discussion about the role of the State as legislator in cyberspace is prevalent: on the one hand one can argue that the nation State has the (moral) obligation to enact legislation that regulates or restricts the private sector in its cyber activities.³⁴ The argument here is that the State has to uphold binding obligations under international law, such as the protection of human rights, international peace and security, the customary 'no harm' principle³⁵, the protection of critical infrastructures³⁶ and more. These obligations can then only be (practically) guaranteed in the cyber domain if rights and obligations are imposed on private actors.³⁷\n---\n²⁸ N.

Kittichaisaree, ‘Future Prospects of Public International Law of Cyberspace’, 335-352.\n6\nSome call into question whether the role of the State within the cyber domain can and should be that far-reaching. In this respect, the main arguments in favor of a limited oversight function of the State are that the private sector does not have sufficient incentives to duly cooperate with the State since this could jeopardize its commercial objectives³⁸ (i.e. reputation damage, counter-attacks by competitors using released technology), that regulation will slow down innovation³⁹, that the private sector prefers a private legal system as opposed to public criminal law⁴⁰, etc. An alternative solution is that the governance of cyberspace shall be observed on the basis of (binding or non-binding) codes of conduct originating from the industry itself.⁴¹\n8. We agree that these two opposing sides should not be seen as an and/or question⁴²: whether and to which extent the State should have a regulatory role in cyberspace has to depend on the specific conduct one wishes to regulate. The “institutional choice may begin with determining whether the issue at stake is best taken on by the market, by private firms, by the State government, or by international law”.⁴³ When we will discuss the NIS Directive under section IV, it will become evident that the role of the State in protecting critical infrastructure (from cyber incidents) is still quite clear, uncontroversial and moreover necessary, as the State disposes of the necessary information, tools, legal framework and legitimate measures to do so. Interestingly, the NIS Directive imposes binding obligations onto certain entities in the private sector, acknowledging that cyberspace is a domain in which cooperation between the State and private actors is more than often necessary.\n4° Applying existing law versus creating new law\n9. Is it sufficient to apply existing international law to the cyber domain, or should the international community create new rules specifically designed to address this challenge? Three suggestions prevail⁴⁴:\n38 M. Teplinsky, ‘Fiddling on the Roof: Recent Developments in Cybersecurity’, American University Business Law Review 2013, 225-322, 310.\n39 J. Contreras et al., ‘Mapping Today’s Cybersecurity Landscape’, American University Law Review 2013, 1115, 1119.\n40 D. Wall, Cybercrime: The Transformation of Crime in the Information Age, Cambridge, Polity, 2007, 25-26.\n41 An example of such an influential code of conduct is the \"NIST\" (National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity) framework. This document harmonizes consensus standards and industry best practices to provide, its proponents argue, a flexible and cost-effective approach to enhancing cybersecurity that assists owners and operators of critical infrastructure in assessing and managing cyber risk, as the standard for due diligence. NIST collaborates with i.e. the United Kingdom, Japan, Korea, Estonia, Israel and Germany. A disadvantage of NIST would be that it is less well suited to protect enterprises from sophisticated and targeted cyberattacks, argue S. Shackelford, J. Russell and A. Kuehn in ‘Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors’, 42.\n42 J. Trachtman, ‘Cyberspace and Cybersecurity’, 90.\n43 This choice reflects the “true meaning of subsidiarity”, according to J. Trachtman, ‘Cyberspace and Cybersecurity’, 90.\n44 M. Hoisington, ‘Regulating Cyber Operations Through International Law: In, Out or Against the Box’, 87.\n\"(1) Cybersecurity should be addressed by using existing rules and existing structures under international law;\n(2) Cyberspace is a fundamentally unique concept that requires a whole new set of rules and legal structures;\n(3) Existing law can include the challenge of cybersecurity, but in order to be effective and efficient, those elements that are incompatible with the uniqueness of cyberspace need to be set aside\".\nWhat has been done so far on the international plane can largely be placed under option 1: the UN GGE has declared that international law, including the UN Charter, applies to cyberspace, whereas the Tallinn Manual 2.0 transposes basic concepts of international law to cyberspace in general (notably Rules 1-24), and further on in the book to cyberwarfare.\n## 5° 'Cyber Mania'\n10. Cyber mania is another phenomenon that complicates the relationship between international law and cybersecurity.⁴⁵ While the international developments in the field of cybersecurity sensu strictu have been limited, a considerable amount of academic attention and policy interest has been paid to the specific issue of 'cyberwarfare law'. According to O' CONNELL, it were the highly mediatized cyberattacks that took place in the 00's (Estonia 2007; Russo-Georgian conflict 2008; Stuxnet 2010)⁴⁶ that created this militarized image of cybersecurity law. However, the majority of cyber incidents do not reach the threshold of 'armed attack' in the sense of article 51 of the UN Charter.⁴⁷ In reality, cyber threats are more complex and diverse in nature, and they often target private companies.⁴⁸ Recent legislation, such as the European NIS Directive (which aims to protect providers of essential services and digital services such as online marketplaces) shows awareness of this more complex cyber reality, which we agree cannot be reduced to international war terms.⁴⁹\n## B. Interim conclusion\n11. Given these multiple challenges, of which this article highlighted just five, it is perhaps not surprising - or it is precisely so in view of the imminent need - that there exists no comprehensive international or European legislation in the field of cybersecurity sensu strictu.\n⁴⁵ W. von Heinegg, 'The Tallinn Manual and International Cyber Security Law', in T.

D'Elia, 'La guerre économique à l'ère du cyberspace', Hérodote 2014, 240-260.\nIn recent years, attention did diversify away from cyberwarfare law, and i.e. the UN, EU, and certain national governments (through the means of National Cybersecurity Strategies) have devoted more attention to the issue. In the next section, the article will analyze the recent developments within the UN, with a specific focus to the work of the UN GGE. In the section thereafter, we will discuss the European NIS Directive.\n## III United Nations\nA. The UN Group of Governmental Experts: paving the way for international cybersecurity law?\n12. As discussed before, because of the nature of cyberspace, it was early on realized that cybersecurity demands for more than purely national regulation. Shortly after Edward Snowed changed the cybersecurity playing field, the UN GGE - established under the auspices of the First Committee of the UN General Assembly - published a report on 24 June 2013. The essence of the non-binding document is that it confirms that international law, and in particular the UN Charter, applies in cyberspace just like in the physical space.^^ This includes the rules on state sovereignty and the principles resulting from the notion of sovereignty: for example, a State has jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure on its territory; and the State is responsible for international unlawful cyber acts that can be attributed to it.^^\nIn its successive consensual report of 2015, the UN GGE put forward i.e. the following principles of the UN Charter and international law as applicable in cyberspace to state behavior: \"sovereignty, sovereign equality, peaceful conflict resolution, the prohibition of the use of or threat of violence against the territorial integrity or political independence of a State, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States\".^^ This transposition to cyberspace of the basic principles of public international law, which almost all constitute binding customary law or have been confirmed by the International Court of Justice, is subject to a reasonable degree of agreement.^^ As expressed before, the question is not really 'if' international law applies to cyberspace, but 'how', and importantly, whether it is translated efficiently and whether this suffices.^^\n^ UN General Assembly, Report of Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the context of International Security, UN Doc.

Henriksen, 'The end of the road for the UN GGE process: The future regulation of cyberspace', 2.\n13. The 2013 and 2015 UN GGE reports are non-binding soft law.⁵⁵ In this logic, they reflect that international law applies in cyberspace and they serve as an important indicator.⁵⁶ After all, several States, including certain cyber superpowers, have confirmed this applicability in their comments to the UN GGE reports and in their national cyber security strategies. This applicability was equally confirmed by the G20 states in 2015.⁵⁷ At that point in time, the reports by the UN GGE could be seen as a sign of growing consensus on the matter, and in this sense as evidence of the development of *opinio juris*, which is one of the elements needed to eventually create binding customary international law (art. 38(1)(c) Statute of the International Court of Justice).⁵⁸ Especially in the domain of international cybersecurity law, the manifestation of *opinio juris* can be deemed as imperative if one wants to argue that there exists customary law⁵⁹, as practice on cybersecurity is for the larger part either classified or contradictory, and states have shown to be reluctant to openly declare if and how they regulate cyberspace.⁶⁰ One can find elements that inform *opinio juris* i.e. in reports prepared by international organizations, such as the UN GGE reports. Seeing how international cybersecurity law is still in a formative state, any expressed *opinio juris* displays aspirations rather than commitments⁶¹ – yet they are still of importance. Then, in June 2017, during the fifth meeting of the UN GGE, any meaningful manifestation of the development of *opinio juris* came to an abrupt end. Fundamental differences between the 25 members emerged, mainly on the issue of self-defence rights and on applying international humanitarian law to cyber conflicts. The Cuban delegation refused to recognize the explicit reference in the text to the applicability of self-defence rights in cyberspace. According to the delegation, this would “legitimize an ICT war”.⁶² The Americans interpreted this as undoing all earlier progress made within the UN GGE.⁶³ Geopolitics aside, note that the 2013 UN GGE report confirmed the applicability of the UN Charter to cyberspace, and with this *implicitly* article 51 UN Charter⁶⁴,\n⁵⁵ K.

A/68/98, 24 June 2013, §19.\n10\nwhich constitutes the right to individual and collective self-defence of a State.⁶⁵ The 2015 UN GGE report did not explicitly stipulate that international humanitarian law applies to the cyber domain. The Cuban argument is thus not so much legal as it is political. At the end of the 2017 session, no consensus report was adopted. One cannot argue that the UN GGE 2013 and 2015 reports have become *opinio juris*, yet they still constitute an important indication of the applicability of international law to cyberspace, not only because the principal content of the reports has been reiterated by States on multiple occasions, but also precisely because the UN GGE reports restate the international *lex lata*.⁶⁶ The UN GGE is now, writing end of 2019, seemingly defunct⁶⁷: will there be a momentum to revive this exercise of diplomacy?\n## IV. EU Network and Information Security Directive 2016\n14. In parallel to, or following, the deadlock on cybersecurity law discussions on the international level, the European Union issued its first ever horizontal and legally binding instrument on cybersecurity *sensu strictu*, which aims to protect critical infrastructure (essential service providers and digital service providers) from cyber incidents that have a ‘significant disruptive effect’⁶⁸. The NIS Directive was issued in 2016 and had to be implemented in the different national legal orders. As HENRIKSEN professed, the deadlock within the UN GGE may lead to more regional initiatives with like-minded states, much like the European Directive we will now discuss.⁶⁹ The NIS Directive is an example of new rules being created after cybersecurity emerged as a policy problem, and not applying previously existing international law to a new context (e.g. UN GGE 2013 and 2015 reports and Tallinn Manual 2.0).\nOver the last few decades, critical infrastructure has become increasingly more reliant on the Internet, so that it is now essential “to our water, our power, our financial segment, our aviation industry and more”.⁷⁰ Note that the approach taken in the Directive is an “all hazards”\n⁶⁵ Article 51 Charter of the United Nations and Statute of the International Court of Justice, signed in San Francisco on 26 June 1945, entered into force on 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS XVI.\n⁶⁶ As does the Tallinn Manual 2.0.\n⁶⁷ S. Soesanto and F. D'Incau, ‘The UN GGE is dead: Time to fall forward’.\n⁶⁸ Art. 6 NIS Directive.\n⁶⁹ In the wake of the 2017 UN GGE ‘failure’, US Homeland Security advisor Tim Bossart expressed that “it was now time to consider other approaches…and that the U.S. will work with smaller groups of likeminded partners”. See T. Bossart, Remarks at Cyber Week 2017, Tel Aviv, 26 June 2017, online available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-homeland-security-advisor-thomas-p-bossert-cyber-week-2017/ (last accessed 8 November 2019). Think for example of the efforts by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on the Code of Conduct for Information Security or the previously mentioned African Union Convention. According to Henriksen, the regionalization of cybersecurity regulation into legal sub-systems of varying normative depth is unfortunate, given the global nature of the Internet. Yet Henriksen also admits that there are advantages to a more regional approach to cyber regulation, such as avoiding time-consuming negotiations, the perspective of reaching agreement on complex issues rather than just on the low-hanging fruits, etc. See A. Henriksen, ‘The end of the road for the UN GGE process: The future regulation of cyberspace’, 6.\n⁷⁰ Testimony of Admiral Michael Rogers, Hearing of the House Select Intelligence Committee, ‘Cybersecurity Threats: The Way Forward’, 20 November 2014 (Federal News Service Transcript). Other international organizations have equally raised awareness on the issue of cyber threats to critical infrastructure, see e.g. UN General Assembly, Report of Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the context of International Security, UN Doc. A/68/98, 24 June 2013, §9, 26(e), 30; C. Heinl, ‘Regional Cyber Security: Towards a Resilient ASEAN Cyber Security Regime’, RSIS Working Paper No. 263, 9\n11\nstrategy⁷¹: to protect critical infrastructure from a range of cyber ‘incidents’⁷². The question addressed is whether networks are protected against incidents from any source; the Directive does not demarcate on the basis of the category of the threat (contrary to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, and the Tallinn Manual 2.0 rules on cyberwarfare operations in armed conflict).\n## A. Objective and context\n15. The EU launched a strategy for a digital single market in 2015; the NIS Directive, the General Data Protection Regulation (the famous 'GDPR')⁷³ and the eIDAS Regulation⁷⁴ all fall under this strategy.\nThe primary objective of the NIS Directive is mentioned in the preparatory works: “to guarantee a high common level of network and IT security”.⁷⁵ One of the main reasons for the creation of the NIS directive was that some EU member states did not have cybersecurity legislation in place, and even when they did, there were large divergences among nations. This goal is important seeing how \"cyber incidents are increasing in size, frequency and complexity and can result in business inability to do their jobs, significant financial losses to the EU economy and a loss of welfare for society\".⁷⁶ The fact that the Directive imposes obligations on providers of digital services indicates that the European legislator is aware that cyber incidents today are\nSeptember 2013, online available at https://www.rsis.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/rsis-pubs/WP263.pdf (last accessed 7 November 2019); Organization of American States, Critical Infrastructure Protection Programs: Cyber Security, online available at http://www.oas.org/en/sms/ ciche/programs_cyber.asp (last accessed 7 November 2019); Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Critical Information Infrastructures Protection, online available at http://www. oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/ciip.htm (last accessed 7 November 2019); M.

Note how the Shanghai Cooperation Organization went a step further than cooperation and awareness raising, and agreed in a treaty to cooperate on information security within critical infrastructures. The previously mentioned AU Convention obliges parties to undertake action to protect critical infrastructure. See Art. 3, Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of International Information Security, 16 June 2009, online available at https://ccdcoe-admin.aku.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SCO-090616-IISAgreement.pdf (unofficial English translation, last accessed 7 November 2019); Article 25(4) AU Convention on Cyber Security.\n⁷¹ Termed by D. Fidler, 'Wither the Web: International Law, Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection', 13.\n⁷² Art. 4(7) NIS Directive.\n⁷³ Regulation (EU) No 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and repealing directive 95/46/EC, 4 May 2016, OJ L 119, 1-88.\n⁷⁴ Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions in the Internal Market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC, 28 August 2014, OJ L 257, 73-114.\n⁷⁵ Preamble (4) NIS Directive.\n⁷⁶ Preamble (2) NIS Directive.\ndiverse and complex in nature⁷⁷, most of the time not reaching the threshold of ‘armed attack’ (article 51 UN Charter).\n16. The NIS Directive is legally binding. It is not particularly difficult to explain why consensus on legally binding measures could be found within the EU on this topic, and why it has proved more difficult within the UN. Apart from the like-minded group argument (supra), the NIS Directive primarily creates measures to protect critical infrastructure; for the latter, the role of the formal legislator is still quite clearly defined.⁷⁸ Moreover, since there exists a manageable working definition of \"critical infrastructures\"⁷⁹ and since this concern has long been voiced within cybersecurity discussions⁸⁰, the NIS Directive ignores some of the obstacles mentioned in numbers 5-10. In addition to this, as a country's critical infrastructure is most often located within its territory (e.g. drink water systems, hospitals, railways)⁸¹, and thus within its jurisdiction, governments can in principle (to a certain extent) protect it without necessarily relying upon public international law.⁸²\n17. Analyzing the NIS Directive is interesting, as the European legislator acknowledges the importance of imposing obligations upon the private sector. There are two entities onto which the Directives imposes obligations: the Member State government (1) and the private sector (2) (notably the providers of essential services mentioned in Annex II of the Directive and the providers of digital services mentioned in Annex II of the Directive).\n⁷⁷ See supra, no 10.\n⁷⁸ Supra, no 8.\n⁷⁹ See art. 2(a) EU Directive 2008/114/EC of the Council of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection, adopted on 8 December 2008, entered into force January 2009, Pb.

Fidler, 'Wither the Web: International Law, Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection', 9-10.\n13\nB. Measures at Member State level and cooperation with EU\n18. The NIS Directive imposes upon Member States obligations that can be summarized under the following three categories⁸³:\n1) Each Member State must ensure a minimum national capacity by designating NIS competent authorities (Art. 8 NIS Directive), by setting up computer crisis teams ('Computer Emergency Response Teams' - CERTs or 'Computer Security Incident Response Teams' - CSIRTs (Art. 9) and national NIS strategies and cooperation plans (Art. 7));\n2) National competent authorities should work together within a network that allows secure and effective coordination, including coordinated information exchange, and detection and response at EU level. Member States must exchange information and collaborate through this network to tackle NIS threats and incidents on the basis of the European NIS cooperation plan (Art. 11);\n3) One of the most important obligations for the Member State is to identify the providers of essential services (Art. 5). A culture of risk management shall be introduced and the private and public sectors shall exchange information with each other.\nC. Specific obligations for stakeholders in the private sector\n19. The Directive focuses on two types of entities in the private sector (Articles 1, 4, 5, 14, 16):\n- the providers of essential services⁸⁴;\n- digital service providers.\n20. In its Annex II, the NIS Directive specifies in a non-exhaustive way the sectors in which the Member States must search for the providers of essential services. These include the following sectors: banks, stock exchanges, transport and distribution of energy, air, rail and maritime transport, health, internet services and the government. Nuclear installations fall outside the scope of the Directive.⁸⁵\n21. \"Digital service providers\", the second private sector entity onto which the Directive imposes obligations, should be understood as online marketplaces, online search engines and cloud computer services. These are exhaustively listed in Annex II of the Directive. Note that\n⁸³ R. Roex, 'EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed', Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016.\n⁸⁴ According to Article 5 (2) NIS Directive, providers of essential services are entities that 'provide services that are essential for the maintenance of critical social and / or economic activities, the provision of that service depending on network and information systems and in which in the event of an incident this would have significant disruptive effects on the provision of that service'.\n⁸⁵ L. Lemmens, 'België werkt aan omzetting NIS-richtlijn voor uniforme beveiliging netwerk- en informatiesystemen', Commentary – Wolters Kluwer Online 22 November 2018.\n14\nduring the legislative process, it was decided that many of the other suggested digital services were not critical enough.⁸⁶\n22. The most important obligations for providers of essential services and providers of digital services can be summarized as follows⁸⁷:\n- take appropriate technical and organizational measures to manage NIS risks;\n- prepare and implement business continuity plans;\n- notify the competent authority or CSIRT of an incident that has a significant impact.\nWhat exactly constitutes a cyber incident with a ‘significant disruptive impact’ is thus quintessential to the implementation of the Directive, yet the meaning of the broad term is unclear at this stage⁸⁸, and it remains to be seen how this will be applied in practice.\nD. Territorial scope\n23. Articles 5 and 18 of the NIS Directive clarify its territorial scope. For providers of essential services, each Member State where the provider has an establishment through which he offers essential services in that Member State will have jurisdiction. For digital service providers, this will be the Member State where the service provider has its headquarters and jurisdiction and its supervisory authority (one stop shop principle). If there are no headquarters in the EU, the provider or service provider must appoint a representative.⁸⁹\nV. Conclusion\n24. This article identified five factors underlying the difficult relationship between cybersecurity and international law. These are the speed at which global digitization is taking place as well as the nature of cyber operations (1), the fragmented jurisdiction and attribution problem (2), the question whether and to which extent the State and/or the private sector should have a regulatory role in cyberspace (3), whether transposing existing law onto the new technological context suffices, and (5) the phenomenon of 'cyber mania'.\n⁸⁶ R. Roex, ‘EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed’, Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016. Under the NIS Directive, Member States are not required to identify digital service providers, allowing for a ‘catch-all approach’. See D. Markopoulou, V. Papakonstantinou and P. de Hert, ‘The new EU cybersecurity framework: The NIS Directive, ENISA’s role and the General Data Protection Regulation’, Computer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 2019, 4.\n⁸⁷ Art. 14 and 16 NIS Directive. Affected Member States are informed when an incident has cross-border consequences. See also D. Markopoulou, V. Papakonstantinou and P. de Hert, ‘The new EU cybersecurity framework: The NIS Directive, ENISA’s role and the General Data Protection Regulation’, 5-6. R. Roex, ‘EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed’, Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016.\n⁸⁸ Some guiding elements to determine what a ‘significant disruptive effect’ is, are mentioned in articles 6, 14 and 16 of the NIS Directive, as well as in its Preamble (27), (28), (38).\n⁸⁹ Art. 5 and 18 NIS Directive; L. Lemmens, ‘België werkt aan omzetting NIS-richtlijn voor uniforme beveiliging netwerk- en informatiesystemen’, Commentary – Wolters Kluwer Online 22 November 2018; R. Roex, ‘EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed’, Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016.\n15\n25. These factors contribute to the difficulties facing the UN GGE. We have made clear that the diplomatic deadlock in which the UN GGE process finds itself goes back to a geopolitical argument rather than a legal one: it was the explicit reference in the 2017 text to the applicability of self-defence rights and humanitarian law in cyberspace that led to the end of the negotiations, even though the previous reports had implicitly done precisely that, by stating that the UN Charter and thus article 51, applies in cyberspace. This article has shown that the 2013 and 2015 UN GGE reports do not constitute opinio juris, yet they are an important indication of the applicability of international law to cyberspace, not only because States, including some cyber superpowers, reiterated this on multiple occasions, but also because the UN GGE reports restate the international lex lata. The UN GGE, as the Tallinn Manual 2.0, is thus a prime example of applying pre-existing law to a new technological context.\nEnter the EU NIS Directive in 2016. As HENRIKSEN points out, the inertia on the international level may lead to more regional initiatives with like-minded States. The NIS Directive is the first horizontal and legally binding EU instrument on cybersecurity. The fact that consensus on legally binding measures could be found is partially because the Directive focuses on the protection of critical infrastructure, a domain in which the role of the State as legislator is still quite clearly defined and necessary, of which there exists a working definition, which is a concern that has long been voiced, and seeing how critical infrastructure such as hospitals, drink water systems and railways (Annex II NIS Directive) are usually located within the territory and thus jurisdiction of a State. Interestingly, the NIS Directive shows awareness of a changing, more complex and diverse cybersecurity landscape, by imposing obligations upon two entities in the private sector. Moreover, this testifies that the European legislator acknowledges that cybersecurity cannot be adequately guaranteed without involving the private sector. However, the fact that consensus on legally binding measures on the topic could be found, does not mean that the EU NIS Directive is a success: it remains to be seen how the nation States will interpret a 'cyber incident with a significant disruptive impact', without which the obligations of the Directive are meaningless. In that sense, one currently cannot overstate the success of the NIS Directive and inversely overstate the failure of the UN GGE: the latter made clear that international law does apply to state behavior in cyberspace, which indeed offers the necessary starting point.⁹⁰ Europe has less cyber superpowers around the table than does the UN GGE, and it may be likely that State actors in the latter forum are guilty of \"fence sitting\": on the international level, cyber superpowers and other nations may want to wait and see \"where the technology is going\", or because it is in the interest of their flexibility to \"maintain the current legal uncertainties\".⁹¹\n⁹⁰ A. Henriksen, ‘The end of the road for the UN GGE process: The future regulation of cyberspace’, 8.\n⁹¹ A. Henriksen, ‘The end of the road for the UN GGE process: The future regulation of cyberspace’, 5.\n16\nWe know that international law applies in cyberspace ('if') – although it would be difficult to argue that the support for this principle has become opinio juris – and while the NIS Directive wanted to answer 'how' law applies in cyberspace, the question remains, depending on the factual interpretation of a 'significant disruptive impact'.\n17"

Futter, 'Cyber semantics: why we should retire the latest buzzword in security studies', Journal of Cyber Policy 2018, 202. The terminological vagueness is not without practical impact: the definition of cybersecurity in a given context is after all contingent upon what and who is being deterred, how, and whether the attribution of capabilities is possible.

To date, however, cybersecurity has generated very little international law. How can this be explained? The article examines the factors underlying the difficult marriage between public international law and the high-tech phenomenon of cyberspace. What can or should the role of the State and/or the private sector in regulating cyberspace be? Should the international level create new laws to regulate cybersecurity or should the existing international legal principles simply be transposed to the new technological context? Today, it has become clear that the vast majority of cyber incidents do not reach the threshold of 'armed attack' in the sense of article 51 of the UN Charter. In reaction, we see that certain international organizations and nation States launched efforts to better protect cybersecurity sensu strictu. In this article, we focus on recent efforts within the UN and the EU. Notably, the article will answer whether the efforts to apply existing international law to cyberspace, undertaken by the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the Context of International Security, suffice. Why did the fifth round of negotiations among the Expert Group fail in 2017, and will there be another momentum to revive this diplomatic exercise? Zooming in on the protection of critical infrastructure specifically, how does the first horizontal and legally binding EU Directive on Network and Information Security (2016) fit in the worldwide effort to better regulate cybersecurity? This is interesting, as the Directive shows awareness of the diverse and complex nature of cybersecurity by imposing binding obligations upon the providers of essential services and digital providers.\nI Introduction ¹ Anne Verhelst is PhD Researcher in International Law at the Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies and the Institute for International Law, KU Leuven, Belgium.

Examples include cyber-theft, cyber-trespass, cyber-obscenity, and cyber-extortions. In section IV of this article, we will analyze the European Network and Information Security Directive (2016), which aims to protect critical infrastructure from cyber incidents. Note that some authors and instruments categorize cyberattacks against critical infrastructure under ‘cybercrime’. See N. Kshetri, ‘Global Cybersecurity: Key Issues and Concepts’, 3 and N. Kshetri, ‘Positive externality, increasing returns and the rise in cybercrimes’, Communications of the ACM 2009, 141–144. In this article, we will discuss the European Directive as aiming to protect critical infrastructure, regardless of whether a cyberattack against such infrastructure should be seen as falling under a strict definition of ‘cybercrime’. Specific regional instruments dedicated to cybercrime as such are the Council of Europe’s Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and the African Union’s Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection. See Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime of 23 November 2001, entered into force on 01 July 2004, ETS no 185; African Union, Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection 27 June 2014, entered into force 3 June 2019, online available at https://au.int/sites/default/files/treaties/29560-treaty-0048_-_african_union_convention_on_cyber_security_and_personal_data_protection_e.pdf (last accessed 11 November 2019).\n⁹ E.g.

Factors explaining the uneasy marriage between international law and cybersecurity\n\n¹⁴ In its 2013 Consensual Report (UN Doc. A/68/98, §19) and 2015 Consensual Report (UN Doc. A/70/174, §24), the UN GGE confirmed the applicability of international law, including the UN Charter, in cyberspace. Several States have already confirmed this position in their comments to these reports and in their national cyber defence and security strategies. The G20 states also confirmed this in 2015 (G20 Summit Communiqué, Antalya, 15-16 November 2015).

EU Network and Information Security Directive 2016\n\nOver the last few decades, critical infrastructure has become increasingly more reliant on the Internet, so that it is now essential “to our water, our power, our financial segment, our aviation industry and more”.⁷⁰ Note that the approach taken in the Directive is an “all hazards” ⁶⁵ Article 51 Charter of the United Nations and Statute of the International Court of Justice, signed in San Francisco on 26 June 1945, entered into force on 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS XVI.\n⁶⁶ As does the Tallinn Manual 2.0.\n⁶⁷ S. Soesanto and F. D'Incau, ‘The UN GGE is dead: Time to fall forward’.\n⁶⁸ Art. 6 NIS Directive.\n⁶⁹ In the wake of the 2017 UN GGE ‘failure’, US Homeland Security advisor Tim Bossart expressed that “it was now time to consider other approaches…and that the U.S. will work with smaller groups of likeminded partners”. See T. Bossart, Remarks at Cyber Week 2017, Tel Aviv, 26 June 2017, online available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-homeland-security-advisor-thomas-p-bossert-cyber-week-2017/ (last accessed 8 November 2019). Think for example of the efforts by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on the Code of Conduct for Information Security or the previously mentioned African Union Convention. According to Henriksen, the regionalization of cybersecurity regulation into legal sub-systems of varying normative depth is unfortunate, given the global nature of the Internet. Yet Henriksen also admits that there are advantages to a more regional approach to cyber regulation, such as avoiding time-consuming negotiations, the perspective of reaching agreement on complex issues rather than just on the low-hanging fruits, etc. See A. Henriksen, ‘The end of the road for the UN GGE process: The future regulation of cyberspace’, 6.\n⁷⁰ Testimony of Admiral Michael Rogers, Hearing of the House Select Intelligence Committee, ‘Cybersecurity Threats: The Way Forward’, 20 November 2014 (Federal News Service Transcript). Other international organizations have equally raised awareness on the issue of cyber threats to critical infrastructure, see e.g. UN General Assembly, Report of Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the context of International Security, UN Doc. A/68/98, 24 June 2013, §9, 26(e), 30; C. Heinl, ‘Regional Cyber Security: Towards a Resilient ASEAN Cyber Security Regime’, RSIS Working Paper No. 263, 9\n\n## A. Objective and context\n\nThe primary objective of the NIS Directive is mentioned in the preparatory works: “to guarantee a high common level of network and IT security”.⁷⁵ One of the main reasons for the creation of the NIS directive was that some EU member states did not have cybersecurity legislation in place, and even when they did, there were large divergences among nations. This goal is important seeing how\"cyber incidents are increasing in size, frequency and complexity and can result in business inability to do their jobs, significant financial losses to the EU economy and a loss of welfare for society\".⁷⁶ The fact that the Directive imposes obligations on providers of digital services indicates that the European legislator is aware that cyber incidents today are September 2013, online available at https://www.rsis.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/rsis-pubs/WP263.pdf (last accessed 7 November 2019); Organization of American States, Critical Infrastructure Protection Programs: Cyber Security, online available at http://www.oas.org/en/sms/ ciche/programs_cyber.asp (last accessed 7 November 2019); Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Critical Information Infrastructures Protection, online available at http://www. oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/ciip.htm (last accessed 7 November 2019); M.

Note how the Shanghai Cooperation Organization went a step further than cooperation and awareness raising, and agreed in a treaty to cooperate on information security within critical infrastructures. The previously mentioned AU Convention obliges parties to undertake action to protect critical infrastructure. See Art. 3, Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of International Information Security, 16 June 2009, online available at https://ccdcoe-admin.aku.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SCO-090616-IISAgreement.pdf (unofficial English translation, last accessed 7 November 2019); Article 25(4) AU Convention on Cyber Security.\n⁷¹ Termed by D.

Under the NIS Directive, Member States are not required to identify digital service providers, allowing for a ‘catch-all approach’. See D. Markopoulou, V. Papakonstantinou and P. de Hert, ‘The new EU cybersecurity framework: The NIS Directive, ENISA’s role and the General Data Protection Regulation’, Computer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 2019, 4.\n⁸⁷ Art. 14 and 16 NIS Directive. Affected Member States are informed when an incident has cross-border consequences. See also D. Markopoulou, V. Papakonstantinou and P. de Hert, ‘The new EU cybersecurity framework: The NIS Directive, ENISA’s role and the General Data Protection Regulation’, 5-6. R. Roex, ‘EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed’, Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016.\n⁸⁸ Some guiding elements to determine what a ‘significant disruptive effect’ is, are mentioned in articles 6, 14 and 16 of the NIS Directive, as well as in its Preamble (27), (28), (38).\n⁸⁹ Art. 5 and 18 NIS Directive; L. Lemmens, ‘België werkt aan omzetting NIS-richtlijn voor uniforme beveiliging netwerk- en informatiesystemen’, Commentary – Wolters Kluwer Online 22 November 2018; R. Roex, ‘EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed’, Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016.\n\nEnter the EU NIS Directive in 2016. As HENRIKSEN points out, the inertia on the international level may lead to more regional initiatives with like-minded States. The NIS Directive is the first horizontal and legally binding EU instrument on cybersecurity. The fact that consensus on legally binding measures could be found is partially because the Directive focuses on the protection of critical infrastructure, a domain in which the role of the State as legislator is still quite clearly defined and necessary, of which there exists a working definition, which is a concern that has long been voiced, and seeing how critical infrastructure such as hospitals, drink water systems and railways (Annex II NIS Directive) are usually located within the territory and thus jurisdiction of a State. Interestingly, the NIS Directive shows awareness of a changing, more complex and diverse cybersecurity landscape, by imposing obligations upon two entities in the private sector. Moreover, this testifies that the European legislator acknowledges that cybersecurity cannot be adequately guaranteed without involving the private sector. However, the fact that consensus on legally binding measures on the topic could be found, does not mean that the EU NIS Directive is a success: it remains to be seen how the nation States will interpret a 'cyber incident with a significant disruptive impact', without which the obligations of the Directive are meaningless. In that sense, one currently cannot overstate the success of the NIS Directive and inversely overstate the failure of the UN GGE: the latter made clear that international law does apply to state behavior in cyberspace, which indeed offers the necessary starting point.⁹⁰ Europe has less cyber superpowers around the table than does the UN GGE, and it may be likely that State actors in the latter forum are guilty of\"fence sitting\": on the international level, cyber superpowers and other nations may want to wait and see\"where the technology is going\", or because it is in the interest of their flexibility to\"maintain the current legal uncertainties\".⁹¹ ⁹⁰ A.

To date, however, cybersecurity has generated very little international law. How can this be explained? The article examines the factors underlying the difficult marriage between public international law and the high-tech phenomenon of cyberspace. What can or should the role of the State and/or the private sector in regulating cyberspace be? Should the international level create new laws to regulate cybersecurity or should the existing international legal principles simply be transposed to the new technological context? Today, it has become clear that the vast majority of cyber incidents do not reach the threshold of 'armed attack' in the sense of article 51 of the UN Charter. In reaction, we see that certain international organizations and nation States launched efforts to better protect cybersecurity sensu strictu. In this article, we focus on recent efforts within the UN and the EU. Notably, the article will answer whether the efforts to apply existing international law to cyberspace, undertaken by the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the Context of International Security, suffice. Why did the fifth round of negotiations among the Expert Group fail in 2017, and will there be another momentum to revive this diplomatic exercise? Zooming in on the protection of critical infrastructure specifically, how does the first horizontal and legally binding EU Directive on Network and Information Security (2016) fit in the worldwide effort to better regulate cybersecurity?

A few initiatives of which we will highlight in this article. Yet, cybersecurity as a policy concern has generated very little international law up to now.\nA straightforward reason that partially explains this inertia, is that the scope, nature, meaning and terminology of cybersecurity is unclear.⁵ There is little general agreement about what cybersecurity entails, and it seems that individual people use the term differently, depending on the context.⁶ This article will depart from a concept of cybersecurity sensu strictu. In that view, cybersecurity shall mean\"the security of network and information systems; the ability of network and information systems to withstand, with a certain degree of confidence, actions that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored, transmitted or processed data or the related services provided or accessible through those network and information systems\".⁷ This article thus applies a concept of cybersecurity excluding a focus As the NIS Directive aims to protect critical infrastructure against cyber incidents, this article will pay specific attention to threats directed at critical infrastructure¹², rather than focusing on cyberattacks against the data of private people, against companies (when it has no larger societal effect), etc. Moreover, in this article we exclusively discuss the international regulatory level as viewed by a nation’s perspective, to which cybersecurity can be summarized and clarified to mean the “ability to protect itself and its institutions against cyber threats”.¹³ ⁸ Cybercrime can be defined as ‘a criminal activity in which computers or computer networks are the principal means of committing an offense’. Examples include cyber-theft, cyber-trespass, cyber-obscenity, and cyber-extortions. In section IV of this article, we will analyze the European Network and Information Security Directive (2016), which aims to protect critical infrastructure from cyber incidents. Note that some authors and instruments categorize cyberattacks against critical infrastructure under ‘cybercrime’. See N. Kshetri, ‘Global Cybersecurity: Key Issues and Concepts’, 3 and N. Kshetri, ‘Positive externality, increasing returns and the rise in cybercrimes’, Communications of the ACM 2009, 141–144. In this article, we will discuss the European Directive as aiming to protect critical infrastructure, regardless of whether a cyberattack against such infrastructure should be seen as falling under a strict definition of ‘cybercrime’. Specific regional instruments dedicated to cybercrime as such are the Council of Europe’s Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and the African Union’s Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection. See Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime of 23 November 2001, entered into force on 01 July 2004, ETS no 185; African Union, Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection 27 June 2014, entered into force 3 June 2019, online available at https://au.int/sites/default/files/treaties/29560-treaty-0048_-_african_union_convention_on_cyber_security_and_personal_data_protection_e.pdf (last accessed 11 November 2019).\n⁹ E.g.

Schmitt et al., Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2017.\n¹¹ We will see in this article that multiple initiatives that try to regulate cybersecurity only address a small portion of the broader legal framework, such as the protection of critical infrastructure (e.g. EU NIS Directive), data protection online (e.g. the famous European GDPR Directive), cyber warfare (e.g. the Tallinn Manual 2.0), and thus the definition or concept of cybersecurity used (if explicitly done so) often varies according to the specific legal domain one tries to capture.

The terminological vagueness is not without practical impact: the definition of cybersecurity in a given context is after all contingent upon what and who is being deterred, how, and whether the attribution of capabilities is possible. The vague language means that it can be unclear who should take responsibility for ensuring cybersecurity, leading to various legal and practical obstacles in regulating the issue. See A.

    "on the specific threats of cybercrime⁸, cyber terrorism⁹ and cyber warfare¹⁰,¹¹ We opt for this definition as it originates in article 4.2 of the European Network and Information Security Directive (2016) (hereinafter: ‘NIS Directive’), which will form a large part of this study.\n\nAs the NIS Directive aims to protect critical infrastructure against cyber incidents, this article will pay specific attention to threats directed at critical infrastructure¹², rather than focusing on cyberattacks against the data of private people, against companies (when it has no larger societal effect), etc. Moreover, in this article we exclusively discuss the international regulatory level as viewed by a nation’s perspective, to which cybersecurity can be summarized and clarified to mean the “ability to protect itself and its institutions against cyber threats”.¹³\n\n2. The purpose of this article is to bring together, analyze and clarify where necessary the most important recent developments in cybersecurity law and initiatives within the United Nations (hereinafter: ‘UN’) and European Union (hereinafter: ‘EU’). The questions addressed in this article are the following. First, on a more abstract level, we will discuss whether international law can adequately regulate issues of cybersecurity. Are there any impediments that law places on the cyber domain (if so, which ones)? And vice versa, can the high-tech phenomenon of cybersecurity be embedded in international law? (Title II) The article then analyzes the most important legal, regulatory, and soft law developments in the field of cybersecurity within the UN, with specific attention paid to the work by the Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the Context\n\n⁸ Cybercrime can be defined as ‘a criminal activity in which computers or computer networks are the principal means of committing an offense’. Examples include cyber-theft, cyber-trespass, cyber-obscenity, and cyber-extortions. In section IV of this article, we will analyze the European Network and Information Security Directive (2016), which aims to protect critical infrastructure from cyber incidents. Note that some authors and instruments categorize cyberattacks against critical infrastructure under ‘cybercrime’. See N. Kshetri, ‘Global Cybersecurity: Key Issues and Concepts’, 3 and N. Kshetri, ‘Positive externality, increasing returns and the rise in cybercrimes’, Communications of the ACM 2009, 141–144. In this article, we will discuss the European Directive as aiming to protect critical infrastructure, regardless of whether a cyberattack against such infrastructure should be seen as falling under a strict definition of ‘cybercrime’. Specific regional instruments dedicated to cybercrime as such are the Council of Europe’s Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and the African Union’s Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection. See Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime of 23 November 2001, entered into force on 01 July 2004, ETS no 185; African Union, Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection 27 June 2014, entered into force 3 June 2019, online available at https://au.int/sites/default/files/treaties/29560-treaty-0048_-_african_union_convention_on_cyber_security_and_personal_data_protection_e.pdf (last accessed 11 November 2019).\n\n⁹ E.g.

Schmitt et al., Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2017.\n\n¹¹ We will see in this article that multiple initiatives that try to regulate cybersecurity only address a small portion of the broader legal framework, such as the protection of critical infrastructure (e.g. EU NIS Directive), data protection online (e.g. the famous European GDPR Directive), cyber warfare (e.g. the Tallinn Manual 2.0), and thus the definition or concept of cybersecurity used (if explicitly done so) often varies according to the specific legal domain one tries to capture.

The conclusion of the article stipulates some forward-looking comments (Title V).\n\n## II Cybersecurity and international law: irreconcilable?\n\n3. First and foremost, it should be clear that there is a broad understanding that international law applies in cyberspace to state behavior.¹⁴ This is to say, the rules developed before cybersecurity became a prominent (policy) problem. The same international legal norms that govern the physical space are applicable in cyberspace: the core question is thus not “if” international law applies to cyberspace, but rather “how” it does.¹⁵ How to efficiently translate the pre-cyber existing international law to cyberspace is difficult¹⁶, which can be explained by certain factors scrutinized right below.\n\n### A. Factors explaining the uneasy marriage between international law and cybersecurity\n\n4. Law as a system is no stranger to try and regulate rapid technological evolutions, be it developments in outer space, on the high seas, in the data collection domain, artificial intelligence, etc. This is equally so for cyberspace.¹⁷ The uneasy marriage between international law and cybersecurity can be explained by the intrinsic properties of both phenomena.\n\n¹⁴ In its 2013 Consensual Report (UN Doc. A/68/98, §19) and 2015 Consensual Report (UN Doc. A/70/174, §24), the UN GGE confirmed the applicability of international law, including the UN Charter, in cyberspace. Several States have already confirmed this position in their comments to these reports and in their national cyber defence and security strategies. The G20 states also confirmed this in 2015 (G20 Summit Communiqué, Antalya, 15-16 November 2015).

    "1° Fast and high-tech cyber revolution\n\n5. The digitization of the world is taking place at an unparalleled pace.¹⁸ It is expected that by 2020 there will be more than 20 billion connected devices.¹⁹ In contrast to how the international regulator in the last century was able to respond in a timely manner to certain evolutions, such as the international law of the sea concept 'exclusive economic zone' (EEZ)²⁰ and the protection of the seabed as 'common heritage of mankind'²¹, the cyber revolution is often said to be so fast and unpredictable that international law-making has difficulties catching up.²²\n\n2° Territoriality, sovereignty, fragmentation of jurisdiction and attribution\n\n6. It has become evident that the current global challenges cannot be adequately addressed by one single actor. Whether one thinks of climate change, international terrorism or cyber threats, international law offers a framework for international co-operation. Now let it be the case that the core concept on which international law is based, that of state sovereignty, does not effortlessly fit in cyberspace.²³ Although there is agreement that the principle of state sovereignty (UN Charter) applies in cyberspace²⁴, there is no one State that can claim sovereignty over the entire cyberspace.²⁵ The reason being that the many cyber infrastructures that make up cyberspace are located in different sovereign territories²⁶, and in international law, territoriality allocates jurisdiction. Nonetheless, this off and on fragmentation of jurisdiction should not be a reason to give up on regulating cybersecurity all together, we agree with TRACHTMAN, since after all, (cyber)conduct still occurs in a certain territory and effects are still felt in a certain territory.²⁷ Issues that transcend territorial jurisdiction are not new whatsoever to international law (e.g. the law of the high seas, outer space, climate change). The challenge here is linked to the attribution problem, understood as the difficulty to determine\n\n¹⁸ K.

    "the identity or location of a cyber-attacker or their intermediary²⁸, which can be seen as the true complicating factor here.²⁹ And even when there are rules on cybersecurity in place, note that the legal attribution problem may weaken their performance and success.³⁰\n\n## 3° Role of the government versus of the private sector\n\n7. A third factor that underlies the difficult relationship between cybersecurity and international law is the question of the (extent of the) regulatory role of the State versus that of the private sector in cyberspace.³¹ The alternatively controlled nature of cyberspace is the reason this debate exists³²: cyberspace is a domain in which industry and the private sector play a/the pivotal role. The private sector governs cyberspace in an informal fashion, leaving less room for the formal legislator (the nation State).³³ This informal governance is reminiscent of the *lex mercatoria*, the private economic law of the Middle Ages, according to HOISINGTON. The question is then to what extent the State must or can impose legal obligations on the private sector in regulating cybersecurity. Vice versa, to what extent can cybersecurity regulation be effective if the private sector is not involved in its preparation and implementation?\n\nThe discussion about the role of the State as legislator in cyberspace is prevalent: on the one hand one can argue that the nation State has the (moral) obligation to enact legislation that regulates or restricts the private sector in its cyber activities.³⁴ The argument here is that the State has to uphold binding obligations under international law, such as the protection of human rights, international peace and security, the customary 'no harm' principle³⁵, the protection of critical infrastructures³⁶ and more. These obligations can then only be (practically) guaranteed in the cyber domain if rights and obligations are imposed on private actors.³⁷\n\n---\n\n²⁸ N.

    "Some call into question whether the role of the State within the cyber domain can and should be that far-reaching. In this respect, the main arguments in favor of a limited oversight function of the State are that the private sector does not have sufficient incentives to duly cooperate with the State since this could jeopardize its commercial objectives³⁸ (i.e. reputation damage, counter-attacks by competitors using released technology), that regulation will slow down innovation³⁹, that the private sector prefers a private legal system as opposed to public criminal law⁴⁰, etc. An alternative solution is that the governance of cyberspace shall be observed on the basis of (binding or non-binding) codes of conduct originating from the industry itself.⁴¹\n\n8. We agree that these two opposing sides should not be seen as an and/or question⁴²: whether and to which extent the State should have a regulatory role in cyberspace has to depend on the specific conduct one wishes to regulate. The “institutional choice may begin with determining whether the issue at stake is best taken on by the market, by private firms, by the State government, or by international law”.⁴³ When we will discuss the NIS Directive under section IV, it will become evident that the role of the State in protecting critical infrastructure (from cyber incidents) is still quite clear, uncontroversial and moreover necessary, as the State disposes of the necessary information, tools, legal framework and legitimate measures to do so. Interestingly, the NIS Directive imposes binding obligations onto certain entities in the private sector, acknowledging that cyberspace is a domain in which cooperation between the State and private actors is more than often necessary.\n\n4° Applying existing law versus creating new law\n\n9. Is it sufficient to apply existing international law to the cyber domain, or should the international community create new rules specifically designed to address this challenge? Three suggestions prevail⁴⁴:\n\n38 M. Teplinsky, ‘Fiddling on the Roof: Recent Developments in Cybersecurity’, American University Business Law Review 2013, 225-322, 310.\n\n39 J.

Wall, Cybercrime: The Transformation of Crime in the Information Age, Cambridge, Polity, 2007, 25-26.\n\n41 An example of such an influential code of conduct is the \"NIST\" (National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity) framework. This document harmonizes consensus standards and industry best practices to provide, its proponents argue, a flexible and cost-effective approach to enhancing cybersecurity that assists owners and operators of critical infrastructure in assessing and managing cyber risk, as the standard for due diligence. NIST collaborates with i.e. the United Kingdom, Japan, Korea, Estonia, Israel and Germany. A disadvantage of NIST would be that it is less well suited to protect enterprises from sophisticated and targeted cyberattacks, argue S. Shackelford, J. Russell and A. Kuehn in ‘Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors’, 42.\n\n42 J.

    "\"(1) Cybersecurity should be addressed by using existing rules and existing structures under international law;\n(2) Cyberspace is a fundamentally unique concept that requires a whole new set of rules and legal structures;\n(3) Existing law can include the challenge of cybersecurity, but in order to be effective and efficient, those elements that are incompatible with the uniqueness of cyberspace need to be set aside\".\n\nWhat has been done so far on the international plane can largely be placed under option 1: the UN GGE has declared that international law, including the UN Charter, applies to cyberspace, whereas the Tallinn Manual 2.0 transposes basic concepts of international law to cyberspace in general (notably Rules 1-24), and further on in the book to cyberwarfare.\n\n## 5° 'Cyber Mania'\n\n10. Cyber mania is another phenomenon that complicates the relationship between international law and cybersecurity.⁴⁵ While the international developments in the field of cybersecurity sensu strictu have been limited, a considerable amount of academic attention and policy interest has been paid to the specific issue of 'cyberwarfare law'. According to O' CONNELL, it were the highly mediatized cyberattacks that took place in the 00's (Estonia 2007; Russo-Georgian conflict 2008; Stuxnet 2010)⁴⁶ that created this militarized image of cybersecurity law. However, the majority of cyber incidents do not reach the threshold of 'armed attack' in the sense of article 51 of the UN Charter.⁴⁷ In reality, cyber threats are more complex and diverse in nature, and they often target private companies.⁴⁸ Recent legislation, such as the European NIS Directive (which aims to protect providers of essential services and digital services such as online marketplaces) shows awareness of this more complex cyber reality, which we agree cannot be reduced to international war terms.⁴⁹\n\n## B. Interim conclusion\n\n11. Given these multiple challenges, of which this article highlighted just five, it is perhaps not surprising - or it is precisely so in view of the imminent need - that there exists no comprehensive international or European legislation in the field of cybersecurity sensu strictu.\n\n⁴⁵ W. von Heinegg, 'The Tallinn Manual and International Cyber Security Law', in T.

    "In recent years, attention did diversify away from cyberwarfare law, and i.e. the UN, EU, and certain national governments (through the means of National Cybersecurity Strategies) have devoted more attention to the issue. In the next section, the article will analyze the recent developments within the UN, with a specific focus to the work of the UN GGE. In the section thereafter, we will discuss the European NIS Directive.\n\n## III United Nations\n\nA. The UN Group of Governmental Experts: paving the way for international cybersecurity law?\n\n12. As discussed before, because of the nature of cyberspace, it was early on realized that cybersecurity demands for more than purely national regulation. Shortly after Edward Snowed changed the cybersecurity playing field, the UN GGE - established under the auspices of the First Committee of the UN General Assembly - published a report on 24 June 2013. The essence of the non-binding document is that it confirms that international law, and in particular the UN Charter, applies in cyberspace just like in the physical space.^[50]^ This includes the rules on state sovereignty and the principles resulting from the notion of sovereignty: for example, a State has jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure on its territory; and the State is responsible for international unlawful cyber acts that can be attributed to it.^[51]^\n\nIn its successive consensual report of 2015, the UN GGE put forward i.e. the following principles of the UN Charter and international law as applicable in cyberspace to state behavior: \"sovereignty, sovereign equality, peaceful conflict resolution, the prohibition of the use of or threat of violence against the territorial integrity or political independence of a State, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States\".^[52]^ This transposition to cyberspace of the basic principles of public international law, which almost all constitute binding customary law or have been confirmed by the International Court of Justice, is subject to a reasonable degree of agreement.^[53]^ As expressed before, the question is not really 'if' international law applies to cyberspace, but 'how', and importantly, whether it is translated efficiently and whether this suffices.^[54]^\n\n^[50] UN General Assembly, Report of Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the context of International Security, UN Doc.

    "13. The 2013 and 2015 UN GGE reports are non-binding soft law.⁵⁵ In this logic, they reflect that international law applies in cyberspace and they serve as an important indicator.⁵⁶ After all, several States, including certain cyber superpowers, have confirmed this applicability in their comments to the UN GGE reports and in their national cyber security strategies. This applicability was equally confirmed by the G20 states in 2015.⁵⁷ At that point in time, the reports by the UN GGE could be seen as a sign of growing consensus on the matter, and in this sense as evidence of the development of *opinio juris*, which is one of the elements needed to eventually create binding customary international law (art. 38(1)(c) Statute of the International Court of Justice).⁵⁸ Especially in the domain of international cybersecurity law, the manifestation of *opinio juris* can be deemed as imperative if one wants to argue that there exists customary law⁵⁹, as practice on cybersecurity is for the larger part either classified or contradictory, and states have shown to be reluctant to openly declare if and how they regulate cyberspace.⁶⁰ One can find elements that inform *opinio juris* i.e. in reports prepared by international organizations, such as the UN GGE reports. Seeing how international cybersecurity law is still in a formative state, any expressed *opinio juris* displays aspirations rather than commitments⁶¹ – yet they are still of importance. Then, in June 2017, during the fifth meeting of the UN GGE, any meaningful manifestation of the development of *opinio juris* came to an abrupt end. Fundamental differences between the 25 members emerged, mainly on the issue of self-defence rights and on applying international humanitarian law to cyber conflicts. The Cuban delegation refused to recognize the explicit reference in the text to the applicability of self-defence rights in cyberspace. According to the delegation, this would “legitimize an ICT war”.⁶² The Americans interpreted this as undoing all earlier progress made within the UN GGE.⁶³ Geopolitics aside, note that the 2013 UN GGE report confirmed the applicability of the UN Charter to cyberspace, and with this *implicitly* article 51 UN Charter⁶⁴,\n\n⁵⁵ K.

One cannot argue that the UN GGE 2013 and 2015 reports have become *opinio juris*, yet they still constitute an important indication of the applicability of international law to cyberspace, not only because the principal content of the reports has been reiterated by States on multiple occasions, but also precisely because the UN GGE reports restate the international *lex lata*.⁶⁶ The UN GGE is now, writing end of 2019, seemingly defunct⁶⁷: will there be a momentum to revive this exercise of diplomacy?\n\n## IV. EU Network and Information Security Directive 2016\n\n14. In parallel to, or following, the deadlock on cybersecurity law discussions on the international level, the European Union issued its first ever horizontal and legally binding instrument on cybersecurity *sensu strictu*, which aims to protect critical infrastructure (essential service providers and digital service providers) from cyber incidents that have a ‘significant disruptive effect’⁶⁸. The NIS Directive was issued in 2016 and had to be implemented in the different national legal orders. As HENRIKSEN professed, the deadlock within the UN GGE may lead to more regional initiatives with like-minded states, much like the European Directive we will now discuss.⁶⁹ The NIS Directive is an example of new rules being created after cybersecurity emerged as a policy problem, and not applying previously existing international law to a new context (e.g. UN GGE 2013 and 2015 reports and Tallinn Manual 2.0).\n\nOver the last few decades, critical infrastructure has become increasingly more reliant on the Internet, so that it is now essential “to our water, our power, our financial segment, our aviation industry and more”.⁷⁰ Note that the approach taken in the Directive is an “all hazards”\n\n⁶⁵ Article 51 Charter of the United Nations and Statute of the International Court of Justice, signed in San Francisco on 26 June 1945, entered into force on 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS XVI.\n⁶⁶ As does the Tallinn Manual 2.0.\n⁶⁷ S. Soesanto and F. D'Incau, ‘The UN GGE is dead: Time to fall forward’.\n⁶⁸ Art. 6 NIS Directive.\n⁶⁹ In the wake of the 2017 UN GGE ‘failure’, US Homeland Security advisor Tim Bossart expressed that “it was now time to consider other approaches…and that the U.S. will work with smaller groups of likeminded partners”. See T. Bossart, Remarks at Cyber Week 2017, Tel Aviv, 26 June 2017, online available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-homeland-security-advisor-thomas-p-bossert-cyber-week-2017/ (last accessed 8 November 2019). Think for example of the efforts by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on the Code of Conduct for Information Security or the previously mentioned African Union Convention. According to Henriksen, the regionalization of cybersecurity regulation into legal sub-systems of varying normative depth is unfortunate, given the global nature of the Internet. Yet Henriksen also admits that there are advantages to a more regional approach to cyber regulation, such as avoiding time-consuming negotiations, the perspective of reaching agreement on complex issues rather than just on the low-hanging fruits, etc. See A. Henriksen, ‘The end of the road for the UN GGE process: The future regulation of cyberspace’, 6.\n⁷⁰ Testimony of Admiral Michael Rogers, Hearing of the House Select Intelligence Committee, ‘Cybersecurity Threats: The Way Forward’, 20 November 2014 (Federal News Service Transcript). Other international organizations have equally raised awareness on the issue of cyber threats to critical infrastructure, see e.g. UN General Assembly, Report of Group of Governmental Experts on Information and Telecommunications Developments in the context of International Security, UN Doc. A/68/98, 24 June 2013, §9, 26(e), 30; C. Heinl, ‘Regional Cyber Security: Towards a Resilient ASEAN Cyber Security Regime’, RSIS Working Paper No. 263, 9\n\n11",
    "strategy⁷¹: to protect critical infrastructure from a range of cyber ‘incidents’⁷². The question addressed is whether networks are protected against incidents from any source; the Directive does not demarcate on the basis of the category of the threat (contrary to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, and the Tallinn Manual 2.0 rules on cyberwarfare operations in armed conflict).\n\n## A. Objective and context\n\n15. The EU launched a strategy for a digital single market in 2015; the NIS Directive, the General Data Protection Regulation (the famous 'GDPR')⁷³ and the eIDAS Regulation⁷⁴ all fall under this strategy.\n\nThe primary objective of the NIS Directive is mentioned in the preparatory works: “to guarantee a high common level of network and IT security”.⁷⁵ One of the main reasons for the creation of the NIS directive was that some EU member states did not have cybersecurity legislation in place, and even when they did, there were large divergences among nations. This goal is important seeing how \"cyber incidents are increasing in size, frequency and complexity and can result in business inability to do their jobs, significant financial losses to the EU economy and a loss of welfare for society\".⁷⁶ The fact that the Directive imposes obligations on providers of digital services indicates that the European legislator is aware that cyber incidents today are\n\nSeptember 2013, online available at https://www.rsis.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/rsis-pubs/WP263.pdf (last accessed 7 November 2019); Organization of American States, Critical Infrastructure Protection Programs: Cyber Security, online available at http://www.oas.org/en/sms/ ciche/programs_cyber.asp (last accessed 7 November 2019); Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Critical Information Infrastructures Protection, online available at http://www. oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/ciip.htm (last accessed 7 November 2019); M.

Note how the Shanghai Cooperation Organization went a step further than cooperation and awareness raising, and agreed in a treaty to cooperate on information security within critical infrastructures. The previously mentioned AU Convention obliges parties to undertake action to protect critical infrastructure. See Art. 3, Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of International Information Security, 16 June 2009, online available at https://ccdcoe-admin.aku.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SCO-090616-IISAgreement.pdf (unofficial English translation, last accessed 7 November 2019); Article 25(4) AU Convention on Cyber Security.\n\n⁷¹ Termed by D.

    "diverse and complex in nature⁷⁷, most of the time not reaching the threshold of ‘armed attack’ (article 51 UN Charter).\n\n16. The NIS Directive is legally binding. It is not particularly difficult to explain why consensus on legally binding measures could be found within the EU on this topic, and why it has proved more difficult within the UN. Apart from the like-minded group argument (supra), the NIS Directive primarily creates measures to protect critical infrastructure; for the latter, the role of the formal legislator is still quite clearly defined.⁷⁸ Moreover, since there exists a manageable working definition of \"critical infrastructures\"⁷⁹ and since this concern has long been voiced within cybersecurity discussions⁸⁰, the NIS Directive ignores some of the obstacles mentioned in numbers 5-10. In addition to this, as a country's critical infrastructure is most often located within its territory (e.g. drink water systems, hospitals, railways)⁸¹, and thus within its jurisdiction, governments can in principle (to a certain extent) protect it without necessarily relying upon public international law.⁸²\n\n17. Analyzing the NIS Directive is interesting, as the European legislator acknowledges the importance of imposing obligations upon the private sector. There are two entities onto which the Directives imposes obligations: the Member State government (1) and the private sector (2) (notably the providers of essential services mentioned in Annex II of the Directive and the providers of digital services mentioned in Annex II of the Directive).\n\n⁷⁷ See supra, no 10.\n⁷⁸ Supra, no 8.\n⁷⁹ See art. 2(a) EU Directive 2008/114/EC of the Council of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection, adopted on 8 December 2008, entered into force January 2009, Pb.

Fidler, 'Wither the Web: International Law, Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection', 9-10.\n\n13",
    "B. Measures at Member State level and cooperation with EU\n\n18. The NIS Directive imposes upon Member States obligations that can be summarized under the following three categories⁸³:\n\n1) Each Member State must ensure a minimum national capacity by designating NIS competent authorities (Art. 8 NIS Directive), by setting up computer crisis teams ('Computer Emergency Response Teams' - CERTs or 'Computer Security Incident Response Teams' - CSIRTs (Art. 9) and national NIS strategies and cooperation plans (Art. 7));\n\n2) National competent authorities should work together within a network that allows secure and effective coordination, including coordinated information exchange, and detection and response at EU level. Member States must exchange information and collaborate through this network to tackle NIS threats and incidents on the basis of the European NIS cooperation plan (Art. 11);\n\n3) One of the most important obligations for the Member State is to identify the providers of essential services (Art. 5). A culture of risk management shall be introduced and the private and public sectors shall exchange information with each other.\n\nC. Specific obligations for stakeholders in the private sector\n\n19. The Directive focuses on two types of entities in the private sector (Articles 1, 4, 5, 14, 16):\n\n- the providers of essential services⁸⁴;\n- digital service providers.\n\n20. In its Annex II, the NIS Directive specifies in a non-exhaustive way the sectors in which the Member States must search for the providers of essential services. These include the following sectors: banks, stock exchanges, transport and distribution of energy, air, rail and maritime transport, health, internet services and the government. Nuclear installations fall outside the scope of the Directive.⁸⁵\n\n21. \"Digital service providers\", the second private sector entity onto which the Directive imposes obligations, should be understood as online marketplaces, online search engines and cloud computer services. These are exhaustively listed in Annex II of the Directive. Note that\n\n⁸³ R. Roex, 'EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed', Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016.\n\n⁸⁴ According to Article 5 (2) NIS Directive, providers of essential services are entities that 'provide services that are essential for the maintenance of critical social and / or economic activities, the provision of that service depending on network and information systems and in which in the event of an incident this would have significant disruptive effects on the provision of that service'.\n\n⁸⁵ L. Lemmens, 'België werkt aan omzetting NIS-richtlijn voor uniforme beveiliging netwerk- en informatiesystemen', Commentary – Wolters Kluwer Online 22 November 2018.\n\n14",
    "during the legislative process, it was decided that many of the other suggested digital services were not critical enough.⁸⁶\n\n22. The most important obligations for providers of essential services and providers of digital services can be summarized as follows⁸⁷:\n\n- take appropriate technical and organizational measures to manage NIS risks;\n- prepare and implement business continuity plans;\n- notify the competent authority or CSIRT of an incident that has a significant impact.\n\nWhat exactly constitutes a cyber incident with a ‘significant disruptive impact’ is thus quintessential to the implementation of the Directive, yet the meaning of the broad term is unclear at this stage⁸⁸, and it remains to be seen how this will be applied in practice.\n\nD. Territorial scope\n\n23. Articles 5 and 18 of the NIS Directive clarify its territorial scope. For providers of essential services, each Member State where the provider has an establishment through which he offers essential services in that Member State will have jurisdiction. For digital service providers, this will be the Member State where the service provider has its headquarters and jurisdiction and its supervisory authority (one stop shop principle). If there are no headquarters in the EU, the provider or service provider must appoint a representative.⁸⁹\n\nV. Conclusion\n\n24. This article identified five factors underlying the difficult relationship between cybersecurity and international law. These are the speed at which global digitization is taking place as well as the nature of cyber operations (1), the fragmented jurisdiction and attribution problem (2), the question whether and to which extent the State and/or the private sector should have a regulatory role in cyberspace (3), whether transposing existing law onto the new technological context suffices, and (5) the phenomenon of 'cyber mania'.\n\n⁸⁶ R. Roex, ‘EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed’, Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016. Under the NIS Directive, Member States are not required to identify digital service providers, allowing for a ‘catch-all approach’. See D. Markopoulou, V. Papakonstantinou and P. de Hert, ‘The new EU cybersecurity framework: The NIS Directive, ENISA’s role and the General Data Protection Regulation’, Computer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 2019, 4.\n\n⁸⁷ Art. 14 and 16 NIS Directive. Affected Member States are informed when an incident has cross-border consequences. See also D. Markopoulou, V. Papakonstantinou and P. de Hert, ‘The new EU cybersecurity framework: The NIS Directive, ENISA’s role and the General Data Protection Regulation’, 5-6. R. Roex, ‘EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed’, Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016.\n\n⁸⁸ Some guiding elements to determine what a ‘significant disruptive effect’ is, are mentioned in articles 6, 14 and 16 of the NIS Directive, as well as in its Preamble (27), (28), (38).\n\n⁸⁹ Art. 5 and 18 NIS Directive; L. Lemmens, ‘België werkt aan omzetting NIS-richtlijn voor uniforme beveiliging netwerk- en informatiesystemen’, Commentary – Wolters Kluwer Online 22 November 2018; R. Roex, ‘EU keurt eerste algemene cybersecurity-wet goed’, Commentary - Wolters Kluwer Online 16 August 2016.\n\n15",
    "25. These factors contribute to the difficulties facing the UN GGE. We have made clear that the diplomatic deadlock in which the UN GGE process finds itself goes back to a geopolitical argument rather than a legal one: it was the explicit reference in the 2017 text to the applicability of self-defence rights and humanitarian law in cyberspace that led to the end of the negotiations, even though the previous reports had implicitly done precisely that, by stating that the UN Charter and thus article 51, applies in cyberspace. This article has shown that the 2013 and 2015 UN GGE reports do not constitute opinio juris, yet they are an important indication of the applicability of international law to cyberspace, not only because States, including some cyber superpowers, reiterated this on multiple occasions, but also because the UN GGE reports restate the international lex lata. The UN GGE, as the Tallinn Manual 2.0, is thus a prime example of applying pre-existing law to a new technological context.\n\nEnter the EU NIS Directive in 2016. As HENRIKSEN points out, the inertia on the international level may lead to more regional initiatives with like-minded States. The NIS Directive is the first horizontal and legally binding EU instrument on cybersecurity. The fact that consensus on legally binding measures could be found is partially because the Directive focuses on the protection of critical infrastructure, a domain in which the role of the State as legislator is still quite clearly defined and necessary, of which there exists a working definition, which is a concern that has long been voiced, and seeing how critical infrastructure such as hospitals, drink water systems and railways (Annex II NIS Directive) are usually located within the territory and thus jurisdiction of a State. Interestingly, the NIS Directive shows awareness of a changing, more complex and diverse cybersecurity landscape, by imposing obligations upon two entities in the private sector. Moreover, this testifies that the European legislator acknowledges that cybersecurity cannot be adequately guaranteed without involving the private sector. However, the fact that consensus on legally binding measures on the topic could be found, does not mean that the EU NIS Directive is a success: it remains to be seen how the nation States will interpret a 'cyber incident with a significant disruptive impact', without which the obligations of the Directive are meaningless. In that sense, one currently cannot overstate the success of the NIS Directive and inversely overstate the failure of the UN GGE: the latter made clear that international law does apply to state behavior in cyberspace, which indeed offers the necessary starting point.⁹⁰ Europe has less cyber superpowers around the table than does the UN GGE, and it may be likely that State actors in the latter forum are guilty of \"fence sitting\": on the international level, cyber superpowers and other nations may want to wait and see \"where the technology is going\", or because it is in the interest of their flexibility to \"maintain the current legal uncertainties\".⁹¹\n\n⁹⁰ A. Henriksen, ‘The end of the road for the UN GGE process: The future regulation of cyberspace’, 8.\n⁹¹ A. Henriksen, ‘The end of the road for the UN GGE process: The future regulation of cyberspace’, 5.\n\n16",
    "We know that international law applies in cyberspace ('if') – although it would be difficult to argue that the support for this principle has become opinio juris – and while the NIS Directive wanted to answer 'how' law applies in cyberspace, the question remains, depending on the factual interpretation of a 'significant disruptive impact'.\n\n17"
