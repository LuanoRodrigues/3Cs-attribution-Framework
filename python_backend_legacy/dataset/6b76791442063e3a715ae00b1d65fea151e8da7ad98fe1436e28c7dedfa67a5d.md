NATO member states have recognized cyberspace as a new domain of war – one through which adversaries will target CI to both commence and prosecute conflict. Given this: How do NATO member state militaries understand their part in protecting civilian CI from cyberattacks that constitute casus belli? Drawing on original, empirical evidence – 31 interviews and 1 focus group with senior military, defense, and intelligence cyber experts from 12 NATO states – this article argues that militaries regard themselves as unable, unauthorized, and ill-suited to protect CI from cyberattacks that initiate or occur in war. Instead, NATO member states overwhelmingly rely on private corporations (notably their civilian employees) for the protection of CI – including in violent conflict. This article provides original, empirical evidence to confirm the claim that the theory of Civil-Military Relations (CMR) falters when applied to cyberspace. It also asks cutting normative questions attendant with private corporations being on the front line of cyber-defense during war and argues that cyberspace obfuscates the boundaries of modern-day conflicts. This forces a re-examination of the military's role in 21st century wars.\n# ARTICLE HISTORY\nReceived 11 May 2024\nAccepted 13 January 2025\n# KEYWORDS\nCyber; Civil-Military Relations; NATO; militaries; critical infrastructure\n# Introduction\nWithin liberal democratic states, war is premised on the strict delineation between the military and civilian domains. However, cyberattacks against privately owned and operated civilian critical infrastructure (CI) are challenging this traditional distinction. Understanding the protection of CI from cyberattacks that constitute casus belli within NATO states is especially pressing, as the livelihoods of 1 billion people across 31 countries are at stake (NATO 2023a). In 2014, NATO formally acknowledged that cyberattacks could be considered an armed attack and thus could trigger Article 5 (Collective Defense) of the NATO Charter (NATO 2014). Since 2016, the Alliance has recognized cyberspace as a domain of military operations in which it \"must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea\" (NATO 2016a).

More recently, the U.S. 2023 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy (U.S. DoD 2023, 7) notes: “U.S. adversaries regularly use malicious cyber activity to target our critical infrastructure. In crisis, they will seek to hinder U.S. military mobilization, sow chaos, and harm the American people.” This is because CI are the very “systems upon which modern society, economy, and polity are seen to depend” (CISA n.d.) and so the disruption or destruction of which would have severe consequences for national security. Indeed, as Haataja (2022, 425) notes, there is a pervasive “recognition of the potentially devastating impact that cyber operations on CI can have.”\nWhilst there has been significant development in mandatory regulation for private corporations regarding cyber-defense, the role of militaries in protecting civilian CI from cyberattacks that can trigger or occur in war has received very little empirical attention. This absence is curious, especially as the military is the traditional state organ tasked with defending the nation against external threats arising to the level of an armed attack.\nSuch a lacuna might be explained by the fact that the prevailing theoretical approach to the role of the military -- Civil--Military Relations (CMR) -- struggles to coherently account for cyberspace as a new “domain” of conflict. Cyberspace raises questions pertaining to the role of the military in 21st century conflicts, creating tensions between prevailing CMR assumptions and the new ways in which wars are fought. This is because “cyberspace pushes questions of traditional boundaries of sovereignty, as well as blurs lines between the civilian and security sector” (Lantis and Bloomberg 2018, 152). State-sponsored adversarial attacks in cyberspace even challenge the very notion of war itself (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022). As a result, there is a theoretical opacity in CMR regarding the military's duties in defending privately owned civilian CI from cyberattacks that both trigger and occur in war.\nGreater scholarly enquiry is therefore required to interrogate this theoretical muddiness inherent in cyber-CMR. Specifically, almost no empirical attention has been afforded to test whether this cyber-CMR tension is reflected in the military's own understanding of its role in cyber-defense of civilian CI. This article aims to fill this gap. It does so by drawing on 31 semi-structured interviews and 1 focus group with cyber experts from 12 NATO states to test this theoretical opacity. How do military cyber experts from NATO member states understand their role in defending critical infrastructure against cyberattacks? We find that -- unlike acts of aggression emanating from land, air, and sea -- NATO military members believe they can not, should not, and are not authorized to defend CI against cyberattacks that could constitute casus belli. Instead, despite recognizing that cyberattacks against CI could trigger or form part of “the next war”, NATO member states rely on private owners and operators for the provision and protection of CI. This finding is crucial, as it challenges preconceived notions of the military taking the lead in defending the state (including from cyberattacks) during war. Departing from the extant literature, the article then critically explores the practical and normative implications of having private corporations on the front line of cyber-defense of CI, and the military taking a backseat during (cyber)war.\nThe paper begins with an overview of the prevailing theoretical framework for understanding the role of the military in conflict -- CMR. This is crucial to make sense of how militaries understand their role in defending the nation in/through cyberspace. After a review of the article's methodology, we present the empirical data obtained from the\ninterviews. This is followed by a discussion of the findings, highlighting the problematic logic of the current dynamic, and a normative and practical consideration of whether the military ought to be more involved in cyber-defense of civilian CI. The conclusion summarizes the findings and scopes avenues for future research.\n## (Cyber) Civil--Military Relations\nCMR elucidates the relationship between the armed forces, the people, and the state's civilian authorities: it stresses civilian control over the military, defines what it means to be a professional soldier in a democratic society (Huntington 1957; Janowitz 1960), and identifies which items of the national security agenda fall to the military (Finer 1962; Huntington 1957). It is with this latter aspect of CMR with which we are principally concerned because it pertains to the role of the military in cyber operations, and in the protection of critical infrastructure. The consensus in the literature and in practice has been to try to maintain the separation between the military and civilians when it comes to critical infrastructure protection (CIP) (Pačka and Mareš 2021). However, the development of cyberspace challenges the foundational theoretical assumptions of CMR in three ways.\nFirst, cyberspace inherently blurs the traditional division between foreign and domestic theatres, which has authorization complexities for the military operating on home soil. One of the main tenets of CMR is that the military “does not generally operate or deploy domestically” (Rudesill 2021, 247--248). As a result, the focus of the military (acting on behalf and at the behest of the civilian government) has been on defending against physical, foreign threats. Yet, this view has been somewhat altered since the collapse of the Soviet Union, when the new threat environment drew to the fore a more diverse set of security imperatives. Non-traditional security threats, such as terrorism, civil conflicts, pandemics, and natural disasters, have “compelled a world-wide re-thinking of the roles and missions of armed forces” within the CMR literature (Diamond, and Plattner 1996, x). “[V]irtually everywhere”, Bruneau and Matei (2012, 2) contend, “militaries and other security instruments are taking on new roles and missions”, such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR).\nThe changing character of national security forces militaries to adapt to a wider array of missions and to develop a broader purpose. But the military's focus largely remains on providing security from physical, external threats (Goodman 1996). In the 21st century, technological transformations altered the character of security and war yet again, forcing scholars to question whether CMR needs to be adjusted to protect states in “non-traditional battlefields,” notably cyberspace and outerspace. The boundaries between domestic and external security threats became increasingly obscured by transnational digital information systems (Rudesill 2021).\nAn important implication of this reality for CMR is a change of the main locus of military operations: “soldiers operating on the home front” might come to be seen as the rule rather than the exception (Rudesill 2021, 248). As put by Burton (2015, 302), cyberattacks “occur over a globally linked network of computer systems and can be launched without warning, in milliseconds, from anywhere on the planet.” Cyberspace, he argues, creates a new challenge for security organizations like NATO, which has “traditionally focused on geographically\nproximate security threats” (Burton 2015, 302). This brought others to argue that soldiers will be securing networks and countering intrusions against critical infrastructure (Jensen and Work 2018). The nature of transnational cyber threats, therefore, has important implications for the future role of the military, urging states to reconsider whether a physical, territorial distinction -- a separation between domestic and foreign theatres of operations -- is justified (or indeed even possible) in cyberspace.\nSecond, cyberspace challenges CMR's clear distinction between civilian and military domains because the cyberspace environment is inherently different from that of traditional, physical domains of war (land, air, and sea). As such, the traditional CMR boundaries between military and civilian spheres have become increasingly hazy. Pačka and Mareš (2021, 437) note: “In a common national security and defense ecosystem, the roles of players such as an army, police, intelligence agency, and others are set clearly and there is an evident division of labor ... cyberspace constantly changes the boundaries.” Cyberspace is “blurring the lines between the traditional expertise of the uniformed military and the roles and responsibilities of civilians” (Beehner, Brooks, and Maurer 2021, 5). This is especially the case because aggressions in cyberspace often target civilian persons or infrastructure (Sewall 2021).\nAs militaries become more involved in the cyber domain, they will inevitably conduct their operations over “international and domestic computer infrastructure that supports the dense lattice of digital-age civilian life” (Rudesill 2021, 248). As Sharpe, Trichas, and Terrill (2024, 5) note, “recognition of ... cyberspace as a critical domain ... represents a paradigm shift in military strategy.” Further distorting the distinction between civilian and military spheres is the fact that technological infrastructure is often dual-use and that militaries rely increasingly on civilian networks for their own operations (Fasana 2018). Consensus amongst CMR scholars seems to be that the uniqueness of the cyber domain requires “unorthodox” and innovative approaches to the organization of security and defense (Kallberg and Cook 2017, 8130), challenging, in the words of Brooks (2016, 359), existing “walls” between civilians and the military. As summarized by Chayes (2015, 187): “Civil and military roles are not easily sorted out in the area of cyberattacks and cyber warfare.”\nThird, cyberspace forces a revision not only of what it means to fight wars and of who is involved in warfighting but of the delineation between war and peace itself (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022; Sewall 2021). Constant contact and interconnectedness are key features of cyberspace, favoring initiative and pre-emption over passivity and reactive defense, meaning that states are incentivized to persistently exploit adversary vulnerabilities in order to gain and maintain the advantage (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022). This challenges the dominant Western understanding of war, premised on “use of force” and “armed attack” as the crossing of what is usually considered to be the boundary between war and peace. Unlike with conventional warfare, there is seemingly no strict division between war and peace in cyberspace. States are in a constant state of competition. NATO holds the view that “cyberspace is contested at all times” (NATO 2022). Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett (2022, 123) argue that this requires a paradigm shift in policy and strategy planning, one that would focus on an “increased tempo” of cyber military operations outside their own network, and continuous preparation and execution of cyber campaigns.\nAs the complexities of cyberspace are challenging the long-held clear division between war and peace, by extension, the clear separation between civilian and military spheres is also contested. Is there a need for “an increased tempo” of cyber military operations not only outside the defense's network but outside the unique context of war? That the military might play a role outside of warfighting is not new to cyberspace, as discussed above, and so it is justified to address the challenge of continuous competition in cyberspace and activities occurring in this space between peace and war.\nThe question that then flows from this is whether it matters at all when a cyberattack against CI reaches the threshold of an armed attack and triggers Article 5, especially with regards to the roles and responsibilities of cyber-defense. Surely, it does matter, because -- traditionally -- if states are at war, different agents become responsible for action (namely, the military). Yet in cyberspace, this does not seem to be the case, with this responsibility being entrusted to private actors even during conflict. Instead, it seems that the dissolution of the war-peace continuum in cyberspace is making it difficult for states to identify the appropriate response to cyberattacks against the nation's CI, both during the crisis phase, before Article 5 is invoked, and during war. It is with these kinds of cyberattacks, that could constitute casus belli or occur in war, that this article is concerned.\nOwing to these complexities, it is unclear “whether civil-military relations are sufficiently calibrated to protect ... in these non-traditional battlefields” where “warfare encompass[es] ... less-understood cyber-tools” (Beehner, Brooks, and Maurer 2021, 3). The foundational assumptions built into CMR paradigmatically accept that the military's role is in defending against physical, external threats, focused within war time and is wedded to the distinction between civilian and military responsibilities. But, as others have noted, cyberspace generates theoretical tensions regarding the applicability of these three a priori accepted precepts.\n## Research design and methodology: NATO case study\nIf cyberattacks on CI will inevitably feature in 21st century conflicts, then it is urgent to understand if and how the military, as the institution responsible for warfighting and defense on behalf of the state, understands its role. In other words, it is of paramount importance to test whether existing theoretical tensions are reflected empirically -- by going straight to the source. The justification for casing our study to NATO is because the alliance represents a significant proportion of the global population and serves as a key exemplar of dominant Western perspectives.\nWe conducted 31 semi-structured interviews with military and defense cyber subject matter experts (SMEs) from 12 NATO member states, and 1 focus group of 7 military cyber experts. Representatives from Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Estonia, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US) participated in the research. These countries were chosen based on access (at the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Tallinn and at the NATO Headquarters in Brussels) and expertise within the NATO alliance regarding cyber-defense, including states that are technologically advanced and at the forefront of cyber affairs in practice, and others that are not as well positioned. Among NATO states, cyber-defense of CI is a national responsibility and as such, strategies vary across nations but clear similarities can be found. This illustrates that regardless of a state's level of\n“cyber-awareness,” most NATO members share similar views on the role of the military regarding the cyber-defense of CI. It also illuminates an apparent disconnect between traditional CMR assumptions regarding the role of the military in territorial defense against external threats and current military perceptions across NATO states. It is also important to note that cyber-offense has its own very specific construct -- Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies (SCEPVA) -- which we do not explore in this paper.\nBy “cyber subject matter experts” we mean military members (officers and enlisted) and civilians (policy advisors) working for defense ministries and at the NATO Headquarters, whose principal occupation is with matters of cyberspace -- both offense and defense. The interview participants included senior military officials (including two-star generals) and cyber experts and lawyers from the military and other government departments (including ministries of defense and intelligence agencies) from NATO member states.\nInterviewees were assured that their views would not be taken as representative of NATO or their “home” state, military, or department, and that their identity would be anonymized. Accordingly, quotes have not been assigned to specific roles or states in order to mitigate the risks associated with attribution, particularly those arising from cross-referencing. The goal of conducting these interviews was not to examine differences in cultural approaches across NATO members, although this would be a valuable future study.\nA note on limitations. One limitation pertaining to the approach of this research is that, by focusing on military perspectives only, the research excludes other crucial stakeholders such as private-sector partners and other public agencies like police, local cyber task forces and computer emergency response teams (CERTS). Notably, we do not examine what the private owners and operators of CI (CEOs and/or employees) consider as the appropriate role of the military in cyber-defense. This question, albeit important, requires a separate, substantive future investigation -- one that, due to space constraints, we could not explore here. Instead, our interest lies with understanding the military's role in defending the nation against cyberattacks, a question that is best answered by those working in defense who are across the current military cyber posture. That said, the participants also included representatives from intelligence agencies, who work closely with their military counterparts and who have important responsibilities in both cyber-offense and cyber-defense in many countries. These interviewees were well placed to differentiate the role of the military and that of intelligence agencies in responding to a cyber event, confirming some issues raised by defense interviewees in terms of cyber-CMR.\n## NATO militaries' perceptions of cyber-defense of CI\nIn the words of the interviewees, the purpose of the military is to “serve, protect, and defend” the state and the population against foreign aggression. However, when asked how the military discharges this responsibility to protect citizens from adversarial cyberattacks on CI either triggering or happening in war, all of the interviewees stated that the military was ill-suited or ill-prepared to intervene, even in the case where it might be asked to do so. We also found that, despite cyberspace being recognized as a domain of\nmilitary operations, military members' understanding of their role reflects the complexities of the cyber war-peace continuum. Three recurring narratives emerged from the interviewees when describing the limits of their role. Each chime with the three tensions articulated in cyber-CMR above: the uniqueness of the domain, the blurring of foreign/domestic theaters, and what this means for understanding war. To begin, however, we survey how militaries presently engage in cyber-defense of CI.\n### Defending forward, persistent engagement, and integrated deterrence\nNATO member militaries are engaged in collecting, analyzing, and exchanging intelligence with other government agencies, the private sector, and NATO allies (U.S. DoD 2023). Information collection and sharing is considered an integral aspect of cyber-defense (NATO 2016b, U.S. DoD 2023). When private corporations identify a threat in their system and pass that information along to government agencies, such public agencies then make recommendations regarding how the private companies ought to rectify the vulnerability and voluntarily assist in that process (which, in many instances, can be declined by the corporation). Yet, importantly (for reasons we explore below), according to one of our interviewees: “the government won't go into anyone's systems: they have a coordination role, but otherwise it's hands off the keyboard” (Participant 18, 2019).\nMoreover, NATO state militaries are authorized (and indeed required) to take proactive measures to ensure the cybersecurity of their own military systems -- principally to ensure continued operability across the traditional, physical domains of armed conflict. The desire to enhance the cyber resilience of the Alliance was reiterated at the 2023 Vilnius Summit (NATO 2023b). As a senior military officer explained, however, “the primary concern of the military is to ensure our cyber systems are working so we can do kinetic defense: the military has a monopoly on kinetic defense, not cyber” (Participant 12, 2019).\nA few of the interviewees stated that the military is engaged in what has long been understood as “active defense:” “defensive operations that involve direct engagement with sophisticated adversaries in DoD-controlled cyberspace” (DARPA 2012). The U.S. in particular has employed the notion of “defending forward” (Healey 2019; Kosseff et al. 2019) which aims to pre-emptively “stop threats before they reach their targets” (U.S. Department of Defense 2018, 2) and which was developed in response to criticisms that the military was not proactively defending critical infrastructure against cyberattacks (Former US Cyber Command official, personal communication with author, 2020). “Defending forward,” “active defense,” and “persistent engagement” were born out of the recognition that the U.S. could not expect private corporations to defend themselves against the full power of an adversarial state. Both approaches form part of what the U.S. now regards as “integrated deterrence,” developed in the most recent DoD Cyber Strategy (2023, 2), which focuses on using military cyber capabilities “in concert with other instruments of national power.”\nFurther still, the military would likely be the apparatus called upon by the state in the “response” phase of a devastating cyberattack (Participants 8, 14, 16, 22). The military would be responsible for launching a cyber or kinetic counter-offensive, following appropriate attribution processes (proportionality, necessity, and distinction factors\nconsidered). But such responses are necessarily ex post facto. As was expressed in the focus group (2019): “Reacting after the fact is a losing strategy.” Until then, the front line of defense -- with public sector support, especially intelligence agencies -- is the private corporations.\n### The effectiveness narrative: can not\nPreviously, it has been thought that -- in the context of NATO and specifically the U.S. -- the resources and expertise on cyber-defense and cyberwar was retained by the military (Burton 2015; O'Connell 2012). Our empirical evidence finds the opposite to be the case. Most of the interviewees argued that their respective militaries currently lack the necessary resources, human-power, and relevant expertise required to effectively defend CI from cyberattacks. As a result, the interviewees consistently highlighted that, due to the nature of the domain, the military is unable to protect civilian CI from cyberattacks -- even those that can trigger or occur in war. One interviewee compared this lack of cyber capability with traditional, kinetic attacks: “The military is the only institution or organization to defend against armed attacks, because they're the only ones who have fighter planes. But in a cyberattack, Cyber Command won't be first [to respond], because they don't have the capability” (Participant 19, 2019). Another senior military officer (Participant 3, 2019) reflected that attention ought to be focused on pragmatically determining which organization is likely to be most successful in providing cyber-defense: “It's about having the right tools, and the right knowledge ... the military might not be best placed to defend certain infrastructure.” For instance, interviewees rightly pointed out that in many countries intelligence agencies play a significant role in the cyber-defense of the nation and its critical infrastructure, notably by advising and assisting other government agencies and the private sector (see for instance GCHQ n.d.; Government of Canada n.d.).\nA few interviewees also noted that because the private corporations that own and operate CI use different and often “tailor-made” platforms, it would be almost impossible for cyber experts in the military to be sufficiently knowledgeable to defend across all the different systems. It is “unimaginable” for the military to help, one interviewee reflected, “because they are completely unfamiliar with the systems” (Participant 9, 2019).\nSome of the interviewees argued that it would be financially ineffective or even prohibitively expensive to have the military provide cyber-defense for CI: it is “better to let the private sector deal with it,” because having the government provide the cyber-defense for critical infrastructure would be “implausible and expensive” (Participant 12, 2019). “Private corporations should be responsible,” one interviewee stated, “otherwise there would be a lot of taxpayers' money required to provide [protection for] those systems -- like a ‘cybersecurity tax' for providing cyber-defense of critical infrastructure” (Participant 9, 2019). The interviewees' perception echoes the sentiment highlighted in the literature on critical infrastructure protection that private owners are best placed to establish cyber-defenses (Carr 2016; Dunn Cavelty and Suter 2009; Newlove-Eriksson, Giacomello, and Eriksson 2018; Pačka and Mareš 2021).\nThe environment narrative: should not\nWhen discussing why the military does not play a greater role in protecting CI from cyberattacks -- as they would if the “armed attack” was emanating from other domains of war -- the interviewees stated that this is because “cyberspace is fundamentally different” (Participant 15, 2019). The participants overwhelmingly referred to cyberspace's ubiquitous, borderless, fluid, and invisible nature. The interviewees emphasized the relatively abstract characteristics of cyberspace identified in the literature (Barnard-Wills and Ashenden 2012; Branch 2021; Mainwaring 2020; Wright 2018) as affecting the military's ability to help defend. One government official simply stated: “cyber is a different domain; we haven't figured out how it works” (Participant 22, 2019). Another interviewee reflected: “In cyber, the fog of war is heightened” (Participant 11, 2019). Interviewees also referred to the difficulty of determining whether sovereignty is applicable to cyberspace and where borders might begin and end, thereby touching on the ongoing debate between NATO member states about whether sovereignty is applicable to cyberspace.\nIn most instances, the interviewees' reference to sovereignty was intended to highlight that, unlike in sea, air, and land -- which have clear, physical borders that can be transgressed -- cyberspace has no such border. The interviewees often highlighted the difficulty of defending against cyberattacks by comparing cyberspace with the physical domains of warfighting: “You can see equipment like frigates and airplanes,” one interviewee noted, “but you can't see firewalls or malicious code” (Focus group 2019).\nA majority of interviewees also argued that the military does not have a significant role in defending CI from cyberattacks that could trigger war or happen in war because -- again, in contrast to the physical domain -- it is an “unchartered territory” and so “the line between government and private” is “blurred” (Participants 16, 18 and 26, 2019). A few interviewees drew parallels with the other services, claiming that “we've had an army, navy, and air force for a long time, but cyberspace is new” (Participant 13, 2019). These comments are reminiscent of the remarks made by Lt. Col. Kurt Sanger, Chief Judge Advocate for National Security Law at U.S. Cyber Command at the 2019 CyCon U.S: “For most of the domains, you have thousands of years and millions of warriors contributing to the lessons that you're now learning ... We don't have that in cyberspace” (Sanger 2019, quoted in Pomerleau 2019). In short, cyberspace itself was thought by the interviewees as an inherently exposed space, with points of vulnerabilities too vast to comprehend. As one officer put it, “cyberspace is un-defendable” (Participant 12, 2019). These responses align with what Cate (2015, 307) identifies as the prevailing “sense of despair about the size and complexity of the challenge.”\nOur empirical evidence highlights that the military believes it should not play a significant role in defending CI. In doing so, it thereby supports the extant theoretical claim that cyberspace distorts the lines between the domestic vs. foreign spheres and forces an alteration of traditional territorial and sovereign conceptions of defense. This further illustrates the dissolution of the traditional division between civilian and military sectors in CMR due to the unprecedented nature of the domain.\nThe authorization narrative: not permitted\nThe last narrative that emerged from the interviewees' responses is that of “authorization.” A third of the interviewees noted that the military is not permitted to operate on domestic soil. Typically, within NATO states, the military is not automatically authorized to conduct what are considered police enforcement duties: for instance, the U.S. Posse Comitatus Act, signed in 1878, is designed to prohibit the deployment of the military to enforce domestic civilian policies and practices “unless expressly authorized by the Constitution or an act of Congress” (Congressional Research Service 2018). It seems that this is what most of the interviewees were referring to when raising concerns regarding “authorization.” Many participants explained that this is a “design reality” of the democratic system, which means that states are constrained and restrained by their legal environment (Participants 1, 2 and 13, 2019). As one interviewee articulated, “the legislation is not adjusted for the realities of cyberspace” (Participant 7, 2019), while another reflected, “if we want to live in a liberal, democratic society, this is what we get” (Participant 17, 2019).\nSome interviewees highlighted that the military would be called upon, by the state, to operate in the territory of that sovereign state in the instance that there is an actual use of physical force against the state. As one interviewee explained: “Obviously if our ‘friends' in the East rolled tanks across the border right now, our forces would be authorized to act in the state to repel that assault. It wouldn't be the police's job” (Participant 15, 2019).\nAdditionally, a few interviewees raised concerns regarding privacy as a barrier to greater military involvement. One military officer noted that: “[People] are OK that we have ships, border patrol, flight deterrence ... But with cyber, people don't want the government to look into their Internet connectivity” (Participant 18, 2019). Overall, the interviewees consistently stated that the military would be called upon to protect the sovereign state from a land invasion, naval assault, or airborne missile strike against CI -- but this would not be the case regarding a comparable assault emanating from cyberspace.\nThe three narratives empirically confirm the tension highlighted in the literature on cyber-CMR. It further resonates with the 2023 U.S. Cyber Strategy that the Department of Defense “lacks the authority to employ military forces to defend private companies against cyberattacks” and that there are “limited circumstances in which military cyber forces would be asked to defend civilian critical infrastructure -- the Department will not posture itself to defend every private sector network” (U.S. DoD 2023, 13). In short, NATO member militaries do not believe they play a major role in cyber-defense of CI that initiates or occurs amidst war due to environment, effectiveness, and authorization complexities. As one interviewee noted: “There is a contradiction between the fear of cyberattacks, [and the fact that] we [the people] ... don't want the military to play a bigger role” (Participant 18, 2019).\n## Critical discussion of the military perspective\nThere are three key findings that arise from the empirical evidence. First: the military members affirm the perception of the blurred nature of cyber-CMR described above. Second: the minimal military involvement raises urgent questions regarding CI that will\nbe targeted in war. Third: while regulations have improved in the past few years, it is the private corporations that are principally responsible for protecting CI from sophisticated state-sponsored cyberattacks during war. These findings invite a re-examination of the role of the military in 21st century conflicts.\n### A reflection of political will and political choices\nOne of the explanations invoked by the interviewees for why the military is not more involved in the cyber-defense of CI is because the military currently lacks the financial and human resources to do so (the effectiveness narrative). Some might claim that it is unreasonable to reassign some military funding for cyber-defense of CI in the face of “defense austerity” -- although in the U.S. this notion is debatable, as the proposed 2024 budget for the entire DoD totaled $842 billion (Congressional Budget Office 2023). One interviewee argued that this objection is misplaced, as taking proactive security measures prior to an “inevitable cyberattack against critical infrastructure” is a more fiscally responsible decision from the outset (Participant 4, 2019).\nFunds already allocated to the acquisition of traditional kinetic weapons could (again, hypothetically) be redirected toward: the military's development of defensive cyber technologies for CI, the recruitment of more military cyber personnel, and the expansion and implementation of CIP military training programs. Other interviewees instead reiterated an absence of political will for states to invest highly in something as intangible as cybersecurity: “Guns and tanks and fighter jets are sexier. They're sexier and easier for politicians to show off for their next election campaign, that they're doing something for national security ... [They're] not really able to show off lines of code” (Focus group, 2019).\nAside from the fiscal element is the ostensible “novelty” and “unknowable-ness” of cyberspace as to why they “should not” be involved in defense of CI (the environment narrative). Confusion surrounding cyberspace's distinct character is something that is debated in the literature (Bringsjord and Licato 2015). Nonetheless, there is a risk of “succumbing to the shock of the new” (Betz and Stevens 2011, 87). Erroneously perceiving the form of a domain as inherently enigmatic stymies progress toward establishing effective defense systems. Considering other “newer” domains of war, one interviewee compared cyberspace to the air force: no “historical accident ... the air force was born out of the need for defense from attacks in airspace in the 20th century” (Participant 28, 2019). It is a political choice to allocate the main face of defense in war to private corporations.\nMoreover, whilst the military is prima facie prohibited from operating on domestic soil, the authorization narrative should be interrogated further. Indeed, the military could -- and would -- be called upon by the state to operate in its sovereign territory if there is an actual use of physical force tantamount to an armed attack. In the face of cyberattacks that do reach the level of an armed attack and that could trigger NATO's Article 5, conceivably, the military would be authorized to get involved in the cyber-defense of civilian CI systems. Theoretically at least, cyber aggressions comparable to armed attacks do not pose a significantly new challenge for civil--military relations. Nonetheless, the research finds that even with this kind of attack that could constitute casus belli, or occur during war, uncertainty remains within the military regarding the\nextent to which they would be authorized (or able) to get involved in the cyber-defense of private networks. Even when faced with cyberattacks that would amount to an armed attack, or during war, the military would not be able to effectively help defend CI. The militaries' current (and limited) ability and expectation to provide cyber-defense of CI is a political calculation. One defense personnel reflected: “I feel that there is a growing need for more cyber units in the military, and since cyber has now been recognized as a proper domain of armed conflict on par with air, land, sea and in some cases also space, I think it will happen ... It is just a question of how it will evolve, and through which means. (Participant 16, 2019)”\nNevertheless, according to the interviewees, this is likely only after some “catastrophic” cyberattack on CI (Participants 8 and 29, 2019). The current decision to rely heavily on private corporations, albeit with mandatory reporting and compliance mechanisms, is a political choice.\n### Concerns surrounding “dual-use” infrastructures\nA further implication of minimal military involvement is how to deal with “dual-use” CI. Civilian CI has been and will continue to be targeted by adversarial actors as part of war (Wallace and Reeves 2020). One interviewee stated: “There is no such thing as a ‘military' cyberattack; 90% of the time it will be against civilian infrastructure” (Participant 22, 2019). According to another: “Adversaries will -- and already do -- attack critical infrastructure as a primary target via cyberspace, because it's what we would do” (Participant 7, 2019). States will likely seek to disable CI in war in order to gain a military advantage.\nAs per international cyber norms regarding responsible state behavior, there is a prohibition of “cyber operations that cause intentional damage or impairment to critical infrastructure (CI)” (Haataja 2022, 423). CI should be -- in the words of then U.S. President Joe Biden -- “‘off limits' to attack” (cited in Haataja 2022, 425). Of course, only military objects and combatants are liable to be lawfully targeted in war; according to the International Humanitarian Law (IHL) principle of distinction, intentionally targeting civilians and civilian CI (including via cyber) is prohibited (ICRC 2023). Nevertheless, the urgency of preparing the military to contribute to the defense of CI is even more apparent given the potential for civilian CI to be rendered a liable military objective. This is because civilian CI can: i) become co-opted for military purposes, ii) have a “military utility,” or iii) be “dual-use” (Schmitt 2017, 128--135).\nThere are three concerns raised here. First, if (privately owned) CI networks become “dual-use” or are of “military utility,” they become military objectives and thus may be lawfully targeted. As Horowitz (2024, 327) notes: a “privately owned civilian aviation air traffic control tower that the enemy military temporarily uses to enable offensive operations” might be rendered a military objective “because of its ‘use.'” Moreover, according to the Tallinn Manual 2.0: if critical infrastructure is being used by both civilian and military ends, and it is “impossible” to differentiate between the civilian and military parts of a system, “the entire network ... qualifies as a military objective” (Schmitt 2017, 135).\nSecond, because of the invisible nature of cyberspace, it is additionally challenging to differentiate between civilian vs. military cyber infrastructures. As such, there is\nforeseeably a large scope for misinterpretation and accidental military targeting of CI. Third, it is unclear whether preparatory acts on “dual-use” infrastructures during peacetime -- such as the insertion of dormant malware -- constitutes an attack or strictly cyber-espionage. Haataja (2022, 424, 428) highlights that there is a danger for pre-positioned adversarial code in CI that could be activated later, a practice known as “persistent presence” in CI. Simply planting malware or creating “backdoors” certainly violates international cyber norms and could be considered a breach of a state's obligation under international law (others consider such cyber norms “voluntary, non-binding”) (Haataja 2022, 428--31). But such cyber-operations themselves are unlikely to rise to the level of an armed attack. Activating a dormant malware in a privately owned CI, such as a nuclear powerplant, causing it to explode, would foreseeably reach that threshold. All of this points to the complexity of defending CI from cyberattacks that constitute casus belli or may be pursued in war.\n### A degree of (risky) faith in the private sector\nPrivate corporations that own and operate CI ought to provide appropriate cyber-defensive measures -- especially to protect what one interviewee called “low-hanging fruits” (Participant 3, 2019). Nonetheless, as one interviewee noted: “We can't expect private companies to protect themselves against state-sponsored attacks” (Participant 23, 2019). Many interviewees expressed having “faith” in private corporations adhering to proper standards and regulations: “We hope they [the private corporations] do the right thing” (Participant 8, 2019).\nUsing the physical domain as an analogy, the private owners of a power grid would be expected to employ a reasonable degree of security -- locking doors, installing surveillance cameras, erecting wire fences, and employing security guards, and so on. However, the security guard would not be expected to defend against an attack that rises to a use of force tantamount with war. Defense from in-coming ballistic missiles would fall to the state and -- foreseeably -- the air force: “In the physical world, we don't require companies to have an air force, or submarines, or to really look at the pointy end of an attack” (Hanson 2021).\nYet whilst companies have oversight, assistance, and mandatory regulations from government, the front line of defense in cyberspace remains the purview of companies. It is often in their profit margins interests to ensure their cyber-defenses are in order, and to work closely and collaboratively with government agencies to redress vulnerabilities or incursions. Beyond purely monetary interests, corporations could be appealed to do so on the notion of “loyalty” (Christensen and Petersen 2017, 1440). They may be incentivized to effectively participate in the provision of cyber-defense based on “a moral commitment to ‘solidarity' and ‘community responsibility'” (Christensen and Petersen 2017, 1440). One senior government official iterated this patriotic duty to “protect our lifestyle” (Participant 22, 2019). For instance, when asked about who is defending Ukrainian CI from Russian cyberattacks, one retired general responded: “The private corporations in Ukraine are doing an excellent job” (General [retd.], personal communication with author, 2022). Similarly, Matania and Sommer (2023, 3) note that “Tech Titans” (Google,\nMicrosoft, Meta, Apple, SpaceX and Amazon) are playing a meaningful role in the armed conflict in Ukraine.\nThat said, as one interviewee reflected: “appealing towards companies' patriotism ... is probably not the safest way to do things” (Participant 13, 2019). Even if a private corporation is “homegrown,” it does not guarantee that they are, in fact, patriotic. “Company Over Country” was Meta CEO and Founder Mark Zuckerberg's early motto (Losse 2018). Similarly, the whistle blower Haugen (2021, 2) iterated that -- when torn between “its own profits and [the U.S.'] safety,” Meta “consistently ... favor[ed] its own profits.” This demonstrates that American-owned corporations have prioritized financial gains over that of the security of the American people. Such a dynamic becomes even more problematic if CI corporations in NATO member states are outsourced and owned by foreign corporations.\nPerhaps “profits before patriotism” is strictly a feature of peacetime: once it comes to war, the dynamic will flip. For instance, by May 2022 Google had pledged approximately $55 million in support of Ukraine's resistance of Russian aggression (Matania and Sommer 2023, 11). Similarly, within days of the full-scale invasion, Microsoft moved Ukraine's critical government data to its cloud storage platform (Microsoft 2022). This was because most of the data was “extremely vulnerable to missile attacks, and their physical destruction could paralyze the entire work of the country's top leadership” (Microsoft 2023).\nYet the view that corporations would be driven by patriotism (or, more accurately, defense of liberal values) over profit hinges on two, risky assumptions. In the first instance, it takes for granted that the CI private corporation heralds from, or is ideologically aligned with, the country under (cyber)attack -- which is not necessarily always the case. It supposes the private corporation may not be under pressure from the attacking-state or wishes to remain neutral, or had been convinced to allow the attack to take place (due to corruption, coercion, or ideological leanings). There is no guarantee for support. There is no expectation for patriotism even from corporations that are (for lack of a better word) “home grown.”\nIn the second instance, it is also not clear how long “patriotic” support or commitment to democratic liberal ideals -- even if it is forthcoming -- might last. While Elon Musk's SpaceX initially sent Starlink satellites to the Ukrainian military for free, it eventually stated it could no longer foot the bill, and the Pentagon had to pick up the tab -- once the reliance on Musk's service had been firmly established (conceivably with an agenda to accrue profits). Moreover, demonstrating the selectivity of private sector support, when the Ukrainian military conducted an offensive into the Russian-held Crimea, they begged Elon Musk to turn on its satellite service in the Russian-controlled area, but he refused to do so because (according to his post on X) he feared SpaceX's complicity in “a major act of war and conflict escalation” (Musk 2023). Betting on private corporations' patriotism and political alliances or appetite for war, over that of their foundational and raison d'être interests in profit, is to gamble with national (cyber) defense. If there is a profit to be made, corporations might choose to get involved in conflicts (even distant ones), but they might stop to be involved when it is no longer financially advisable.\nOur empirical data suggests that -- unlike kinetic acts of war emanating in land, air, and sea -- the military is not responsible for defending against state-sponsored acts of\naggression against CI via cyberspace. However, trusting private corporations to adequately defend against cyberattacks in war is a risky security strategy.\n## Should militaries be more involved? Normative and practical considerations\nAs detailed in the previous section, multiple interviewees remarked on the risks associated with dual-use infrastructure and with being overly reliant on private corporations to provide cyber-defense of CI. Relatedly, some participants expressed concerns about not being readied and resourced to defend CI against cyberattacks. This prompts the question: might there be a case for increasing military involvement in cyber-defense of CI? After all, the military is the principal body responsible for defending civilians (on behalf of the state) from acts of aggression rising to war. Former NATO Deputy Secretary General Rose Gottemoeller et al. (2022) expressed the need for NATO Allies to be better prepared in response to cyberattacks. This requirement is especially pertinent, as Burton (2015, 302) remarks, “cyber operations are increasingly part of [conflicts involving NATO forces] and an element of the strategy of NATO's main state adversaries.” To be clear, we are not in any way suggesting a “military-takes-all,” zero-sum approach to defending CI from cyberattacks that trigger Article 5. The normative question is whether militaries should be readied -- as a last line of defense -- to help protect alongside private corporations and public bodies (such as intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and federal and local cyber task forces).\nOne objection to greater military involvement is the potential for escalation. A cyber-defensive operation led by the military could be perceived by an adversary as a cyber countermeasure, resulting in a “tit-for-tat escalation of cyberattacks and responses, each one more serious than the last” (Hollis and Ohlin 2018, 448). An increased role of the military in providing cyber-defense of CI may therefore lead to “a permissive normative-legal environment in which states are more likely than before to resort to uses of force” (Heinze and Neilsen 2020, 186).\nA related normative concern is that the increased role of the military in cyber-defense of CI begets the militarization of cyberspace. The perception of the military being involved in a civilian network, even for strictly defensive purposes, may render it a military target. But simply because the military may be called upon, as a last resort, to aid in the cyber-defense of CI does not render the civilian objective ipso facto a military target. In the same way that the military might be called upon to help defend a hospital (for instance) from kinetic attacks, the military presence does not automatically render the hospital a liable military objective.\nAnother further objection might be that introducing the military as an agent of cyber-defense of CI risks increasing the potential for abuse -- notably, through mass militarized surveillance or the military placing pressure on private corporations to act in certain ways. Relatedly, there may be normative concerns regarding competing authorities -- an unnecessary duplication of responsibilities and confusion over which entity precisely (the private organization vs. intelligence agency vs. the military) acts in what contexts. Within the extant literature, Public--Private Partnerships in CI protection are already regarded as notoriously fraught with complications pertaining to cooperation, information sharing, and trust (Carr 2016; Dunn Cavelty and Suter 2009). For instance, one interviewee noted that -- on the issue of information sharing of breaches -- “private companies won't ‘sho\ntheir hand' ... they would rather sell the intelligence than give it away for free” (Participant 9, 2019). Surely adding another agent into the mix will make cyber-defense more complex.\nA reply to these two objections is that the military should only get involved when: i) the private entity is unable or unwilling to respond, ii) that the aid of the existing public agencies is insufficient, or iii) that the cyberattack would (through its scale and effects) constitute an armed attack. What should be envisaged is a live, cooperative triage system, whereby the military might be deployed only to help defend CI, should the attack foreseeably trigger war or take place in war, or if other responders have failed to address the threat and require additional assistance.\nOne further objection is that increasing military involvement generates a moral hazard for the private sector. Specifically, if the military is offering a pseudo-“security umbrella,” private corporations may be disincentivized to invest in necessary cybersecurity measures and instead increase their risk tolerance (as per prospect theory). Cybersecurity is costly and time-consuming; saving on cybersecurity would likely increase corporations' profits, and energy and resources could be redirected to other parts of business.\nHowever, there are several considerations that would foreseeably mitigate this moral hazard. Corporations risk extreme reputational damage and services by relying too heavily on possible military defense: corporations must still provide adequate levels of cybersecurity that sufficiently defend against the vast majority of cyberattacks, which are criminal or low-level intrusions. Further, corporations would rather deal with cyber-defense issues in house and (as our interviewees noted) are wary about freely “opening the doors” to the military. These are serious objections to increasing military involvement. But it is also pertinent to examine the normative implications if states do not increase military involvement.\nFirst, the existing requirement for private corporations to be on the “front line” of cyber-defense of CI means demanding that civilians be responsible for defending against disastrous acts of (cyber)war. Even if they are not explicitly conscripted (more on this below) it is the civilian employees of those private sectors who nonetheless currently shoulder national cybersecurity duties. “Like the soldiers in the fortress,” Brenner and Clarke (emphasis added, 2010, 1032) reflect, “computer personnel confronting a cyberattack are responsible for defending their ‘territory' from hostile activity.”\nThis blurring of civilian and military spheres -- the expectation of civilians in corporations to not only contribute to but bear the weight of defending the state from cyber-attacks in war -- opens Pandora's box regarding pressing legal, normative, and practical questions. Is the expectation to participate in cyber-defense during war articulated in the employees' contracts? Are these civilian employees permitted to excuse themselves, or conscientiously object to participating in war, or will they be forced to fight, albeit with code over cobalt? Are employees aware of this possibility as part of their day job? If civilian operators on the cyber front-line “abandon their posts” -- literally removing hands from keyboards -- should they be court-martialed?\nWorse still: What if individual civilians, unbeknownst to their corporate managers, sympathize with the aggressor state, or have been compromised by the aggressor (via blackmail, bribery, or disinformation)? This may lead employees to feign cyber-defense and even aid the cyberattacker. Indeed, one of the interviewees worried that “moles are already there in the private sector,” and that such “moles” may be feeding\nsensitive information to adversaries, or even disrupting the systems on behalf of a foreign state (Participant 15, 2019). After all, these privately employed civilians (unlike military personnel) have not pledged allegiance to their (respective) flags. Even if the corporation leadership is patriotic, how can we be sure of the political allegiances of its civilian employees, especially as many are unlikely to have undergone security checks? If private corporations are “fighting” in war, might such corporations (or their CEOs, like Musk, or individual civilian operators) be tempted to aggressively hack-back?\nFurthermore, at what point does a civilian (both based in and, crucially, outside the country waging war) become a direct participant in hostilities and become a liable target for cyber and kinetic strikes under IHL? Horowitz (2024, 322) remarks that -- following an “expansive interpretation of the temporal element of [direct participation in hostilities (DPH)]” under IHL -- “a tech company employee who engages in DPH,” including strictly cyber-defense, “even if only infrequently during a work week from their office, might lose protection from attack not only while they engage in those specific acts of DPH but also continuously from morning to night and at home for an extended period of time.” Even if a narrow view of the temporal aspect of DPH is adopted -- wherein a civilian may only be targeted “for such time” that she is actively contributing to military activity via cyber-defense -- this dynamic creates a “revolving door” for civilians “who repeatedly engage in DPH” (Horowitz 2024, 322). Civilians forfeit and regain protection status depending on whether their hands are, quite literally in that moment, on the keyboard.\nCivilians who are completely oblivious of their contribution to hostilities retain their protection status (Horowitz 2024, 319). Might that be an argument for not telling private corporation employees about their foreseeable role in defending against cyberattacks in war? This seems ethically dubious, as it raises a host of questions surrounding transparency and individuals' agency. Civilian tech employees also do not forfeit their protection status when acting in “self-defense or in defense of others against violence prohibited against IHL,” such as “looting, rape, and murder by marauding” (emphasis added, Melzer 2009, 61, cited in; Horowitz 2024, 319). But civilian employees would forfeit their protected status (and become liable to targeting) if they are knowingly responding to cyberattacks that are permissible under IHL. Further still, if an individual tech employee is engaged in DPH and commits a violation of IHL that amounts to war crimes, they become liable under international criminal law (Horowitz 2024, 336). To what extent are civilian employees aware of this when they join a private corporation and are expected to fight in (cyber)wars to protect CI?\nSecond, if the military is not responsible for defending privately owned CI from devastating cyberattacks triggering and during war, then this means acknowledging that the military is seemingly responsible for defending the civilian population only in certain ways when it comes to CI (Participant 3, 2019). To be precise, it means the military is responsible for: i) defending CI from attacks emanating from the “physical domain,” ii) thwarting cyberattacks that target their own military or government systems, iii) mounting offensive cyber operations against adversarial CI, and iv) intelligence gathering and (if possible) sharing with companies. Correspondingly, the civilian population must be made aware of, and consent to, the reality that an entire arm of the state\nwill not be readied or resourced to protect against a catastrophic cyberattack against CI amounting to or during war.\nThird, as private corporations are required to shoulder enhanced duties to protect themselves (and the civilians who depend on them), they will be driven to amass more wealth and influence to fulfil the responsibilities demanded of them by states. After all, the flipside of the adage “with great power comes great responsibility” is with great responsibility comes the requirement to obtain the power to fulfil that responsibility. The foreseeable result is that private corporations will become even more powerful, and the public sector even more dependent on private corporations to guarantee national cybersecurity.\nThe worry, then, is that demanding private corporations to act like states means permitting -- indeed, requiring -- private corporations to fulfil the responsibilities of states. But private corporations are not states. CEOs are not democratically elected by the civilian populations they are (ostensibly) charged to protect. Their main pursuit is not protection but profit. There is no requirement for patriotism.\nMaybe these consternations are mute: private corporations could simply be subsumed under government control during war time via nationalization. Yet this dynamic circles back to the issues raised above pertaining to an overreliance on civilian consent or conscription. May individual employees conscientiously object to participating in war? If so, this will leave a lacuna for cyber-defense, as the military has not thus far been readied-and-resourced to respond (according to the interviewees). If not, this means conscripting employees to participate in war -- via cyber -- when they do not wish to; this may spell a cyber-equivalent to the “non-firing phenomenon” (where soldiers fail to shoot or to shoot accurately at the enemy). These questions highlight the further dissolution between civilians and the military in cyberspace.\nAs two interviewees noted: “by the time [the adversary is] in our systems, it's already too late” (Participant 18, 2019), and “if I were thinking about the current threats, I would be sleepless” (Participant 14, 2019). Relying heavily on private corporations and, crucially, their civilian employees to defend CI in war prompts a required reassessment and renegotiation regarding the role of the military (as the warfighting machine) in the digital age. Perhaps before states begin forcibly requiring civilian employees of private corporations to provide cyber-defense of CI in/as part of war, the military (alongside relevant public and private bodies) should be better equipped to help protect.\n## Conclusion\nNATO has long recognized cyberspace as a domain of war alongside air, land, and sea. Whilst the threat of cyberattacks has been widely debated, political and military leaders have consistently warned that adversaries will target CI with cyberattacks to initiate and prosecute conflict. Despite these concerns, there has been limited attention afforded to how Civil--Military Relations theory makes sense of cyberspace, and almost no empirical inquiry into how militaries understand their role in cyber-defense.\nTo fill this gap in defense studies literature, we conducted extensive, original elite interviews with military members across 12 NATO countries. Our data provided empirical evidence to confirm the theoretical opacity in cyber-CMR. It remains unclear at which point the military might be asked to get involved in the cyber-defense of CI, and it seems\nthat they would not be capable to help, even in war. Militaries play a role in gathering and sharing intelligence, defending forward, and reacting (via cyber or kinetic measures) after the fact. But they do not play a role in actively defending civilian CI as they would in other domains of war (Participant 12, 2019). According to our interviewees, this is because the military could not act (effectiveness narrative), should not act (environment narrative), and is not permitted to act (authorization narrative). Instead, the interviewees pointed to the fact that private owners and operators of CI play a central role in war.\nGiven this dynamic, the article then explores concerns around allocation of financial resources, “dual-use” infrastructures, and “having faith” in the private sector to “do the right thing.” The final part of the paper then controversially asks whether the military ought to be more involved. This section unpacked the serious legal, normative, and practical considerations with the private sector -- specifically, their civilian employees -- being on the front line of cyber-defense in war. To what extent should civilian employees be expected to act qua the military to defend against a cyberattack triggering or occurring in war? Are engineers in private corporations aware that they could become a direct participant in hostilities under IHL (and thereby forfeit their protection status as civilians)? What are the consequences of civilians abandoning their post or refusing to partake in defensive war? May they -- should they -- be court-martialed?\nBy raising these questions, this article galvanizes future research into determining if and how the military should be more involved or whether and when civilians should be conscripted into cyberwars. Additional investigations should involve interviewing the private owners and operators of CI to ascertain i) their views on the military's role in defending their CI, and ii) how they understand their own role in cyber-defense in 21st century wars. Future research may also seek to determine whether greater military involvement into cyber-defense of CI could act as a deterrent against potential adversaries, contributing to a burgeoning literature debating the applicability of deterrence strategy in cyberspace (see Borghard and Lonergan 2023; Lilli 2021; Schneider 2019). Finally, further research could conduct a cross-cultural comparison to highlight differences among NATO states and examine how competitor states, such as Russia and China, guarantee their cyber-defense of CI in war. This is especially pertinent, as the CMR separation in such autocracies is less stark.\nIn conclusion, as one NATO senior military officer noted: How states provide for the defense of CI from cyberattacks that trigger and feature in war is “fundamentally a societal choice” (Participant 13, 2019). For now, the officer continued, “we are hoping and praying the private companies have their defenses in order” (Participant 13, 2019).",

Marxe School of Public and International Affairs, Baruch College, City University of New York (CUNY), New York, NY, USA; $^{b}$ Centre for Future Defence and National Security, Deakin University, Canberra, Australia # ABSTRACT Severe state and state-sponsored cyberattacks against critical infrastructure (CI) is a pressing issue in contemporary conflicts. NATO member states have recognized cyberspace as a new domain of war – one through which adversaries will target CI to both commence and prosecute conflict. Given this: How do NATO member state militaries understand their part in protecting civilian CI from cyberattacks that constitute casus belli? Drawing on original, empirical evidence – 31 interviews and 1 focus group with senior military, defense, and intelligence cyber experts from 12 NATO states – this article argues that militaries regard themselves as unable, unauthorized, and ill-suited to protect CI from cyberattacks that initiate or occur in war. Instead, NATO member states overwhelmingly rely on private corporations (notably their civilian employees) for the protection of CI – including in violent conflict. This article provides original, empirical evidence to confirm the claim that the theory of Civil-Military Relations (CMR) falters when applied to cyberspace. It also asks cutting normative questions attendant with private corporations being on the front line of cyber-defense during war and argues that cyberspace obfuscates the boundaries of modern-day conflicts. This forces a re-examination of the military's role in 21st century wars.\n# ARTICLE HISTORY Received 11 May 2024 Accepted 13 January 2025 # KEYWORDS Cyber; Civil-Military Relations; NATO; militaries; critical infrastructure # Introduction Within liberal democratic states, war is premised on the strict delineation between the military and civilian domains. However, cyberattacks against privately owned and operated civilian critical infrastructure (CI) are challenging this traditional distinction. Understanding the protection of CI from cyberattacks that constitute casus belli within NATO states is especially pressing, as the livelihoods of 1 billion people across 31 countries are at stake. In 2014, NATO formally acknowledged that cyberattacks could be considered an armed attack and thus could trigger Article 5 (Collective Defense) of the NATO Charter. Since 2016, the Alliance has recognized cyberspace as a domain of military operations in which it\"must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea\".

Marxe School of Public and International Affairs, Baruch College, City University of New York (CUNY), 135 East 22nd St, New York, NY 10010, USA © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group affirmed in 2021 that smaller cyberattacks could -- cumulatively -- amount to an armed attack. More recently, the U.S. 2023 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy (U.S. DoD 2023, 7) notes: “U.S. adversaries regularly use malicious cyber activity to target our critical infrastructure. In crisis, they will seek to hinder U.S. military mobilization, sow chaos, and harm the American people.” This is because CI are the very “systems upon which modern society, economy, and polity are seen to depend” (CISA n.d.) and so the disruption or destruction of which would have severe consequences for national security. Indeed, as Haataja (2022, 425) notes, there is a pervasive “recognition of the potentially devastating impact that cyber operations on CI can have.”\nWhilst there has been significant development in mandatory regulation for private corporations regarding cyber-defense, the role of militaries in protecting civilian CI from cyberattacks that can trigger or occur in war has received very little empirical attention. This absence is curious, especially as the military is the traditional state organ tasked with defending the nation against external threats arising to the level of an armed attack.\nSuch a lacuna might be explained by the fact that the prevailing theoretical approach to the role of the military -- Civil--Military Relations (CMR) -- struggles to coherently account for cyberspace as a new “domain” of conflict. Cyberspace raises questions pertaining to the role of the military in 21st century conflicts, creating tensions between prevailing CMR assumptions and the new ways in which wars are fought. This is because “cyberspace pushes questions of traditional boundaries of sovereignty, as well as blurs lines between the civilian and security sector”. State-sponsored adversarial attacks in cyberspace even challenge the very notion of war itself (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022). As a result, there is a theoretical opacity in CMR regarding the military's duties in defending privately owned civilian CI from cyberattacks that both trigger and occur in war.\nGreater scholarly enquiry is therefore required to interrogate this theoretical muddiness inherent in cyber-CMR. Specifically, almost no empirical attention has been afforded to test whether this cyber-CMR tension is reflected in the military's own understanding of its role in cyber-defense of civilian CI. This article aims to fill this gap. It does so by drawing on 31 semi-structured interviews and 1 focus group with cyber experts from 12 NATO states to test this theoretical opacity. How do military cyber experts from NATO member states understand their role in defending critical infrastructure against cyberattacks? We find that -- unlike acts of aggression emanating from land, air, and sea -- NATO military members believe they can not, should not, and are not authorized to defend CI against cyberattacks that could constitute casus belli. Instead, despite recognizing that cyberattacks against CI could trigger or form part of “the next war”, NATO member states rely on private owners and operators for the provision and protection of CI. This finding is crucial, as it challenges preconceived notions of the military taking the lead in defending the state (including from cyberattacks) during war. Departing from the extant literature, the article then critically explores the practical and normative implications of having private corporations on the front line of cyber-defense of CI, and the military taking a backseat during (cyber)war.\nThe paper begins with an overview of the prevailing theoretical framework for understanding the role of the military in conflict -- CMR. This is crucial to make sense of how militaries understand their role in defending the nation in/through cyberspace. After a review of the article's methodology, we present the empirical data obtained from the interviews. This is followed by a discussion of the findings, highlighting the problematic logic of the current dynamic, and a normative and practical consideration of whether the military ought to be more involved in cyber-defense of civilian CI. The conclusion summarizes the findings and scopes avenues for future research.\n## (Cyber) Civil--Military Relations CMR elucidates the relationship between the armed forces, the people, and the state's civilian authorities: it stresses civilian control over the military, defines what it means to be a professional soldier in a democratic society, and identifies which items of the national security agenda fall to the military. It is with this latter aspect of CMR with which we are principally concerned because it pertains to the role of the military in cyber operations, and in the protection of critical infrastructure. The consensus in the literature and in practice has been to try to maintain the separation between the military and civilians when it comes to critical infrastructure protection (CIP) (Pačka and Mareš 2021). However, the development of cyberspace challenges the foundational theoretical assumptions of CMR in three ways.\nFirst, cyberspace inherently blurs the traditional division between foreign and domestic theatres, which has authorization complexities for the military operating on home soil. One of the main tenets of CMR is that the military “does not generally operate or deploy domestically”. As a result, the focus of the military (acting on behalf and at the behest of the civilian government) has been on defending against physical, foreign threats. Yet, this view has been somewhat altered since the collapse of the Soviet Union, when the new threat environment drew to the fore a more diverse set of security imperatives. Non-traditional security threats, such as terrorism, civil conflicts, pandemics, and natural disasters, have “compelled a world-wide re-thinking of the roles and missions of armed forces” within the CMR literature (Diamond, and Plattner 1996, x). “[V]irtually everywhere”, Bruneau and Matei (2012, 2) contend, “militaries and other security instruments are taking on new roles and missions”, such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR).\nThe changing character of national security forces militaries to adapt to a wider array of missions and to develop a broader purpose. But the military's focus largely remains on providing security from physical, external threats. In the 21st century, technological transformations altered the character of security and war yet again, forcing scholars to question whether CMR needs to be adjusted to protect states in “non-traditional battlefields,” notably cyberspace and outerspace. The boundaries between domestic and external security threats became increasingly obscured by transnational digital information systems.\nAn important implication of this reality for CMR is a change of the main locus of military operations: “soldiers operating on the home front” might come to be seen as the rule rather than the exception. As put by Burton (2015, 302), cyberattacks “occur over a globally linked network of computer systems and can be launched without warning, in milliseconds, from anywhere on the planet.” Cyberspace, he argues, creates a new challenge for security organizations like NATO, which has “traditionally focused on geographically proximate security threats”. This brought others to argue that soldiers will be securing networks and countering intrusions against critical infrastructure. The nature of transnational cyber threats, therefore, has important implications for the future role of the military, urging states to reconsider whether a physical, territorial distinction -- a separation between domestic and foreign theatres of operations -- is justified (or indeed even possible) in cyberspace.\nSecond, cyberspace challenges CMR's clear distinction between civilian and military domains because the cyberspace environment is inherently different from that of traditional, physical domains of war (land, air, and sea). As such, the traditional CMR boundaries between military and civilian spheres have become increasingly hazy. Pačka and Mareš (2021, 437) note: “In a common national security and defense ecosystem, the roles of players such as an army, police, intelligence agency, and others are set clearly and there is an evident division of labor... cyberspace constantly changes the boundaries.” Cyberspace is “blurring the lines between the traditional expertise of the uniformed military and the roles and responsibilities of civilians” (Beehner, Brooks, and Maurer 2021, 5). This is especially the case because aggressions in cyberspace often target civilian persons or infrastructure.\nAs militaries become more involved in the cyber domain, they will inevitably conduct their operations over “international and domestic computer infrastructure that supports the dense lattice of digital-age civilian life”. As Sharpe, Trichas, and Terrill (2024, 5) note, “recognition of... cyberspace as a critical domain... represents a paradigm shift in military strategy.” Further distorting the distinction between civilian and military spheres is the fact that technological infrastructure is often dual-use and that militaries rely increasingly on civilian networks for their own operations. Consensus amongst CMR scholars seems to be that the uniqueness of the cyber domain requires “unorthodox” and innovative approaches to the organization of security and defense, challenging, in the words of Brooks (2016, 359), existing “walls” between civilians and the military. As summarized by Chayes (2015, 187): “Civil and military roles are not easily sorted out in the area of cyberattacks and cyber warfare.”\nThird, cyberspace forces a revision not only of what it means to fight wars and of who is involved in warfighting but of the delineation between war and peace itself (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022; Sewall 2021). Constant contact and interconnectedness are key features of cyberspace, favoring initiative and pre-emption over passivity and reactive defense, meaning that states are incentivized to persistently exploit adversary vulnerabilities in order to gain and maintain the advantage (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022). This challenges the dominant Western understanding of war, premised on “use of force” and “armed attack” as the crossing of what is usually considered to be the boundary between war and peace. Unlike with conventional warfare, there is seemingly no strict division between war and peace in cyberspace. States are in a constant state of competition. NATO holds the view that “cyberspace is contested at all times”. Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett (2022, 123) argue that this requires a paradigm shift in policy and strategy planning, one that would focus on an “increased tempo” of cyber military operations outside their own network, and continuous preparation and execution of cyber campaigns.\nAs the complexities of cyberspace are challenging the long-held clear division between war and peace, by extension, the clear separation between civilian and military spheres is also contested. Is there a need for “an increased tempo” of cyber military operations not only outside the defense's network but outside the unique context of war? That the military might play a role outside of warfighting is not new to cyberspace, as discussed above, and so it is justified to address the challenge of continuous competition in cyberspace and activities occurring in this space between peace and war.\nThe question that then flows from this is whether it matters at all when a cyberattack against CI reaches the threshold of an armed attack and triggers Article 5, especially with regards to the roles and responsibilities of cyber-defense. Surely, it does matter, because -- traditionally -- if states are at war, different agents become responsible for action (namely, the military). Yet in cyberspace, this does not seem to be the case, with this responsibility being entrusted to private actors even during conflict. Instead, it seems that the dissolution of the war-peace continuum in cyberspace is making it difficult for states to identify the appropriate response to cyberattacks against the nation's CI, both during the crisis phase, before Article 5 is invoked, and during war. It is with these kinds of cyberattacks, that could constitute casus belli or occur in war, that this article is concerned.\nOwing to these complexities, it is unclear “whether civil-military relations are sufficiently calibrated to protect... in these non-traditional battlefields” where “warfare encompass[es]... less-understood cyber-tools” (Beehner, Brooks, and Maurer 2021, 3). The foundational assumptions built into CMR paradigmatically accept that the military's role is in defending against physical, external threats, focused within war time and is wedded to the distinction between civilian and military responsibilities. But, as others have noted, cyberspace generates theoretical tensions regarding the applicability of these three a priori accepted precepts.\n## Research design and methodology: NATO case study If cyberattacks on CI will inevitably feature in 21st century conflicts, then it is urgent to understand if and how the military, as the institution responsible for warfighting and defense on behalf of the state, understands its role. In other words, it is of paramount importance to test whether existing theoretical tensions are reflected empirically -- by going straight to the source. The justification for casing our study to NATO is because the alliance represents a significant proportion of the global population and serves as a key exemplar of dominant Western perspectives.\nWe conducted 31 semi-structured interviews with military and defense cyber subject matter experts (SMEs) from 12 NATO member states, and 1 focus group of 7 military cyber experts. Representatives from Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Estonia, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US) participated in the research. These countries were chosen based on access (at the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Tallinn and at the NATO Headquarters in Brussels) and expertise within the NATO alliance regarding cyber-defense, including states that are technologically advanced and at the forefront of cyber affairs in practice, and others that are not as well positioned. Among NATO states, cyber-defense of CI is a national responsibility and as such, strategies vary across nations but clear similarities can be found. This illustrates that regardless of a state's level of “cyber-awareness,” most NATO members share similar views on the role of the military regarding the cyber-defense of CI. It also illuminates an apparent disconnect between traditional CMR assumptions regarding the role of the military in territorial defense against external threats and current military perceptions across NATO states. It is also important to note that cyber-offense has its own very specific construct -- Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies (SCEPVA) -- which we do not explore in this paper.\nBy “cyber subject matter experts” we mean military members (officers and enlisted) and civilians (policy advisors) working for defense ministries and at the NATO Headquarters, whose principal occupation is with matters of cyberspace -- both offense and defense. The interview participants included senior military officials (including two-star generals) and cyber experts and lawyers from the military and other government departments (including ministries of defense and intelligence agencies) from NATO member states.\nInterviewees were assured that their views would not be taken as representative of NATO or their “home” state, military, or department, and that their identity would be anonymized. Accordingly, quotes have not been assigned to specific roles or states in order to mitigate the risks associated with attribution, particularly those arising from cross-referencing. The goal of conducting these interviews was not to examine differences in cultural approaches across NATO members, although this would be a valuable future study.\nA note on limitations. One limitation pertaining to the approach of this research is that, by focusing on military perspectives only, the research excludes other crucial stakeholders such as private-sector partners and other public agencies like police, local cyber task forces and computer emergency response teams (CERTS). Notably, we do not examine what the private owners and operators of CI (CEOs and/or employees) consider as the appropriate role of the military in cyber-defense. This question, albeit important, requires a separate, substantive future investigation -- one that, due to space constraints, we could not explore here. Instead, our interest lies with understanding the military's role in defending the nation against cyberattacks, a question that is best answered by those working in defense who are across the current military cyber posture. That said, the participants also included representatives from intelligence agencies, who work closely with their military counterparts and who have important responsibilities in both cyber-offense and cyber-defense in many countries. These interviewees were well placed to differentiate the role of the military and that of intelligence agencies in responding to a cyber event, confirming some issues raised by defense interviewees in terms of cyber-CMR.\n## NATO militaries' perceptions of cyber-defense of CI In the words of the interviewees, the purpose of the military is to “serve, protect, and defend” the state and the population against foreign aggression. However, when asked how the military discharges this responsibility to protect citizens from adversarial cyberattacks on CI either triggering or happening in war, all of the interviewees stated that the military was ill-suited or ill-prepared to intervene, even in the case where it might be asked to do so. We also found that, despite cyberspace being recognized as a domain of military operations, military members' understanding of their role reflects the complexities of the cyber war-peace continuum. Three recurring narratives emerged from the interviewees when describing the limits of their role. Each chime with the three tensions articulated in cyber-CMR above: the uniqueness of the domain, the blurring of foreign/domestic theaters, and what this means for understanding war. To begin, however, we survey how militaries presently engage in cyber-defense of CI.\n### Defending forward, persistent engagement, and integrated deterrence NATO member militaries are engaged in collecting, analyzing, and exchanging intelligence with other government agencies, the private sector, and NATO allies (U.S. DoD 2023). Information collection and sharing is considered an integral aspect of cyber-defense. When private corporations identify a threat in their system and pass that information along to government agencies, such public agencies then make recommendations regarding how the private companies ought to rectify the vulnerability and voluntarily assist in that process (which, in many instances, can be declined by the corporation). Yet, importantly (for reasons we explore below), according to one of our interviewees: “the government won't go into anyone's systems: they have a coordination role, but otherwise it's hands off the keyboard” (Participant 18, 2019).\nMoreover, NATO state militaries are authorized (and indeed required) to take proactive measures to ensure the cybersecurity of their own military systems -- principally to ensure continued operability across the traditional, physical domains of armed conflict. The desire to enhance the cyber resilience of the Alliance was reiterated at the 2023 Vilnius Summit. As a senior military officer explained, however, “the primary concern of the military is to ensure our cyber systems are working so we can do kinetic defense: the military has a monopoly on kinetic defense, not cyber” (Participant 12, 2019).\nA few of the interviewees stated that the military is engaged in what has long been understood as “active defense:” “defensive operations that involve direct engagement with sophisticated adversaries in DoD-controlled cyberspace”. The U.S. in particular has employed the notion of “defending forward” which aims to pre-emptively “stop threats before they reach their targets” (U.S. Department of Defense 2018, 2) and which was developed in response to criticisms that the military was not proactively defending critical infrastructure against cyberattacks (Former US Cyber Command official, personal communication with author, 2020). “Defending forward,” “active defense,” and “persistent engagement” were born out of the recognition that the U.S. could not expect private corporations to defend themselves against the full power of an adversarial state. Both approaches form part of what the U.S. now regards as “integrated deterrence,” developed in the most recent DoD Cyber Strategy (2023, 2), which focuses on using military cyber capabilities “in concert with other instruments of national power.”\nFurther still, the military would likely be the apparatus called upon by the state in the “response” phase of a devastating cyberattack (Participants 8, 14, 16, 22). The military would be responsible for launching a cyber or kinetic counter-offensive, following appropriate attribution processes (proportionality, necessity, and distinction factors considered). But such responses are necessarily ex post facto. As was expressed in the focus group (2019): “Reacting after the fact is a losing strategy.” Until then, the front line of defense -- with public sector support, especially intelligence agencies -- is the private corporations.\n### The effectiveness narrative: can not Previously, it has been thought that -- in the context of NATO and specifically the U.S. -- the resources and expertise on cyber-defense and cyberwar was retained by the military. Our empirical evidence finds the opposite to be the case. Most of the interviewees argued that their respective militaries currently lack the necessary resources, human-power, and relevant expertise required to effectively defend CI from cyberattacks. As a result, the interviewees consistently highlighted that, due to the nature of the domain, the military is unable to protect civilian CI from cyberattacks -- even those that can trigger or occur in war. One interviewee compared this lack of cyber capability with traditional, kinetic attacks: “The military is the only institution or organization to defend against armed attacks, because they're the only ones who have fighter planes. But in a cyberattack, Cyber Command won't be first [to respond], because they don't have the capability” (Participant 19, 2019). Another senior military officer (Participant 3, 2019) reflected that attention ought to be focused on pragmatically determining which organization is likely to be most successful in providing cyber-defense: “It's about having the right tools, and the right knowledge... the military might not be best placed to defend certain infrastructure.” For instance, interviewees rightly pointed out that in many countries intelligence agencies play a significant role in the cyber-defense of the nation and its critical infrastructure, notably by advising and assisting other government agencies and the private sector (see for instance GCHQ n.d.; Government of Canada n.d.).\nA few interviewees also noted that because the private corporations that own and operate CI use different and often “tailor-made” platforms, it would be almost impossible for cyber experts in the military to be sufficiently knowledgeable to defend across all the different systems. It is “unimaginable” for the military to help, one interviewee reflected, “because they are completely unfamiliar with the systems” (Participant 9, 2019).\nSome of the interviewees argued that it would be financially ineffective or even prohibitively expensive to have the military provide cyber-defense for CI: it is “better to let the private sector deal with it,” because having the government provide the cyber-defense for critical infrastructure would be “implausible and expensive” (Participant 12, 2019). “Private corporations should be responsible,” one interviewee stated, “otherwise there would be a lot of taxpayers' money required to provide [protection for] those systems -- like a ‘cybersecurity tax' for providing cyber-defense of critical infrastructure” (Participant 9, 2019). The interviewees' perception echoes the sentiment highlighted in the literature on critical infrastructure protection that private owners are best placed to establish cyber-defenses.\nThe environment narrative: should not When discussing why the military does not play a greater role in protecting CI from cyberattacks -- as they would if the “armed attack” was emanating from other domains of war -- the interviewees stated that this is because “cyberspace is fundamentally different” (Participant 15, 2019). The participants overwhelmingly referred to cyberspace's ubiquitous, borderless, fluid, and invisible nature. The interviewees emphasized the relatively abstract characteristics of cyberspace identified in the literature as affecting the military's ability to help defend. One government official simply stated: “cyber is a different domain; we haven't figured out how it works” (Participant 22, 2019). Another interviewee reflected: “In cyber, the fog of war is heightened” (Participant 11, 2019). Interviewees also referred to the difficulty of determining whether sovereignty is applicable to cyberspace and where borders might begin and end, thereby touching on the ongoing debate between NATO member states about whether sovereignty is applicable to cyberspace.\nIn most instances, the interviewees' reference to sovereignty was intended to highlight that, unlike in sea, air, and land -- which have clear, physical borders that can be transgressed -- cyberspace has no such border. The interviewees often highlighted the difficulty of defending against cyberattacks by comparing cyberspace with the physical domains of warfighting: “You can see equipment like frigates and airplanes,” one interviewee noted, “but you can't see firewalls or malicious code” (Focus group 2019).\nA majority of interviewees also argued that the military does not have a significant role in defending CI from cyberattacks that could trigger war or happen in war because -- again, in contrast to the physical domain -- it is an “unchartered territory” and so “the line between government and private” is “blurred” (Participants 16, 18 and 26, 2019). A few interviewees drew parallels with the other services, claiming that “we've had an army, navy, and air force for a long time, but cyberspace is new” (Participant 13, 2019). These comments are reminiscent of the remarks made by Lt. Col. Kurt Sanger, Chief Judge Advocate for National Security Law at U.S. Cyber Command at the 2019 CyCon U.S: “For most of the domains, you have thousands of years and millions of warriors contributing to the lessons that you're now learning... We don't have that in cyberspace”. In short, cyberspace itself was thought by the interviewees as an inherently exposed space, with points of vulnerabilities too vast to comprehend. As one officer put it, “cyberspace is un-defendable” (Participant 12, 2019). These responses align with what Cate (2015, 307) identifies as the prevailing “sense of despair about the size and complexity of the challenge.”\nOur empirical evidence highlights that the military believes it should not play a significant role in defending CI. In doing so, it thereby supports the extant theoretical claim that cyberspace distorts the lines between the domestic vs. foreign spheres and forces an alteration of traditional territorial and sovereign conceptions of defense. This further illustrates the dissolution of the traditional division between civilian and military sectors in CMR due to the unprecedented nature of the domain.\nThe authorization narrative: not permitted The last narrative that emerged from the interviewees' responses is that of “authorization.” A third of the interviewees noted that the military is not permitted to operate on domestic soil. Typically, within NATO states, the military is not automatically authorized to conduct what are considered police enforcement duties: for instance, the U.S. Posse Comitatus Act, signed in 1878, is designed to prohibit the deployment of the military to enforce domestic civilian policies and practices “unless expressly authorized by the Constitution or an act of Congress” (Congressional Research Service 2018). It seems that this is what most of the interviewees were referring to when raising concerns regarding “authorization.” Many participants explained that this is a “design reality” of the democratic system, which means that states are constrained and restrained by their legal environment (Participants 1, 2 and 13, 2019). As one interviewee articulated, “the legislation is not adjusted for the realities of cyberspace” (Participant 7, 2019), while another reflected, “if we want to live in a liberal, democratic society, this is what we get” (Participant 17, 2019).\nSome interviewees highlighted that the military would be called upon, by the state, to operate in the territory of that sovereign state in the instance that there is an actual use of physical force against the state. As one interviewee explained: “Obviously if our ‘friends' in the East rolled tanks across the border right now, our forces would be authorized to act in the state to repel that assault. It wouldn't be the police's job” (Participant 15, 2019).\nAdditionally, a few interviewees raised concerns regarding privacy as a barrier to greater military involvement. One military officer noted that: “[People] are OK that we have ships, border patrol, flight deterrence... But with cyber, people don't want the government to look into their Internet connectivity” (Participant 18, 2019). Overall, the interviewees consistently stated that the military would be called upon to protect the sovereign state from a land invasion, naval assault, or airborne missile strike against CI -- but this would not be the case regarding a comparable assault emanating from cyberspace.\nThe three narratives empirically confirm the tension highlighted in the literature on cyber-CMR. It further resonates with the 2023 U.S. Cyber Strategy that the Department of Defense “lacks the authority to employ military forces to defend private companies against cyberattacks” and that there are “limited circumstances in which military cyber forces would be asked to defend civilian critical infrastructure -- the Department will not posture itself to defend every private sector network” (U.S. DoD 2023, 13). In short, NATO member militaries do not believe they play a major role in cyber-defense of CI that initiates or occurs amidst war due to environment, effectiveness, and authorization complexities. As one interviewee noted: “There is a contradiction between the fear of cyberattacks, [and the fact that] we [the people]... don't want the military to play a bigger role” (Participant 18, 2019).\n## Critical discussion of the military perspective There are three key findings that arise from the empirical evidence. First: the military members affirm the perception of the blurred nature of cyber-CMR described above. Second: the minimal military involvement raises urgent questions regarding CI that will be targeted in war. Third: while regulations have improved in the past few years, it is the private corporations that are principally responsible for protecting CI from sophisticated state-sponsored cyberattacks during war. These findings invite a re-examination of the role of the military in 21st century conflicts.\n### A reflection of political will and political choices One of the explanations invoked by the interviewees for why the military is not more involved in the cyber-defense of CI is because the military currently lacks the financial and human resources to do so (the effectiveness narrative). Some might claim that it is unreasonable to reassign some military funding for cyber-defense of CI in the face of “defense austerity” -- although in the U.S. this notion is debatable, as the proposed 2024 budget for the entire DoD totaled $842 billion (Congressional Budget Office 2023). One interviewee argued that this objection is misplaced, as taking proactive security measures prior to an “inevitable cyberattack against critical infrastructure” is a more fiscally responsible decision from the outset (Participant 4, 2019).\nFunds already allocated to the acquisition of traditional kinetic weapons could (again, hypothetically) be redirected toward: the military's development of defensive cyber technologies for CI, the recruitment of more military cyber personnel, and the expansion and implementation of CIP military training programs. Other interviewees instead reiterated an absence of political will for states to invest highly in something as intangible as cybersecurity: “Guns and tanks and fighter jets are sexier. They're sexier and easier for politicians to show off for their next election campaign, that they're doing something for national security... [They're] not really able to show off lines of code” (Focus group, 2019).\nAside from the fiscal element is the ostensible “novelty” and “unknowable-ness” of cyberspace as to why they “should not” be involved in defense of CI (the environment narrative). Confusion surrounding cyberspace's distinct character is something that is debated in the literature. Nonetheless, there is a risk of “succumbing to the shock of the new”. Erroneously perceiving the form of a domain as inherently enigmatic stymies progress toward establishing effective defense systems. Considering other “newer” domains of war, one interviewee compared cyberspace to the air force: no “historical accident... the air force was born out of the need for defense from attacks in airspace in the 20th century” (Participant 28, 2019). It is a political choice to allocate the main face of defense in war to private corporations.\nMoreover, whilst the military is prima facie prohibited from operating on domestic soil, the authorization narrative should be interrogated further. Indeed, the military could -- and would -- be called upon by the state to operate in its sovereign territory if there is an actual use of physical force tantamount to an armed attack. In the face of cyberattacks that do reach the level of an armed attack and that could trigger NATO's Article 5, conceivably, the military would be authorized to get involved in the cyber-defense of civilian CI systems. Theoretically at least, cyber aggressions comparable to armed attacks do not pose a significantly new challenge for civil--military relations. Nonetheless, the research finds that even with this kind of attack that could constitute casus belli, or occur during war, uncertainty remains within the military regarding the extent to which they would be authorized (or able) to get involved in the cyber-defense of private networks. Even when faced with cyberattacks that would amount to an armed attack, or during war, the military would not be able to effectively help defend CI. The militaries' current (and limited) ability and expectation to provide cyber-defense of CI is a political calculation. One defense personnel reflected: “I feel that there is a growing need for more cyber units in the military, and since cyber has now been recognized as a proper domain of armed conflict on par with air, land, sea and in some cases also space, I think it will happen... It is just a question of how it will evolve, and through which means. (Participant 16, 2019)” Nevertheless, according to the interviewees, this is likely only after some “catastrophic” cyberattack on CI (Participants 8 and 29, 2019). The current decision to rely heavily on private corporations, albeit with mandatory reporting and compliance mechanisms, is a political choice.\n### Concerns surrounding “dual-use” infrastructures A further implication of minimal military involvement is how to deal with “dual-use” CI. Civilian CI has been and will continue to be targeted by adversarial actors as part of war. One interviewee stated: “There is no such thing as a ‘military' cyberattack; 90% of the time it will be against civilian infrastructure” (Participant 22, 2019). According to another: “Adversaries will -- and already do -- attack critical infrastructure as a primary target via cyberspace, because it's what we would do” (Participant 7, 2019). States will likely seek to disable CI in war in order to gain a military advantage.\nAs per international cyber norms regarding responsible state behavior, there is a prohibition of “cyber operations that cause intentional damage or impairment to critical infrastructure (CI)”. CI should be -- in the words of then U.S. President Joe Biden -- “‘off limits' to attack” (cited in Haataja 2022, 425). Of course, only military objects and combatants are liable to be lawfully targeted in war; according to the International Humanitarian Law (IHL) principle of distinction, intentionally targeting civilians and civilian CI (including via cyber) is prohibited. Nevertheless, the urgency of preparing the military to contribute to the defense of CI is even more apparent given the potential for civilian CI to be rendered a liable military objective. This is because civilian CI can: i) become co-opted for military purposes, ii) have a “military utility,” or iii) be “dual-use”.\nThere are three concerns raised here. First, if (privately owned) CI networks become “dual-use” or are of “military utility,” they become military objectives and thus may be lawfully targeted. As Horowitz (2024, 327) notes: a “privately owned civilian aviation air traffic control tower that the enemy military temporarily uses to enable offensive operations” might be rendered a military objective “because of its ‘use.'” Moreover, according to the Tallinn Manual 2.0: if critical infrastructure is being used by both civilian and military ends, and it is “impossible” to differentiate between the civilian and military parts of a system, “the entire network... qualifies as a military objective”.\nSecond, because of the invisible nature of cyberspace, it is additionally challenging to differentiate between civilian vs. military cyber infrastructures. As such, there is foreseeably a large scope for misinterpretation and accidental military targeting of CI. Third, it is unclear whether preparatory acts on “dual-use” infrastructures during peacetime -- such as the insertion of dormant malware -- constitutes an attack or strictly cyber-espionage. Haataja (2022, 424, 428) highlights that there is a danger for pre-positioned adversarial code in CI that could be activated later, a practice known as “persistent presence” in CI. Simply planting malware or creating “backdoors” certainly violates international cyber norms and could be considered a breach of a state's obligation under international law (others consider such cyber norms “voluntary, non-binding”). But such cyber-operations themselves are unlikely to rise to the level of an armed attack. Activating a dormant malware in a privately owned CI, such as a nuclear powerplant, causing it to explode, would foreseeably reach that threshold. All of this points to the complexity of defending CI from cyberattacks that constitute casus belli or may be pursued in war.\n### A degree of (risky) faith in the private sector Private corporations that own and operate CI ought to provide appropriate cyber-defensive measures -- especially to protect what one interviewee called “low-hanging fruits” (Participant 3, 2019). Nonetheless, as one interviewee noted: “We can't expect private companies to protect themselves against state-sponsored attacks” (Participant 23, 2019). Many interviewees expressed having “faith” in private corporations adhering to proper standards and regulations: “We hope they [the private corporations] do the right thing” (Participant 8, 2019).\nUsing the physical domain as an analogy, the private owners of a power grid would be expected to employ a reasonable degree of security -- locking doors, installing surveillance cameras, erecting wire fences, and employing security guards, and so on. However, the security guard would not be expected to defend against an attack that rises to a use of force tantamount with war. Defense from in-coming ballistic missiles would fall to the state and -- foreseeably -- the air force: “In the physical world, we don't require companies to have an air force, or submarines, or to really look at the pointy end of an attack”.\nYet whilst companies have oversight, assistance, and mandatory regulations from government, the front line of defense in cyberspace remains the purview of companies. It is often in their profit margins interests to ensure their cyber-defenses are in order, and to work closely and collaboratively with government agencies to redress vulnerabilities or incursions. Beyond purely monetary interests, corporations could be appealed to do so on the notion of “loyalty”. They may be incentivized to effectively participate in the provision of cyber-defense based on “a moral commitment to ‘solidarity' and ‘community responsibility'”. One senior government official iterated this patriotic duty to “protect our lifestyle” (Participant 22, 2019). For instance, when asked about who is defending Ukrainian CI from Russian cyberattacks, one retired general responded: “The private corporations in Ukraine are doing an excellent job” (General [retd.], personal communication with author, 2022). Similarly, Matania and Sommer (2023, 3) note that “Tech Titans” (Google, Microsoft, Meta, Apple, SpaceX and Amazon) are playing a meaningful role in the armed conflict in Ukraine.\nThat said, as one interviewee reflected: “appealing towards companies' patriotism... is probably not the safest way to do things” (Participant 13, 2019). Even if a private corporation is “homegrown,” it does not guarantee that they are, in fact, patriotic. “Company Over Country” was Meta CEO and Founder Mark Zuckerberg's early motto. Similarly, the whistle blower Haugen (2021, 2) iterated that -- when torn between “its own profits and [the U.S.'] safety,” Meta “consistently... favor[ed] its own profits.” This demonstrates that American-owned corporations have prioritized financial gains over that of the security of the American people. Such a dynamic becomes even more problematic if CI corporations in NATO member states are outsourced and owned by foreign corporations.\nPerhaps “profits before patriotism” is strictly a feature of peacetime: once it comes to war, the dynamic will flip. For instance, by May 2022 Google had pledged approximately $55 million in support of Ukraine's resistance of Russian aggression. Similarly, within days of the full-scale invasion, Microsoft moved Ukraine's critical government data to its cloud storage platform. This was because most of the data was “extremely vulnerable to missile attacks, and their physical destruction could paralyze the entire work of the country's top leadership”.\nYet the view that corporations would be driven by patriotism (or, more accurately, defense of liberal values) over profit hinges on two, risky assumptions. In the first instance, it takes for granted that the CI private corporation heralds from, or is ideologically aligned with, the country under (cyber)attack -- which is not necessarily always the case. It supposes the private corporation may not be under pressure from the attacking-state or wishes to remain neutral, or had been convinced to allow the attack to take place (due to corruption, coercion, or ideological leanings). There is no guarantee for support. There is no expectation for patriotism even from corporations that are (for lack of a better word) “home grown.”\nIn the second instance, it is also not clear how long “patriotic” support or commitment to democratic liberal ideals -- even if it is forthcoming -- might last. While Elon Musk's SpaceX initially sent Starlink satellites to the Ukrainian military for free, it eventually stated it could no longer foot the bill, and the Pentagon had to pick up the tab -- once the reliance on Musk's service had been firmly established (conceivably with an agenda to accrue profits). Moreover, demonstrating the selectivity of private sector support, when the Ukrainian military conducted an offensive into the Russian-held Crimea, they begged Elon Musk to turn on its satellite service in the Russian-controlled area, but he refused to do so because (according to his post on X) he feared SpaceX's complicity in “a major act of war and conflict escalation”. Betting on private corporations' patriotism and political alliances or appetite for war, over that of their foundational and raison d'être interests in profit, is to gamble with national (cyber) defense. If there is a profit to be made, corporations might choose to get involved in conflicts (even distant ones), but they might stop to be involved when it is no longer financially advisable.\nOur empirical data suggests that -- unlike kinetic acts of war emanating in land, air, and sea -- the military is not responsible for defending against state-sponsored acts of aggression against CI via cyberspace. However, trusting private corporations to adequately defend against cyberattacks in war is a risky security strategy.\n## Should militaries be more involved? Normative and practical considerations As detailed in the previous section, multiple interviewees remarked on the risks associated with dual-use infrastructure and with being overly reliant on private corporations to provide cyber-defense of CI. Relatedly, some participants expressed concerns about not being readied and resourced to defend CI against cyberattacks. This prompts the question: might there be a case for increasing military involvement in cyber-defense of CI? After all, the military is the principal body responsible for defending civilians (on behalf of the state) from acts of aggression rising to war. Former NATO Deputy Secretary General Rose Gottemoeller et al. (2022) expressed the need for NATO Allies to be better prepared in response to cyberattacks. This requirement is especially pertinent, as Burton (2015, 302) remarks, “cyber operations are increasingly part of [conflicts involving NATO forces] and an element of the strategy of NATO's main state adversaries.” To be clear, we are not in any way suggesting a “military-takes-all,” zero-sum approach to defending CI from cyberattacks that trigger Article 5. The normative question is whether militaries should be readied -- as a last line of defense -- to help protect alongside private corporations and public bodies (such as intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and federal and local cyber task forces).\nOne objection to greater military involvement is the potential for escalation. A cyber-defensive operation led by the military could be perceived by an adversary as a cyber countermeasure, resulting in a “tit-for-tat escalation of cyberattacks and responses, each one more serious than the last”. An increased role of the military in providing cyber-defense of CI may therefore lead to “a permissive normative-legal environment in which states are more likely than before to resort to uses of force”.\nA related normative concern is that the increased role of the military in cyber-defense of CI begets the militarization of cyberspace. The perception of the military being involved in a civilian network, even for strictly defensive purposes, may render it a military target. But simply because the military may be called upon, as a last resort, to aid in the cyber-defense of CI does not render the civilian objective ipso facto a military target. In the same way that the military might be called upon to help defend a hospital (for instance) from kinetic attacks, the military presence does not automatically render the hospital a liable military objective.\nAnother further objection might be that introducing the military as an agent of cyber-defense of CI risks increasing the potential for abuse -- notably, through mass militarized surveillance or the military placing pressure on private corporations to act in certain ways. Relatedly, there may be normative concerns regarding competing authorities -- an unnecessary duplication of responsibilities and confusion over which entity precisely (the private organization vs. intelligence agency vs. the military) acts in what contexts. Within the extant literature, Public--Private Partnerships in CI protection are already regarded as notoriously fraught with complications pertaining to cooperation, information sharing, and trust. For instance, one interviewee noted that -- on the issue of information sharing of breaches -- “private companies won't ‘sho their hand'... they would rather sell the intelligence than give it away for free” (Participant 9, 2019). Surely adding another agent into the mix will make cyber-defense more complex.\nA reply to these two objections is that the military should only get involved when: i) the private entity is unable or unwilling to respond, ii) that the aid of the existing public agencies is insufficient, or iii) that the cyberattack would (through its scale and effects) constitute an armed attack. What should be envisaged is a live, cooperative triage system, whereby the military might be deployed only to help defend CI, should the attack foreseeably trigger war or take place in war, or if other responders have failed to address the threat and require additional assistance.\nOne further objection is that increasing military involvement generates a moral hazard for the private sector. Specifically, if the military is offering a pseudo-“security umbrella,” private corporations may be disincentivized to invest in necessary cybersecurity measures and instead increase their risk tolerance (as per prospect theory). Cybersecurity is costly and time-consuming; saving on cybersecurity would likely increase corporations' profits, and energy and resources could be redirected to other parts of business.\nHowever, there are several considerations that would foreseeably mitigate this moral hazard. Corporations risk extreme reputational damage and services by relying too heavily on possible military defense: corporations must still provide adequate levels of cybersecurity that sufficiently defend against the vast majority of cyberattacks, which are criminal or low-level intrusions. Further, corporations would rather deal with cyber-defense issues in house and (as our interviewees noted) are wary about freely “opening the doors” to the military. These are serious objections to increasing military involvement. But it is also pertinent to examine the normative implications if states do not increase military involvement.\nFirst, the existing requirement for private corporations to be on the “front line” of cyber-defense of CI means demanding that civilians be responsible for defending against disastrous acts of (cyber)war. Even if they are not explicitly conscripted (more on this below) it is the civilian employees of those private sectors who nonetheless currently shoulder national cybersecurity duties. “Like the soldiers in the fortress,” Brenner and Clarke (emphasis added, 2010, 1032) reflect, “computer personnel confronting a cyberattack are responsible for defending their ‘territory' from hostile activity.”\nThis blurring of civilian and military spheres -- the expectation of civilians in corporations to not only contribute to but bear the weight of defending the state from cyber-attacks in war -- opens Pandora's box regarding pressing legal, normative, and practical questions. Is the expectation to participate in cyber-defense during war articulated in the employees' contracts? Are these civilian employees permitted to excuse themselves, or conscientiously object to participating in war, or will they be forced to fight, albeit with code over cobalt? Are employees aware of this possibility as part of their day job? If civilian operators on the cyber front-line “abandon their posts” -- literally removing hands from keyboards -- should they be court-martialed?\nWorse still: What if individual civilians, unbeknownst to their corporate managers, sympathize with the aggressor state, or have been compromised by the aggressor (via blackmail, bribery, or disinformation)? This may lead employees to feign cyber-defense and even aid the cyberattacker. Indeed, one of the interviewees worried that “moles are already there in the private sector,” and that such “moles” may be feeding sensitive information to adversaries, or even disrupting the systems on behalf of a foreign state (Participant 15, 2019). After all, these privately employed civilians (unlike military personnel) have not pledged allegiance to their (respective) flags. Even if the corporation leadership is patriotic, how can we be sure of the political allegiances of its civilian employees, especially as many are unlikely to have undergone security checks? If private corporations are “fighting” in war, might such corporations (or their CEOs, like Musk, or individual civilian operators) be tempted to aggressively hack-back?\nFurthermore, at what point does a civilian (both based in and, crucially, outside the country waging war) become a direct participant in hostilities and become a liable target for cyber and kinetic strikes under IHL? Horowitz (2024, 322) remarks that -- following an “expansive interpretation of the temporal element of [direct participation in hostilities (DPH)]” under IHL -- “a tech company employee who engages in DPH,” including strictly cyber-defense, “even if only infrequently during a work week from their office, might lose protection from attack not only while they engage in those specific acts of DPH but also continuously from morning to night and at home for an extended period of time.” Even if a narrow view of the temporal aspect of DPH is adopted -- wherein a civilian may only be targeted “for such time” that she is actively contributing to military activity via cyber-defense -- this dynamic creates a “revolving door” for civilians “who repeatedly engage in DPH”. Civilians forfeit and regain protection status depending on whether their hands are, quite literally in that moment, on the keyboard.\nCivilians who are completely oblivious of their contribution to hostilities retain their protection status. Might that be an argument for not telling private corporation employees about their foreseeable role in defending against cyberattacks in war? This seems ethically dubious, as it raises a host of questions surrounding transparency and individuals' agency. Civilian tech employees also do not forfeit their protection status when acting in “self-defense or in defense of others against violence prohibited against IHL,” such as “looting, rape, and murder by marauding” (emphasis added, Melzer 2009, 61, cited in; Horowitz 2024, 319). But civilian employees would forfeit their protected status (and become liable to targeting) if they are knowingly responding to cyberattacks that are permissible under IHL. Further still, if an individual tech employee is engaged in DPH and commits a violation of IHL that amounts to war crimes, they become liable under international criminal law. To what extent are civilian employees aware of this when they join a private corporation and are expected to fight in (cyber)wars to protect CI?\nSecond, if the military is not responsible for defending privately owned CI from devastating cyberattacks triggering and during war, then this means acknowledging that the military is seemingly responsible for defending the civilian population only in certain ways when it comes to CI (Participant 3, 2019). To be precise, it means the military is responsible for: i) defending CI from attacks emanating from the “physical domain,” ii) thwarting cyberattacks that target their own military or government systems, iii) mounting offensive cyber operations against adversarial CI, and iv) intelligence gathering and (if possible) sharing with companies. Correspondingly, the civilian population must be made aware of, and consent to, the reality that an entire arm of the state will not be readied or resourced to protect against a catastrophic cyberattack against CI amounting to or during war.\nThird, as private corporations are required to shoulder enhanced duties to protect themselves (and the civilians who depend on them), they will be driven to amass more wealth and influence to fulfil the responsibilities demanded of them by states. After all, the flipside of the adage “with great power comes great responsibility” is with great responsibility comes the requirement to obtain the power to fulfil that responsibility. The foreseeable result is that private corporations will become even more powerful, and the public sector even more dependent on private corporations to guarantee national cybersecurity.\nThe worry, then, is that demanding private corporations to act like states means permitting -- indeed, requiring -- private corporations to fulfil the responsibilities of states. But private corporations are not states. CEOs are not democratically elected by the civilian populations they are (ostensibly) charged to protect. Their main pursuit is not protection but profit. There is no requirement for patriotism.\nMaybe these consternations are mute: private corporations could simply be subsumed under government control during war time via nationalization. Yet this dynamic circles back to the issues raised above pertaining to an overreliance on civilian consent or conscription. May individual employees conscientiously object to participating in war? If so, this will leave a lacuna for cyber-defense, as the military has not thus far been readied-and-resourced to respond (according to the interviewees). If not, this means conscripting employees to participate in war -- via cyber -- when they do not wish to; this may spell a cyber-equivalent to the “non-firing phenomenon” (where soldiers fail to shoot or to shoot accurately at the enemy). These questions highlight the further dissolution between civilians and the military in cyberspace.\nAs two interviewees noted: “by the time [the adversary is] in our systems, it's already too late” (Participant 18, 2019), and “if I were thinking about the current threats, I would be sleepless” (Participant 14, 2019). Relying heavily on private corporations and, crucially, their civilian employees to defend CI in war prompts a required reassessment and renegotiation regarding the role of the military (as the warfighting machine) in the digital age. Perhaps before states begin forcibly requiring civilian employees of private corporations to provide cyber-defense of CI in/as part of war, the military (alongside relevant public and private bodies) should be better equipped to help protect.\n## Conclusion NATO has long recognized cyberspace as a domain of war alongside air, land, and sea. Whilst the threat of cyberattacks has been widely debated, political and military leaders have consistently warned that adversaries will target CI with cyberattacks to initiate and prosecute conflict. Despite these concerns, there has been limited attention afforded to how Civil--Military Relations theory makes sense of cyberspace, and almost no empirical inquiry into how militaries understand their role in cyber-defense.\nTo fill this gap in defense studies literature, we conducted extensive, original elite interviews with military members across 12 NATO countries. Our data provided empirical evidence to confirm the theoretical opacity in cyber-CMR. It remains unclear at which point the military might be asked to get involved in the cyber-defense of CI, and it seems that they would not be capable to help, even in war. Militaries play a role in gathering and sharing intelligence, defending forward, and reacting (via cyber or kinetic measures) after the fact. But they do not play a role in actively defending civilian CI as they would in other domains of war (Participant 12, 2019). According to our interviewees, this is because the military could not act (effectiveness narrative), should not act (environment narrative), and is not permitted to act (authorization narrative). Instead, the interviewees pointed to the fact that private owners and operators of CI play a central role in war.\nGiven this dynamic, the article then explores concerns around allocation of financial resources, “dual-use” infrastructures, and “having faith” in the private sector to “do the right thing.” The final part of the paper then controversially asks whether the military ought to be more involved. This section unpacked the serious legal, normative, and practical considerations with the private sector -- specifically, their civilian employees -- being on the front line of cyber-defense in war. To what extent should civilian employees be expected to act qua the military to defend against a cyberattack triggering or occurring in war? Are engineers in private corporations aware that they could become a direct participant in hostilities under IHL (and thereby forfeit their protection status as civilians)? What are the consequences of civilians abandoning their post or refusing to partake in defensive war? May they -- should they -- be court-martialed?\nBy raising these questions, this article galvanizes future research into determining if and how the military should be more involved or whether and when civilians should be conscripted into cyberwars. Additional investigations should involve interviewing the private owners and operators of CI to ascertain i) their views on the military's role in defending their CI, and ii) how they understand their own role in cyber-defense in 21st century wars. Future research may also seek to determine whether greater military involvement into cyber-defense of CI could act as a deterrent against potential adversaries, contributing to a burgeoning literature debating the applicability of deterrence strategy in cyberspace (see Borghard and Lonergan 2023; Lilli 2021; Schneider 2019). Finally, further research could conduct a cross-cultural comparison to highlight differences among NATO states and examine how competitor states, such as Russia and China, guarantee their cyber-defense of CI in war. This is especially pertinent, as the CMR separation in such autocracies is less stark.\nIn conclusion, as one NATO senior military officer noted: How states provide for the defense of CI from cyberattacks that trigger and feature in war is “fundamentally a societal choice” (Participant 13, 2019). For now, the officer continued, “we are hoping and praying the private companies have their defenses in order” (Participant 13, 2019).",

However, when asked how the military discharges this responsibility to protect citizens from adversarial cyberattacks on CI either triggering or happening in war, all of the interviewees stated that the military was ill-suited or ill-prepared to intervene, even in the case where it might be asked to do so. We also found that, despite cyberspace being recognized as a domain of military operations, military members' understanding of their role reflects the complexities of the cyber war-peace continuum. Three recurring narratives emerged from the interviewees when describing the limits of their role. Each chime with the three tensions articulated in cyber-CMR above: the uniqueness of the domain, the blurring of foreign/domestic theaters, and what this means for understanding war.

NATO member states have recognized cyberspace as a new domain of war – one through which adversaries will target CI to both commence and prosecute conflict. Given this: How do NATO member state militaries understand their part in protecting civilian CI from cyberattacks that constitute casus belli? Drawing on original, empirical evidence – 31 interviews and 1 focus group with senior military, defense, and intelligence cyber experts from 12 NATO states – this article argues that militaries regard themselves as unable, unauthorized, and ill-suited to protect CI from cyberattacks that initiate or occur in war. Instead, NATO member states overwhelmingly rely on private corporations (notably their civilian employees) for the protection of CI – including in violent conflict. This article provides original, empirical evidence to confirm the claim that the theory of Civil-Military Relations (CMR) falters when applied to cyberspace. It also asks cutting normative questions attendant with private corporations being on the front line of cyber-defense during war and argues that cyberspace obfuscates the boundaries of modern-day conflicts. This forces a re-examination of the military's role in 21st century wars.",
    "## (Cyber) Civil--Military Relations CMR elucidates the relationship between the armed forces, the people, and the state's civilian authorities: it stresses civilian control over the military, defines what it means to be a professional soldier in a democratic society, and identifies which items of the national security agenda fall to the military. It is with this latter aspect of CMR with which we are principally concerned because it pertains to the role of the military in cyber operations, and in the protection of critical infrastructure. The consensus in the literature and in practice has been to try to maintain the separation between the military and civilians when it comes to critical infrastructure protection (CIP) (Pačka and Mareš 2021). However, the development of cyberspace challenges the foundational theoretical assumptions of CMR in three ways.": "First, cyberspace inherently blurs the traditional division between foreign and domestic theatres, which has authorization complexities for the military operating on home soil. One of the main tenets of CMR is that the military “does not generally operate or deploy domestically”. As a result, the focus of the military (acting on behalf and at the behest of the civilian government) has been on defending against physical, foreign threats. Yet, this view has been somewhat altered since the collapse of the Soviet Union, when the new threat environment drew to the fore a more diverse set of security imperatives. Non-traditional security threats, such as terrorism, civil conflicts, pandemics, and natural disasters, have “compelled a world-wide re-thinking of the roles and missions of armed forces” within the CMR literature (Diamond, and Plattner 1996, x). “[V]irtually everywhere”, Bruneau and Matei (2012, 2) contend, “militaries and other security instruments are taking on new roles and missions”, such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR).\nThe changing character of national security forces militaries to adapt to a wider array of missions and to develop a broader purpose. But the military's focus largely remains on providing security from physical, external threats. In the 21st century, technological transformations altered the character of security and war yet again, forcing scholars to question whether CMR needs to be adjusted to protect states in “non-traditional battlefields,” notably cyberspace and outerspace. The boundaries between domestic and external security threats became increasingly obscured by transnational digital information systems.\nAn important implication of this reality for CMR is a change of the main locus of military operations: “soldiers operating on the home front” might come to be seen as the rule rather than the exception. As put by Burton (2015, 302), cyberattacks “occur over a globally linked network of computer systems and can be launched without warning, in milliseconds, from anywhere on the planet.” Cyberspace, he argues, creates a new challenge for security organizations like NATO, which has “traditionally focused on geographically proximate security threats”. This brought others to argue that soldiers will be securing networks and countering intrusions against critical infrastructure. The nature of transnational cyber threats, therefore, has important implications for the future role of the military, urging states to reconsider whether a physical, territorial distinction -- a separation between domestic and foreign theatres of operations -- is justified (or indeed even possible) in cyberspace.\nSecond, cyberspace challenges CMR's clear distinction between civilian and military domains because the cyberspace environment is inherently different from that of traditional, physical domains of war (land, air, and sea). As such, the traditional CMR boundaries between military and civilian spheres have become increasingly hazy. Pačka and Mareš (2021, 437) note: “In a common national security and defense ecosystem, the roles of players such as an army, police, intelligence agency, and others are set clearly and there is an evident division of labor... cyberspace constantly changes the boundaries.” Cyberspace is “blurring the lines between the traditional expertise of the uniformed military and the roles and responsibilities of civilians” (Beehner, Brooks, and Maurer 2021, 5). This is especially the case because aggressions in cyberspace often target civilian persons or infrastructure.\nAs militaries become more involved in the cyber domain, they will inevitably conduct their operations over “international and domestic computer infrastructure that supports the dense lattice of digital-age civilian life”. As Sharpe, Trichas, and Terrill (2024, 5) note, “recognition of... cyberspace as a critical domain... represents a paradigm shift in military strategy.” Further distorting the distinction between civilian and military spheres is the fact that technological infrastructure is often dual-use and that militaries rely increasingly on civilian networks for their own operations. Consensus amongst CMR scholars seems to be that the uniqueness of the cyber domain requires “unorthodox” and innovative approaches to the organization of security and defense, challenging, in the words of Brooks (2016, 359), existing “walls” between civilians and the military. As summarized by Chayes (2015, 187): “Civil and military roles are not easily sorted out in the area of cyberattacks and cyber warfare.”\nThird, cyberspace forces a revision not only of what it means to fight wars and of who is involved in warfighting but of the delineation between war and peace itself (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022; Sewall 2021). Constant contact and interconnectedness are key features of cyberspace, favoring initiative and pre-emption over passivity and reactive defense, meaning that states are incentivized to persistently exploit adversary vulnerabilities in order to gain and maintain the advantage (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022). This challenges the dominant Western understanding of war, premised on “use of force” and “armed attack” as the crossing of what is usually considered to be the boundary between war and peace. Unlike with conventional warfare, there is seemingly no strict division between war and peace in cyberspace. States are in a constant state of competition. NATO holds the view that “cyberspace is contested at all times”. Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett (2022, 123) argue that this requires a paradigm shift in policy and strategy planning, one that would focus on an “increased tempo” of cyber military operations outside their own network, and continuous preparation and execution of cyber campaigns.\nAs the complexities of cyberspace are challenging the long-held clear division between war and peace, by extension, the clear separation between civilian and military spheres is also contested. Is there a need for “an increased tempo” of cyber military operations not only outside the defense's network but outside the unique context of war? That the military might play a role outside of warfighting is not new to cyberspace, as discussed above, and so it is justified to address the challenge of continuous competition in cyberspace and activities occurring in this space between peace and war.\nThe question that then flows from this is whether it matters at all when a cyberattack against CI reaches the threshold of an armed attack and triggers Article 5, especially with regards to the roles and responsibilities of cyber-defense. Surely, it does matter, because -- traditionally -- if states are at war, different agents become responsible for action (namely, the military). Yet in cyberspace, this does not seem to be the case, with this responsibility being entrusted to private actors even during conflict. Instead, it seems that the dissolution of the war-peace continuum in cyberspace is making it difficult for states to identify the appropriate response to cyberattacks against the nation's CI, both during the crisis phase, before Article 5 is invoked, and during war. It is with these kinds of cyberattacks, that could constitute casus belli or occur in war, that this article is concerned.\nOwing to these complexities, it is unclear “whether civil-military relations are sufficiently calibrated to protect... in these non-traditional battlefields” where “warfare encompass[es]... less-understood cyber-tools” (Beehner, Brooks, and Maurer 2021, 3). The foundational assumptions built into CMR paradigmatically accept that the military's role is in defending against physical, external threats, focused within war time and is wedded to the distinction between civilian and military responsibilities. But, as others have noted, cyberspace generates theoretical tensions regarding the applicability of these three a priori accepted precepts.",
    "## Research design and methodology: NATO case study If cyberattacks on CI will inevitably feature in 21st century conflicts, then it is urgent to understand if and how the military, as the institution responsible for warfighting and defense on behalf of the state, understands its role. In other words, it is of paramount importance to test whether existing theoretical tensions are reflected empirically -- by going straight to the source. The justification for casing our study to NATO is because the alliance represents a significant proportion of the global population and serves as a key exemplar of dominant Western perspectives.": "We conducted 31 semi-structured interviews with military and defense cyber subject matter experts (SMEs) from 12 NATO member states, and 1 focus group of 7 military cyber experts. Representatives from Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Estonia, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US) participated in the research. These countries were chosen based on access (at the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Tallinn and at the NATO Headquarters in Brussels) and expertise within the NATO alliance regarding cyber-defense, including states that are technologically advanced and at the forefront of cyber affairs in practice, and others that are not as well positioned. Among NATO states, cyber-defense of CI is a national responsibility and as such, strategies vary across nations but clear similarities can be found. This illustrates that regardless of a state's level of “cyber-awareness,” most NATO members share similar views on the role of the military regarding the cyber-defense of CI. It also illuminates an apparent disconnect between traditional CMR assumptions regarding the role of the military in territorial defense against external threats and current military perceptions across NATO states. It is also important to note that cyber-offense has its own very specific construct -- Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies (SCEPVA) -- which we do not explore in this paper.\nBy “cyber subject matter experts” we mean military members (officers and enlisted) and civilians (policy advisors) working for defense ministries and at the NATO Headquarters, whose principal occupation is with matters of cyberspace -- both offense and defense. The interview participants included senior military officials (including two-star generals) and cyber experts and lawyers from the military and other government departments (including ministries of defense and intelligence agencies) from NATO member states.\nInterviewees were assured that their views would not be taken as representative of NATO or their “home” state, military, or department, and that their identity would be anonymized. Accordingly, quotes have not been assigned to specific roles or states in order to mitigate the risks associated with attribution, particularly those arising from cross-referencing. The goal of conducting these interviews was not to examine differences in cultural approaches across NATO members, although this would be a valuable future study.\nA note on limitations. One limitation pertaining to the approach of this research is that, by focusing on military perspectives only, the research excludes other crucial stakeholders such as private-sector partners and other public agencies like police, local cyber task forces and computer emergency response teams (CERTS). Notably, we do not examine what the private owners and operators of CI (CEOs and/or employees) consider as the appropriate role of the military in cyber-defense. This question, albeit important, requires a separate, substantive future investigation -- one that, due to space constraints, we could not explore here. Instead, our interest lies with understanding the military's role in defending the nation against cyberattacks, a question that is best answered by those working in defense who are across the current military cyber posture. That said, the participants also included representatives from intelligence agencies, who work closely with their military counterparts and who have important responsibilities in both cyber-offense and cyber-defense in many countries. These interviewees were well placed to differentiate the role of the military and that of intelligence agencies in responding to a cyber event, confirming some issues raised by defense interviewees in terms of cyber-CMR.",
    "## NATO militaries' perceptions of cyber-defense of CI In the words of the interviewees, the purpose of the military is to “serve, protect, and defend” the state and the population against foreign aggression. However, when asked how the military discharges this responsibility to protect citizens from adversarial cyberattacks on CI either triggering or happening in war, all of the interviewees stated that the military was ill-suited or ill-prepared to intervene, even in the case where it might be asked to do so. We also found that, despite cyberspace being recognized as a domain of military operations, military members' understanding of their role reflects the complexities of the cyber war-peace continuum. Three recurring narratives emerged from the interviewees when describing the limits of their role. Each chime with the three tensions articulated in cyber-CMR above: the uniqueness of the domain, the blurring of foreign/domestic theaters, and what this means for understanding war. To begin, however, we survey how militaries presently engage in cyber-defense of CI.": "### Defending forward, persistent engagement, and integrated deterrence NATO member militaries are engaged in collecting, analyzing, and exchanging intelligence with other government agencies, the private sector, and NATO allies (U.S. DoD 2023). Information collection and sharing is considered an integral aspect of cyber-defense. When private corporations identify a threat in their system and pass that information along to government agencies, such public agencies then make recommendations regarding how the private companies ought to rectify the vulnerability and voluntarily assist in that process (which, in many instances, can be declined by the corporation). Yet, importantly (for reasons we explore below), according to one of our interviewees: “the government won't go into anyone's systems: they have a coordination role, but otherwise it's hands off the keyboard” (Participant 18, 2019).\nMoreover, NATO state militaries are authorized (and indeed required) to take proactive measures to ensure the cybersecurity of their own military systems -- principally to ensure continued operability across the traditional, physical domains of armed conflict. The desire to enhance the cyber resilience of the Alliance was reiterated at the 2023 Vilnius Summit. As a senior military officer explained, however, “the primary concern of the military is to ensure our cyber systems are working so we can do kinetic defense: the military has a monopoly on kinetic defense, not cyber” (Participant 12, 2019).\nA few of the interviewees stated that the military is engaged in what has long been understood as “active defense:” “defensive operations that involve direct engagement with sophisticated adversaries in DoD-controlled cyberspace”. The U.S. in particular has employed the notion of “defending forward” which aims to pre-emptively “stop threats before they reach their targets” (U.S. Department of Defense 2018, 2) and which was developed in response to criticisms that the military was not proactively defending critical infrastructure against cyberattacks (Former US Cyber Command official, personal communication with author, 2020). “Defending forward,” “active defense,” and “persistent engagement” were born out of the recognition that the U.S. could not expect private corporations to defend themselves against the full power of an adversarial state. Both approaches form part of what the U.S. now regards as “integrated deterrence,” developed in the most recent DoD Cyber Strategy (2023, 2), which focuses on using military cyber capabilities “in concert with other instruments of national power.”\nFurther still, the military would likely be the apparatus called upon by the state in the “response” phase of a devastating cyberattack (Participants 8, 14, 16, 22). The military would be responsible for launching a cyber or kinetic counter-offensive, following appropriate attribution processes (proportionality, necessity, and distinction factors considered). But such responses are necessarily ex post facto. As was expressed in the focus group (2019): “Reacting after the fact is a losing strategy.” Until then, the front line of defense -- with public sector support, especially intelligence agencies -- is the private corporations.\n### The effectiveness narrative: can not Previously, it has been thought that -- in the context of NATO and specifically the U.S. -- the resources and expertise on cyber-defense and cyberwar was retained by the military. Our empirical evidence finds the opposite to be the case. Most of the interviewees argued that their respective militaries currently lack the necessary resources, human-power, and relevant expertise required to effectively defend CI from cyberattacks. As a result, the interviewees consistently highlighted that, due to the nature of the domain, the military is unable to protect civilian CI from cyberattacks -- even those that can trigger or occur in war. One interviewee compared this lack of cyber capability with traditional, kinetic attacks: “The military is the only institution or organization to defend against armed attacks, because they're the only ones who have fighter planes. But in a cyberattack, Cyber Command won't be first [to respond], because they don't have the capability” (Participant 19, 2019). Another senior military officer (Participant 3, 2019) reflected that attention ought to be focused on pragmatically determining which organization is likely to be most successful in providing cyber-defense: “It's about having the right tools, and the right knowledge... the military might not be best placed to defend certain infrastructure.” For instance, interviewees rightly pointed out that in many countries intelligence agencies play a significant role in the cyber-defense of the nation and its critical infrastructure, notably by advising and assisting other government agencies and the private sector (see for instance GCHQ n.d.; Government of Canada n.d.).\nA few interviewees also noted that because the private corporations that own and operate CI use different and often “tailor-made” platforms, it would be almost impossible for cyber experts in the military to be sufficiently knowledgeable to defend across all the different systems. It is “unimaginable” for the military to help, one interviewee reflected, “because they are completely unfamiliar with the systems” (Participant 9, 2019).\nSome of the interviewees argued that it would be financially ineffective or even prohibitively expensive to have the military provide cyber-defense for CI: it is “better to let the private sector deal with it,” because having the government provide the cyber-defense for critical infrastructure would be “implausible and expensive” (Participant 12, 2019). “Private corporations should be responsible,” one interviewee stated, “otherwise there would be a lot of taxpayers' money required to provide [protection for] those systems -- like a ‘cybersecurity tax' for providing cyber-defense of critical infrastructure” (Participant 9, 2019). The interviewees' perception echoes the sentiment highlighted in the literature on critical infrastructure protection that private owners are best placed to establish cyber-defenses.\nThe environment narrative: should not When discussing why the military does not play a greater role in protecting CI from cyberattacks -- as they would if the “armed attack” was emanating from other domains of war -- the interviewees stated that this is because “cyberspace is fundamentally different” (Participant 15, 2019). The participants overwhelmingly referred to cyberspace's ubiquitous, borderless, fluid, and invisible nature. The interviewees emphasized the relatively abstract characteristics of cyberspace identified in the literature as affecting the military's ability to help defend. One government official simply stated: “cyber is a different domain; we haven't figured out how it works” (Participant 22, 2019). Another interviewee reflected: “In cyber, the fog of war is heightened” (Participant 11, 2019). Interviewees also referred to the difficulty of determining whether sovereignty is applicable to cyberspace and where borders might begin and end, thereby touching on the ongoing debate between NATO member states about whether sovereignty is applicable to cyberspace.\nIn most instances, the interviewees' reference to sovereignty was intended to highlight that, unlike in sea, air, and land -- which have clear, physical borders that can be transgressed -- cyberspace has no such border. The interviewees often highlighted the difficulty of defending against cyberattacks by comparing cyberspace with the physical domains of warfighting: “You can see equipment like frigates and airplanes,” one interviewee noted, “but you can't see firewalls or malicious code” (Focus group 2019).\nA majority of interviewees also argued that the military does not have a significant role in defending CI from cyberattacks that could trigger war or happen in war because -- again, in contrast to the physical domain -- it is an “unchartered territory” and so “the line between government and private” is “blurred” (Participants 16, 18 and 26, 2019). A few interviewees drew parallels with the other services, claiming that “we've had an army, navy, and air force for a long time, but cyberspace is new” (Participant 13, 2019). These comments are reminiscent of the remarks made by Lt. Col. Kurt Sanger, Chief Judge Advocate for National Security Law at U.S. Cyber Command at the 2019 CyCon U.S: “For most of the domains, you have thousands of years and millions of warriors contributing to the lessons that you're now learning... We don't have that in cyberspace”. In short, cyberspace itself was thought by the interviewees as an inherently exposed space, with points of vulnerabilities too vast to comprehend. As one officer put it, “cyberspace is un-defendable” (Participant 12, 2019). These responses align with what Cate (2015, 307) identifies as the prevailing “sense of despair about the size and complexity of the challenge.”\nOur empirical evidence highlights that the military believes it should not play a significant role in defending CI. In doing so, it thereby supports the extant theoretical claim that cyberspace distorts the lines between the domestic vs. foreign spheres and forces an alteration of traditional territorial and sovereign conceptions of defense. This further illustrates the dissolution of the traditional division between civilian and military sectors in CMR due to the unprecedented nature of the domain.\nThe authorization narrative: not permitted The last narrative that emerged from the interviewees' responses is that of “authorization.” A third of the interviewees noted that the military is not permitted to operate on domestic soil. Typically, within NATO states, the military is not automatically authorized to conduct what are considered police enforcement duties: for instance, the U.S. Posse Comitatus Act, signed in 1878, is designed to prohibit the deployment of the military to enforce domestic civilian policies and practices “unless expressly authorized by the Constitution or an act of Congress” (Congressional Research Service 2018). It seems that this is what most of the interviewees were referring to when raising concerns regarding “authorization.” Many participants explained that this is a “design reality” of the democratic system, which means that states are constrained and restrained by their legal environment (Participants 1, 2 and 13, 2019). As one interviewee articulated, “the legislation is not adjusted for the realities of cyberspace” (Participant 7, 2019), while another reflected, “if we want to live in a liberal, democratic society, this is what we get” (Participant 17, 2019).\nSome interviewees highlighted that the military would be called upon, by the state, to operate in the territory of that sovereign state in the instance that there is an actual use of physical force against the state. As one interviewee explained: “Obviously if our ‘friends' in the East rolled tanks across the border right now, our forces would be authorized to act in the state to repel that assault. It wouldn't be the police's job” (Participant 15, 2019).\nAdditionally, a few interviewees raised concerns regarding privacy as a barrier to greater military involvement. One military officer noted that: “[People] are OK that we have ships, border patrol, flight deterrence... But with cyber, people don't want the government to look into their Internet connectivity” (Participant 18, 2019). Overall, the interviewees consistently stated that the military would be called upon to protect the sovereign state from a land invasion, naval assault, or airborne missile strike against CI -- but this would not be the case regarding a comparable assault emanating from cyberspace.\nThe three narratives empirically confirm the tension highlighted in the literature on cyber-CMR. It further resonates with the 2023 U.S. Cyber Strategy that the Department of Defense “lacks the authority to employ military forces to defend private companies against cyberattacks” and that there are “limited circumstances in which military cyber forces would be asked to defend civilian critical infrastructure -- the Department will not posture itself to defend every private sector network” (U.S. DoD 2023, 13). In short, NATO member militaries do not believe they play a major role in cyber-defense of CI that initiates or occurs amidst war due to environment, effectiveness, and authorization complexities. As one interviewee noted: “There is a contradiction between the fear of cyberattacks, [and the fact that] we [the people]... don't want the military to play a bigger role” (Participant 18, 2019).",
    "## Critical discussion of the military perspective There are three key findings that arise from the empirical evidence. First: the military members affirm the perception of the blurred nature of cyber-CMR described above. Second: the minimal military involvement raises urgent questions regarding CI that will be targeted in war. Third: while regulations have improved in the past few years, it is the private corporations that are principally responsible for protecting CI from sophisticated state-sponsored cyberattacks during war. These findings invite a re-examination of the role of the military in 21st century conflicts.": "### A reflection of political will and political choices One of the explanations invoked by the interviewees for why the military is not more involved in the cyber-defense of CI is because the military currently lacks the financial and human resources to do so (the effectiveness narrative). Some might claim that it is unreasonable to reassign some military funding for cyber-defense of CI in the face of “defense austerity” -- although in the U.S. this notion is debatable, as the proposed 2024 budget for the entire DoD totaled $842 billion (Congressional Budget Office 2023). One interviewee argued that this objection is misplaced, as taking proactive security measures prior to an “inevitable cyberattack against critical infrastructure” is a more fiscally responsible decision from the outset (Participant 4, 2019).\nFunds already allocated to the acquisition of traditional kinetic weapons could (again, hypothetically) be redirected toward: the military's development of defensive cyber technologies for CI, the recruitment of more military cyber personnel, and the expansion and implementation of CIP military training programs. Other interviewees instead reiterated an absence of political will for states to invest highly in something as intangible as cybersecurity: “Guns and tanks and fighter jets are sexier. They're sexier and easier for politicians to show off for their next election campaign, that they're doing something for national security... [They're] not really able to show off lines of code” (Focus group, 2019).\nAside from the fiscal element is the ostensible “novelty” and “unknowable-ness” of cyberspace as to why they “should not” be involved in defense of CI (the environment narrative). Confusion surrounding cyberspace's distinct character is something that is debated in the literature. Nonetheless, there is a risk of “succumbing to the shock of the new”. Erroneously perceiving the form of a domain as inherently enigmatic stymies progress toward establishing effective defense systems. Considering other “newer” domains of war, one interviewee compared cyberspace to the air force: no “historical accident... the air force was born out of the need for defense from attacks in airspace in the 20th century” (Participant 28, 2019). It is a political choice to allocate the main face of defense in war to private corporations.\nMoreover, whilst the military is prima facie prohibited from operating on domestic soil, the authorization narrative should be interrogated further. Indeed, the military could -- and would -- be called upon by the state to operate in its sovereign territory if there is an actual use of physical force tantamount to an armed attack. In the face of cyberattacks that do reach the level of an armed attack and that could trigger NATO's Article 5, conceivably, the military would be authorized to get involved in the cyber-defense of civilian CI systems. Theoretically at least, cyber aggressions comparable to armed attacks do not pose a significantly new challenge for civil--military relations. Nonetheless, the research finds that even with this kind of attack that could constitute casus belli, or occur during war, uncertainty remains within the military regarding the extent to which they would be authorized (or able) to get involved in the cyber-defense of private networks. Even when faced with cyberattacks that would amount to an armed attack, or during war, the military would not be able to effectively help defend CI. The militaries' current (and limited) ability and expectation to provide cyber-defense of CI is a political calculation. One defense personnel reflected: “I feel that there is a growing need for more cyber units in the military, and since cyber has now been recognized as a proper domain of armed conflict on par with air, land, sea and in some cases also space, I think it will happen... It is just a question of how it will evolve, and through which means. (Participant 16, 2019)” Nevertheless, according to the interviewees, this is likely only after some “catastrophic” cyberattack on CI (Participants 8 and 29, 2019). The current decision to rely heavily on private corporations, albeit with mandatory reporting and compliance mechanisms, is a political choice.\n### Concerns surrounding “dual-use” infrastructures A further implication of minimal military involvement is how to deal with “dual-use” CI. Civilian CI has been and will continue to be targeted by adversarial actors as part of war. One interviewee stated: “There is no such thing as a ‘military' cyberattack; 90% of the time it will be against civilian infrastructure” (Participant 22, 2019). According to another: “Adversaries will -- and already do -- attack critical infrastructure as a primary target via cyberspace, because it's what we would do” (Participant 7, 2019). States will likely seek to disable CI in war in order to gain a military advantage.\nAs per international cyber norms regarding responsible state behavior, there is a prohibition of “cyber operations that cause intentional damage or impairment to critical infrastructure (CI)”. CI should be -- in the words of then U.S. President Joe Biden -- “‘off limits' to attack” (cited in Haataja 2022, 425). Of course, only military objects and combatants are liable to be lawfully targeted in war; according to the International Humanitarian Law (IHL) principle of distinction, intentionally targeting civilians and civilian CI (including via cyber) is prohibited. Nevertheless, the urgency of preparing the military to contribute to the defense of CI is even more apparent given the potential for civilian CI to be rendered a liable military objective. This is because civilian CI can: i) become co-opted for military purposes, ii) have a “military utility,” or iii) be “dual-use”.\nThere are three concerns raised here. First, if (privately owned) CI networks become “dual-use” or are of “military utility,” they become military objectives and thus may be lawfully targeted. As Horowitz (2024, 327) notes: a “privately owned civilian aviation air traffic control tower that the enemy military temporarily uses to enable offensive operations” might be rendered a military objective “because of its ‘use.'” Moreover, according to the Tallinn Manual 2.0: if critical infrastructure is being used by both civilian and military ends, and it is “impossible” to differentiate between the civilian and military parts of a system, “the entire network... qualifies as a military objective”.\nSecond, because of the invisible nature of cyberspace, it is additionally challenging to differentiate between civilian vs. military cyber infrastructures. As such, there is foreseeably a large scope for misinterpretation and accidental military targeting of CI. Third, it is unclear whether preparatory acts on “dual-use” infrastructures during peacetime -- such as the insertion of dormant malware -- constitutes an attack or strictly cyber-espionage. Haataja (2022, 424, 428) highlights that there is a danger for pre-positioned adversarial code in CI that could be activated later, a practice known as “persistent presence” in CI. Simply planting malware or creating “backdoors” certainly violates international cyber norms and could be considered a breach of a state's obligation under international law (others consider such cyber norms “voluntary, non-binding”). But such cyber-operations themselves are unlikely to rise to the level of an armed attack. Activating a dormant malware in a privately owned CI, such as a nuclear powerplant, causing it to explode, would foreseeably reach that threshold. All of this points to the complexity of defending CI from cyberattacks that constitute casus belli or may be pursued in war.\n### A degree of (risky) faith in the private sector Private corporations that own and operate CI ought to provide appropriate cyber-defensive measures -- especially to protect what one interviewee called “low-hanging fruits” (Participant 3, 2019). Nonetheless, as one interviewee noted: “We can't expect private companies to protect themselves against state-sponsored attacks” (Participant 23, 2019). Many interviewees expressed having “faith” in private corporations adhering to proper standards and regulations: “We hope they [the private corporations] do the right thing” (Participant 8, 2019).\nUsing the physical domain as an analogy, the private owners of a power grid would be expected to employ a reasonable degree of security -- locking doors, installing surveillance cameras, erecting wire fences, and employing security guards, and so on. However, the security guard would not be expected to defend against an attack that rises to a use of force tantamount with war. Defense from in-coming ballistic missiles would fall to the state and -- foreseeably -- the air force: “In the physical world, we don't require companies to have an air force, or submarines, or to really look at the pointy end of an attack”.\nYet whilst companies have oversight, assistance, and mandatory regulations from government, the front line of defense in cyberspace remains the purview of companies. It is often in their profit margins interests to ensure their cyber-defenses are in order, and to work closely and collaboratively with government agencies to redress vulnerabilities or incursions. Beyond purely monetary interests, corporations could be appealed to do so on the notion of “loyalty”. They may be incentivized to effectively participate in the provision of cyber-defense based on “a moral commitment to ‘solidarity' and ‘community responsibility'”. One senior government official iterated this patriotic duty to “protect our lifestyle” (Participant 22, 2019). For instance, when asked about who is defending Ukrainian CI from Russian cyberattacks, one retired general responded: “The private corporations in Ukraine are doing an excellent job” (General [retd.], personal communication with author, 2022). Similarly, Matania and Sommer (2023, 3) note that “Tech Titans” (Google, Microsoft, Meta, Apple, SpaceX and Amazon) are playing a meaningful role in the armed conflict in Ukraine.\nThat said, as one interviewee reflected: “appealing towards companies' patriotism... is probably not the safest way to do things” (Participant 13, 2019). Even if a private corporation is “homegrown,” it does not guarantee that they are, in fact, patriotic. “Company Over Country” was Meta CEO and Founder Mark Zuckerberg's early motto. Similarly, the whistle blower Haugen (2021, 2) iterated that -- when torn between “its own profits and [the U.S.'] safety,” Meta “consistently... favor[ed] its own profits.” This demonstrates that American-owned corporations have prioritized financial gains over that of the security of the American people. Such a dynamic becomes even more problematic if CI corporations in NATO member states are outsourced and owned by foreign corporations.\nPerhaps “profits before patriotism” is strictly a feature of peacetime: once it comes to war, the dynamic will flip. For instance, by May 2022 Google had pledged approximately $55 million in support of Ukraine's resistance of Russian aggression. Similarly, within days of the full-scale invasion, Microsoft moved Ukraine's critical government data to its cloud storage platform. This was because most of the data was “extremely vulnerable to missile attacks, and their physical destruction could paralyze the entire work of the country's top leadership”.\nYet the view that corporations would be driven by patriotism (or, more accurately, defense of liberal values) over profit hinges on two, risky assumptions. In the first instance, it takes for granted that the CI private corporation heralds from, or is ideologically aligned with, the country under (cyber)attack -- which is not necessarily always the case. It supposes the private corporation may not be under pressure from the attacking-state or wishes to remain neutral, or had been convinced to allow the attack to take place (due to corruption, coercion, or ideological leanings). There is no guarantee for support. There is no expectation for patriotism even from corporations that are (for lack of a better word) “home grown.”\nIn the second instance, it is also not clear how long “patriotic” support or commitment to democratic liberal ideals -- even if it is forthcoming -- might last. While Elon Musk's SpaceX initially sent Starlink satellites to the Ukrainian military for free, it eventually stated it could no longer foot the bill, and the Pentagon had to pick up the tab -- once the reliance on Musk's service had been firmly established (conceivably with an agenda to accrue profits). Moreover, demonstrating the selectivity of private sector support, when the Ukrainian military conducted an offensive into the Russian-held Crimea, they begged Elon Musk to turn on its satellite service in the Russian-controlled area, but he refused to do so because (according to his post on X) he feared SpaceX's complicity in “a major act of war and conflict escalation”. Betting on private corporations' patriotism and political alliances or appetite for war, over that of their foundational and raison d'être interests in profit, is to gamble with national (cyber) defense. If there is a profit to be made, corporations might choose to get involved in conflicts (even distant ones), but they might stop to be involved when it is no longer financially advisable.\nOur empirical data suggests that -- unlike kinetic acts of war emanating in land, air, and sea -- the military is not responsible for defending against state-sponsored acts of aggression against CI via cyberspace. However, trusting private corporations to adequately defend against cyberattacks in war is a risky security strategy.",
    "## Should militaries be more involved? Normative and practical considerations As detailed in the previous section, multiple interviewees remarked on the risks associated with dual-use infrastructure and with being overly reliant on private corporations to provide cyber-defense of CI. Relatedly, some participants expressed concerns about not being readied and resourced to defend CI against cyberattacks. This prompts the question: might there be a case for increasing military involvement in cyber-defense of CI? After all, the military is the principal body responsible for defending civilians (on behalf of the state) from acts of aggression rising to war. Former NATO Deputy Secretary General Rose Gottemoeller et al. (2022) expressed the need for NATO Allies to be better prepared in response to cyberattacks. This requirement is especially pertinent, as Burton (2015, 302) remarks, “cyber operations are increasingly part of [conflicts involving NATO forces] and an element of the strategy of NATO's main state adversaries.” To be clear, we are not in any way suggesting a “military-takes-all,” zero-sum approach to defending CI from cyberattacks that trigger Article 5. The normative question is whether militaries should be readied -- as a last line of defense -- to help protect alongside private corporations and public bodies (such as intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and federal and local cyber task forces).": "One objection to greater military involvement is the potential for escalation. A cyber-defensive operation led by the military could be perceived by an adversary as a cyber countermeasure, resulting in a “tit-for-tat escalation of cyberattacks and responses, each one more serious than the last”. An increased role of the military in providing cyber-defense of CI may therefore lead to “a permissive normative-legal environment in which states are more likely than before to resort to uses of force”.\nA related normative concern is that the increased role of the military in cyber-defense of CI begets the militarization of cyberspace. The perception of the military being involved in a civilian network, even for strictly defensive purposes, may render it a military target. But simply because the military may be called upon, as a last resort, to aid in the cyber-defense of CI does not render the civilian objective ipso facto a military target. In the same way that the military might be called upon to help defend a hospital (for instance) from kinetic attacks, the military presence does not automatically render the hospital a liable military objective.\nAnother further objection might be that introducing the military as an agent of cyber-defense of CI risks increasing the potential for abuse -- notably, through mass militarized surveillance or the military placing pressure on private corporations to act in certain ways. Relatedly, there may be normative concerns regarding competing authorities -- an unnecessary duplication of responsibilities and confusion over which entity precisely (the private organization vs. intelligence agency vs. the military) acts in what contexts. Within the extant literature, Public--Private Partnerships in CI protection are already regarded as notoriously fraught with complications pertaining to cooperation, information sharing, and trust. For instance, one interviewee noted that -- on the issue of information sharing of breaches -- “private companies won't ‘sho their hand'... they would rather sell the intelligence than give it away for free” (Participant 9, 2019). Surely adding another agent into the mix will make cyber-defense more complex.\nA reply to these two objections is that the military should only get involved when: i) the private entity is unable or unwilling to respond, ii) that the aid of the existing public agencies is insufficient, or iii) that the cyberattack would (through its scale and effects) constitute an armed attack. What should be envisaged is a live, cooperative triage system, whereby the military might be deployed only to help defend CI, should the attack foreseeably trigger war or take place in war, or if other responders have failed to address the threat and require additional assistance.\nOne further objection is that increasing military involvement generates a moral hazard for the private sector. Specifically, if the military is offering a pseudo-“security umbrella,” private corporations may be disincentivized to invest in necessary cybersecurity measures and instead increase their risk tolerance (as per prospect theory). Cybersecurity is costly and time-consuming; saving on cybersecurity would likely increase corporations' profits, and energy and resources could be redirected to other parts of business.\nHowever, there are several considerations that would foreseeably mitigate this moral hazard. Corporations risk extreme reputational damage and services by relying too heavily on possible military defense: corporations must still provide adequate levels of cybersecurity that sufficiently defend against the vast majority of cyberattacks, which are criminal or low-level intrusions. Further, corporations would rather deal with cyber-defense issues in house and (as our interviewees noted) are wary about freely “opening the doors” to the military. These are serious objections to increasing military involvement. But it is also pertinent to examine the normative implications if states do not increase military involvement.\nFirst, the existing requirement for private corporations to be on the “front line” of cyber-defense of CI means demanding that civilians be responsible for defending against disastrous acts of (cyber)war. Even if they are not explicitly conscripted (more on this below) it is the civilian employees of those private sectors who nonetheless currently shoulder national cybersecurity duties. “Like the soldiers in the fortress,” Brenner and Clarke (emphasis added, 2010, 1032) reflect, “computer personnel confronting a cyberattack are responsible for defending their ‘territory' from hostile activity.”\nThis blurring of civilian and military spheres -- the expectation of civilians in corporations to not only contribute to but bear the weight of defending the state from cyber-attacks in war -- opens Pandora's box regarding pressing legal, normative, and practical questions. Is the expectation to participate in cyber-defense during war articulated in the employees' contracts? Are these civilian employees permitted to excuse themselves, or conscientiously object to participating in war, or will they be forced to fight, albeit with code over cobalt? Are employees aware of this possibility as part of their day job? If civilian operators on the cyber front-line “abandon their posts” -- literally removing hands from keyboards -- should they be court-martialed?\nWorse still: What if individual civilians, unbeknownst to their corporate managers, sympathize with the aggressor state, or have been compromised by the aggressor (via blackmail, bribery, or disinformation)? This may lead employees to feign cyber-defense and even aid the cyberattacker. Indeed, one of the interviewees worried that “moles are already there in the private sector,” and that such “moles” may be feeding sensitive information to adversaries, or even disrupting the systems on behalf of a foreign state (Participant 15, 2019). After all, these privately employed civilians (unlike military personnel) have not pledged allegiance to their (respective) flags. Even if the corporation leadership is patriotic, how can we be sure of the political allegiances of its civilian employees, especially as many are unlikely to have undergone security checks? If private corporations are “fighting” in war, might such corporations (or their CEOs, like Musk, or individual civilian operators) be tempted to aggressively hack-back?\nFurthermore, at what point does a civilian (both based in and, crucially, outside the country waging war) become a direct participant in hostilities and become a liable target for cyber and kinetic strikes under IHL? Horowitz (2024, 322) remarks that -- following an “expansive interpretation of the temporal element of [direct participation in hostilities (DPH)]” under IHL -- “a tech company employee who engages in DPH,” including strictly cyber-defense, “even if only infrequently during a work week from their office, might lose protection from attack not only while they engage in those specific acts of DPH but also continuously from morning to night and at home for an extended period of time.” Even if a narrow view of the temporal aspect of DPH is adopted -- wherein a civilian may only be targeted “for such time” that she is actively contributing to military activity via cyber-defense -- this dynamic creates a “revolving door” for civilians “who repeatedly engage in DPH”. Civilians forfeit and regain protection status depending on whether their hands are, quite literally in that moment, on the keyboard.\nCivilians who are completely oblivious of their contribution to hostilities retain their protection status. Might that be an argument for not telling private corporation employees about their foreseeable role in defending against cyberattacks in war? This seems ethically dubious, as it raises a host of questions surrounding transparency and individuals' agency. Civilian tech employees also do not forfeit their protection status when acting in “self-defense or in defense of others against violence prohibited against IHL,” such as “looting, rape, and murder by marauding” (emphasis added, Melzer 2009, 61, cited in; Horowitz 2024, 319). But civilian employees would forfeit their protected status (and become liable to targeting) if they are knowingly responding to cyberattacks that are permissible under IHL. Further still, if an individual tech employee is engaged in DPH and commits a violation of IHL that amounts to war crimes, they become liable under international criminal law. To what extent are civilian employees aware of this when they join a private corporation and are expected to fight in (cyber)wars to protect CI?\nSecond, if the military is not responsible for defending privately owned CI from devastating cyberattacks triggering and during war, then this means acknowledging that the military is seemingly responsible for defending the civilian population only in certain ways when it comes to CI (Participant 3, 2019). To be precise, it means the military is responsible for: i) defending CI from attacks emanating from the “physical domain,” ii) thwarting cyberattacks that target their own military or government systems, iii) mounting offensive cyber operations against adversarial CI, and iv) intelligence gathering and (if possible) sharing with companies. Correspondingly, the civilian population must be made aware of, and consent to, the reality that an entire arm of the state will not be readied or resourced to protect against a catastrophic cyberattack against CI amounting to or during war.\nThird, as private corporations are required to shoulder enhanced duties to protect themselves (and the civilians who depend on them), they will be driven to amass more wealth and influence to fulfil the responsibilities demanded of them by states. After all, the flipside of the adage “with great power comes great responsibility” is with great responsibility comes the requirement to obtain the power to fulfil that responsibility. The foreseeable result is that private corporations will become even more powerful, and the public sector even more dependent on private corporations to guarantee national cybersecurity.\nThe worry, then, is that demanding private corporations to act like states means permitting -- indeed, requiring -- private corporations to fulfil the responsibilities of states. But private corporations are not states. CEOs are not democratically elected by the civilian populations they are (ostensibly) charged to protect. Their main pursuit is not protection but profit. There is no requirement for patriotism.\nMaybe these consternations are mute: private corporations could simply be subsumed under government control during war time via nationalization. Yet this dynamic circles back to the issues raised above pertaining to an overreliance on civilian consent or conscription. May individual employees conscientiously object to participating in war? If so, this will leave a lacuna for cyber-defense, as the military has not thus far been readied-and-resourced to respond (according to the interviewees). If not, this means conscripting employees to participate in war -- via cyber -- when they do not wish to; this may spell a cyber-equivalent to the “non-firing phenomenon” (where soldiers fail to shoot or to shoot accurately at the enemy). These questions highlight the further dissolution between civilians and the military in cyberspace.\nAs two interviewees noted: “by the time [the adversary is] in our systems, it's already too late” (Participant 18, 2019), and “if I were thinking about the current threats, I would be sleepless” (Participant 14, 2019). Relying heavily on private corporations and, crucially, their civilian employees to defend CI in war prompts a required reassessment and renegotiation regarding the role of the military (as the warfighting machine) in the digital age. Perhaps before states begin forcibly requiring civilian employees of private corporations to provide cyber-defense of CI in/as part of war, the military (alongside relevant public and private bodies) should be better equipped to help protect.",
    "## Conclusion NATO has long recognized cyberspace as a domain of war alongside air, land, and sea. Whilst the threat of cyberattacks has been widely debated, political and military leaders have consistently warned that adversaries will target CI with cyberattacks to initiate and prosecute conflict. Despite these concerns, there has been limited attention afforded to how Civil--Military Relations theory makes sense of cyberspace, and almost no empirical inquiry into how militaries understand their role in cyber-defense.": "To fill this gap in defense studies literature, we conducted extensive, original elite interviews with military members across 12 NATO countries. Our data provided empirical evidence to confirm the theoretical opacity in cyber-CMR. It remains unclear at which point the military might be asked to get involved in the cyber-defense of CI, and it seems that they would not be capable to help, even in war. Militaries play a role in gathering and sharing intelligence, defending forward, and reacting (via cyber or kinetic measures) after the fact. But they do not play a role in actively defending civilian CI as they would in other domains of war (Participant 12, 2019). According to our interviewees, this is because the military could not act (effectiveness narrative), should not act (environment narrative), and is not permitted to act (authorization narrative). Instead, the interviewees pointed to the fact that private owners and operators of CI play a central role in war.\nGiven this dynamic, the article then explores concerns around allocation of financial resources, “dual-use” infrastructures, and “having faith” in the private sector to “do the right thing.” The final part of the paper then controversially asks whether the military ought to be more involved. This section unpacked the serious legal, normative, and practical considerations with the private sector -- specifically, their civilian employees -- being on the front line of cyber-defense in war. To what extent should civilian employees be expected to act qua the military to defend against a cyberattack triggering or occurring in war? Are engineers in private corporations aware that they could become a direct participant in hostilities under IHL (and thereby forfeit their protection status as civilians)? What are the consequences of civilians abandoning their post or refusing to partake in defensive war? May they -- should they -- be court-martialed?\nBy raising these questions, this article galvanizes future research into determining if and how the military should be more involved or whether and when civilians should be conscripted into cyberwars. Additional investigations should involve interviewing the private owners and operators of CI to ascertain i) their views on the military's role in defending their CI, and ii) how they understand their own role in cyber-defense in 21st century wars. Future research may also seek to determine whether greater military involvement into cyber-defense of CI could act as a deterrent against potential adversaries, contributing to a burgeoning literature debating the applicability of deterrence strategy in cyberspace (see Borghard and Lonergan 2023; Lilli 2021; Schneider 2019). Finally, further research could conduct a cross-cultural comparison to highlight differences among NATO states and examine how competitor states, such as Russia and China, guarantee their cyber-defense of CI in war. This is especially pertinent, as the CMR separation in such autocracies is less stark.\nIn conclusion, as one NATO senior military officer noted: How states provide for the defense of CI from cyberattacks that trigger and feature in war is “fundamentally a societal choice” (Participant 13, 2019). For now, the officer continued, “we are hoping and praying the private companies have their defenses in order” (Participant 13, 2019)."

    "## Notes\n1. Participant 18.\n2. NATO does not provide a single universal definition of cyberspace. Based on its strategic documents, we can deduce, like Stevens and Burton (2023), that cyberspace is generally understood as “the global domain of interconnected information technology infrastructures.” This includes Internet and telecommunications networks, computer systems and networks, and data stored and transmitted through these systems.\n3. The current definition of CI in the U.S. includes 16 sectors: chemical, commercial, communications (regarded as especially critical due to its “enabling function” across all other CI), critical manufacturing, dams, defence industrial base, emergency services, energy,\nfinancial, food and agriculture, government facilities, healthcare, information technology (hardware, software, and the Internet), nuclear, transportation systems, water and waste. Other NATO members share similar definitions. See European Commission (2024); NPSA (n.d.); Public Safety Canada (n.d.).Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies (SCEPVA) refers to “the voluntary provision of cyber capabilities and effects by member nations to support collective defense and operational missions” (NATO n.d.).Eight other interviewees made the same comment.Some argue that the decentralised nature of cyberspace undermines the power of states and their control over physical territories; others suggest that cyberspace expands the extra-territorial capacities of states to promote their interests. See Deibert and Pauly (2019); Ministère des Armées (2019).Privacy falls beyond the scope of our investigation.It is important to note that there is opacity surrounding the intersection of international cyber norms and international law. See Hataaja (2022).We are grateful to one of the reviewers for pointing this out.\n## Acknowledgments\nWe are grateful to the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Tallinn, where we conducted this research, and the interviewees who participated in this study.

NATO member states have recognized cyberspace as a new domain of war – one through which adversaries will target CI to both commence and prosecute conflict. Given this: How do NATO member state militaries understand their part in protecting civilian CI from cyberattacks that constitute casus belli? Drawing on original, empirical evidence – 31 interviews and 1 focus group with senior military, defense, and intelligence cyber experts from 12 NATO states – this article argues that militaries regard themselves as unable, unauthorized, and ill-suited to protect CI from cyberattacks that initiate or occur in war. Instead, NATO member states overwhelmingly rely on private corporations (notably their civilian employees) for the protection of CI – including in violent conflict. This article provides original, empirical evidence to confirm the claim that the theory of Civil-Military Relations (CMR) falters when applied to cyberspace. It also asks cutting normative questions attendant with private corporations being on the front line of cyber-defense during war and argues that cyberspace obfuscates the boundaries of modern-day conflicts. This forces a re-examination of the military's role in 21st century wars.\n# ARTICLE HISTORY Received 11 May 2024 Accepted 13 January 2025 # KEYWORDS Cyber; Civil-Military Relations; NATO; militaries; critical infrastructure # Introduction Within liberal democratic states, war is premised on the strict delineation between the military and civilian domains. However, cyberattacks against privately owned and operated civilian critical infrastructure (CI) are challenging this traditional distinction. Understanding the protection of CI from cyberattacks that constitute casus belli within NATO states is especially pressing, as the livelihoods of 1 billion people across 31 countries are at stake. In 2014, NATO formally acknowledged that cyberattacks could be considered an armed attack and thus could trigger Article 5 (Collective Defense) of the NATO Charter. Since 2016, the Alliance has recognized cyberspace as a domain of military operations in which it\"must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea\".

Marxe School of Public and International Affairs, Baruch College, City University of New York (CUNY), 135 East 22nd St, New York, NY 10010, USA © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group affirmed in 2021 that smaller cyberattacks could -- cumulatively -- amount to an armed attack. More recently, the U.S. 2023 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy (U.S. DoD 2023, 7) notes: “U.S. adversaries regularly use malicious cyber activity to target our critical infrastructure. In crisis, they will seek to hinder U.S. military mobilization, sow chaos, and harm the American people.” This is because CI are the very “systems upon which modern society, economy, and polity are seen to depend” (CISA n.d.) and so the disruption or destruction of which would have severe consequences for national security. Indeed, as Haataja (2022, 425) notes, there is a pervasive “recognition of the potentially devastating impact that cyber operations on CI can have.”\nWhilst there has been significant development in mandatory regulation for private corporations regarding cyber-defense, the role of militaries in protecting civilian CI from cyberattacks that can trigger or occur in war has received very little empirical attention. This absence is curious, especially as the military is the traditional state organ tasked with defending the nation against external threats arising to the level of an armed attack.\nSuch a lacuna might be explained by the fact that the prevailing theoretical approach to the role of the military -- Civil--Military Relations (CMR) -- struggles to coherently account for cyberspace as a new “domain” of conflict. Cyberspace raises questions pertaining to the role of the military in 21st century conflicts, creating tensions between prevailing CMR assumptions and the new ways in which wars are fought. This is because “cyberspace pushes questions of traditional boundaries of sovereignty, as well as blurs lines between the civilian and security sector”. State-sponsored adversarial attacks in cyberspace even challenge the very notion of war itself (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022). As a result, there is a theoretical opacity in CMR regarding the military's duties in defending privately owned civilian CI from cyberattacks that both trigger and occur in war.\nGreater scholarly enquiry is therefore required to interrogate this theoretical muddiness inherent in cyber-CMR. Specifically, almost no empirical attention has been afforded to test whether this cyber-CMR tension is reflected in the military's own understanding of its role in cyber-defense of civilian CI. This article aims to fill this gap. It does so by drawing on 31 semi-structured interviews and 1 focus group with cyber experts from 12 NATO states to test this theoretical opacity. How do military cyber experts from NATO member states understand their role in defending critical infrastructure against cyberattacks? We find that -- unlike acts of aggression emanating from land, air, and sea -- NATO military members believe they can not, should not, and are not authorized to defend CI against cyberattacks that could constitute casus belli. Instead, despite recognizing that cyberattacks against CI could trigger or form part of “the next war”, NATO member states rely on private owners and operators for the provision and protection of CI. This finding is crucial, as it challenges preconceived notions of the military taking the lead in defending the state (including from cyberattacks) during war. Departing from the extant literature, the article then critically explores the practical and normative implications of having private corporations on the front line of cyber-defense of CI, and the military taking a backseat during (cyber)war.\nThe paper begins with an overview of the prevailing theoretical framework for understanding the role of the military in conflict -- CMR. This is crucial to make sense of how militaries understand their role in defending the nation in/through cyberspace. After a review of the article's methodology, we present the empirical data obtained from the interviews. This is followed by a discussion of the findings, highlighting the problematic logic of the current dynamic, and a normative and practical consideration of whether the military ought to be more involved in cyber-defense of civilian CI. The conclusion summarizes the findings and scopes avenues for future research.\n## (Cyber) Civil--Military Relations CMR elucidates the relationship between the armed forces, the people, and the state's civilian authorities: it stresses civilian control over the military, defines what it means to be a professional soldier in a democratic society, and identifies which items of the national security agenda fall to the military. It is with this latter aspect of CMR with which we are principally concerned because it pertains to the role of the military in cyber operations, and in the protection of critical infrastructure. The consensus in the literature and in practice has been to try to maintain the separation between the military and civilians when it comes to critical infrastructure protection (CIP) (Pačka and Mareš 2021). However, the development of cyberspace challenges the foundational theoretical assumptions of CMR in three ways.\nFirst, cyberspace inherently blurs the traditional division between foreign and domestic theatres, which has authorization complexities for the military operating on home soil. One of the main tenets of CMR is that the military “does not generally operate or deploy domestically”. As a result, the focus of the military (acting on behalf and at the behest of the civilian government) has been on defending against physical, foreign threats. Yet, this view has been somewhat altered since the collapse of the Soviet Union, when the new threat environment drew to the fore a more diverse set of security imperatives. Non-traditional security threats, such as terrorism, civil conflicts, pandemics, and natural disasters, have “compelled a world-wide re-thinking of the roles and missions of armed forces” within the CMR literature (Diamond, and Plattner 1996, x). “[V]irtually everywhere”, Bruneau and Matei (2012, 2) contend, “militaries and other security instruments are taking on new roles and missions”, such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR).\nThe changing character of national security forces militaries to adapt to a wider array of missions and to develop a broader purpose. But the military's focus largely remains on providing security from physical, external threats. In the 21st century, technological transformations altered the character of security and war yet again, forcing scholars to question whether CMR needs to be adjusted to protect states in “non-traditional battlefields,” notably cyberspace and outerspace. The boundaries between domestic and external security threats became increasingly obscured by transnational digital information systems.\nAn important implication of this reality for CMR is a change of the main locus of military operations: “soldiers operating on the home front” might come to be seen as the rule rather than the exception. As put by Burton (2015, 302), cyberattacks “occur over a globally linked network of computer systems and can be launched without warning, in milliseconds, from anywhere on the planet.” Cyberspace, he argues, creates a new challenge for security organizations like NATO, which has “traditionally focused on geographically proximate security threats”. This brought others to argue that soldiers will be securing networks and countering intrusions against critical infrastructure. The nature of transnational cyber threats, therefore, has important implications for the future role of the military, urging states to reconsider whether a physical, territorial distinction -- a separation between domestic and foreign theatres of operations -- is justified (or indeed even possible) in cyberspace.\nSecond, cyberspace challenges CMR's clear distinction between civilian and military domains because the cyberspace environment is inherently different from that of traditional, physical domains of war (land, air, and sea). As such, the traditional CMR boundaries between military and civilian spheres have become increasingly hazy. Pačka and Mareš (2021, 437) note: “In a common national security and defense ecosystem, the roles of players such as an army, police, intelligence agency, and others are set clearly and there is an evident division of labor... cyberspace constantly changes the boundaries.” Cyberspace is “blurring the lines between the traditional expertise of the uniformed military and the roles and responsibilities of civilians” (Beehner, Brooks, and Maurer 2021, 5). This is especially the case because aggressions in cyberspace often target civilian persons or infrastructure.\nAs militaries become more involved in the cyber domain, they will inevitably conduct their operations over “international and domestic computer infrastructure that supports the dense lattice of digital-age civilian life”. As Sharpe, Trichas, and Terrill (2024, 5) note, “recognition of... cyberspace as a critical domain... represents a paradigm shift in military strategy.” Further distorting the distinction between civilian and military spheres is the fact that technological infrastructure is often dual-use and that militaries rely increasingly on civilian networks for their own operations. Consensus amongst CMR scholars seems to be that the uniqueness of the cyber domain requires “unorthodox” and innovative approaches to the organization of security and defense, challenging, in the words of Brooks (2016, 359), existing “walls” between civilians and the military. As summarized by Chayes (2015, 187): “Civil and military roles are not easily sorted out in the area of cyberattacks and cyber warfare.”\nThird, cyberspace forces a revision not only of what it means to fight wars and of who is involved in warfighting but of the delineation between war and peace itself (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022; Sewall 2021). Constant contact and interconnectedness are key features of cyberspace, favoring initiative and pre-emption over passivity and reactive defense, meaning that states are incentivized to persistently exploit adversary vulnerabilities in order to gain and maintain the advantage (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022). This challenges the dominant Western understanding of war, premised on “use of force” and “armed attack” as the crossing of what is usually considered to be the boundary between war and peace. Unlike with conventional warfare, there is seemingly no strict division between war and peace in cyberspace. States are in a constant state of competition. NATO holds the view that “cyberspace is contested at all times”. Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett (2022, 123) argue that this requires a paradigm shift in policy and strategy planning, one that would focus on an “increased tempo” of cyber military operations outside their own network, and continuous preparation and execution of cyber campaigns.\nAs the complexities of cyberspace are challenging the long-held clear division between war and peace, by extension, the clear separation between civilian and military spheres is also contested. Is there a need for “an increased tempo” of cyber military operations not only outside the defense's network but outside the unique context of war? That the military might play a role outside of warfighting is not new to cyberspace, as discussed above, and so it is justified to address the challenge of continuous competition in cyberspace and activities occurring in this space between peace and war.\nThe question that then flows from this is whether it matters at all when a cyberattack against CI reaches the threshold of an armed attack and triggers Article 5, especially with regards to the roles and responsibilities of cyber-defense. Surely, it does matter, because -- traditionally -- if states are at war, different agents become responsible for action (namely, the military). Yet in cyberspace, this does not seem to be the case, with this responsibility being entrusted to private actors even during conflict. Instead, it seems that the dissolution of the war-peace continuum in cyberspace is making it difficult for states to identify the appropriate response to cyberattacks against the nation's CI, both during the crisis phase, before Article 5 is invoked, and during war. It is with these kinds of cyberattacks, that could constitute casus belli or occur in war, that this article is concerned.\nOwing to these complexities, it is unclear “whether civil-military relations are sufficiently calibrated to protect... in these non-traditional battlefields” where “warfare encompass[es]... less-understood cyber-tools” (Beehner, Brooks, and Maurer 2021, 3). The foundational assumptions built into CMR paradigmatically accept that the military's role is in defending against physical, external threats, focused within war time and is wedded to the distinction between civilian and military responsibilities. But, as others have noted, cyberspace generates theoretical tensions regarding the applicability of these three a priori accepted precepts.\n## Research design and methodology: NATO case study If cyberattacks on CI will inevitably feature in 21st century conflicts, then it is urgent to understand if and how the military, as the institution responsible for warfighting and defense on behalf of the state, understands its role. In other words, it is of paramount importance to test whether existing theoretical tensions are reflected empirically -- by going straight to the source. The justification for casing our study to NATO is because the alliance represents a significant proportion of the global population and serves as a key exemplar of dominant Western perspectives.\nWe conducted 31 semi-structured interviews with military and defense cyber subject matter experts (SMEs) from 12 NATO member states, and 1 focus group of 7 military cyber experts. Representatives from Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Estonia, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US) participated in the research. These countries were chosen based on access (at the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Tallinn and at the NATO Headquarters in Brussels) and expertise within the NATO alliance regarding cyber-defense, including states that are technologically advanced and at the forefront of cyber affairs in practice, and others that are not as well positioned. Among NATO states, cyber-defense of CI is a national responsibility and as such, strategies vary across nations but clear similarities can be found. This illustrates that regardless of a state's level of “cyber-awareness,” most NATO members share similar views on the role of the military regarding the cyber-defense of CI. It also illuminates an apparent disconnect between traditional CMR assumptions regarding the role of the military in territorial defense against external threats and current military perceptions across NATO states. It is also important to note that cyber-offense has its own very specific construct -- Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies (SCEPVA) -- which we do not explore in this paper.\nBy “cyber subject matter experts” we mean military members (officers and enlisted) and civilians (policy advisors) working for defense ministries and at the NATO Headquarters, whose principal occupation is with matters of cyberspace -- both offense and defense. The interview participants included senior military officials (including two-star generals) and cyber experts and lawyers from the military and other government departments (including ministries of defense and intelligence agencies) from NATO member states.\nInterviewees were assured that their views would not be taken as representative of NATO or their “home” state, military, or department, and that their identity would be anonymized. Accordingly, quotes have not been assigned to specific roles or states in order to mitigate the risks associated with attribution, particularly those arising from cross-referencing. The goal of conducting these interviews was not to examine differences in cultural approaches across NATO members, although this would be a valuable future study.\nA note on limitations. One limitation pertaining to the approach of this research is that, by focusing on military perspectives only, the research excludes other crucial stakeholders such as private-sector partners and other public agencies like police, local cyber task forces and computer emergency response teams (CERTS). Notably, we do not examine what the private owners and operators of CI (CEOs and/or employees) consider as the appropriate role of the military in cyber-defense. This question, albeit important, requires a separate, substantive future investigation -- one that, due to space constraints, we could not explore here. Instead, our interest lies with understanding the military's role in defending the nation against cyberattacks, a question that is best answered by those working in defense who are across the current military cyber posture. That said, the participants also included representatives from intelligence agencies, who work closely with their military counterparts and who have important responsibilities in both cyber-offense and cyber-defense in many countries. These interviewees were well placed to differentiate the role of the military and that of intelligence agencies in responding to a cyber event, confirming some issues raised by defense interviewees in terms of cyber-CMR.\n## NATO militaries' perceptions of cyber-defense of CI In the words of the interviewees, the purpose of the military is to “serve, protect, and defend” the state and the population against foreign aggression. However, when asked how the military discharges this responsibility to protect citizens from adversarial cyberattacks on CI either triggering or happening in war, all of the interviewees stated that the military was ill-suited or ill-prepared to intervene, even in the case where it might be asked to do so. We also found that, despite cyberspace being recognized as a domain of military operations, military members' understanding of their role reflects the complexities of the cyber war-peace continuum. Three recurring narratives emerged from the interviewees when describing the limits of their role. Each chime with the three tensions articulated in cyber-CMR above: the uniqueness of the domain, the blurring of foreign/domestic theaters, and what this means for understanding war. To begin, however, we survey how militaries presently engage in cyber-defense of CI.\n### Defending forward, persistent engagement, and integrated deterrence NATO member militaries are engaged in collecting, analyzing, and exchanging intelligence with other government agencies, the private sector, and NATO allies (U.S. DoD 2023). Information collection and sharing is considered an integral aspect of cyber-defense. When private corporations identify a threat in their system and pass that information along to government agencies, such public agencies then make recommendations regarding how the private companies ought to rectify the vulnerability and voluntarily assist in that process (which, in many instances, can be declined by the corporation). Yet, importantly (for reasons we explore below), according to one of our interviewees: “the government won't go into anyone's systems: they have a coordination role, but otherwise it's hands off the keyboard” (Participant 18, 2019).\nMoreover, NATO state militaries are authorized (and indeed required) to take proactive measures to ensure the cybersecurity of their own military systems -- principally to ensure continued operability across the traditional, physical domains of armed conflict. The desire to enhance the cyber resilience of the Alliance was reiterated at the 2023 Vilnius Summit. As a senior military officer explained, however, “the primary concern of the military is to ensure our cyber systems are working so we can do kinetic defense: the military has a monopoly on kinetic defense, not cyber” (Participant 12, 2019).\nA few of the interviewees stated that the military is engaged in what has long been understood as “active defense:” “defensive operations that involve direct engagement with sophisticated adversaries in DoD-controlled cyberspace”. The U.S. in particular has employed the notion of “defending forward” which aims to pre-emptively “stop threats before they reach their targets” (U.S. Department of Defense 2018, 2) and which was developed in response to criticisms that the military was not proactively defending critical infrastructure against cyberattacks (Former US Cyber Command official, personal communication with author, 2020). “Defending forward,” “active defense,” and “persistent engagement” were born out of the recognition that the U.S. could not expect private corporations to defend themselves against the full power of an adversarial state. Both approaches form part of what the U.S. now regards as “integrated deterrence,” developed in the most recent DoD Cyber Strategy (2023, 2), which focuses on using military cyber capabilities “in concert with other instruments of national power.”\nFurther still, the military would likely be the apparatus called upon by the state in the “response” phase of a devastating cyberattack (Participants 8, 14, 16, 22). The military would be responsible for launching a cyber or kinetic counter-offensive, following appropriate attribution processes (proportionality, necessity, and distinction factors considered). But such responses are necessarily ex post facto. As was expressed in the focus group (2019): “Reacting after the fact is a losing strategy.” Until then, the front line of defense -- with public sector support, especially intelligence agencies -- is the private corporations.\n### The effectiveness narrative: can not Previously, it has been thought that -- in the context of NATO and specifically the U.S. -- the resources and expertise on cyber-defense and cyberwar was retained by the military. Our empirical evidence finds the opposite to be the case. Most of the interviewees argued that their respective militaries currently lack the necessary resources, human-power, and relevant expertise required to effectively defend CI from cyberattacks. As a result, the interviewees consistently highlighted that, due to the nature of the domain, the military is unable to protect civilian CI from cyberattacks -- even those that can trigger or occur in war. One interviewee compared this lack of cyber capability with traditional, kinetic attacks: “The military is the only institution or organization to defend against armed attacks, because they're the only ones who have fighter planes. But in a cyberattack, Cyber Command won't be first [to respond], because they don't have the capability” (Participant 19, 2019). Another senior military officer (Participant 3, 2019) reflected that attention ought to be focused on pragmatically determining which organization is likely to be most successful in providing cyber-defense: “It's about having the right tools, and the right knowledge... the military might not be best placed to defend certain infrastructure.” For instance, interviewees rightly pointed out that in many countries intelligence agencies play a significant role in the cyber-defense of the nation and its critical infrastructure, notably by advising and assisting other government agencies and the private sector (see for instance GCHQ n.d.; Government of Canada n.d.).\nA few interviewees also noted that because the private corporations that own and operate CI use different and often “tailor-made” platforms, it would be almost impossible for cyber experts in the military to be sufficiently knowledgeable to defend across all the different systems. It is “unimaginable” for the military to help, one interviewee reflected, “because they are completely unfamiliar with the systems” (Participant 9, 2019).\nSome of the interviewees argued that it would be financially ineffective or even prohibitively expensive to have the military provide cyber-defense for CI: it is “better to let the private sector deal with it,” because having the government provide the cyber-defense for critical infrastructure would be “implausible and expensive” (Participant 12, 2019). “Private corporations should be responsible,” one interviewee stated, “otherwise there would be a lot of taxpayers' money required to provide [protection for] those systems -- like a ‘cybersecurity tax' for providing cyber-defense of critical infrastructure” (Participant 9, 2019). The interviewees' perception echoes the sentiment highlighted in the literature on critical infrastructure protection that private owners are best placed to establish cyber-defenses.\nThe environment narrative: should not When discussing why the military does not play a greater role in protecting CI from cyberattacks -- as they would if the “armed attack” was emanating from other domains of war -- the interviewees stated that this is because “cyberspace is fundamentally different” (Participant 15, 2019). The participants overwhelmingly referred to cyberspace's ubiquitous, borderless, fluid, and invisible nature. The interviewees emphasized the relatively abstract characteristics of cyberspace identified in the literature as affecting the military's ability to help defend. One government official simply stated: “cyber is a different domain; we haven't figured out how it works” (Participant 22, 2019). Another interviewee reflected: “In cyber, the fog of war is heightened” (Participant 11, 2019). Interviewees also referred to the difficulty of determining whether sovereignty is applicable to cyberspace and where borders might begin and end, thereby touching on the ongoing debate between NATO member states about whether sovereignty is applicable to cyberspace.\nIn most instances, the interviewees' reference to sovereignty was intended to highlight that, unlike in sea, air, and land -- which have clear, physical borders that can be transgressed -- cyberspace has no such border. The interviewees often highlighted the difficulty of defending against cyberattacks by comparing cyberspace with the physical domains of warfighting: “You can see equipment like frigates and airplanes,” one interviewee noted, “but you can't see firewalls or malicious code” (Focus group 2019).\nA majority of interviewees also argued that the military does not have a significant role in defending CI from cyberattacks that could trigger war or happen in war because -- again, in contrast to the physical domain -- it is an “unchartered territory” and so “the line between government and private” is “blurred” (Participants 16, 18 and 26, 2019). A few interviewees drew parallels with the other services, claiming that “we've had an army, navy, and air force for a long time, but cyberspace is new” (Participant 13, 2019). These comments are reminiscent of the remarks made by Lt. Col. Kurt Sanger, Chief Judge Advocate for National Security Law at U.S. Cyber Command at the 2019 CyCon U.S: “For most of the domains, you have thousands of years and millions of warriors contributing to the lessons that you're now learning... We don't have that in cyberspace”. In short, cyberspace itself was thought by the interviewees as an inherently exposed space, with points of vulnerabilities too vast to comprehend. As one officer put it, “cyberspace is un-defendable” (Participant 12, 2019). These responses align with what Cate (2015, 307) identifies as the prevailing “sense of despair about the size and complexity of the challenge.”\nOur empirical evidence highlights that the military believes it should not play a significant role in defending CI. In doing so, it thereby supports the extant theoretical claim that cyberspace distorts the lines between the domestic vs. foreign spheres and forces an alteration of traditional territorial and sovereign conceptions of defense. This further illustrates the dissolution of the traditional division between civilian and military sectors in CMR due to the unprecedented nature of the domain.\nThe authorization narrative: not permitted The last narrative that emerged from the interviewees' responses is that of “authorization.” A third of the interviewees noted that the military is not permitted to operate on domestic soil. Typically, within NATO states, the military is not automatically authorized to conduct what are considered police enforcement duties: for instance, the U.S. Posse Comitatus Act, signed in 1878, is designed to prohibit the deployment of the military to enforce domestic civilian policies and practices “unless expressly authorized by the Constitution or an act of Congress” (Congressional Research Service 2018). It seems that this is what most of the interviewees were referring to when raising concerns regarding “authorization.” Many participants explained that this is a “design reality” of the democratic system, which means that states are constrained and restrained by their legal environment (Participants 1, 2 and 13, 2019). As one interviewee articulated, “the legislation is not adjusted for the realities of cyberspace” (Participant 7, 2019), while another reflected, “if we want to live in a liberal, democratic society, this is what we get” (Participant 17, 2019).\nSome interviewees highlighted that the military would be called upon, by the state, to operate in the territory of that sovereign state in the instance that there is an actual use of physical force against the state. As one interviewee explained: “Obviously if our ‘friends' in the East rolled tanks across the border right now, our forces would be authorized to act in the state to repel that assault. It wouldn't be the police's job” (Participant 15, 2019).\nAdditionally, a few interviewees raised concerns regarding privacy as a barrier to greater military involvement. One military officer noted that: “[People] are OK that we have ships, border patrol, flight deterrence... But with cyber, people don't want the government to look into their Internet connectivity” (Participant 18, 2019). Overall, the interviewees consistently stated that the military would be called upon to protect the sovereign state from a land invasion, naval assault, or airborne missile strike against CI -- but this would not be the case regarding a comparable assault emanating from cyberspace.\nThe three narratives empirically confirm the tension highlighted in the literature on cyber-CMR. It further resonates with the 2023 U.S. Cyber Strategy that the Department of Defense “lacks the authority to employ military forces to defend private companies against cyberattacks” and that there are “limited circumstances in which military cyber forces would be asked to defend civilian critical infrastructure -- the Department will not posture itself to defend every private sector network” (U.S. DoD 2023, 13). In short, NATO member militaries do not believe they play a major role in cyber-defense of CI that initiates or occurs amidst war due to environment, effectiveness, and authorization complexities. As one interviewee noted: “There is a contradiction between the fear of cyberattacks, [and the fact that] we [the people]... don't want the military to play a bigger role” (Participant 18, 2019).\n## Critical discussion of the military perspective There are three key findings that arise from the empirical evidence. First: the military members affirm the perception of the blurred nature of cyber-CMR described above. Second: the minimal military involvement raises urgent questions regarding CI that will be targeted in war. Third: while regulations have improved in the past few years, it is the private corporations that are principally responsible for protecting CI from sophisticated state-sponsored cyberattacks during war. These findings invite a re-examination of the role of the military in 21st century conflicts.\n### A reflection of political will and political choices One of the explanations invoked by the interviewees for why the military is not more involved in the cyber-defense of CI is because the military currently lacks the financial and human resources to do so (the effectiveness narrative). Some might claim that it is unreasonable to reassign some military funding for cyber-defense of CI in the face of “defense austerity” -- although in the U.S. this notion is debatable, as the proposed 2024 budget for the entire DoD totaled $842 billion (Congressional Budget Office 2023). One interviewee argued that this objection is misplaced, as taking proactive security measures prior to an “inevitable cyberattack against critical infrastructure” is a more fiscally responsible decision from the outset (Participant 4, 2019).\nFunds already allocated to the acquisition of traditional kinetic weapons could (again, hypothetically) be redirected toward: the military's development of defensive cyber technologies for CI, the recruitment of more military cyber personnel, and the expansion and implementation of CIP military training programs. Other interviewees instead reiterated an absence of political will for states to invest highly in something as intangible as cybersecurity: “Guns and tanks and fighter jets are sexier. They're sexier and easier for politicians to show off for their next election campaign, that they're doing something for national security... [They're] not really able to show off lines of code” (Focus group, 2019).\nAside from the fiscal element is the ostensible “novelty” and “unknowable-ness” of cyberspace as to why they “should not” be involved in defense of CI (the environment narrative). Confusion surrounding cyberspace's distinct character is something that is debated in the literature. Nonetheless, there is a risk of “succumbing to the shock of the new”. Erroneously perceiving the form of a domain as inherently enigmatic stymies progress toward establishing effective defense systems. Considering other “newer” domains of war, one interviewee compared cyberspace to the air force: no “historical accident... the air force was born out of the need for defense from attacks in airspace in the 20th century” (Participant 28, 2019). It is a political choice to allocate the main face of defense in war to private corporations.\nMoreover, whilst the military is prima facie prohibited from operating on domestic soil, the authorization narrative should be interrogated further. Indeed, the military could -- and would -- be called upon by the state to operate in its sovereign territory if there is an actual use of physical force tantamount to an armed attack. In the face of cyberattacks that do reach the level of an armed attack and that could trigger NATO's Article 5, conceivably, the military would be authorized to get involved in the cyber-defense of civilian CI systems. Theoretically at least, cyber aggressions comparable to armed attacks do not pose a significantly new challenge for civil--military relations. Nonetheless, the research finds that even with this kind of attack that could constitute casus belli, or occur during war, uncertainty remains within the military regarding the extent to which they would be authorized (or able) to get involved in the cyber-defense of private networks. Even when faced with cyberattacks that would amount to an armed attack, or during war, the military would not be able to effectively help defend CI. The militaries' current (and limited) ability and expectation to provide cyber-defense of CI is a political calculation. One defense personnel reflected: “I feel that there is a growing need for more cyber units in the military, and since cyber has now been recognized as a proper domain of armed conflict on par with air, land, sea and in some cases also space, I think it will happen... It is just a question of how it will evolve, and through which means. (Participant 16, 2019)” Nevertheless, according to the interviewees, this is likely only after some “catastrophic” cyberattack on CI (Participants 8 and 29, 2019). The current decision to rely heavily on private corporations, albeit with mandatory reporting and compliance mechanisms, is a political choice.\n### Concerns surrounding “dual-use” infrastructures A further implication of minimal military involvement is how to deal with “dual-use” CI. Civilian CI has been and will continue to be targeted by adversarial actors as part of war. One interviewee stated: “There is no such thing as a ‘military' cyberattack; 90% of the time it will be against civilian infrastructure” (Participant 22, 2019). According to another: “Adversaries will -- and already do -- attack critical infrastructure as a primary target via cyberspace, because it's what we would do” (Participant 7, 2019). States will likely seek to disable CI in war in order to gain a military advantage.\nAs per international cyber norms regarding responsible state behavior, there is a prohibition of “cyber operations that cause intentional damage or impairment to critical infrastructure (CI)”. CI should be -- in the words of then U.S. President Joe Biden -- “‘off limits' to attack” (cited in Haataja 2022, 425). Of course, only military objects and combatants are liable to be lawfully targeted in war; according to the International Humanitarian Law (IHL) principle of distinction, intentionally targeting civilians and civilian CI (including via cyber) is prohibited. Nevertheless, the urgency of preparing the military to contribute to the defense of CI is even more apparent given the potential for civilian CI to be rendered a liable military objective. This is because civilian CI can: i) become co-opted for military purposes, ii) have a “military utility,” or iii) be “dual-use”.\nThere are three concerns raised here. First, if (privately owned) CI networks become “dual-use” or are of “military utility,” they become military objectives and thus may be lawfully targeted. As Horowitz (2024, 327) notes: a “privately owned civilian aviation air traffic control tower that the enemy military temporarily uses to enable offensive operations” might be rendered a military objective “because of its ‘use.'” Moreover, according to the Tallinn Manual 2.0: if critical infrastructure is being used by both civilian and military ends, and it is “impossible” to differentiate between the civilian and military parts of a system, “the entire network... qualifies as a military objective”.\nSecond, because of the invisible nature of cyberspace, it is additionally challenging to differentiate between civilian vs. military cyber infrastructures. As such, there is foreseeably a large scope for misinterpretation and accidental military targeting of CI. Third, it is unclear whether preparatory acts on “dual-use” infrastructures during peacetime -- such as the insertion of dormant malware -- constitutes an attack or strictly cyber-espionage. Haataja (2022, 424, 428) highlights that there is a danger for pre-positioned adversarial code in CI that could be activated later, a practice known as “persistent presence” in CI. Simply planting malware or creating “backdoors” certainly violates international cyber norms and could be considered a breach of a state's obligation under international law (others consider such cyber norms “voluntary, non-binding”). But such cyber-operations themselves are unlikely to rise to the level of an armed attack. Activating a dormant malware in a privately owned CI, such as a nuclear powerplant, causing it to explode, would foreseeably reach that threshold. All of this points to the complexity of defending CI from cyberattacks that constitute casus belli or may be pursued in war.\n### A degree of (risky) faith in the private sector Private corporations that own and operate CI ought to provide appropriate cyber-defensive measures -- especially to protect what one interviewee called “low-hanging fruits” (Participant 3, 2019). Nonetheless, as one interviewee noted: “We can't expect private companies to protect themselves against state-sponsored attacks” (Participant 23, 2019). Many interviewees expressed having “faith” in private corporations adhering to proper standards and regulations: “We hope they [the private corporations] do the right thing” (Participant 8, 2019).\nUsing the physical domain as an analogy, the private owners of a power grid would be expected to employ a reasonable degree of security -- locking doors, installing surveillance cameras, erecting wire fences, and employing security guards, and so on. However, the security guard would not be expected to defend against an attack that rises to a use of force tantamount with war. Defense from in-coming ballistic missiles would fall to the state and -- foreseeably -- the air force: “In the physical world, we don't require companies to have an air force, or submarines, or to really look at the pointy end of an attack”.\nYet whilst companies have oversight, assistance, and mandatory regulations from government, the front line of defense in cyberspace remains the purview of companies. It is often in their profit margins interests to ensure their cyber-defenses are in order, and to work closely and collaboratively with government agencies to redress vulnerabilities or incursions. Beyond purely monetary interests, corporations could be appealed to do so on the notion of “loyalty”. They may be incentivized to effectively participate in the provision of cyber-defense based on “a moral commitment to ‘solidarity' and ‘community responsibility'”. One senior government official iterated this patriotic duty to “protect our lifestyle” (Participant 22, 2019). For instance, when asked about who is defending Ukrainian CI from Russian cyberattacks, one retired general responded: “The private corporations in Ukraine are doing an excellent job” (General [retd.], personal communication with author, 2022). Similarly, Matania and Sommer (2023, 3) note that “Tech Titans” (Google, Microsoft, Meta, Apple, SpaceX and Amazon) are playing a meaningful role in the armed conflict in Ukraine.\nThat said, as one interviewee reflected: “appealing towards companies' patriotism... is probably not the safest way to do things” (Participant 13, 2019). Even if a private corporation is “homegrown,” it does not guarantee that they are, in fact, patriotic. “Company Over Country” was Meta CEO and Founder Mark Zuckerberg's early motto. Similarly, the whistle blower Haugen (2021, 2) iterated that -- when torn between “its own profits and [the U.S.'] safety,” Meta “consistently... favor[ed] its own profits.” This demonstrates that American-owned corporations have prioritized financial gains over that of the security of the American people. Such a dynamic becomes even more problematic if CI corporations in NATO member states are outsourced and owned by foreign corporations.\nPerhaps “profits before patriotism” is strictly a feature of peacetime: once it comes to war, the dynamic will flip. For instance, by May 2022 Google had pledged approximately $55 million in support of Ukraine's resistance of Russian aggression. Similarly, within days of the full-scale invasion, Microsoft moved Ukraine's critical government data to its cloud storage platform. This was because most of the data was “extremely vulnerable to missile attacks, and their physical destruction could paralyze the entire work of the country's top leadership”.\nYet the view that corporations would be driven by patriotism (or, more accurately, defense of liberal values) over profit hinges on two, risky assumptions. In the first instance, it takes for granted that the CI private corporation heralds from, or is ideologically aligned with, the country under (cyber)attack -- which is not necessarily always the case. It supposes the private corporation may not be under pressure from the attacking-state or wishes to remain neutral, or had been convinced to allow the attack to take place (due to corruption, coercion, or ideological leanings). There is no guarantee for support. There is no expectation for patriotism even from corporations that are (for lack of a better word) “home grown.”\nIn the second instance, it is also not clear how long “patriotic” support or commitment to democratic liberal ideals -- even if it is forthcoming -- might last. While Elon Musk's SpaceX initially sent Starlink satellites to the Ukrainian military for free, it eventually stated it could no longer foot the bill, and the Pentagon had to pick up the tab -- once the reliance on Musk's service had been firmly established (conceivably with an agenda to accrue profits). Moreover, demonstrating the selectivity of private sector support, when the Ukrainian military conducted an offensive into the Russian-held Crimea, they begged Elon Musk to turn on its satellite service in the Russian-controlled area, but he refused to do so because (according to his post on X) he feared SpaceX's complicity in “a major act of war and conflict escalation”. Betting on private corporations' patriotism and political alliances or appetite for war, over that of their foundational and raison d'être interests in profit, is to gamble with national (cyber) defense. If there is a profit to be made, corporations might choose to get involved in conflicts (even distant ones), but they might stop to be involved when it is no longer financially advisable.\nOur empirical data suggests that -- unlike kinetic acts of war emanating in land, air, and sea -- the military is not responsible for defending against state-sponsored acts of aggression against CI via cyberspace. However, trusting private corporations to adequately defend against cyberattacks in war is a risky security strategy.\n## Should militaries be more involved? Normative and practical considerations As detailed in the previous section, multiple interviewees remarked on the risks associated with dual-use infrastructure and with being overly reliant on private corporations to provide cyber-defense of CI. Relatedly, some participants expressed concerns about not being readied and resourced to defend CI against cyberattacks. This prompts the question: might there be a case for increasing military involvement in cyber-defense of CI? After all, the military is the principal body responsible for defending civilians (on behalf of the state) from acts of aggression rising to war. Former NATO Deputy Secretary General Rose Gottemoeller et al. (2022) expressed the need for NATO Allies to be better prepared in response to cyberattacks. This requirement is especially pertinent, as Burton (2015, 302) remarks, “cyber operations are increasingly part of [conflicts involving NATO forces] and an element of the strategy of NATO's main state adversaries.” To be clear, we are not in any way suggesting a “military-takes-all,” zero-sum approach to defending CI from cyberattacks that trigger Article 5. The normative question is whether militaries should be readied -- as a last line of defense -- to help protect alongside private corporations and public bodies (such as intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and federal and local cyber task forces).\nOne objection to greater military involvement is the potential for escalation. A cyber-defensive operation led by the military could be perceived by an adversary as a cyber countermeasure, resulting in a “tit-for-tat escalation of cyberattacks and responses, each one more serious than the last”. An increased role of the military in providing cyber-defense of CI may therefore lead to “a permissive normative-legal environment in which states are more likely than before to resort to uses of force”.\nA related normative concern is that the increased role of the military in cyber-defense of CI begets the militarization of cyberspace. The perception of the military being involved in a civilian network, even for strictly defensive purposes, may render it a military target. But simply because the military may be called upon, as a last resort, to aid in the cyber-defense of CI does not render the civilian objective ipso facto a military target. In the same way that the military might be called upon to help defend a hospital (for instance) from kinetic attacks, the military presence does not automatically render the hospital a liable military objective.\nAnother further objection might be that introducing the military as an agent of cyber-defense of CI risks increasing the potential for abuse -- notably, through mass militarized surveillance or the military placing pressure on private corporations to act in certain ways. Relatedly, there may be normative concerns regarding competing authorities -- an unnecessary duplication of responsibilities and confusion over which entity precisely (the private organization vs. intelligence agency vs. the military) acts in what contexts. Within the extant literature, Public--Private Partnerships in CI protection are already regarded as notoriously fraught with complications pertaining to cooperation, information sharing, and trust. For instance, one interviewee noted that -- on the issue of information sharing of breaches -- “private companies won't ‘sho their hand'... they would rather sell the intelligence than give it away for free” (Participant 9, 2019). Surely adding another agent into the mix will make cyber-defense more complex.\nA reply to these two objections is that the military should only get involved when: i) the private entity is unable or unwilling to respond, ii) that the aid of the existing public agencies is insufficient, or iii) that the cyberattack would (through its scale and effects) constitute an armed attack. What should be envisaged is a live, cooperative triage system, whereby the military might be deployed only to help defend CI, should the attack foreseeably trigger war or take place in war, or if other responders have failed to address the threat and require additional assistance.\nOne further objection is that increasing military involvement generates a moral hazard for the private sector. Specifically, if the military is offering a pseudo-“security umbrella,” private corporations may be disincentivized to invest in necessary cybersecurity measures and instead increase their risk tolerance (as per prospect theory). Cybersecurity is costly and time-consuming; saving on cybersecurity would likely increase corporations' profits, and energy and resources could be redirected to other parts of business.\nHowever, there are several considerations that would foreseeably mitigate this moral hazard. Corporations risk extreme reputational damage and services by relying too heavily on possible military defense: corporations must still provide adequate levels of cybersecurity that sufficiently defend against the vast majority of cyberattacks, which are criminal or low-level intrusions. Further, corporations would rather deal with cyber-defense issues in house and (as our interviewees noted) are wary about freely “opening the doors” to the military. These are serious objections to increasing military involvement. But it is also pertinent to examine the normative implications if states do not increase military involvement.\nFirst, the existing requirement for private corporations to be on the “front line” of cyber-defense of CI means demanding that civilians be responsible for defending against disastrous acts of (cyber)war. Even if they are not explicitly conscripted (more on this below) it is the civilian employees of those private sectors who nonetheless currently shoulder national cybersecurity duties. “Like the soldiers in the fortress,” Brenner and Clarke (emphasis added, 2010, 1032) reflect, “computer personnel confronting a cyberattack are responsible for defending their ‘territory' from hostile activity.”\nThis blurring of civilian and military spheres -- the expectation of civilians in corporations to not only contribute to but bear the weight of defending the state from cyber-attacks in war -- opens Pandora's box regarding pressing legal, normative, and practical questions. Is the expectation to participate in cyber-defense during war articulated in the employees' contracts? Are these civilian employees permitted to excuse themselves, or conscientiously object to participating in war, or will they be forced to fight, albeit with code over cobalt? Are employees aware of this possibility as part of their day job? If civilian operators on the cyber front-line “abandon their posts” -- literally removing hands from keyboards -- should they be court-martialed?\nWorse still: What if individual civilians, unbeknownst to their corporate managers, sympathize with the aggressor state, or have been compromised by the aggressor (via blackmail, bribery, or disinformation)? This may lead employees to feign cyber-defense and even aid the cyberattacker. Indeed, one of the interviewees worried that “moles are already there in the private sector,” and that such “moles” may be feeding sensitive information to adversaries, or even disrupting the systems on behalf of a foreign state (Participant 15, 2019). After all, these privately employed civilians (unlike military personnel) have not pledged allegiance to their (respective) flags. Even if the corporation leadership is patriotic, how can we be sure of the political allegiances of its civilian employees, especially as many are unlikely to have undergone security checks? If private corporations are “fighting” in war, might such corporations (or their CEOs, like Musk, or individual civilian operators) be tempted to aggressively hack-back?\nFurthermore, at what point does a civilian (both based in and, crucially, outside the country waging war) become a direct participant in hostilities and become a liable target for cyber and kinetic strikes under IHL? Horowitz (2024, 322) remarks that -- following an “expansive interpretation of the temporal element of [direct participation in hostilities (DPH)]” under IHL -- “a tech company employee who engages in DPH,” including strictly cyber-defense, “even if only infrequently during a work week from their office, might lose protection from attack not only while they engage in those specific acts of DPH but also continuously from morning to night and at home for an extended period of time.” Even if a narrow view of the temporal aspect of DPH is adopted -- wherein a civilian may only be targeted “for such time” that she is actively contributing to military activity via cyber-defense -- this dynamic creates a “revolving door” for civilians “who repeatedly engage in DPH”. Civilians forfeit and regain protection status depending on whether their hands are, quite literally in that moment, on the keyboard.\nCivilians who are completely oblivious of their contribution to hostilities retain their protection status. Might that be an argument for not telling private corporation employees about their foreseeable role in defending against cyberattacks in war? This seems ethically dubious, as it raises a host of questions surrounding transparency and individuals' agency. Civilian tech employees also do not forfeit their protection status when acting in “self-defense or in defense of others against violence prohibited against IHL,” such as “looting, rape, and murder by marauding” (emphasis added, Melzer 2009, 61, cited in; Horowitz 2024, 319). But civilian employees would forfeit their protected status (and become liable to targeting) if they are knowingly responding to cyberattacks that are permissible under IHL. Further still, if an individual tech employee is engaged in DPH and commits a violation of IHL that amounts to war crimes, they become liable under international criminal law. To what extent are civilian employees aware of this when they join a private corporation and are expected to fight in (cyber)wars to protect CI?\nSecond, if the military is not responsible for defending privately owned CI from devastating cyberattacks triggering and during war, then this means acknowledging that the military is seemingly responsible for defending the civilian population only in certain ways when it comes to CI (Participant 3, 2019). To be precise, it means the military is responsible for: i) defending CI from attacks emanating from the “physical domain,” ii) thwarting cyberattacks that target their own military or government systems, iii) mounting offensive cyber operations against adversarial CI, and iv) intelligence gathering and (if possible) sharing with companies. Correspondingly, the civilian population must be made aware of, and consent to, the reality that an entire arm of the state will not be readied or resourced to protect against a catastrophic cyberattack against CI amounting to or during war.\nThird, as private corporations are required to shoulder enhanced duties to protect themselves (and the civilians who depend on them), they will be driven to amass more wealth and influence to fulfil the responsibilities demanded of them by states. After all, the flipside of the adage “with great power comes great responsibility” is with great responsibility comes the requirement to obtain the power to fulfil that responsibility. The foreseeable result is that private corporations will become even more powerful, and the public sector even more dependent on private corporations to guarantee national cybersecurity.\nThe worry, then, is that demanding private corporations to act like states means permitting -- indeed, requiring -- private corporations to fulfil the responsibilities of states. But private corporations are not states. CEOs are not democratically elected by the civilian populations they are (ostensibly) charged to protect. Their main pursuit is not protection but profit. There is no requirement for patriotism.\nMaybe these consternations are mute: private corporations could simply be subsumed under government control during war time via nationalization. Yet this dynamic circles back to the issues raised above pertaining to an overreliance on civilian consent or conscription. May individual employees conscientiously object to participating in war? If so, this will leave a lacuna for cyber-defense, as the military has not thus far been readied-and-resourced to respond (according to the interviewees). If not, this means conscripting employees to participate in war -- via cyber -- when they do not wish to; this may spell a cyber-equivalent to the “non-firing phenomenon” (where soldiers fail to shoot or to shoot accurately at the enemy). These questions highlight the further dissolution between civilians and the military in cyberspace.\nAs two interviewees noted: “by the time [the adversary is] in our systems, it's already too late” (Participant 18, 2019), and “if I were thinking about the current threats, I would be sleepless” (Participant 14, 2019). Relying heavily on private corporations and, crucially, their civilian employees to defend CI in war prompts a required reassessment and renegotiation regarding the role of the military (as the warfighting machine) in the digital age. Perhaps before states begin forcibly requiring civilian employees of private corporations to provide cyber-defense of CI in/as part of war, the military (alongside relevant public and private bodies) should be better equipped to help protect.\n## Conclusion NATO has long recognized cyberspace as a domain of war alongside air, land, and sea. Whilst the threat of cyberattacks has been widely debated, political and military leaders have consistently warned that adversaries will target CI with cyberattacks to initiate and prosecute conflict. Despite these concerns, there has been limited attention afforded to how Civil--Military Relations theory makes sense of cyberspace, and almost no empirical inquiry into how militaries understand their role in cyber-defense.\nTo fill this gap in defense studies literature, we conducted extensive, original elite interviews with military members across 12 NATO countries. Our data provided empirical evidence to confirm the theoretical opacity in cyber-CMR. It remains unclear at which point the military might be asked to get involved in the cyber-defense of CI, and it seems that they would not be capable to help, even in war. Militaries play a role in gathering and sharing intelligence, defending forward, and reacting (via cyber or kinetic measures) after the fact. But they do not play a role in actively defending civilian CI as they would in other domains of war (Participant 12, 2019). According to our interviewees, this is because the military could not act (effectiveness narrative), should not act (environment narrative), and is not permitted to act (authorization narrative). Instead, the interviewees pointed to the fact that private owners and operators of CI play a central role in war.\nGiven this dynamic, the article then explores concerns around allocation of financial resources, “dual-use” infrastructures, and “having faith” in the private sector to “do the right thing.” The final part of the paper then controversially asks whether the military ought to be more involved. This section unpacked the serious legal, normative, and practical considerations with the private sector -- specifically, their civilian employees -- being on the front line of cyber-defense in war. To what extent should civilian employees be expected to act qua the military to defend against a cyberattack triggering or occurring in war? Are engineers in private corporations aware that they could become a direct participant in hostilities under IHL (and thereby forfeit their protection status as civilians)? What are the consequences of civilians abandoning their post or refusing to partake in defensive war? May they -- should they -- be court-martialed?\nBy raising these questions, this article galvanizes future research into determining if and how the military should be more involved or whether and when civilians should be conscripted into cyberwars. Additional investigations should involve interviewing the private owners and operators of CI to ascertain i) their views on the military's role in defending their CI, and ii) how they understand their own role in cyber-defense in 21st century wars. Future research may also seek to determine whether greater military involvement into cyber-defense of CI could act as a deterrent against potential adversaries, contributing to a burgeoning literature debating the applicability of deterrence strategy in cyberspace (see Borghard and Lonergan 2023; Lilli 2021; Schneider 2019). Finally, further research could conduct a cross-cultural comparison to highlight differences among NATO states and examine how competitor states, such as Russia and China, guarantee their cyber-defense of CI in war. This is especially pertinent, as the CMR separation in such autocracies is less stark.\nIn conclusion, as one NATO senior military officer noted: How states provide for the defense of CI from cyberattacks that trigger and feature in war is “fundamentally a societal choice” (Participant 13, 2019). For now, the officer continued, “we are hoping and praying the private companies have their defenses in order” (Participant 13, 2019).",

NATO member states have recognized cyberspace as a new domain of war – one through which adversaries will target CI to both commence and prosecute conflict. Given this: How do NATO member state militaries understand their part in protecting civilian CI from cyberattacks that constitute casus belli? Drawing on original, empirical evidence – 31 interviews and 1 focus group with senior military, defense, and intelligence cyber experts from 12 NATO states – this article argues that militaries regard themselves as unable, unauthorized, and ill-suited to protect CI from cyberattacks that initiate or occur in war. Instead, NATO member states overwhelmingly rely on private corporations (notably their civilian employees) for the protection of CI – including in violent conflict. This article provides original, empirical evidence to confirm the claim that the theory of Civil-Military Relations (CMR) falters when applied to cyberspace. It also asks cutting normative questions attendant with private corporations being on the front line of cyber-defense during war and argues that cyberspace obfuscates the boundaries of modern-day conflicts. This forces a re-examination of the military's role in 21st century wars.\n# ARTICLE HISTORY\nReceived 11 May 2024\nAccepted 13 January 2025\n# KEYWORDS\nCyber; Civil-Military Relations; NATO; militaries; critical infrastructure\n# Introduction\nWithin liberal democratic states, war is premised on the strict delineation between the military and civilian domains. However, cyberattacks against privately owned and operated civilian critical infrastructure (CI) are challenging this traditional distinction. Understanding the protection of CI from cyberattacks that constitute casus belli within NATO states is especially pressing, as the livelihoods of 1 billion people across 31 countries are at stake (NATO 2023a). In 2014, NATO formally acknowledged that cyberattacks could be considered an armed attack and thus could trigger Article 5 (Collective Defense) of the NATO Charter (NATO 2014). Since 2016, the Alliance has recognized cyberspace as a domain of military operations in which it \"must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea\" (NATO 2016a).

More recently, the U.S. 2023 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy (U.S. DoD 2023, 7) notes: “U.S. adversaries regularly use malicious cyber activity to target our critical infrastructure. In crisis, they will seek to hinder U.S. military mobilization, sow chaos, and harm the American people.” This is because CI are the very “systems upon which modern society, economy, and polity are seen to depend” (CISA n.d.) and so the disruption or destruction of which would have severe consequences for national security. Indeed, as Haataja (2022, 425) notes, there is a pervasive “recognition of the potentially devastating impact that cyber operations on CI can have.”\nWhilst there has been significant development in mandatory regulation for private corporations regarding cyber-defense, the role of militaries in protecting civilian CI from cyberattacks that can trigger or occur in war has received very little empirical attention. This absence is curious, especially as the military is the traditional state organ tasked with defending the nation against external threats arising to the level of an armed attack.\nSuch a lacuna might be explained by the fact that the prevailing theoretical approach to the role of the military -- Civil--Military Relations (CMR) -- struggles to coherently account for cyberspace as a new “domain” of conflict. Cyberspace raises questions pertaining to the role of the military in 21st century conflicts, creating tensions between prevailing CMR assumptions and the new ways in which wars are fought. This is because “cyberspace pushes questions of traditional boundaries of sovereignty, as well as blurs lines between the civilian and security sector” (Lantis and Bloomberg 2018, 152). State-sponsored adversarial attacks in cyberspace even challenge the very notion of war itself (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022). As a result, there is a theoretical opacity in CMR regarding the military's duties in defending privately owned civilian CI from cyberattacks that both trigger and occur in war.\nGreater scholarly enquiry is therefore required to interrogate this theoretical muddiness inherent in cyber-CMR. Specifically, almost no empirical attention has been afforded to test whether this cyber-CMR tension is reflected in the military's own understanding of its role in cyber-defense of civilian CI. This article aims to fill this gap. It does so by drawing on 31 semi-structured interviews and 1 focus group with cyber experts from 12 NATO states to test this theoretical opacity. How do military cyber experts from NATO member states understand their role in defending critical infrastructure against cyberattacks? We find that -- unlike acts of aggression emanating from land, air, and sea -- NATO military members believe they can not, should not, and are not authorized to defend CI against cyberattacks that could constitute casus belli. Instead, despite recognizing that cyberattacks against CI could trigger or form part of “the next war”, NATO member states rely on private owners and operators for the provision and protection of CI. This finding is crucial, as it challenges preconceived notions of the military taking the lead in defending the state (including from cyberattacks) during war. Departing from the extant literature, the article then critically explores the practical and normative implications of having private corporations on the front line of cyber-defense of CI, and the military taking a backseat during (cyber)war.\nThe paper begins with an overview of the prevailing theoretical framework for understanding the role of the military in conflict -- CMR. This is crucial to make sense of how militaries understand their role in defending the nation in/through cyberspace. After a review of the article's methodology, we present the empirical data obtained from the\ninterviews. This is followed by a discussion of the findings, highlighting the problematic logic of the current dynamic, and a normative and practical consideration of whether the military ought to be more involved in cyber-defense of civilian CI. The conclusion summarizes the findings and scopes avenues for future research.\n## (Cyber) Civil--Military Relations\nCMR elucidates the relationship between the armed forces, the people, and the state's civilian authorities: it stresses civilian control over the military, defines what it means to be a professional soldier in a democratic society (Huntington 1957; Janowitz 1960), and identifies which items of the national security agenda fall to the military (Finer 1962; Huntington 1957). It is with this latter aspect of CMR with which we are principally concerned because it pertains to the role of the military in cyber operations, and in the protection of critical infrastructure. The consensus in the literature and in practice has been to try to maintain the separation between the military and civilians when it comes to critical infrastructure protection (CIP) (Pačka and Mareš 2021). However, the development of cyberspace challenges the foundational theoretical assumptions of CMR in three ways.\nFirst, cyberspace inherently blurs the traditional division between foreign and domestic theatres, which has authorization complexities for the military operating on home soil. One of the main tenets of CMR is that the military “does not generally operate or deploy domestically” (Rudesill 2021, 247--248). As a result, the focus of the military (acting on behalf and at the behest of the civilian government) has been on defending against physical, foreign threats. Yet, this view has been somewhat altered since the collapse of the Soviet Union, when the new threat environment drew to the fore a more diverse set of security imperatives. Non-traditional security threats, such as terrorism, civil conflicts, pandemics, and natural disasters, have “compelled a world-wide re-thinking of the roles and missions of armed forces” within the CMR literature (Diamond, and Plattner 1996, x). “[V]irtually everywhere”, Bruneau and Matei (2012, 2) contend, “militaries and other security instruments are taking on new roles and missions”, such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR).\nThe changing character of national security forces militaries to adapt to a wider array of missions and to develop a broader purpose. But the military's focus largely remains on providing security from physical, external threats (Goodman 1996). In the 21st century, technological transformations altered the character of security and war yet again, forcing scholars to question whether CMR needs to be adjusted to protect states in “non-traditional battlefields,” notably cyberspace and outerspace. The boundaries between domestic and external security threats became increasingly obscured by transnational digital information systems (Rudesill 2021).\nAn important implication of this reality for CMR is a change of the main locus of military operations: “soldiers operating on the home front” might come to be seen as the rule rather than the exception (Rudesill 2021, 248). As put by Burton (2015, 302), cyberattacks “occur over a globally linked network of computer systems and can be launched without warning, in milliseconds, from anywhere on the planet.” Cyberspace, he argues, creates a new challenge for security organizations like NATO, which has “traditionally focused on geographically\nproximate security threats” (Burton 2015, 302). This brought others to argue that soldiers will be securing networks and countering intrusions against critical infrastructure (Jensen and Work 2018). The nature of transnational cyber threats, therefore, has important implications for the future role of the military, urging states to reconsider whether a physical, territorial distinction -- a separation between domestic and foreign theatres of operations -- is justified (or indeed even possible) in cyberspace.\nSecond, cyberspace challenges CMR's clear distinction between civilian and military domains because the cyberspace environment is inherently different from that of traditional, physical domains of war (land, air, and sea). As such, the traditional CMR boundaries between military and civilian spheres have become increasingly hazy. Pačka and Mareš (2021, 437) note: “In a common national security and defense ecosystem, the roles of players such as an army, police, intelligence agency, and others are set clearly and there is an evident division of labor ... cyberspace constantly changes the boundaries.” Cyberspace is “blurring the lines between the traditional expertise of the uniformed military and the roles and responsibilities of civilians” (Beehner, Brooks, and Maurer 2021, 5). This is especially the case because aggressions in cyberspace often target civilian persons or infrastructure (Sewall 2021).\nAs militaries become more involved in the cyber domain, they will inevitably conduct their operations over “international and domestic computer infrastructure that supports the dense lattice of digital-age civilian life” (Rudesill 2021, 248). As Sharpe, Trichas, and Terrill (2024, 5) note, “recognition of ... cyberspace as a critical domain ... represents a paradigm shift in military strategy.” Further distorting the distinction between civilian and military spheres is the fact that technological infrastructure is often dual-use and that militaries rely increasingly on civilian networks for their own operations (Fasana 2018). Consensus amongst CMR scholars seems to be that the uniqueness of the cyber domain requires “unorthodox” and innovative approaches to the organization of security and defense (Kallberg and Cook 2017, 8130), challenging, in the words of Brooks (2016, 359), existing “walls” between civilians and the military. As summarized by Chayes (2015, 187): “Civil and military roles are not easily sorted out in the area of cyberattacks and cyber warfare.”\nThird, cyberspace forces a revision not only of what it means to fight wars and of who is involved in warfighting but of the delineation between war and peace itself (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022; Sewall 2021). Constant contact and interconnectedness are key features of cyberspace, favoring initiative and pre-emption over passivity and reactive defense, meaning that states are incentivized to persistently exploit adversary vulnerabilities in order to gain and maintain the advantage (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022). This challenges the dominant Western understanding of war, premised on “use of force” and “armed attack” as the crossing of what is usually considered to be the boundary between war and peace. Unlike with conventional warfare, there is seemingly no strict division between war and peace in cyberspace. States are in a constant state of competition. NATO holds the view that “cyberspace is contested at all times” (NATO 2022). Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett (2022, 123) argue that this requires a paradigm shift in policy and strategy planning, one that would focus on an “increased tempo” of cyber military operations outside their own network, and continuous preparation and execution of cyber campaigns.\nAs the complexities of cyberspace are challenging the long-held clear division between war and peace, by extension, the clear separation between civilian and military spheres is also contested. Is there a need for “an increased tempo” of cyber military operations not only outside the defense's network but outside the unique context of war? That the military might play a role outside of warfighting is not new to cyberspace, as discussed above, and so it is justified to address the challenge of continuous competition in cyberspace and activities occurring in this space between peace and war.\nThe question that then flows from this is whether it matters at all when a cyberattack against CI reaches the threshold of an armed attack and triggers Article 5, especially with regards to the roles and responsibilities of cyber-defense. Surely, it does matter, because -- traditionally -- if states are at war, different agents become responsible for action (namely, the military). Yet in cyberspace, this does not seem to be the case, with this responsibility being entrusted to private actors even during conflict. Instead, it seems that the dissolution of the war-peace continuum in cyberspace is making it difficult for states to identify the appropriate response to cyberattacks against the nation's CI, both during the crisis phase, before Article 5 is invoked, and during war. It is with these kinds of cyberattacks, that could constitute casus belli or occur in war, that this article is concerned.\nOwing to these complexities, it is unclear “whether civil-military relations are sufficiently calibrated to protect ... in these non-traditional battlefields” where “warfare encompass[es] ... less-understood cyber-tools” (Beehner, Brooks, and Maurer 2021, 3). The foundational assumptions built into CMR paradigmatically accept that the military's role is in defending against physical, external threats, focused within war time and is wedded to the distinction between civilian and military responsibilities. But, as others have noted, cyberspace generates theoretical tensions regarding the applicability of these three a priori accepted precepts.\n## Research design and methodology: NATO case study\nIf cyberattacks on CI will inevitably feature in 21st century conflicts, then it is urgent to understand if and how the military, as the institution responsible for warfighting and defense on behalf of the state, understands its role. In other words, it is of paramount importance to test whether existing theoretical tensions are reflected empirically -- by going straight to the source. The justification for casing our study to NATO is because the alliance represents a significant proportion of the global population and serves as a key exemplar of dominant Western perspectives.\nWe conducted 31 semi-structured interviews with military and defense cyber subject matter experts (SMEs) from 12 NATO member states, and 1 focus group of 7 military cyber experts. Representatives from Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Estonia, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US) participated in the research. These countries were chosen based on access (at the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Tallinn and at the NATO Headquarters in Brussels) and expertise within the NATO alliance regarding cyber-defense, including states that are technologically advanced and at the forefront of cyber affairs in practice, and others that are not as well positioned. Among NATO states, cyber-defense of CI is a national responsibility and as such, strategies vary across nations but clear similarities can be found. This illustrates that regardless of a state's level of\n“cyber-awareness,” most NATO members share similar views on the role of the military regarding the cyber-defense of CI. It also illuminates an apparent disconnect between traditional CMR assumptions regarding the role of the military in territorial defense against external threats and current military perceptions across NATO states. It is also important to note that cyber-offense has its own very specific construct -- Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies (SCEPVA) -- which we do not explore in this paper.\nBy “cyber subject matter experts” we mean military members (officers and enlisted) and civilians (policy advisors) working for defense ministries and at the NATO Headquarters, whose principal occupation is with matters of cyberspace -- both offense and defense. The interview participants included senior military officials (including two-star generals) and cyber experts and lawyers from the military and other government departments (including ministries of defense and intelligence agencies) from NATO member states.\nInterviewees were assured that their views would not be taken as representative of NATO or their “home” state, military, or department, and that their identity would be anonymized. Accordingly, quotes have not been assigned to specific roles or states in order to mitigate the risks associated with attribution, particularly those arising from cross-referencing. The goal of conducting these interviews was not to examine differences in cultural approaches across NATO members, although this would be a valuable future study.\nA note on limitations. One limitation pertaining to the approach of this research is that, by focusing on military perspectives only, the research excludes other crucial stakeholders such as private-sector partners and other public agencies like police, local cyber task forces and computer emergency response teams (CERTS). Notably, we do not examine what the private owners and operators of CI (CEOs and/or employees) consider as the appropriate role of the military in cyber-defense. This question, albeit important, requires a separate, substantive future investigation -- one that, due to space constraints, we could not explore here. Instead, our interest lies with understanding the military's role in defending the nation against cyberattacks, a question that is best answered by those working in defense who are across the current military cyber posture. That said, the participants also included representatives from intelligence agencies, who work closely with their military counterparts and who have important responsibilities in both cyber-offense and cyber-defense in many countries. These interviewees were well placed to differentiate the role of the military and that of intelligence agencies in responding to a cyber event, confirming some issues raised by defense interviewees in terms of cyber-CMR.\n## NATO militaries' perceptions of cyber-defense of CI\nIn the words of the interviewees, the purpose of the military is to “serve, protect, and defend” the state and the population against foreign aggression. However, when asked how the military discharges this responsibility to protect citizens from adversarial cyberattacks on CI either triggering or happening in war, all of the interviewees stated that the military was ill-suited or ill-prepared to intervene, even in the case where it might be asked to do so. We also found that, despite cyberspace being recognized as a domain of\nmilitary operations, military members' understanding of their role reflects the complexities of the cyber war-peace continuum. Three recurring narratives emerged from the interviewees when describing the limits of their role. Each chime with the three tensions articulated in cyber-CMR above: the uniqueness of the domain, the blurring of foreign/domestic theaters, and what this means for understanding war. To begin, however, we survey how militaries presently engage in cyber-defense of CI.\n### Defending forward, persistent engagement, and integrated deterrence\nNATO member militaries are engaged in collecting, analyzing, and exchanging intelligence with other government agencies, the private sector, and NATO allies (U.S. DoD 2023). Information collection and sharing is considered an integral aspect of cyber-defense (NATO 2016b, U.S. DoD 2023). When private corporations identify a threat in their system and pass that information along to government agencies, such public agencies then make recommendations regarding how the private companies ought to rectify the vulnerability and voluntarily assist in that process (which, in many instances, can be declined by the corporation). Yet, importantly (for reasons we explore below), according to one of our interviewees: “the government won't go into anyone's systems: they have a coordination role, but otherwise it's hands off the keyboard” (Participant 18, 2019).\nMoreover, NATO state militaries are authorized (and indeed required) to take proactive measures to ensure the cybersecurity of their own military systems -- principally to ensure continued operability across the traditional, physical domains of armed conflict. The desire to enhance the cyber resilience of the Alliance was reiterated at the 2023 Vilnius Summit (NATO 2023b). As a senior military officer explained, however, “the primary concern of the military is to ensure our cyber systems are working so we can do kinetic defense: the military has a monopoly on kinetic defense, not cyber” (Participant 12, 2019).\nA few of the interviewees stated that the military is engaged in what has long been understood as “active defense:” “defensive operations that involve direct engagement with sophisticated adversaries in DoD-controlled cyberspace” (DARPA 2012). The U.S. in particular has employed the notion of “defending forward” (Healey 2019; Kosseff et al. 2019) which aims to pre-emptively “stop threats before they reach their targets” (U.S. Department of Defense 2018, 2) and which was developed in response to criticisms that the military was not proactively defending critical infrastructure against cyberattacks (Former US Cyber Command official, personal communication with author, 2020). “Defending forward,” “active defense,” and “persistent engagement” were born out of the recognition that the U.S. could not expect private corporations to defend themselves against the full power of an adversarial state. Both approaches form part of what the U.S. now regards as “integrated deterrence,” developed in the most recent DoD Cyber Strategy (2023, 2), which focuses on using military cyber capabilities “in concert with other instruments of national power.”\nFurther still, the military would likely be the apparatus called upon by the state in the “response” phase of a devastating cyberattack (Participants 8, 14, 16, 22). The military would be responsible for launching a cyber or kinetic counter-offensive, following appropriate attribution processes (proportionality, necessity, and distinction factors\nconsidered). But such responses are necessarily ex post facto. As was expressed in the focus group (2019): “Reacting after the fact is a losing strategy.” Until then, the front line of defense -- with public sector support, especially intelligence agencies -- is the private corporations.\n### The effectiveness narrative: can not\nPreviously, it has been thought that -- in the context of NATO and specifically the U.S. -- the resources and expertise on cyber-defense and cyberwar was retained by the military (Burton 2015; O'Connell 2012). Our empirical evidence finds the opposite to be the case. Most of the interviewees argued that their respective militaries currently lack the necessary resources, human-power, and relevant expertise required to effectively defend CI from cyberattacks. As a result, the interviewees consistently highlighted that, due to the nature of the domain, the military is unable to protect civilian CI from cyberattacks -- even those that can trigger or occur in war. One interviewee compared this lack of cyber capability with traditional, kinetic attacks: “The military is the only institution or organization to defend against armed attacks, because they're the only ones who have fighter planes. But in a cyberattack, Cyber Command won't be first [to respond], because they don't have the capability” (Participant 19, 2019). Another senior military officer (Participant 3, 2019) reflected that attention ought to be focused on pragmatically determining which organization is likely to be most successful in providing cyber-defense: “It's about having the right tools, and the right knowledge ... the military might not be best placed to defend certain infrastructure.” For instance, interviewees rightly pointed out that in many countries intelligence agencies play a significant role in the cyber-defense of the nation and its critical infrastructure, notably by advising and assisting other government agencies and the private sector (see for instance GCHQ n.d.; Government of Canada n.d.).\nA few interviewees also noted that because the private corporations that own and operate CI use different and often “tailor-made” platforms, it would be almost impossible for cyber experts in the military to be sufficiently knowledgeable to defend across all the different systems. It is “unimaginable” for the military to help, one interviewee reflected, “because they are completely unfamiliar with the systems” (Participant 9, 2019).\nSome of the interviewees argued that it would be financially ineffective or even prohibitively expensive to have the military provide cyber-defense for CI: it is “better to let the private sector deal with it,” because having the government provide the cyber-defense for critical infrastructure would be “implausible and expensive” (Participant 12, 2019). “Private corporations should be responsible,” one interviewee stated, “otherwise there would be a lot of taxpayers' money required to provide [protection for] those systems -- like a ‘cybersecurity tax' for providing cyber-defense of critical infrastructure” (Participant 9, 2019). The interviewees' perception echoes the sentiment highlighted in the literature on critical infrastructure protection that private owners are best placed to establish cyber-defenses (Carr 2016; Dunn Cavelty and Suter 2009; Newlove-Eriksson, Giacomello, and Eriksson 2018; Pačka and Mareš 2021).\nThe environment narrative: should not\nWhen discussing why the military does not play a greater role in protecting CI from cyberattacks -- as they would if the “armed attack” was emanating from other domains of war -- the interviewees stated that this is because “cyberspace is fundamentally different” (Participant 15, 2019). The participants overwhelmingly referred to cyberspace's ubiquitous, borderless, fluid, and invisible nature. The interviewees emphasized the relatively abstract characteristics of cyberspace identified in the literature (Barnard-Wills and Ashenden 2012; Branch 2021; Mainwaring 2020; Wright 2018) as affecting the military's ability to help defend. One government official simply stated: “cyber is a different domain; we haven't figured out how it works” (Participant 22, 2019). Another interviewee reflected: “In cyber, the fog of war is heightened” (Participant 11, 2019). Interviewees also referred to the difficulty of determining whether sovereignty is applicable to cyberspace and where borders might begin and end, thereby touching on the ongoing debate between NATO member states about whether sovereignty is applicable to cyberspace.\nIn most instances, the interviewees' reference to sovereignty was intended to highlight that, unlike in sea, air, and land -- which have clear, physical borders that can be transgressed -- cyberspace has no such border. The interviewees often highlighted the difficulty of defending against cyberattacks by comparing cyberspace with the physical domains of warfighting: “You can see equipment like frigates and airplanes,” one interviewee noted, “but you can't see firewalls or malicious code” (Focus group 2019).\nA majority of interviewees also argued that the military does not have a significant role in defending CI from cyberattacks that could trigger war or happen in war because -- again, in contrast to the physical domain -- it is an “unchartered territory” and so “the line between government and private” is “blurred” (Participants 16, 18 and 26, 2019). A few interviewees drew parallels with the other services, claiming that “we've had an army, navy, and air force for a long time, but cyberspace is new” (Participant 13, 2019). These comments are reminiscent of the remarks made by Lt. Col. Kurt Sanger, Chief Judge Advocate for National Security Law at U.S. Cyber Command at the 2019 CyCon U.S: “For most of the domains, you have thousands of years and millions of warriors contributing to the lessons that you're now learning ... We don't have that in cyberspace” (Sanger 2019, quoted in Pomerleau 2019). In short, cyberspace itself was thought by the interviewees as an inherently exposed space, with points of vulnerabilities too vast to comprehend. As one officer put it, “cyberspace is un-defendable” (Participant 12, 2019). These responses align with what Cate (2015, 307) identifies as the prevailing “sense of despair about the size and complexity of the challenge.”\nOur empirical evidence highlights that the military believes it should not play a significant role in defending CI. In doing so, it thereby supports the extant theoretical claim that cyberspace distorts the lines between the domestic vs. foreign spheres and forces an alteration of traditional territorial and sovereign conceptions of defense. This further illustrates the dissolution of the traditional division between civilian and military sectors in CMR due to the unprecedented nature of the domain.\nThe authorization narrative: not permitted\nThe last narrative that emerged from the interviewees' responses is that of “authorization.” A third of the interviewees noted that the military is not permitted to operate on domestic soil. Typically, within NATO states, the military is not automatically authorized to conduct what are considered police enforcement duties: for instance, the U.S. Posse Comitatus Act, signed in 1878, is designed to prohibit the deployment of the military to enforce domestic civilian policies and practices “unless expressly authorized by the Constitution or an act of Congress” (Congressional Research Service 2018). It seems that this is what most of the interviewees were referring to when raising concerns regarding “authorization.” Many participants explained that this is a “design reality” of the democratic system, which means that states are constrained and restrained by their legal environment (Participants 1, 2 and 13, 2019). As one interviewee articulated, “the legislation is not adjusted for the realities of cyberspace” (Participant 7, 2019), while another reflected, “if we want to live in a liberal, democratic society, this is what we get” (Participant 17, 2019).\nSome interviewees highlighted that the military would be called upon, by the state, to operate in the territory of that sovereign state in the instance that there is an actual use of physical force against the state. As one interviewee explained: “Obviously if our ‘friends' in the East rolled tanks across the border right now, our forces would be authorized to act in the state to repel that assault. It wouldn't be the police's job” (Participant 15, 2019).\nAdditionally, a few interviewees raised concerns regarding privacy as a barrier to greater military involvement. One military officer noted that: “[People] are OK that we have ships, border patrol, flight deterrence ... But with cyber, people don't want the government to look into their Internet connectivity” (Participant 18, 2019). Overall, the interviewees consistently stated that the military would be called upon to protect the sovereign state from a land invasion, naval assault, or airborne missile strike against CI -- but this would not be the case regarding a comparable assault emanating from cyberspace.\nThe three narratives empirically confirm the tension highlighted in the literature on cyber-CMR. It further resonates with the 2023 U.S. Cyber Strategy that the Department of Defense “lacks the authority to employ military forces to defend private companies against cyberattacks” and that there are “limited circumstances in which military cyber forces would be asked to defend civilian critical infrastructure -- the Department will not posture itself to defend every private sector network” (U.S. DoD 2023, 13). In short, NATO member militaries do not believe they play a major role in cyber-defense of CI that initiates or occurs amidst war due to environment, effectiveness, and authorization complexities. As one interviewee noted: “There is a contradiction between the fear of cyberattacks, [and the fact that] we [the people] ... don't want the military to play a bigger role” (Participant 18, 2019).\n## Critical discussion of the military perspective\nThere are three key findings that arise from the empirical evidence. First: the military members affirm the perception of the blurred nature of cyber-CMR described above. Second: the minimal military involvement raises urgent questions regarding CI that will\nbe targeted in war. Third: while regulations have improved in the past few years, it is the private corporations that are principally responsible for protecting CI from sophisticated state-sponsored cyberattacks during war. These findings invite a re-examination of the role of the military in 21st century conflicts.\n### A reflection of political will and political choices\nOne of the explanations invoked by the interviewees for why the military is not more involved in the cyber-defense of CI is because the military currently lacks the financial and human resources to do so (the effectiveness narrative). Some might claim that it is unreasonable to reassign some military funding for cyber-defense of CI in the face of “defense austerity” -- although in the U.S. this notion is debatable, as the proposed 2024 budget for the entire DoD totaled $842 billion (Congressional Budget Office 2023). One interviewee argued that this objection is misplaced, as taking proactive security measures prior to an “inevitable cyberattack against critical infrastructure” is a more fiscally responsible decision from the outset (Participant 4, 2019).\nFunds already allocated to the acquisition of traditional kinetic weapons could (again, hypothetically) be redirected toward: the military's development of defensive cyber technologies for CI, the recruitment of more military cyber personnel, and the expansion and implementation of CIP military training programs. Other interviewees instead reiterated an absence of political will for states to invest highly in something as intangible as cybersecurity: “Guns and tanks and fighter jets are sexier. They're sexier and easier for politicians to show off for their next election campaign, that they're doing something for national security ... [They're] not really able to show off lines of code” (Focus group, 2019).\nAside from the fiscal element is the ostensible “novelty” and “unknowable-ness” of cyberspace as to why they “should not” be involved in defense of CI (the environment narrative). Confusion surrounding cyberspace's distinct character is something that is debated in the literature (Bringsjord and Licato 2015). Nonetheless, there is a risk of “succumbing to the shock of the new” (Betz and Stevens 2011, 87). Erroneously perceiving the form of a domain as inherently enigmatic stymies progress toward establishing effective defense systems. Considering other “newer” domains of war, one interviewee compared cyberspace to the air force: no “historical accident ... the air force was born out of the need for defense from attacks in airspace in the 20th century” (Participant 28, 2019). It is a political choice to allocate the main face of defense in war to private corporations.\nMoreover, whilst the military is prima facie prohibited from operating on domestic soil, the authorization narrative should be interrogated further. Indeed, the military could -- and would -- be called upon by the state to operate in its sovereign territory if there is an actual use of physical force tantamount to an armed attack. In the face of cyberattacks that do reach the level of an armed attack and that could trigger NATO's Article 5, conceivably, the military would be authorized to get involved in the cyber-defense of civilian CI systems. Theoretically at least, cyber aggressions comparable to armed attacks do not pose a significantly new challenge for civil--military relations. Nonetheless, the research finds that even with this kind of attack that could constitute casus belli, or occur during war, uncertainty remains within the military regarding the\nextent to which they would be authorized (or able) to get involved in the cyber-defense of private networks. Even when faced with cyberattacks that would amount to an armed attack, or during war, the military would not be able to effectively help defend CI. The militaries' current (and limited) ability and expectation to provide cyber-defense of CI is a political calculation. One defense personnel reflected: “I feel that there is a growing need for more cyber units in the military, and since cyber has now been recognized as a proper domain of armed conflict on par with air, land, sea and in some cases also space, I think it will happen ... It is just a question of how it will evolve, and through which means. (Participant 16, 2019)”\nNevertheless, according to the interviewees, this is likely only after some “catastrophic” cyberattack on CI (Participants 8 and 29, 2019). The current decision to rely heavily on private corporations, albeit with mandatory reporting and compliance mechanisms, is a political choice.\n### Concerns surrounding “dual-use” infrastructures\nA further implication of minimal military involvement is how to deal with “dual-use” CI. Civilian CI has been and will continue to be targeted by adversarial actors as part of war (Wallace and Reeves 2020). One interviewee stated: “There is no such thing as a ‘military' cyberattack; 90% of the time it will be against civilian infrastructure” (Participant 22, 2019). According to another: “Adversaries will -- and already do -- attack critical infrastructure as a primary target via cyberspace, because it's what we would do” (Participant 7, 2019). States will likely seek to disable CI in war in order to gain a military advantage.\nAs per international cyber norms regarding responsible state behavior, there is a prohibition of “cyber operations that cause intentional damage or impairment to critical infrastructure (CI)” (Haataja 2022, 423). CI should be -- in the words of then U.S. President Joe Biden -- “‘off limits' to attack” (cited in Haataja 2022, 425). Of course, only military objects and combatants are liable to be lawfully targeted in war; according to the International Humanitarian Law (IHL) principle of distinction, intentionally targeting civilians and civilian CI (including via cyber) is prohibited (ICRC 2023). Nevertheless, the urgency of preparing the military to contribute to the defense of CI is even more apparent given the potential for civilian CI to be rendered a liable military objective. This is because civilian CI can: i) become co-opted for military purposes, ii) have a “military utility,” or iii) be “dual-use” (Schmitt 2017, 128--135).\nThere are three concerns raised here. First, if (privately owned) CI networks become “dual-use” or are of “military utility,” they become military objectives and thus may be lawfully targeted. As Horowitz (2024, 327) notes: a “privately owned civilian aviation air traffic control tower that the enemy military temporarily uses to enable offensive operations” might be rendered a military objective “because of its ‘use.'” Moreover, according to the Tallinn Manual 2.0: if critical infrastructure is being used by both civilian and military ends, and it is “impossible” to differentiate between the civilian and military parts of a system, “the entire network ... qualifies as a military objective” (Schmitt 2017, 135).\nSecond, because of the invisible nature of cyberspace, it is additionally challenging to differentiate between civilian vs. military cyber infrastructures. As such, there is\nforeseeably a large scope for misinterpretation and accidental military targeting of CI. Third, it is unclear whether preparatory acts on “dual-use” infrastructures during peacetime -- such as the insertion of dormant malware -- constitutes an attack or strictly cyber-espionage. Haataja (2022, 424, 428) highlights that there is a danger for pre-positioned adversarial code in CI that could be activated later, a practice known as “persistent presence” in CI. Simply planting malware or creating “backdoors” certainly violates international cyber norms and could be considered a breach of a state's obligation under international law (others consider such cyber norms “voluntary, non-binding”) (Haataja 2022, 428--31). But such cyber-operations themselves are unlikely to rise to the level of an armed attack. Activating a dormant malware in a privately owned CI, such as a nuclear powerplant, causing it to explode, would foreseeably reach that threshold. All of this points to the complexity of defending CI from cyberattacks that constitute casus belli or may be pursued in war.\n### A degree of (risky) faith in the private sector\nPrivate corporations that own and operate CI ought to provide appropriate cyber-defensive measures -- especially to protect what one interviewee called “low-hanging fruits” (Participant 3, 2019). Nonetheless, as one interviewee noted: “We can't expect private companies to protect themselves against state-sponsored attacks” (Participant 23, 2019). Many interviewees expressed having “faith” in private corporations adhering to proper standards and regulations: “We hope they [the private corporations] do the right thing” (Participant 8, 2019).\nUsing the physical domain as an analogy, the private owners of a power grid would be expected to employ a reasonable degree of security -- locking doors, installing surveillance cameras, erecting wire fences, and employing security guards, and so on. However, the security guard would not be expected to defend against an attack that rises to a use of force tantamount with war. Defense from in-coming ballistic missiles would fall to the state and -- foreseeably -- the air force: “In the physical world, we don't require companies to have an air force, or submarines, or to really look at the pointy end of an attack” (Hanson 2021).\nYet whilst companies have oversight, assistance, and mandatory regulations from government, the front line of defense in cyberspace remains the purview of companies. It is often in their profit margins interests to ensure their cyber-defenses are in order, and to work closely and collaboratively with government agencies to redress vulnerabilities or incursions. Beyond purely monetary interests, corporations could be appealed to do so on the notion of “loyalty” (Christensen and Petersen 2017, 1440). They may be incentivized to effectively participate in the provision of cyber-defense based on “a moral commitment to ‘solidarity' and ‘community responsibility'” (Christensen and Petersen 2017, 1440). One senior government official iterated this patriotic duty to “protect our lifestyle” (Participant 22, 2019). For instance, when asked about who is defending Ukrainian CI from Russian cyberattacks, one retired general responded: “The private corporations in Ukraine are doing an excellent job” (General [retd.], personal communication with author, 2022). Similarly, Matania and Sommer (2023, 3) note that “Tech Titans” (Google,\nMicrosoft, Meta, Apple, SpaceX and Amazon) are playing a meaningful role in the armed conflict in Ukraine.\nThat said, as one interviewee reflected: “appealing towards companies' patriotism ... is probably not the safest way to do things” (Participant 13, 2019). Even if a private corporation is “homegrown,” it does not guarantee that they are, in fact, patriotic. “Company Over Country” was Meta CEO and Founder Mark Zuckerberg's early motto (Losse 2018). Similarly, the whistle blower Haugen (2021, 2) iterated that -- when torn between “its own profits and [the U.S.'] safety,” Meta “consistently ... favor[ed] its own profits.” This demonstrates that American-owned corporations have prioritized financial gains over that of the security of the American people. Such a dynamic becomes even more problematic if CI corporations in NATO member states are outsourced and owned by foreign corporations.\nPerhaps “profits before patriotism” is strictly a feature of peacetime: once it comes to war, the dynamic will flip. For instance, by May 2022 Google had pledged approximately $55 million in support of Ukraine's resistance of Russian aggression (Matania and Sommer 2023, 11). Similarly, within days of the full-scale invasion, Microsoft moved Ukraine's critical government data to its cloud storage platform (Microsoft 2022). This was because most of the data was “extremely vulnerable to missile attacks, and their physical destruction could paralyze the entire work of the country's top leadership” (Microsoft 2023).\nYet the view that corporations would be driven by patriotism (or, more accurately, defense of liberal values) over profit hinges on two, risky assumptions. In the first instance, it takes for granted that the CI private corporation heralds from, or is ideologically aligned with, the country under (cyber)attack -- which is not necessarily always the case. It supposes the private corporation may not be under pressure from the attacking-state or wishes to remain neutral, or had been convinced to allow the attack to take place (due to corruption, coercion, or ideological leanings). There is no guarantee for support. There is no expectation for patriotism even from corporations that are (for lack of a better word) “home grown.”\nIn the second instance, it is also not clear how long “patriotic” support or commitment to democratic liberal ideals -- even if it is forthcoming -- might last. While Elon Musk's SpaceX initially sent Starlink satellites to the Ukrainian military for free, it eventually stated it could no longer foot the bill, and the Pentagon had to pick up the tab -- once the reliance on Musk's service had been firmly established (conceivably with an agenda to accrue profits). Moreover, demonstrating the selectivity of private sector support, when the Ukrainian military conducted an offensive into the Russian-held Crimea, they begged Elon Musk to turn on its satellite service in the Russian-controlled area, but he refused to do so because (according to his post on X) he feared SpaceX's complicity in “a major act of war and conflict escalation” (Musk 2023). Betting on private corporations' patriotism and political alliances or appetite for war, over that of their foundational and raison d'être interests in profit, is to gamble with national (cyber) defense. If there is a profit to be made, corporations might choose to get involved in conflicts (even distant ones), but they might stop to be involved when it is no longer financially advisable.\nOur empirical data suggests that -- unlike kinetic acts of war emanating in land, air, and sea -- the military is not responsible for defending against state-sponsored acts of\naggression against CI via cyberspace. However, trusting private corporations to adequately defend against cyberattacks in war is a risky security strategy.\n## Should militaries be more involved? Normative and practical considerations\nAs detailed in the previous section, multiple interviewees remarked on the risks associated with dual-use infrastructure and with being overly reliant on private corporations to provide cyber-defense of CI. Relatedly, some participants expressed concerns about not being readied and resourced to defend CI against cyberattacks. This prompts the question: might there be a case for increasing military involvement in cyber-defense of CI? After all, the military is the principal body responsible for defending civilians (on behalf of the state) from acts of aggression rising to war. Former NATO Deputy Secretary General Rose Gottemoeller et al. (2022) expressed the need for NATO Allies to be better prepared in response to cyberattacks. This requirement is especially pertinent, as Burton (2015, 302) remarks, “cyber operations are increasingly part of [conflicts involving NATO forces] and an element of the strategy of NATO's main state adversaries.” To be clear, we are not in any way suggesting a “military-takes-all,” zero-sum approach to defending CI from cyberattacks that trigger Article 5. The normative question is whether militaries should be readied -- as a last line of defense -- to help protect alongside private corporations and public bodies (such as intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and federal and local cyber task forces).\nOne objection to greater military involvement is the potential for escalation. A cyber-defensive operation led by the military could be perceived by an adversary as a cyber countermeasure, resulting in a “tit-for-tat escalation of cyberattacks and responses, each one more serious than the last” (Hollis and Ohlin 2018, 448). An increased role of the military in providing cyber-defense of CI may therefore lead to “a permissive normative-legal environment in which states are more likely than before to resort to uses of force” (Heinze and Neilsen 2020, 186).\nA related normative concern is that the increased role of the military in cyber-defense of CI begets the militarization of cyberspace. The perception of the military being involved in a civilian network, even for strictly defensive purposes, may render it a military target. But simply because the military may be called upon, as a last resort, to aid in the cyber-defense of CI does not render the civilian objective ipso facto a military target. In the same way that the military might be called upon to help defend a hospital (for instance) from kinetic attacks, the military presence does not automatically render the hospital a liable military objective.\nAnother further objection might be that introducing the military as an agent of cyber-defense of CI risks increasing the potential for abuse -- notably, through mass militarized surveillance or the military placing pressure on private corporations to act in certain ways. Relatedly, there may be normative concerns regarding competing authorities -- an unnecessary duplication of responsibilities and confusion over which entity precisely (the private organization vs. intelligence agency vs. the military) acts in what contexts. Within the extant literature, Public--Private Partnerships in CI protection are already regarded as notoriously fraught with complications pertaining to cooperation, information sharing, and trust (Carr 2016; Dunn Cavelty and Suter 2009). For instance, one interviewee noted that -- on the issue of information sharing of breaches -- “private companies won't ‘sho\ntheir hand' ... they would rather sell the intelligence than give it away for free” (Participant 9, 2019). Surely adding another agent into the mix will make cyber-defense more complex.\nA reply to these two objections is that the military should only get involved when: i) the private entity is unable or unwilling to respond, ii) that the aid of the existing public agencies is insufficient, or iii) that the cyberattack would (through its scale and effects) constitute an armed attack. What should be envisaged is a live, cooperative triage system, whereby the military might be deployed only to help defend CI, should the attack foreseeably trigger war or take place in war, or if other responders have failed to address the threat and require additional assistance.\nOne further objection is that increasing military involvement generates a moral hazard for the private sector. Specifically, if the military is offering a pseudo-“security umbrella,” private corporations may be disincentivized to invest in necessary cybersecurity measures and instead increase their risk tolerance (as per prospect theory). Cybersecurity is costly and time-consuming; saving on cybersecurity would likely increase corporations' profits, and energy and resources could be redirected to other parts of business.\nHowever, there are several considerations that would foreseeably mitigate this moral hazard. Corporations risk extreme reputational damage and services by relying too heavily on possible military defense: corporations must still provide adequate levels of cybersecurity that sufficiently defend against the vast majority of cyberattacks, which are criminal or low-level intrusions. Further, corporations would rather deal with cyber-defense issues in house and (as our interviewees noted) are wary about freely “opening the doors” to the military. These are serious objections to increasing military involvement. But it is also pertinent to examine the normative implications if states do not increase military involvement.\nFirst, the existing requirement for private corporations to be on the “front line” of cyber-defense of CI means demanding that civilians be responsible for defending against disastrous acts of (cyber)war. Even if they are not explicitly conscripted (more on this below) it is the civilian employees of those private sectors who nonetheless currently shoulder national cybersecurity duties. “Like the soldiers in the fortress,” Brenner and Clarke (emphasis added, 2010, 1032) reflect, “computer personnel confronting a cyberattack are responsible for defending their ‘territory' from hostile activity.”\nThis blurring of civilian and military spheres -- the expectation of civilians in corporations to not only contribute to but bear the weight of defending the state from cyber-attacks in war -- opens Pandora's box regarding pressing legal, normative, and practical questions. Is the expectation to participate in cyber-defense during war articulated in the employees' contracts? Are these civilian employees permitted to excuse themselves, or conscientiously object to participating in war, or will they be forced to fight, albeit with code over cobalt? Are employees aware of this possibility as part of their day job? If civilian operators on the cyber front-line “abandon their posts” -- literally removing hands from keyboards -- should they be court-martialed?\nWorse still: What if individual civilians, unbeknownst to their corporate managers, sympathize with the aggressor state, or have been compromised by the aggressor (via blackmail, bribery, or disinformation)? This may lead employees to feign cyber-defense and even aid the cyberattacker. Indeed, one of the interviewees worried that “moles are already there in the private sector,” and that such “moles” may be feeding\nsensitive information to adversaries, or even disrupting the systems on behalf of a foreign state (Participant 15, 2019). After all, these privately employed civilians (unlike military personnel) have not pledged allegiance to their (respective) flags. Even if the corporation leadership is patriotic, how can we be sure of the political allegiances of its civilian employees, especially as many are unlikely to have undergone security checks? If private corporations are “fighting” in war, might such corporations (or their CEOs, like Musk, or individual civilian operators) be tempted to aggressively hack-back?\nFurthermore, at what point does a civilian (both based in and, crucially, outside the country waging war) become a direct participant in hostilities and become a liable target for cyber and kinetic strikes under IHL? Horowitz (2024, 322) remarks that -- following an “expansive interpretation of the temporal element of [direct participation in hostilities (DPH)]” under IHL -- “a tech company employee who engages in DPH,” including strictly cyber-defense, “even if only infrequently during a work week from their office, might lose protection from attack not only while they engage in those specific acts of DPH but also continuously from morning to night and at home for an extended period of time.” Even if a narrow view of the temporal aspect of DPH is adopted -- wherein a civilian may only be targeted “for such time” that she is actively contributing to military activity via cyber-defense -- this dynamic creates a “revolving door” for civilians “who repeatedly engage in DPH” (Horowitz 2024, 322). Civilians forfeit and regain protection status depending on whether their hands are, quite literally in that moment, on the keyboard.\nCivilians who are completely oblivious of their contribution to hostilities retain their protection status (Horowitz 2024, 319). Might that be an argument for not telling private corporation employees about their foreseeable role in defending against cyberattacks in war? This seems ethically dubious, as it raises a host of questions surrounding transparency and individuals' agency. Civilian tech employees also do not forfeit their protection status when acting in “self-defense or in defense of others against violence prohibited against IHL,” such as “looting, rape, and murder by marauding” (emphasis added, Melzer 2009, 61, cited in; Horowitz 2024, 319). But civilian employees would forfeit their protected status (and become liable to targeting) if they are knowingly responding to cyberattacks that are permissible under IHL. Further still, if an individual tech employee is engaged in DPH and commits a violation of IHL that amounts to war crimes, they become liable under international criminal law (Horowitz 2024, 336). To what extent are civilian employees aware of this when they join a private corporation and are expected to fight in (cyber)wars to protect CI?\nSecond, if the military is not responsible for defending privately owned CI from devastating cyberattacks triggering and during war, then this means acknowledging that the military is seemingly responsible for defending the civilian population only in certain ways when it comes to CI (Participant 3, 2019). To be precise, it means the military is responsible for: i) defending CI from attacks emanating from the “physical domain,” ii) thwarting cyberattacks that target their own military or government systems, iii) mounting offensive cyber operations against adversarial CI, and iv) intelligence gathering and (if possible) sharing with companies. Correspondingly, the civilian population must be made aware of, and consent to, the reality that an entire arm of the state\nwill not be readied or resourced to protect against a catastrophic cyberattack against CI amounting to or during war.\nThird, as private corporations are required to shoulder enhanced duties to protect themselves (and the civilians who depend on them), they will be driven to amass more wealth and influence to fulfil the responsibilities demanded of them by states. After all, the flipside of the adage “with great power comes great responsibility” is with great responsibility comes the requirement to obtain the power to fulfil that responsibility. The foreseeable result is that private corporations will become even more powerful, and the public sector even more dependent on private corporations to guarantee national cybersecurity.\nThe worry, then, is that demanding private corporations to act like states means permitting -- indeed, requiring -- private corporations to fulfil the responsibilities of states. But private corporations are not states. CEOs are not democratically elected by the civilian populations they are (ostensibly) charged to protect. Their main pursuit is not protection but profit. There is no requirement for patriotism.\nMaybe these consternations are mute: private corporations could simply be subsumed under government control during war time via nationalization. Yet this dynamic circles back to the issues raised above pertaining to an overreliance on civilian consent or conscription. May individual employees conscientiously object to participating in war? If so, this will leave a lacuna for cyber-defense, as the military has not thus far been readied-and-resourced to respond (according to the interviewees). If not, this means conscripting employees to participate in war -- via cyber -- when they do not wish to; this may spell a cyber-equivalent to the “non-firing phenomenon” (where soldiers fail to shoot or to shoot accurately at the enemy). These questions highlight the further dissolution between civilians and the military in cyberspace.\nAs two interviewees noted: “by the time [the adversary is] in our systems, it's already too late” (Participant 18, 2019), and “if I were thinking about the current threats, I would be sleepless” (Participant 14, 2019). Relying heavily on private corporations and, crucially, their civilian employees to defend CI in war prompts a required reassessment and renegotiation regarding the role of the military (as the warfighting machine) in the digital age. Perhaps before states begin forcibly requiring civilian employees of private corporations to provide cyber-defense of CI in/as part of war, the military (alongside relevant public and private bodies) should be better equipped to help protect.\n## Conclusion\nNATO has long recognized cyberspace as a domain of war alongside air, land, and sea. Whilst the threat of cyberattacks has been widely debated, political and military leaders have consistently warned that adversaries will target CI with cyberattacks to initiate and prosecute conflict. Despite these concerns, there has been limited attention afforded to how Civil--Military Relations theory makes sense of cyberspace, and almost no empirical inquiry into how militaries understand their role in cyber-defense.\nTo fill this gap in defense studies literature, we conducted extensive, original elite interviews with military members across 12 NATO countries. Our data provided empirical evidence to confirm the theoretical opacity in cyber-CMR. It remains unclear at which point the military might be asked to get involved in the cyber-defense of CI, and it seems\nthat they would not be capable to help, even in war. Militaries play a role in gathering and sharing intelligence, defending forward, and reacting (via cyber or kinetic measures) after the fact. But they do not play a role in actively defending civilian CI as they would in other domains of war (Participant 12, 2019). According to our interviewees, this is because the military could not act (effectiveness narrative), should not act (environment narrative), and is not permitted to act (authorization narrative). Instead, the interviewees pointed to the fact that private owners and operators of CI play a central role in war.\nGiven this dynamic, the article then explores concerns around allocation of financial resources, “dual-use” infrastructures, and “having faith” in the private sector to “do the right thing.” The final part of the paper then controversially asks whether the military ought to be more involved. This section unpacked the serious legal, normative, and practical considerations with the private sector -- specifically, their civilian employees -- being on the front line of cyber-defense in war. To what extent should civilian employees be expected to act qua the military to defend against a cyberattack triggering or occurring in war? Are engineers in private corporations aware that they could become a direct participant in hostilities under IHL (and thereby forfeit their protection status as civilians)? What are the consequences of civilians abandoning their post or refusing to partake in defensive war? May they -- should they -- be court-martialed?\nBy raising these questions, this article galvanizes future research into determining if and how the military should be more involved or whether and when civilians should be conscripted into cyberwars. Additional investigations should involve interviewing the private owners and operators of CI to ascertain i) their views on the military's role in defending their CI, and ii) how they understand their own role in cyber-defense in 21st century wars. Future research may also seek to determine whether greater military involvement into cyber-defense of CI could act as a deterrent against potential adversaries, contributing to a burgeoning literature debating the applicability of deterrence strategy in cyberspace (see Borghard and Lonergan 2023; Lilli 2021; Schneider 2019). Finally, further research could conduct a cross-cultural comparison to highlight differences among NATO states and examine how competitor states, such as Russia and China, guarantee their cyber-defense of CI in war. This is especially pertinent, as the CMR separation in such autocracies is less stark.\nIn conclusion, as one NATO senior military officer noted: How states provide for the defense of CI from cyberattacks that trigger and feature in war is “fundamentally a societal choice” (Participant 13, 2019). For now, the officer continued, “we are hoping and praying the private companies have their defenses in order” (Participant 13, 2019)."

NATO member states have recognized cyberspace as a new domain of war – one through which adversaries will target CI to both commence and prosecute conflict. Given this: How do NATO member state militaries understand their part in protecting civilian CI from cyberattacks that constitute casus belli? Drawing on original, empirical evidence – 31 interviews and 1 focus group with senior military, defense, and intelligence cyber experts from 12 NATO states – this article argues that militaries regard themselves as unable, unauthorized, and ill-suited to protect CI from cyberattacks that initiate or occur in war. Instead, NATO member states overwhelmingly rely on private corporations (notably their civilian employees) for the protection of CI – including in violent conflict. This article provides original, empirical evidence to confirm the claim that the theory of Civil-Military Relations (CMR) falters when applied to cyberspace. It also asks cutting normative questions attendant with private corporations being on the front line of cyber-defense during war and argues that cyberspace obfuscates the boundaries of modern-day conflicts. This forces a re-examination of the military's role in 21st century wars.\n# ARTICLE HISTORY\nReceived 11 May 2024\nAccepted 13 January 2025\n# KEYWORDS\nCyber; Civil-Military Relations; NATO; militaries; critical infrastructure\n# Introduction\nWithin liberal democratic states, war is premised on the strict delineation between the military and civilian domains. However, cyberattacks against privately owned and operated civilian critical infrastructure (CI) are challenging this traditional distinction. Understanding the protection of CI from cyberattacks that constitute casus belli within NATO states is especially pressing, as the livelihoods of 1 billion people across 31 countries are at stake (NATO 2023a). In 2014, NATO formally acknowledged that cyberattacks could be considered an armed attack and thus could trigger Article 5 (Collective Defense) of the NATO Charter (NATO 2014). Since 2016, the Alliance has recognized cyberspace as a domain of military operations in which it \"must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea\" (NATO 2016a).

Marxe School of Public and International Affairs, Baruch College, City University of New York (CUNY), 135 East 22nd St, New York, NY 10010, USA\n© 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group\naffirmed in 2021 that smaller cyberattacks could -- cumulatively -- amount to an armed attack (NATO 2021). More recently, the U.S. 2023 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy (U.S. DoD 2023, 7) notes: “U.S. adversaries regularly use malicious cyber activity to target our critical infrastructure. In crisis, they will seek to hinder U.S. military mobilization, sow chaos, and harm the American people.” This is because CI are the very “systems upon which modern society, economy, and polity are seen to depend” (CISA n.d.) and so the disruption or destruction of which would have severe consequences for national security. Indeed, as Haataja (2022, 425) notes, there is a pervasive “recognition of the potentially devastating impact that cyber operations on CI can have.”\nWhilst there has been significant development in mandatory regulation for private corporations regarding cyber-defense, the role of militaries in protecting civilian CI from cyberattacks that can trigger or occur in war has received very little empirical attention. This absence is curious, especially as the military is the traditional state organ tasked with defending the nation against external threats arising to the level of an armed attack.\nSuch a lacuna might be explained by the fact that the prevailing theoretical approach to the role of the military -- Civil--Military Relations (CMR) -- struggles to coherently account for cyberspace as a new “domain” of conflict. Cyberspace raises questions pertaining to the role of the military in 21st century conflicts, creating tensions between prevailing CMR assumptions and the new ways in which wars are fought. This is because “cyberspace pushes questions of traditional boundaries of sovereignty, as well as blurs lines between the civilian and security sector” (Lantis and Bloomberg 2018, 152). State-sponsored adversarial attacks in cyberspace even challenge the very notion of war itself (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022). As a result, there is a theoretical opacity in CMR regarding the military's duties in defending privately owned civilian CI from cyberattacks that both trigger and occur in war.\nGreater scholarly enquiry is therefore required to interrogate this theoretical muddiness inherent in cyber-CMR. Specifically, almost no empirical attention has been afforded to test whether this cyber-CMR tension is reflected in the military's own understanding of its role in cyber-defense of civilian CI. This article aims to fill this gap. It does so by drawing on 31 semi-structured interviews and 1 focus group with cyber experts from 12 NATO states to test this theoretical opacity. How do military cyber experts from NATO member states understand their role in defending critical infrastructure against cyberattacks? We find that -- unlike acts of aggression emanating from land, air, and sea -- NATO military members believe they can not, should not, and are not authorized to defend CI against cyberattacks that could constitute casus belli. Instead, despite recognizing that cyberattacks against CI could trigger or form part of “the next war”, NATO member states rely on private owners and operators for the provision and protection of CI. This finding is crucial, as it challenges preconceived notions of the military taking the lead in defending the state (including from cyberattacks) during war. Departing from the extant literature, the article then critically explores the practical and normative implications of having private corporations on the front line of cyber-defense of CI, and the military taking a backseat during (cyber)war.\nThe paper begins with an overview of the prevailing theoretical framework for understanding the role of the military in conflict -- CMR. This is crucial to make sense of how militaries understand their role in defending the nation in/through cyberspace. After a review of the article's methodology, we present the empirical data obtained from the\ninterviews. This is followed by a discussion of the findings, highlighting the problematic logic of the current dynamic, and a normative and practical consideration of whether the military ought to be more involved in cyber-defense of civilian CI. The conclusion summarizes the findings and scopes avenues for future research.\n## (Cyber) Civil--Military Relations\nCMR elucidates the relationship between the armed forces, the people, and the state's civilian authorities: it stresses civilian control over the military, defines what it means to be a professional soldier in a democratic society (Huntington 1957; Janowitz 1960), and identifies which items of the national security agenda fall to the military (Finer 1962; Huntington 1957). It is with this latter aspect of CMR with which we are principally concerned because it pertains to the role of the military in cyber operations, and in the protection of critical infrastructure. The consensus in the literature and in practice has been to try to maintain the separation between the military and civilians when it comes to critical infrastructure protection (CIP) (Pačka and Mareš 2021). However, the development of cyberspace challenges the foundational theoretical assumptions of CMR in three ways.\nFirst, cyberspace inherently blurs the traditional division between foreign and domestic theatres, which has authorization complexities for the military operating on home soil. One of the main tenets of CMR is that the military “does not generally operate or deploy domestically” (Rudesill 2021, 247--248). As a result, the focus of the military (acting on behalf and at the behest of the civilian government) has been on defending against physical, foreign threats. Yet, this view has been somewhat altered since the collapse of the Soviet Union, when the new threat environment drew to the fore a more diverse set of security imperatives. Non-traditional security threats, such as terrorism, civil conflicts, pandemics, and natural disasters, have “compelled a world-wide re-thinking of the roles and missions of armed forces” within the CMR literature (Diamond, and Plattner 1996, x). “[V]irtually everywhere”, Bruneau and Matei (2012, 2) contend, “militaries and other security instruments are taking on new roles and missions”, such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR).\nThe changing character of national security forces militaries to adapt to a wider array of missions and to develop a broader purpose. But the military's focus largely remains on providing security from physical, external threats (Goodman 1996). In the 21st century, technological transformations altered the character of security and war yet again, forcing scholars to question whether CMR needs to be adjusted to protect states in “non-traditional battlefields,” notably cyberspace and outerspace. The boundaries between domestic and external security threats became increasingly obscured by transnational digital information systems (Rudesill 2021).\nAn important implication of this reality for CMR is a change of the main locus of military operations: “soldiers operating on the home front” might come to be seen as the rule rather than the exception (Rudesill 2021, 248). As put by Burton (2015, 302), cyberattacks “occur over a globally linked network of computer systems and can be launched without warning, in milliseconds, from anywhere on the planet.” Cyberspace, he argues, creates a new challenge for security organizations like NATO, which has “traditionally focused on geographically\nproximate security threats” (Burton 2015, 302). This brought others to argue that soldiers will be securing networks and countering intrusions against critical infrastructure (Jensen and Work 2018). The nature of transnational cyber threats, therefore, has important implications for the future role of the military, urging states to reconsider whether a physical, territorial distinction -- a separation between domestic and foreign theatres of operations -- is justified (or indeed even possible) in cyberspace.\nSecond, cyberspace challenges CMR's clear distinction between civilian and military domains because the cyberspace environment is inherently different from that of traditional, physical domains of war (land, air, and sea). As such, the traditional CMR boundaries between military and civilian spheres have become increasingly hazy. Pačka and Mareš (2021, 437) note: “In a common national security and defense ecosystem, the roles of players such as an army, police, intelligence agency, and others are set clearly and there is an evident division of labor ... cyberspace constantly changes the boundaries.” Cyberspace is “blurring the lines between the traditional expertise of the uniformed military and the roles and responsibilities of civilians” (Beehner, Brooks, and Maurer 2021, 5). This is especially the case because aggressions in cyberspace often target civilian persons or infrastructure (Sewall 2021).\nAs militaries become more involved in the cyber domain, they will inevitably conduct their operations over “international and domestic computer infrastructure that supports the dense lattice of digital-age civilian life” (Rudesill 2021, 248). As Sharpe, Trichas, and Terrill (2024, 5) note, “recognition of ... cyberspace as a critical domain ... represents a paradigm shift in military strategy.” Further distorting the distinction between civilian and military spheres is the fact that technological infrastructure is often dual-use and that militaries rely increasingly on civilian networks for their own operations (Fasana 2018). Consensus amongst CMR scholars seems to be that the uniqueness of the cyber domain requires “unorthodox” and innovative approaches to the organization of security and defense (Kallberg and Cook 2017, 8130), challenging, in the words of Brooks (2016, 359), existing “walls” between civilians and the military. As summarized by Chayes (2015, 187): “Civil and military roles are not easily sorted out in the area of cyberattacks and cyber warfare.”\nThird, cyberspace forces a revision not only of what it means to fight wars and of who is involved in warfighting but of the delineation between war and peace itself (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022; Sewall 2021). Constant contact and interconnectedness are key features of cyberspace, favoring initiative and pre-emption over passivity and reactive defense, meaning that states are incentivized to persistently exploit adversary vulnerabilities in order to gain and maintain the advantage (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022). This challenges the dominant Western understanding of war, premised on “use of force” and “armed attack” as the crossing of what is usually considered to be the boundary between war and peace. Unlike with conventional warfare, there is seemingly no strict division between war and peace in cyberspace. States are in a constant state of competition. NATO holds the view that “cyberspace is contested at all times” (NATO 2022). Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett (2022, 123) argue that this requires a paradigm shift in policy and strategy planning, one that would focus on an “increased tempo” of cyber military operations outside their own network, and continuous preparation and execution of cyber campaigns.\nAs the complexities of cyberspace are challenging the long-held clear division between war and peace, by extension, the clear separation between civilian and military spheres is also contested. Is there a need for “an increased tempo” of cyber military operations not only outside the defense's network but outside the unique context of war? That the military might play a role outside of warfighting is not new to cyberspace, as discussed above, and so it is justified to address the challenge of continuous competition in cyberspace and activities occurring in this space between peace and war.\nThe question that then flows from this is whether it matters at all when a cyberattack against CI reaches the threshold of an armed attack and triggers Article 5, especially with regards to the roles and responsibilities of cyber-defense. Surely, it does matter, because -- traditionally -- if states are at war, different agents become responsible for action (namely, the military). Yet in cyberspace, this does not seem to be the case, with this responsibility being entrusted to private actors even during conflict. Instead, it seems that the dissolution of the war-peace continuum in cyberspace is making it difficult for states to identify the appropriate response to cyberattacks against the nation's CI, both during the crisis phase, before Article 5 is invoked, and during war. It is with these kinds of cyberattacks, that could constitute casus belli or occur in war, that this article is concerned.\nOwing to these complexities, it is unclear “whether civil-military relations are sufficiently calibrated to protect ... in these non-traditional battlefields” where “warfare encompass[es] ... less-understood cyber-tools” (Beehner, Brooks, and Maurer 2021, 3). The foundational assumptions built into CMR paradigmatically accept that the military's role is in defending against physical, external threats, focused within war time and is wedded to the distinction between civilian and military responsibilities. But, as others have noted, cyberspace generates theoretical tensions regarding the applicability of these three a priori accepted precepts.\n## Research design and methodology: NATO case study\nIf cyberattacks on CI will inevitably feature in 21st century conflicts, then it is urgent to understand if and how the military, as the institution responsible for warfighting and defense on behalf of the state, understands its role. In other words, it is of paramount importance to test whether existing theoretical tensions are reflected empirically -- by going straight to the source. The justification for casing our study to NATO is because the alliance represents a significant proportion of the global population and serves as a key exemplar of dominant Western perspectives.\nWe conducted 31 semi-structured interviews with military and defense cyber subject matter experts (SMEs) from 12 NATO member states, and 1 focus group of 7 military cyber experts. Representatives from Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Estonia, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US) participated in the research. These countries were chosen based on access (at the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Tallinn and at the NATO Headquarters in Brussels) and expertise within the NATO alliance regarding cyber-defense, including states that are technologically advanced and at the forefront of cyber affairs in practice, and others that are not as well positioned. Among NATO states, cyber-defense of CI is a national responsibility and as such, strategies vary across nations but clear similarities can be found. This illustrates that regardless of a state's level of\n“cyber-awareness,” most NATO members share similar views on the role of the military regarding the cyber-defense of CI. It also illuminates an apparent disconnect between traditional CMR assumptions regarding the role of the military in territorial defense against external threats and current military perceptions across NATO states. It is also important to note that cyber-offense has its own very specific construct -- Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies (SCEPVA) -- which we do not explore in this paper.\nBy “cyber subject matter experts” we mean military members (officers and enlisted) and civilians (policy advisors) working for defense ministries and at the NATO Headquarters, whose principal occupation is with matters of cyberspace -- both offense and defense. The interview participants included senior military officials (including two-star generals) and cyber experts and lawyers from the military and other government departments (including ministries of defense and intelligence agencies) from NATO member states.\nInterviewees were assured that their views would not be taken as representative of NATO or their “home” state, military, or department, and that their identity would be anonymized. Accordingly, quotes have not been assigned to specific roles or states in order to mitigate the risks associated with attribution, particularly those arising from cross-referencing. The goal of conducting these interviews was not to examine differences in cultural approaches across NATO members, although this would be a valuable future study.\nA note on limitations. One limitation pertaining to the approach of this research is that, by focusing on military perspectives only, the research excludes other crucial stakeholders such as private-sector partners and other public agencies like police, local cyber task forces and computer emergency response teams (CERTS). Notably, we do not examine what the private owners and operators of CI (CEOs and/or employees) consider as the appropriate role of the military in cyber-defense. This question, albeit important, requires a separate, substantive future investigation -- one that, due to space constraints, we could not explore here. Instead, our interest lies with understanding the military's role in defending the nation against cyberattacks, a question that is best answered by those working in defense who are across the current military cyber posture. That said, the participants also included representatives from intelligence agencies, who work closely with their military counterparts and who have important responsibilities in both cyber-offense and cyber-defense in many countries. These interviewees were well placed to differentiate the role of the military and that of intelligence agencies in responding to a cyber event, confirming some issues raised by defense interviewees in terms of cyber-CMR.\n## NATO militaries' perceptions of cyber-defense of CI\nIn the words of the interviewees, the purpose of the military is to “serve, protect, and defend” the state and the population against foreign aggression. However, when asked how the military discharges this responsibility to protect citizens from adversarial cyberattacks on CI either triggering or happening in war, all of the interviewees stated that the military was ill-suited or ill-prepared to intervene, even in the case where it might be asked to do so. We also found that, despite cyberspace being recognized as a domain of\nmilitary operations, military members' understanding of their role reflects the complexities of the cyber war-peace continuum. Three recurring narratives emerged from the interviewees when describing the limits of their role. Each chime with the three tensions articulated in cyber-CMR above: the uniqueness of the domain, the blurring of foreign/domestic theaters, and what this means for understanding war. To begin, however, we survey how militaries presently engage in cyber-defense of CI.\n### Defending forward, persistent engagement, and integrated deterrence\nNATO member militaries are engaged in collecting, analyzing, and exchanging intelligence with other government agencies, the private sector, and NATO allies (U.S. DoD 2023). Information collection and sharing is considered an integral aspect of cyber-defense (NATO 2016b, U.S. DoD 2023). When private corporations identify a threat in their system and pass that information along to government agencies, such public agencies then make recommendations regarding how the private companies ought to rectify the vulnerability and voluntarily assist in that process (which, in many instances, can be declined by the corporation). Yet, importantly (for reasons we explore below), according to one of our interviewees: “the government won't go into anyone's systems: they have a coordination role, but otherwise it's hands off the keyboard” (Participant 18, 2019).\nMoreover, NATO state militaries are authorized (and indeed required) to take proactive measures to ensure the cybersecurity of their own military systems -- principally to ensure continued operability across the traditional, physical domains of armed conflict. The desire to enhance the cyber resilience of the Alliance was reiterated at the 2023 Vilnius Summit (NATO 2023b). As a senior military officer explained, however, “the primary concern of the military is to ensure our cyber systems are working so we can do kinetic defense: the military has a monopoly on kinetic defense, not cyber” (Participant 12, 2019).\nA few of the interviewees stated that the military is engaged in what has long been understood as “active defense:” “defensive operations that involve direct engagement with sophisticated adversaries in DoD-controlled cyberspace” (DARPA 2012). The U.S. in particular has employed the notion of “defending forward” (Healey 2019; Kosseff et al. 2019) which aims to pre-emptively “stop threats before they reach their targets” (U.S. Department of Defense 2018, 2) and which was developed in response to criticisms that the military was not proactively defending critical infrastructure against cyberattacks (Former US Cyber Command official, personal communication with author, 2020). “Defending forward,” “active defense,” and “persistent engagement” were born out of the recognition that the U.S. could not expect private corporations to defend themselves against the full power of an adversarial state. Both approaches form part of what the U.S. now regards as “integrated deterrence,” developed in the most recent DoD Cyber Strategy (2023, 2), which focuses on using military cyber capabilities “in concert with other instruments of national power.”\nFurther still, the military would likely be the apparatus called upon by the state in the “response” phase of a devastating cyberattack (Participants 8, 14, 16, 22). The military would be responsible for launching a cyber or kinetic counter-offensive, following appropriate attribution processes (proportionality, necessity, and distinction factors\nconsidered). But such responses are necessarily ex post facto. As was expressed in the focus group (2019): “Reacting after the fact is a losing strategy.” Until then, the front line of defense -- with public sector support, especially intelligence agencies -- is the private corporations.\n### The effectiveness narrative: can not\nPreviously, it has been thought that -- in the context of NATO and specifically the U.S. -- the resources and expertise on cyber-defense and cyberwar was retained by the military (Burton 2015; O'Connell 2012). Our empirical evidence finds the opposite to be the case. Most of the interviewees argued that their respective militaries currently lack the necessary resources, human-power, and relevant expertise required to effectively defend CI from cyberattacks. As a result, the interviewees consistently highlighted that, due to the nature of the domain, the military is unable to protect civilian CI from cyberattacks -- even those that can trigger or occur in war. One interviewee compared this lack of cyber capability with traditional, kinetic attacks: “The military is the only institution or organization to defend against armed attacks, because they're the only ones who have fighter planes. But in a cyberattack, Cyber Command won't be first [to respond], because they don't have the capability” (Participant 19, 2019). Another senior military officer (Participant 3, 2019) reflected that attention ought to be focused on pragmatically determining which organization is likely to be most successful in providing cyber-defense: “It's about having the right tools, and the right knowledge ... the military might not be best placed to defend certain infrastructure.” For instance, interviewees rightly pointed out that in many countries intelligence agencies play a significant role in the cyber-defense of the nation and its critical infrastructure, notably by advising and assisting other government agencies and the private sector (see for instance GCHQ n.d.; Government of Canada n.d.).\nA few interviewees also noted that because the private corporations that own and operate CI use different and often “tailor-made” platforms, it would be almost impossible for cyber experts in the military to be sufficiently knowledgeable to defend across all the different systems. It is “unimaginable” for the military to help, one interviewee reflected, “because they are completely unfamiliar with the systems” (Participant 9, 2019).\nSome of the interviewees argued that it would be financially ineffective or even prohibitively expensive to have the military provide cyber-defense for CI: it is “better to let the private sector deal with it,” because having the government provide the cyber-defense for critical infrastructure would be “implausible and expensive” (Participant 12, 2019). “Private corporations should be responsible,” one interviewee stated, “otherwise there would be a lot of taxpayers' money required to provide [protection for] those systems -- like a ‘cybersecurity tax' for providing cyber-defense of critical infrastructure” (Participant 9, 2019). The interviewees' perception echoes the sentiment highlighted in the literature on critical infrastructure protection that private owners are best placed to establish cyber-defenses (Carr 2016; Dunn Cavelty and Suter 2009; Newlove-Eriksson, Giacomello, and Eriksson 2018; Pačka and Mareš 2021).\nThe environment narrative: should not\nWhen discussing why the military does not play a greater role in protecting CI from cyberattacks -- as they would if the “armed attack” was emanating from other domains of war -- the interviewees stated that this is because “cyberspace is fundamentally different” (Participant 15, 2019). The participants overwhelmingly referred to cyberspace's ubiquitous, borderless, fluid, and invisible nature. The interviewees emphasized the relatively abstract characteristics of cyberspace identified in the literature (Barnard-Wills and Ashenden 2012; Branch 2021; Mainwaring 2020; Wright 2018) as affecting the military's ability to help defend. One government official simply stated: “cyber is a different domain; we haven't figured out how it works” (Participant 22, 2019). Another interviewee reflected: “In cyber, the fog of war is heightened” (Participant 11, 2019). Interviewees also referred to the difficulty of determining whether sovereignty is applicable to cyberspace and where borders might begin and end, thereby touching on the ongoing debate between NATO member states about whether sovereignty is applicable to cyberspace.\nIn most instances, the interviewees' reference to sovereignty was intended to highlight that, unlike in sea, air, and land -- which have clear, physical borders that can be transgressed -- cyberspace has no such border. The interviewees often highlighted the difficulty of defending against cyberattacks by comparing cyberspace with the physical domains of warfighting: “You can see equipment like frigates and airplanes,” one interviewee noted, “but you can't see firewalls or malicious code” (Focus group 2019).\nA majority of interviewees also argued that the military does not have a significant role in defending CI from cyberattacks that could trigger war or happen in war because -- again, in contrast to the physical domain -- it is an “unchartered territory” and so “the line between government and private” is “blurred” (Participants 16, 18 and 26, 2019). A few interviewees drew parallels with the other services, claiming that “we've had an army, navy, and air force for a long time, but cyberspace is new” (Participant 13, 2019). These comments are reminiscent of the remarks made by Lt. Col. Kurt Sanger, Chief Judge Advocate for National Security Law at U.S. Cyber Command at the 2019 CyCon U.S: “For most of the domains, you have thousands of years and millions of warriors contributing to the lessons that you're now learning ... We don't have that in cyberspace” (Sanger 2019, quoted in Pomerleau 2019). In short, cyberspace itself was thought by the interviewees as an inherently exposed space, with points of vulnerabilities too vast to comprehend. As one officer put it, “cyberspace is un-defendable” (Participant 12, 2019). These responses align with what Cate (2015, 307) identifies as the prevailing “sense of despair about the size and complexity of the challenge.”\nOur empirical evidence highlights that the military believes it should not play a significant role in defending CI. In doing so, it thereby supports the extant theoretical claim that cyberspace distorts the lines between the domestic vs. foreign spheres and forces an alteration of traditional territorial and sovereign conceptions of defense. This further illustrates the dissolution of the traditional division between civilian and military sectors in CMR due to the unprecedented nature of the domain.\nThe authorization narrative: not permitted\nThe last narrative that emerged from the interviewees' responses is that of “authorization.” A third of the interviewees noted that the military is not permitted to operate on domestic soil. Typically, within NATO states, the military is not automatically authorized to conduct what are considered police enforcement duties: for instance, the U.S. Posse Comitatus Act, signed in 1878, is designed to prohibit the deployment of the military to enforce domestic civilian policies and practices “unless expressly authorized by the Constitution or an act of Congress” (Congressional Research Service 2018). It seems that this is what most of the interviewees were referring to when raising concerns regarding “authorization.” Many participants explained that this is a “design reality” of the democratic system, which means that states are constrained and restrained by their legal environment (Participants 1, 2 and 13, 2019). As one interviewee articulated, “the legislation is not adjusted for the realities of cyberspace” (Participant 7, 2019), while another reflected, “if we want to live in a liberal, democratic society, this is what we get” (Participant 17, 2019).\nSome interviewees highlighted that the military would be called upon, by the state, to operate in the territory of that sovereign state in the instance that there is an actual use of physical force against the state. As one interviewee explained: “Obviously if our ‘friends' in the East rolled tanks across the border right now, our forces would be authorized to act in the state to repel that assault. It wouldn't be the police's job” (Participant 15, 2019).\nAdditionally, a few interviewees raised concerns regarding privacy as a barrier to greater military involvement. One military officer noted that: “[People] are OK that we have ships, border patrol, flight deterrence ... But with cyber, people don't want the government to look into their Internet connectivity” (Participant 18, 2019). Overall, the interviewees consistently stated that the military would be called upon to protect the sovereign state from a land invasion, naval assault, or airborne missile strike against CI -- but this would not be the case regarding a comparable assault emanating from cyberspace.\nThe three narratives empirically confirm the tension highlighted in the literature on cyber-CMR. It further resonates with the 2023 U.S. Cyber Strategy that the Department of Defense “lacks the authority to employ military forces to defend private companies against cyberattacks” and that there are “limited circumstances in which military cyber forces would be asked to defend civilian critical infrastructure -- the Department will not posture itself to defend every private sector network” (U.S. DoD 2023, 13). In short, NATO member militaries do not believe they play a major role in cyber-defense of CI that initiates or occurs amidst war due to environment, effectiveness, and authorization complexities. As one interviewee noted: “There is a contradiction between the fear of cyberattacks, [and the fact that] we [the people] ... don't want the military to play a bigger role” (Participant 18, 2019).\n## Critical discussion of the military perspective\nThere are three key findings that arise from the empirical evidence. First: the military members affirm the perception of the blurred nature of cyber-CMR described above. Second: the minimal military involvement raises urgent questions regarding CI that will\nbe targeted in war. Third: while regulations have improved in the past few years, it is the private corporations that are principally responsible for protecting CI from sophisticated state-sponsored cyberattacks during war. These findings invite a re-examination of the role of the military in 21st century conflicts.\n### A reflection of political will and political choices\nOne of the explanations invoked by the interviewees for why the military is not more involved in the cyber-defense of CI is because the military currently lacks the financial and human resources to do so (the effectiveness narrative). Some might claim that it is unreasonable to reassign some military funding for cyber-defense of CI in the face of “defense austerity” -- although in the U.S. this notion is debatable, as the proposed 2024 budget for the entire DoD totaled $842 billion (Congressional Budget Office 2023). One interviewee argued that this objection is misplaced, as taking proactive security measures prior to an “inevitable cyberattack against critical infrastructure” is a more fiscally responsible decision from the outset (Participant 4, 2019).\nFunds already allocated to the acquisition of traditional kinetic weapons could (again, hypothetically) be redirected toward: the military's development of defensive cyber technologies for CI, the recruitment of more military cyber personnel, and the expansion and implementation of CIP military training programs. Other interviewees instead reiterated an absence of political will for states to invest highly in something as intangible as cybersecurity: “Guns and tanks and fighter jets are sexier. They're sexier and easier for politicians to show off for their next election campaign, that they're doing something for national security ... [They're] not really able to show off lines of code” (Focus group, 2019).\nAside from the fiscal element is the ostensible “novelty” and “unknowable-ness” of cyberspace as to why they “should not” be involved in defense of CI (the environment narrative). Confusion surrounding cyberspace's distinct character is something that is debated in the literature (Bringsjord and Licato 2015). Nonetheless, there is a risk of “succumbing to the shock of the new” (Betz and Stevens 2011, 87). Erroneously perceiving the form of a domain as inherently enigmatic stymies progress toward establishing effective defense systems. Considering other “newer” domains of war, one interviewee compared cyberspace to the air force: no “historical accident ... the air force was born out of the need for defense from attacks in airspace in the 20th century” (Participant 28, 2019). It is a political choice to allocate the main face of defense in war to private corporations.\nMoreover, whilst the military is prima facie prohibited from operating on domestic soil, the authorization narrative should be interrogated further. Indeed, the military could -- and would -- be called upon by the state to operate in its sovereign territory if there is an actual use of physical force tantamount to an armed attack. In the face of cyberattacks that do reach the level of an armed attack and that could trigger NATO's Article 5, conceivably, the military would be authorized to get involved in the cyber-defense of civilian CI systems. Theoretically at least, cyber aggressions comparable to armed attacks do not pose a significantly new challenge for civil--military relations. Nonetheless, the research finds that even with this kind of attack that could constitute casus belli, or occur during war, uncertainty remains within the military regarding the\nextent to which they would be authorized (or able) to get involved in the cyber-defense of private networks. Even when faced with cyberattacks that would amount to an armed attack, or during war, the military would not be able to effectively help defend CI. The militaries' current (and limited) ability and expectation to provide cyber-defense of CI is a political calculation. One defense personnel reflected: “I feel that there is a growing need for more cyber units in the military, and since cyber has now been recognized as a proper domain of armed conflict on par with air, land, sea and in some cases also space, I think it will happen ... It is just a question of how it will evolve, and through which means. (Participant 16, 2019)”\nNevertheless, according to the interviewees, this is likely only after some “catastrophic” cyberattack on CI (Participants 8 and 29, 2019). The current decision to rely heavily on private corporations, albeit with mandatory reporting and compliance mechanisms, is a political choice.\n### Concerns surrounding “dual-use” infrastructures\nA further implication of minimal military involvement is how to deal with “dual-use” CI. Civilian CI has been and will continue to be targeted by adversarial actors as part of war (Wallace and Reeves 2020). One interviewee stated: “There is no such thing as a ‘military' cyberattack; 90% of the time it will be against civilian infrastructure” (Participant 22, 2019). According to another: “Adversaries will -- and already do -- attack critical infrastructure as a primary target via cyberspace, because it's what we would do” (Participant 7, 2019). States will likely seek to disable CI in war in order to gain a military advantage.\nAs per international cyber norms regarding responsible state behavior, there is a prohibition of “cyber operations that cause intentional damage or impairment to critical infrastructure (CI)” (Haataja 2022, 423). CI should be -- in the words of then U.S. President Joe Biden -- “‘off limits' to attack” (cited in Haataja 2022, 425). Of course, only military objects and combatants are liable to be lawfully targeted in war; according to the International Humanitarian Law (IHL) principle of distinction, intentionally targeting civilians and civilian CI (including via cyber) is prohibited (ICRC 2023). Nevertheless, the urgency of preparing the military to contribute to the defense of CI is even more apparent given the potential for civilian CI to be rendered a liable military objective. This is because civilian CI can: i) become co-opted for military purposes, ii) have a “military utility,” or iii) be “dual-use” (Schmitt 2017, 128--135).\nThere are three concerns raised here. First, if (privately owned) CI networks become “dual-use” or are of “military utility,” they become military objectives and thus may be lawfully targeted. As Horowitz (2024, 327) notes: a “privately owned civilian aviation air traffic control tower that the enemy military temporarily uses to enable offensive operations” might be rendered a military objective “because of its ‘use.'” Moreover, according to the Tallinn Manual 2.0: if critical infrastructure is being used by both civilian and military ends, and it is “impossible” to differentiate between the civilian and military parts of a system, “the entire network ... qualifies as a military objective” (Schmitt 2017, 135).\nSecond, because of the invisible nature of cyberspace, it is additionally challenging to differentiate between civilian vs. military cyber infrastructures. As such, there is\nforeseeably a large scope for misinterpretation and accidental military targeting of CI. Third, it is unclear whether preparatory acts on “dual-use” infrastructures during peacetime -- such as the insertion of dormant malware -- constitutes an attack or strictly cyber-espionage. Haataja (2022, 424, 428) highlights that there is a danger for pre-positioned adversarial code in CI that could be activated later, a practice known as “persistent presence” in CI. Simply planting malware or creating “backdoors” certainly violates international cyber norms and could be considered a breach of a state's obligation under international law (others consider such cyber norms “voluntary, non-binding”) (Haataja 2022, 428--31). But such cyber-operations themselves are unlikely to rise to the level of an armed attack. Activating a dormant malware in a privately owned CI, such as a nuclear powerplant, causing it to explode, would foreseeably reach that threshold. All of this points to the complexity of defending CI from cyberattacks that constitute casus belli or may be pursued in war.\n### A degree of (risky) faith in the private sector\nPrivate corporations that own and operate CI ought to provide appropriate cyber-defensive measures -- especially to protect what one interviewee called “low-hanging fruits” (Participant 3, 2019). Nonetheless, as one interviewee noted: “We can't expect private companies to protect themselves against state-sponsored attacks” (Participant 23, 2019). Many interviewees expressed having “faith” in private corporations adhering to proper standards and regulations: “We hope they [the private corporations] do the right thing” (Participant 8, 2019).\nUsing the physical domain as an analogy, the private owners of a power grid would be expected to employ a reasonable degree of security -- locking doors, installing surveillance cameras, erecting wire fences, and employing security guards, and so on. However, the security guard would not be expected to defend against an attack that rises to a use of force tantamount with war. Defense from in-coming ballistic missiles would fall to the state and -- foreseeably -- the air force: “In the physical world, we don't require companies to have an air force, or submarines, or to really look at the pointy end of an attack” (Hanson 2021).\nYet whilst companies have oversight, assistance, and mandatory regulations from government, the front line of defense in cyberspace remains the purview of companies. It is often in their profit margins interests to ensure their cyber-defenses are in order, and to work closely and collaboratively with government agencies to redress vulnerabilities or incursions. Beyond purely monetary interests, corporations could be appealed to do so on the notion of “loyalty” (Christensen and Petersen 2017, 1440). They may be incentivized to effectively participate in the provision of cyber-defense based on “a moral commitment to ‘solidarity' and ‘community responsibility'” (Christensen and Petersen 2017, 1440). One senior government official iterated this patriotic duty to “protect our lifestyle” (Participant 22, 2019). For instance, when asked about who is defending Ukrainian CI from Russian cyberattacks, one retired general responded: “The private corporations in Ukraine are doing an excellent job” (General [retd.], personal communication with author, 2022). Similarly, Matania and Sommer (2023, 3) note that “Tech Titans” (Google,\nMicrosoft, Meta, Apple, SpaceX and Amazon) are playing a meaningful role in the armed conflict in Ukraine.\nThat said, as one interviewee reflected: “appealing towards companies' patriotism ... is probably not the safest way to do things” (Participant 13, 2019). Even if a private corporation is “homegrown,” it does not guarantee that they are, in fact, patriotic. “Company Over Country” was Meta CEO and Founder Mark Zuckerberg's early motto (Losse 2018). Similarly, the whistle blower Haugen (2021, 2) iterated that -- when torn between “its own profits and [the U.S.'] safety,” Meta “consistently ... favor[ed] its own profits.” This demonstrates that American-owned corporations have prioritized financial gains over that of the security of the American people. Such a dynamic becomes even more problematic if CI corporations in NATO member states are outsourced and owned by foreign corporations.\nPerhaps “profits before patriotism” is strictly a feature of peacetime: once it comes to war, the dynamic will flip. For instance, by May 2022 Google had pledged approximately $55 million in support of Ukraine's resistance of Russian aggression (Matania and Sommer 2023, 11). Similarly, within days of the full-scale invasion, Microsoft moved Ukraine's critical government data to its cloud storage platform (Microsoft 2022). This was because most of the data was “extremely vulnerable to missile attacks, and their physical destruction could paralyze the entire work of the country's top leadership” (Microsoft 2023).\nYet the view that corporations would be driven by patriotism (or, more accurately, defense of liberal values) over profit hinges on two, risky assumptions. In the first instance, it takes for granted that the CI private corporation heralds from, or is ideologically aligned with, the country under (cyber)attack -- which is not necessarily always the case. It supposes the private corporation may not be under pressure from the attacking-state or wishes to remain neutral, or had been convinced to allow the attack to take place (due to corruption, coercion, or ideological leanings). There is no guarantee for support. There is no expectation for patriotism even from corporations that are (for lack of a better word) “home grown.”\nIn the second instance, it is also not clear how long “patriotic” support or commitment to democratic liberal ideals -- even if it is forthcoming -- might last. While Elon Musk's SpaceX initially sent Starlink satellites to the Ukrainian military for free, it eventually stated it could no longer foot the bill, and the Pentagon had to pick up the tab -- once the reliance on Musk's service had been firmly established (conceivably with an agenda to accrue profits). Moreover, demonstrating the selectivity of private sector support, when the Ukrainian military conducted an offensive into the Russian-held Crimea, they begged Elon Musk to turn on its satellite service in the Russian-controlled area, but he refused to do so because (according to his post on X) he feared SpaceX's complicity in “a major act of war and conflict escalation” (Musk 2023). Betting on private corporations' patriotism and political alliances or appetite for war, over that of their foundational and raison d'être interests in profit, is to gamble with national (cyber) defense. If there is a profit to be made, corporations might choose to get involved in conflicts (even distant ones), but they might stop to be involved when it is no longer financially advisable.\nOur empirical data suggests that -- unlike kinetic acts of war emanating in land, air, and sea -- the military is not responsible for defending against state-sponsored acts of\naggression against CI via cyberspace. However, trusting private corporations to adequately defend against cyberattacks in war is a risky security strategy.\n## Should militaries be more involved? Normative and practical considerations\nAs detailed in the previous section, multiple interviewees remarked on the risks associated with dual-use infrastructure and with being overly reliant on private corporations to provide cyber-defense of CI. Relatedly, some participants expressed concerns about not being readied and resourced to defend CI against cyberattacks. This prompts the question: might there be a case for increasing military involvement in cyber-defense of CI? After all, the military is the principal body responsible for defending civilians (on behalf of the state) from acts of aggression rising to war. Former NATO Deputy Secretary General Rose Gottemoeller et al. (2022) expressed the need for NATO Allies to be better prepared in response to cyberattacks. This requirement is especially pertinent, as Burton (2015, 302) remarks, “cyber operations are increasingly part of [conflicts involving NATO forces] and an element of the strategy of NATO's main state adversaries.” To be clear, we are not in any way suggesting a “military-takes-all,” zero-sum approach to defending CI from cyberattacks that trigger Article 5. The normative question is whether militaries should be readied -- as a last line of defense -- to help protect alongside private corporations and public bodies (such as intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and federal and local cyber task forces).\nOne objection to greater military involvement is the potential for escalation. A cyber-defensive operation led by the military could be perceived by an adversary as a cyber countermeasure, resulting in a “tit-for-tat escalation of cyberattacks and responses, each one more serious than the last” (Hollis and Ohlin 2018, 448). An increased role of the military in providing cyber-defense of CI may therefore lead to “a permissive normative-legal environment in which states are more likely than before to resort to uses of force” (Heinze and Neilsen 2020, 186).\nA related normative concern is that the increased role of the military in cyber-defense of CI begets the militarization of cyberspace. The perception of the military being involved in a civilian network, even for strictly defensive purposes, may render it a military target. But simply because the military may be called upon, as a last resort, to aid in the cyber-defense of CI does not render the civilian objective ipso facto a military target. In the same way that the military might be called upon to help defend a hospital (for instance) from kinetic attacks, the military presence does not automatically render the hospital a liable military objective.\nAnother further objection might be that introducing the military as an agent of cyber-defense of CI risks increasing the potential for abuse -- notably, through mass militarized surveillance or the military placing pressure on private corporations to act in certain ways. Relatedly, there may be normative concerns regarding competing authorities -- an unnecessary duplication of responsibilities and confusion over which entity precisely (the private organization vs. intelligence agency vs. the military) acts in what contexts. Within the extant literature, Public--Private Partnerships in CI protection are already regarded as notoriously fraught with complications pertaining to cooperation, information sharing, and trust (Carr 2016; Dunn Cavelty and Suter 2009). For instance, one interviewee noted that -- on the issue of information sharing of breaches -- “private companies won't ‘sho\ntheir hand' ... they would rather sell the intelligence than give it away for free” (Participant 9, 2019). Surely adding another agent into the mix will make cyber-defense more complex.\nA reply to these two objections is that the military should only get involved when: i) the private entity is unable or unwilling to respond, ii) that the aid of the existing public agencies is insufficient, or iii) that the cyberattack would (through its scale and effects) constitute an armed attack. What should be envisaged is a live, cooperative triage system, whereby the military might be deployed only to help defend CI, should the attack foreseeably trigger war or take place in war, or if other responders have failed to address the threat and require additional assistance.\nOne further objection is that increasing military involvement generates a moral hazard for the private sector. Specifically, if the military is offering a pseudo-“security umbrella,” private corporations may be disincentivized to invest in necessary cybersecurity measures and instead increase their risk tolerance (as per prospect theory). Cybersecurity is costly and time-consuming; saving on cybersecurity would likely increase corporations' profits, and energy and resources could be redirected to other parts of business.\nHowever, there are several considerations that would foreseeably mitigate this moral hazard. Corporations risk extreme reputational damage and services by relying too heavily on possible military defense: corporations must still provide adequate levels of cybersecurity that sufficiently defend against the vast majority of cyberattacks, which are criminal or low-level intrusions. Further, corporations would rather deal with cyber-defense issues in house and (as our interviewees noted) are wary about freely “opening the doors” to the military. These are serious objections to increasing military involvement. But it is also pertinent to examine the normative implications if states do not increase military involvement.\nFirst, the existing requirement for private corporations to be on the “front line” of cyber-defense of CI means demanding that civilians be responsible for defending against disastrous acts of (cyber)war. Even if they are not explicitly conscripted (more on this below) it is the civilian employees of those private sectors who nonetheless currently shoulder national cybersecurity duties. “Like the soldiers in the fortress,” Brenner and Clarke (emphasis added, 2010, 1032) reflect, “computer personnel confronting a cyberattack are responsible for defending their ‘territory' from hostile activity.”\nThis blurring of civilian and military spheres -- the expectation of civilians in corporations to not only contribute to but bear the weight of defending the state from cyber-attacks in war -- opens Pandora's box regarding pressing legal, normative, and practical questions. Is the expectation to participate in cyber-defense during war articulated in the employees' contracts? Are these civilian employees permitted to excuse themselves, or conscientiously object to participating in war, or will they be forced to fight, albeit with code over cobalt? Are employees aware of this possibility as part of their day job? If civilian operators on the cyber front-line “abandon their posts” -- literally removing hands from keyboards -- should they be court-martialed?\nWorse still: What if individual civilians, unbeknownst to their corporate managers, sympathize with the aggressor state, or have been compromised by the aggressor (via blackmail, bribery, or disinformation)? This may lead employees to feign cyber-defense and even aid the cyberattacker. Indeed, one of the interviewees worried that “moles are already there in the private sector,” and that such “moles” may be feeding\nsensitive information to adversaries, or even disrupting the systems on behalf of a foreign state (Participant 15, 2019). After all, these privately employed civilians (unlike military personnel) have not pledged allegiance to their (respective) flags. Even if the corporation leadership is patriotic, how can we be sure of the political allegiances of its civilian employees, especially as many are unlikely to have undergone security checks? If private corporations are “fighting” in war, might such corporations (or their CEOs, like Musk, or individual civilian operators) be tempted to aggressively hack-back?\nFurthermore, at what point does a civilian (both based in and, crucially, outside the country waging war) become a direct participant in hostilities and become a liable target for cyber and kinetic strikes under IHL? Horowitz (2024, 322) remarks that -- following an “expansive interpretation of the temporal element of [direct participation in hostilities (DPH)]” under IHL -- “a tech company employee who engages in DPH,” including strictly cyber-defense, “even if only infrequently during a work week from their office, might lose protection from attack not only while they engage in those specific acts of DPH but also continuously from morning to night and at home for an extended period of time.” Even if a narrow view of the temporal aspect of DPH is adopted -- wherein a civilian may only be targeted “for such time” that she is actively contributing to military activity via cyber-defense -- this dynamic creates a “revolving door” for civilians “who repeatedly engage in DPH” (Horowitz 2024, 322). Civilians forfeit and regain protection status depending on whether their hands are, quite literally in that moment, on the keyboard.\nCivilians who are completely oblivious of their contribution to hostilities retain their protection status (Horowitz 2024, 319). Might that be an argument for not telling private corporation employees about their foreseeable role in defending against cyberattacks in war? This seems ethically dubious, as it raises a host of questions surrounding transparency and individuals' agency. Civilian tech employees also do not forfeit their protection status when acting in “self-defense or in defense of others against violence prohibited against IHL,” such as “looting, rape, and murder by marauding” (emphasis added, Melzer 2009, 61, cited in; Horowitz 2024, 319). But civilian employees would forfeit their protected status (and become liable to targeting) if they are knowingly responding to cyberattacks that are permissible under IHL. Further still, if an individual tech employee is engaged in DPH and commits a violation of IHL that amounts to war crimes, they become liable under international criminal law (Horowitz 2024, 336). To what extent are civilian employees aware of this when they join a private corporation and are expected to fight in (cyber)wars to protect CI?\nSecond, if the military is not responsible for defending privately owned CI from devastating cyberattacks triggering and during war, then this means acknowledging that the military is seemingly responsible for defending the civilian population only in certain ways when it comes to CI (Participant 3, 2019). To be precise, it means the military is responsible for: i) defending CI from attacks emanating from the “physical domain,” ii) thwarting cyberattacks that target their own military or government systems, iii) mounting offensive cyber operations against adversarial CI, and iv) intelligence gathering and (if possible) sharing with companies. Correspondingly, the civilian population must be made aware of, and consent to, the reality that an entire arm of the state\nwill not be readied or resourced to protect against a catastrophic cyberattack against CI amounting to or during war.\nThird, as private corporations are required to shoulder enhanced duties to protect themselves (and the civilians who depend on them), they will be driven to amass more wealth and influence to fulfil the responsibilities demanded of them by states. After all, the flipside of the adage “with great power comes great responsibility” is with great responsibility comes the requirement to obtain the power to fulfil that responsibility. The foreseeable result is that private corporations will become even more powerful, and the public sector even more dependent on private corporations to guarantee national cybersecurity.\nThe worry, then, is that demanding private corporations to act like states means permitting -- indeed, requiring -- private corporations to fulfil the responsibilities of states. But private corporations are not states. CEOs are not democratically elected by the civilian populations they are (ostensibly) charged to protect. Their main pursuit is not protection but profit. There is no requirement for patriotism.\nMaybe these consternations are mute: private corporations could simply be subsumed under government control during war time via nationalization. Yet this dynamic circles back to the issues raised above pertaining to an overreliance on civilian consent or conscription. May individual employees conscientiously object to participating in war? If so, this will leave a lacuna for cyber-defense, as the military has not thus far been readied-and-resourced to respond (according to the interviewees). If not, this means conscripting employees to participate in war -- via cyber -- when they do not wish to; this may spell a cyber-equivalent to the “non-firing phenomenon” (where soldiers fail to shoot or to shoot accurately at the enemy). These questions highlight the further dissolution between civilians and the military in cyberspace.\nAs two interviewees noted: “by the time [the adversary is] in our systems, it's already too late” (Participant 18, 2019), and “if I were thinking about the current threats, I would be sleepless” (Participant 14, 2019). Relying heavily on private corporations and, crucially, their civilian employees to defend CI in war prompts a required reassessment and renegotiation regarding the role of the military (as the warfighting machine) in the digital age. Perhaps before states begin forcibly requiring civilian employees of private corporations to provide cyber-defense of CI in/as part of war, the military (alongside relevant public and private bodies) should be better equipped to help protect.\n## Conclusion\nNATO has long recognized cyberspace as a domain of war alongside air, land, and sea. Whilst the threat of cyberattacks has been widely debated, political and military leaders have consistently warned that adversaries will target CI with cyberattacks to initiate and prosecute conflict. Despite these concerns, there has been limited attention afforded to how Civil--Military Relations theory makes sense of cyberspace, and almost no empirical inquiry into how militaries understand their role in cyber-defense.\nTo fill this gap in defense studies literature, we conducted extensive, original elite interviews with military members across 12 NATO countries. Our data provided empirical evidence to confirm the theoretical opacity in cyber-CMR. It remains unclear at which point the military might be asked to get involved in the cyber-defense of CI, and it seems\nthat they would not be capable to help, even in war. Militaries play a role in gathering and sharing intelligence, defending forward, and reacting (via cyber or kinetic measures) after the fact. But they do not play a role in actively defending civilian CI as they would in other domains of war (Participant 12, 2019). According to our interviewees, this is because the military could not act (effectiveness narrative), should not act (environment narrative), and is not permitted to act (authorization narrative). Instead, the interviewees pointed to the fact that private owners and operators of CI play a central role in war.\nGiven this dynamic, the article then explores concerns around allocation of financial resources, “dual-use” infrastructures, and “having faith” in the private sector to “do the right thing.” The final part of the paper then controversially asks whether the military ought to be more involved. This section unpacked the serious legal, normative, and practical considerations with the private sector -- specifically, their civilian employees -- being on the front line of cyber-defense in war. To what extent should civilian employees be expected to act qua the military to defend against a cyberattack triggering or occurring in war? Are engineers in private corporations aware that they could become a direct participant in hostilities under IHL (and thereby forfeit their protection status as civilians)? What are the consequences of civilians abandoning their post or refusing to partake in defensive war? May they -- should they -- be court-martialed?\nBy raising these questions, this article galvanizes future research into determining if and how the military should be more involved or whether and when civilians should be conscripted into cyberwars. Additional investigations should involve interviewing the private owners and operators of CI to ascertain i) their views on the military's role in defending their CI, and ii) how they understand their own role in cyber-defense in 21st century wars. Future research may also seek to determine whether greater military involvement into cyber-defense of CI could act as a deterrent against potential adversaries, contributing to a burgeoning literature debating the applicability of deterrence strategy in cyberspace (see Borghard and Lonergan 2023; Lilli 2021; Schneider 2019). Finally, further research could conduct a cross-cultural comparison to highlight differences among NATO states and examine how competitor states, such as Russia and China, guarantee their cyber-defense of CI in war. This is especially pertinent, as the CMR separation in such autocracies is less stark.\nIn conclusion, as one NATO senior military officer noted: How states provide for the defense of CI from cyberattacks that trigger and feature in war is “fundamentally a societal choice” (Participant 13, 2019). For now, the officer continued, “we are hoping and praying the private companies have their defenses in order” (Participant 13, 2019)."

Marxe School of Public and International Affairs, Baruch College, City University of New York (CUNY), New York, NY, USA; $^{b}$ Centre for Future Defence and National Security, Deakin University, Canberra, Australia # ABSTRACT Severe state and state-sponsored cyberattacks against critical infrastructure (CI) is a pressing issue in contemporary conflicts. NATO member states have recognized cyberspace as a new domain of war – one through which adversaries will target CI to both commence and prosecute conflict. Given this: How do NATO member state militaries understand their part in protecting civilian CI from cyberattacks that constitute casus belli? Drawing on original, empirical evidence – 31 interviews and 1 focus group with senior military, defense, and intelligence cyber experts from 12 NATO states – this article argues that militaries regard themselves as unable, unauthorized, and ill-suited to protect CI from cyberattacks that initiate or occur in war. Instead, NATO member states overwhelmingly rely on private corporations (notably their civilian employees) for the protection of CI – including in violent conflict. This article provides original, empirical evidence to confirm the claim that the theory of Civil-Military Relations (CMR) falters when applied to cyberspace. It also asks cutting normative questions attendant with private corporations being on the front line of cyber-defense during war and argues that cyberspace obfuscates the boundaries of modern-day conflicts. This forces a re-examination of the military's role in 21st century wars.\n# ARTICLE HISTORY Received 11 May 2024 Accepted 13 January 2025 # KEYWORDS Cyber; Civil-Military Relations; NATO; militaries; critical infrastructure # Introduction Within liberal democratic states, war is premised on the strict delineation between the military and civilian domains. However, cyberattacks against privately owned and operated civilian critical infrastructure (CI) are challenging this traditional distinction. Understanding the protection of CI from cyberattacks that constitute casus belli within NATO states is especially pressing, as the livelihoods of 1 billion people across 31 countries are at stake. In 2014, NATO formally acknowledged that cyberattacks could be considered an armed attack and thus could trigger Article 5 (Collective Defense) of the NATO Charter. Since 2016, the Alliance has recognized cyberspace as a domain of military operations in which it\"must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea\".

Marxe School of Public and International Affairs, Baruch College, City University of New York (CUNY), 135 East 22nd St, New York, NY 10010, USA © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group affirmed in 2021 that smaller cyberattacks could -- cumulatively -- amount to an armed attack. More recently, the U.S. 2023 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy (U.S. DoD 2023, 7) notes: “U.S. adversaries regularly use malicious cyber activity to target our critical infrastructure. In crisis, they will seek to hinder U.S. military mobilization, sow chaos, and harm the American people.” This is because CI are the very “systems upon which modern society, economy, and polity are seen to depend” (CISA n.d.) and so the disruption or destruction of which would have severe consequences for national security. Indeed, as Haataja (2022, 425) notes, there is a pervasive “recognition of the potentially devastating impact that cyber operations on CI can have.”\nWhilst there has been significant development in mandatory regulation for private corporations regarding cyber-defense, the role of militaries in protecting civilian CI from cyberattacks that can trigger or occur in war has received very little empirical attention. This absence is curious, especially as the military is the traditional state organ tasked with defending the nation against external threats arising to the level of an armed attack.\nSuch a lacuna might be explained by the fact that the prevailing theoretical approach to the role of the military -- Civil--Military Relations (CMR) -- struggles to coherently account for cyberspace as a new “domain” of conflict. Cyberspace raises questions pertaining to the role of the military in 21st century conflicts, creating tensions between prevailing CMR assumptions and the new ways in which wars are fought. This is because “cyberspace pushes questions of traditional boundaries of sovereignty, as well as blurs lines between the civilian and security sector”. State-sponsored adversarial attacks in cyberspace even challenge the very notion of war itself (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022). As a result, there is a theoretical opacity in CMR regarding the military's duties in defending privately owned civilian CI from cyberattacks that both trigger and occur in war.\nGreater scholarly enquiry is therefore required to interrogate this theoretical muddiness inherent in cyber-CMR. Specifically, almost no empirical attention has been afforded to test whether this cyber-CMR tension is reflected in the military's own understanding of its role in cyber-defense of civilian CI. This article aims to fill this gap. It does so by drawing on 31 semi-structured interviews and 1 focus group with cyber experts from 12 NATO states to test this theoretical opacity. How do military cyber experts from NATO member states understand their role in defending critical infrastructure against cyberattacks? We find that -- unlike acts of aggression emanating from land, air, and sea -- NATO military members believe they can not, should not, and are not authorized to defend CI against cyberattacks that could constitute casus belli. Instead, despite recognizing that cyberattacks against CI could trigger or form part of “the next war”, NATO member states rely on private owners and operators for the provision and protection of CI. This finding is crucial, as it challenges preconceived notions of the military taking the lead in defending the state (including from cyberattacks) during war. Departing from the extant literature, the article then critically explores the practical and normative implications of having private corporations on the front line of cyber-defense of CI, and the military taking a backseat during (cyber)war.\nThe paper begins with an overview of the prevailing theoretical framework for understanding the role of the military in conflict -- CMR. This is crucial to make sense of how militaries understand their role in defending the nation in/through cyberspace. After a review of the article's methodology, we present the empirical data obtained from the interviews. This is followed by a discussion of the findings, highlighting the problematic logic of the current dynamic, and a normative and practical consideration of whether the military ought to be more involved in cyber-defense of civilian CI. The conclusion summarizes the findings and scopes avenues for future research.\n## (Cyber) Civil--Military Relations CMR elucidates the relationship between the armed forces, the people, and the state's civilian authorities: it stresses civilian control over the military, defines what it means to be a professional soldier in a democratic society, and identifies which items of the national security agenda fall to the military. It is with this latter aspect of CMR with which we are principally concerned because it pertains to the role of the military in cyber operations, and in the protection of critical infrastructure. The consensus in the literature and in practice has been to try to maintain the separation between the military and civilians when it comes to critical infrastructure protection (CIP) (Pačka and Mareš 2021). However, the development of cyberspace challenges the foundational theoretical assumptions of CMR in three ways.\nFirst, cyberspace inherently blurs the traditional division between foreign and domestic theatres, which has authorization complexities for the military operating on home soil. One of the main tenets of CMR is that the military “does not generally operate or deploy domestically”. As a result, the focus of the military (acting on behalf and at the behest of the civilian government) has been on defending against physical, foreign threats. Yet, this view has been somewhat altered since the collapse of the Soviet Union, when the new threat environment drew to the fore a more diverse set of security imperatives. Non-traditional security threats, such as terrorism, civil conflicts, pandemics, and natural disasters, have “compelled a world-wide re-thinking of the roles and missions of armed forces” within the CMR literature (Diamond, and Plattner 1996, x). “[V]irtually everywhere”, Bruneau and Matei (2012, 2) contend, “militaries and other security instruments are taking on new roles and missions”, such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR).\nThe changing character of national security forces militaries to adapt to a wider array of missions and to develop a broader purpose. But the military's focus largely remains on providing security from physical, external threats. In the 21st century, technological transformations altered the character of security and war yet again, forcing scholars to question whether CMR needs to be adjusted to protect states in “non-traditional battlefields,” notably cyberspace and outerspace. The boundaries between domestic and external security threats became increasingly obscured by transnational digital information systems.\nAn important implication of this reality for CMR is a change of the main locus of military operations: “soldiers operating on the home front” might come to be seen as the rule rather than the exception. As put by Burton (2015, 302), cyberattacks “occur over a globally linked network of computer systems and can be launched without warning, in milliseconds, from anywhere on the planet.” Cyberspace, he argues, creates a new challenge for security organizations like NATO, which has “traditionally focused on geographically proximate security threats”. This brought others to argue that soldiers will be securing networks and countering intrusions against critical infrastructure. The nature of transnational cyber threats, therefore, has important implications for the future role of the military, urging states to reconsider whether a physical, territorial distinction -- a separation between domestic and foreign theatres of operations -- is justified (or indeed even possible) in cyberspace.\nSecond, cyberspace challenges CMR's clear distinction between civilian and military domains because the cyberspace environment is inherently different from that of traditional, physical domains of war (land, air, and sea). As such, the traditional CMR boundaries between military and civilian spheres have become increasingly hazy. Pačka and Mareš (2021, 437) note: “In a common national security and defense ecosystem, the roles of players such as an army, police, intelligence agency, and others are set clearly and there is an evident division of labor... cyberspace constantly changes the boundaries.” Cyberspace is “blurring the lines between the traditional expertise of the uniformed military and the roles and responsibilities of civilians” (Beehner, Brooks, and Maurer 2021, 5). This is especially the case because aggressions in cyberspace often target civilian persons or infrastructure.\nAs militaries become more involved in the cyber domain, they will inevitably conduct their operations over “international and domestic computer infrastructure that supports the dense lattice of digital-age civilian life”. As Sharpe, Trichas, and Terrill (2024, 5) note, “recognition of... cyberspace as a critical domain... represents a paradigm shift in military strategy.” Further distorting the distinction between civilian and military spheres is the fact that technological infrastructure is often dual-use and that militaries rely increasingly on civilian networks for their own operations. Consensus amongst CMR scholars seems to be that the uniqueness of the cyber domain requires “unorthodox” and innovative approaches to the organization of security and defense, challenging, in the words of Brooks (2016, 359), existing “walls” between civilians and the military. As summarized by Chayes (2015, 187): “Civil and military roles are not easily sorted out in the area of cyberattacks and cyber warfare.”\nThird, cyberspace forces a revision not only of what it means to fight wars and of who is involved in warfighting but of the delineation between war and peace itself (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022; Sewall 2021). Constant contact and interconnectedness are key features of cyberspace, favoring initiative and pre-emption over passivity and reactive defense, meaning that states are incentivized to persistently exploit adversary vulnerabilities in order to gain and maintain the advantage (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022). This challenges the dominant Western understanding of war, premised on “use of force” and “armed attack” as the crossing of what is usually considered to be the boundary between war and peace. Unlike with conventional warfare, there is seemingly no strict division between war and peace in cyberspace. States are in a constant state of competition. NATO holds the view that “cyberspace is contested at all times”. Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett (2022, 123) argue that this requires a paradigm shift in policy and strategy planning, one that would focus on an “increased tempo” of cyber military operations outside their own network, and continuous preparation and execution of cyber campaigns.\nAs the complexities of cyberspace are challenging the long-held clear division between war and peace, by extension, the clear separation between civilian and military spheres is also contested. Is there a need for “an increased tempo” of cyber military operations not only outside the defense's network but outside the unique context of war? That the military might play a role outside of warfighting is not new to cyberspace, as discussed above, and so it is justified to address the challenge of continuous competition in cyberspace and activities occurring in this space between peace and war.\nThe question that then flows from this is whether it matters at all when a cyberattack against CI reaches the threshold of an armed attack and triggers Article 5, especially with regards to the roles and responsibilities of cyber-defense. Surely, it does matter, because -- traditionally -- if states are at war, different agents become responsible for action (namely, the military). Yet in cyberspace, this does not seem to be the case, with this responsibility being entrusted to private actors even during conflict. Instead, it seems that the dissolution of the war-peace continuum in cyberspace is making it difficult for states to identify the appropriate response to cyberattacks against the nation's CI, both during the crisis phase, before Article 5 is invoked, and during war. It is with these kinds of cyberattacks, that could constitute casus belli or occur in war, that this article is concerned.\nOwing to these complexities, it is unclear “whether civil-military relations are sufficiently calibrated to protect... in these non-traditional battlefields” where “warfare encompass[es]... less-understood cyber-tools” (Beehner, Brooks, and Maurer 2021, 3). The foundational assumptions built into CMR paradigmatically accept that the military's role is in defending against physical, external threats, focused within war time and is wedded to the distinction between civilian and military responsibilities. But, as others have noted, cyberspace generates theoretical tensions regarding the applicability of these three a priori accepted precepts.\n## Research design and methodology: NATO case study If cyberattacks on CI will inevitably feature in 21st century conflicts, then it is urgent to understand if and how the military, as the institution responsible for warfighting and defense on behalf of the state, understands its role. In other words, it is of paramount importance to test whether existing theoretical tensions are reflected empirically -- by going straight to the source. The justification for casing our study to NATO is because the alliance represents a significant proportion of the global population and serves as a key exemplar of dominant Western perspectives.\nWe conducted 31 semi-structured interviews with military and defense cyber subject matter experts (SMEs) from 12 NATO member states, and 1 focus group of 7 military cyber experts. Representatives from Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Estonia, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US) participated in the research. These countries were chosen based on access (at the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Tallinn and at the NATO Headquarters in Brussels) and expertise within the NATO alliance regarding cyber-defense, including states that are technologically advanced and at the forefront of cyber affairs in practice, and others that are not as well positioned. Among NATO states, cyber-defense of CI is a national responsibility and as such, strategies vary across nations but clear similarities can be found. This illustrates that regardless of a state's level of “cyber-awareness,” most NATO members share similar views on the role of the military regarding the cyber-defense of CI. It also illuminates an apparent disconnect between traditional CMR assumptions regarding the role of the military in territorial defense against external threats and current military perceptions across NATO states. It is also important to note that cyber-offense has its own very specific construct -- Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies (SCEPVA) -- which we do not explore in this paper.\nBy “cyber subject matter experts” we mean military members (officers and enlisted) and civilians (policy advisors) working for defense ministries and at the NATO Headquarters, whose principal occupation is with matters of cyberspace -- both offense and defense. The interview participants included senior military officials (including two-star generals) and cyber experts and lawyers from the military and other government departments (including ministries of defense and intelligence agencies) from NATO member states.\nInterviewees were assured that their views would not be taken as representative of NATO or their “home” state, military, or department, and that their identity would be anonymized. Accordingly, quotes have not been assigned to specific roles or states in order to mitigate the risks associated with attribution, particularly those arising from cross-referencing. The goal of conducting these interviews was not to examine differences in cultural approaches across NATO members, although this would be a valuable future study.\nA note on limitations. One limitation pertaining to the approach of this research is that, by focusing on military perspectives only, the research excludes other crucial stakeholders such as private-sector partners and other public agencies like police, local cyber task forces and computer emergency response teams (CERTS). Notably, we do not examine what the private owners and operators of CI (CEOs and/or employees) consider as the appropriate role of the military in cyber-defense. This question, albeit important, requires a separate, substantive future investigation -- one that, due to space constraints, we could not explore here. Instead, our interest lies with understanding the military's role in defending the nation against cyberattacks, a question that is best answered by those working in defense who are across the current military cyber posture. That said, the participants also included representatives from intelligence agencies, who work closely with their military counterparts and who have important responsibilities in both cyber-offense and cyber-defense in many countries. These interviewees were well placed to differentiate the role of the military and that of intelligence agencies in responding to a cyber event, confirming some issues raised by defense interviewees in terms of cyber-CMR.\n## NATO militaries' perceptions of cyber-defense of CI In the words of the interviewees, the purpose of the military is to “serve, protect, and defend” the state and the population against foreign aggression. However, when asked how the military discharges this responsibility to protect citizens from adversarial cyberattacks on CI either triggering or happening in war, all of the interviewees stated that the military was ill-suited or ill-prepared to intervene, even in the case where it might be asked to do so. We also found that, despite cyberspace being recognized as a domain of military operations, military members' understanding of their role reflects the complexities of the cyber war-peace continuum. Three recurring narratives emerged from the interviewees when describing the limits of their role. Each chime with the three tensions articulated in cyber-CMR above: the uniqueness of the domain, the blurring of foreign/domestic theaters, and what this means for understanding war. To begin, however, we survey how militaries presently engage in cyber-defense of CI.\n### Defending forward, persistent engagement, and integrated deterrence NATO member militaries are engaged in collecting, analyzing, and exchanging intelligence with other government agencies, the private sector, and NATO allies (U.S. DoD 2023). Information collection and sharing is considered an integral aspect of cyber-defense. When private corporations identify a threat in their system and pass that information along to government agencies, such public agencies then make recommendations regarding how the private companies ought to rectify the vulnerability and voluntarily assist in that process (which, in many instances, can be declined by the corporation). Yet, importantly (for reasons we explore below), according to one of our interviewees: “the government won't go into anyone's systems: they have a coordination role, but otherwise it's hands off the keyboard” (Participant 18, 2019).\nMoreover, NATO state militaries are authorized (and indeed required) to take proactive measures to ensure the cybersecurity of their own military systems -- principally to ensure continued operability across the traditional, physical domains of armed conflict. The desire to enhance the cyber resilience of the Alliance was reiterated at the 2023 Vilnius Summit. As a senior military officer explained, however, “the primary concern of the military is to ensure our cyber systems are working so we can do kinetic defense: the military has a monopoly on kinetic defense, not cyber” (Participant 12, 2019).\nA few of the interviewees stated that the military is engaged in what has long been understood as “active defense:” “defensive operations that involve direct engagement with sophisticated adversaries in DoD-controlled cyberspace”. The U.S. in particular has employed the notion of “defending forward” which aims to pre-emptively “stop threats before they reach their targets” (U.S. Department of Defense 2018, 2) and which was developed in response to criticisms that the military was not proactively defending critical infrastructure against cyberattacks (Former US Cyber Command official, personal communication with author, 2020). “Defending forward,” “active defense,” and “persistent engagement” were born out of the recognition that the U.S. could not expect private corporations to defend themselves against the full power of an adversarial state. Both approaches form part of what the U.S. now regards as “integrated deterrence,” developed in the most recent DoD Cyber Strategy (2023, 2), which focuses on using military cyber capabilities “in concert with other instruments of national power.”\nFurther still, the military would likely be the apparatus called upon by the state in the “response” phase of a devastating cyberattack (Participants 8, 14, 16, 22). The military would be responsible for launching a cyber or kinetic counter-offensive, following appropriate attribution processes (proportionality, necessity, and distinction factors considered). But such responses are necessarily ex post facto. As was expressed in the focus group (2019): “Reacting after the fact is a losing strategy.” Until then, the front line of defense -- with public sector support, especially intelligence agencies -- is the private corporations.\n### The effectiveness narrative: can not Previously, it has been thought that -- in the context of NATO and specifically the U.S. -- the resources and expertise on cyber-defense and cyberwar was retained by the military. Our empirical evidence finds the opposite to be the case. Most of the interviewees argued that their respective militaries currently lack the necessary resources, human-power, and relevant expertise required to effectively defend CI from cyberattacks. As a result, the interviewees consistently highlighted that, due to the nature of the domain, the military is unable to protect civilian CI from cyberattacks -- even those that can trigger or occur in war. One interviewee compared this lack of cyber capability with traditional, kinetic attacks: “The military is the only institution or organization to defend against armed attacks, because they're the only ones who have fighter planes. But in a cyberattack, Cyber Command won't be first [to respond], because they don't have the capability” (Participant 19, 2019). Another senior military officer (Participant 3, 2019) reflected that attention ought to be focused on pragmatically determining which organization is likely to be most successful in providing cyber-defense: “It's about having the right tools, and the right knowledge... the military might not be best placed to defend certain infrastructure.” For instance, interviewees rightly pointed out that in many countries intelligence agencies play a significant role in the cyber-defense of the nation and its critical infrastructure, notably by advising and assisting other government agencies and the private sector (see for instance GCHQ n.d.; Government of Canada n.d.).\nA few interviewees also noted that because the private corporations that own and operate CI use different and often “tailor-made” platforms, it would be almost impossible for cyber experts in the military to be sufficiently knowledgeable to defend across all the different systems. It is “unimaginable” for the military to help, one interviewee reflected, “because they are completely unfamiliar with the systems” (Participant 9, 2019).\nSome of the interviewees argued that it would be financially ineffective or even prohibitively expensive to have the military provide cyber-defense for CI: it is “better to let the private sector deal with it,” because having the government provide the cyber-defense for critical infrastructure would be “implausible and expensive” (Participant 12, 2019). “Private corporations should be responsible,” one interviewee stated, “otherwise there would be a lot of taxpayers' money required to provide [protection for] those systems -- like a ‘cybersecurity tax' for providing cyber-defense of critical infrastructure” (Participant 9, 2019). The interviewees' perception echoes the sentiment highlighted in the literature on critical infrastructure protection that private owners are best placed to establish cyber-defenses.\nThe environment narrative: should not When discussing why the military does not play a greater role in protecting CI from cyberattacks -- as they would if the “armed attack” was emanating from other domains of war -- the interviewees stated that this is because “cyberspace is fundamentally different” (Participant 15, 2019). The participants overwhelmingly referred to cyberspace's ubiquitous, borderless, fluid, and invisible nature. The interviewees emphasized the relatively abstract characteristics of cyberspace identified in the literature as affecting the military's ability to help defend. One government official simply stated: “cyber is a different domain; we haven't figured out how it works” (Participant 22, 2019). Another interviewee reflected: “In cyber, the fog of war is heightened” (Participant 11, 2019). Interviewees also referred to the difficulty of determining whether sovereignty is applicable to cyberspace and where borders might begin and end, thereby touching on the ongoing debate between NATO member states about whether sovereignty is applicable to cyberspace.\nIn most instances, the interviewees' reference to sovereignty was intended to highlight that, unlike in sea, air, and land -- which have clear, physical borders that can be transgressed -- cyberspace has no such border. The interviewees often highlighted the difficulty of defending against cyberattacks by comparing cyberspace with the physical domains of warfighting: “You can see equipment like frigates and airplanes,” one interviewee noted, “but you can't see firewalls or malicious code” (Focus group 2019).\nA majority of interviewees also argued that the military does not have a significant role in defending CI from cyberattacks that could trigger war or happen in war because -- again, in contrast to the physical domain -- it is an “unchartered territory” and so “the line between government and private” is “blurred” (Participants 16, 18 and 26, 2019). A few interviewees drew parallels with the other services, claiming that “we've had an army, navy, and air force for a long time, but cyberspace is new” (Participant 13, 2019). These comments are reminiscent of the remarks made by Lt. Col. Kurt Sanger, Chief Judge Advocate for National Security Law at U.S. Cyber Command at the 2019 CyCon U.S: “For most of the domains, you have thousands of years and millions of warriors contributing to the lessons that you're now learning... We don't have that in cyberspace”. In short, cyberspace itself was thought by the interviewees as an inherently exposed space, with points of vulnerabilities too vast to comprehend. As one officer put it, “cyberspace is un-defendable” (Participant 12, 2019). These responses align with what Cate (2015, 307) identifies as the prevailing “sense of despair about the size and complexity of the challenge.”\nOur empirical evidence highlights that the military believes it should not play a significant role in defending CI. In doing so, it thereby supports the extant theoretical claim that cyberspace distorts the lines between the domestic vs. foreign spheres and forces an alteration of traditional territorial and sovereign conceptions of defense. This further illustrates the dissolution of the traditional division between civilian and military sectors in CMR due to the unprecedented nature of the domain.\nThe authorization narrative: not permitted The last narrative that emerged from the interviewees' responses is that of “authorization.” A third of the interviewees noted that the military is not permitted to operate on domestic soil. Typically, within NATO states, the military is not automatically authorized to conduct what are considered police enforcement duties: for instance, the U.S. Posse Comitatus Act, signed in 1878, is designed to prohibit the deployment of the military to enforce domestic civilian policies and practices “unless expressly authorized by the Constitution or an act of Congress” (Congressional Research Service 2018). It seems that this is what most of the interviewees were referring to when raising concerns regarding “authorization.” Many participants explained that this is a “design reality” of the democratic system, which means that states are constrained and restrained by their legal environment (Participants 1, 2 and 13, 2019). As one interviewee articulated, “the legislation is not adjusted for the realities of cyberspace” (Participant 7, 2019), while another reflected, “if we want to live in a liberal, democratic society, this is what we get” (Participant 17, 2019).\nSome interviewees highlighted that the military would be called upon, by the state, to operate in the territory of that sovereign state in the instance that there is an actual use of physical force against the state. As one interviewee explained: “Obviously if our ‘friends' in the East rolled tanks across the border right now, our forces would be authorized to act in the state to repel that assault. It wouldn't be the police's job” (Participant 15, 2019).\nAdditionally, a few interviewees raised concerns regarding privacy as a barrier to greater military involvement. One military officer noted that: “[People] are OK that we have ships, border patrol, flight deterrence... But with cyber, people don't want the government to look into their Internet connectivity” (Participant 18, 2019). Overall, the interviewees consistently stated that the military would be called upon to protect the sovereign state from a land invasion, naval assault, or airborne missile strike against CI -- but this would not be the case regarding a comparable assault emanating from cyberspace.\nThe three narratives empirically confirm the tension highlighted in the literature on cyber-CMR. It further resonates with the 2023 U.S. Cyber Strategy that the Department of Defense “lacks the authority to employ military forces to defend private companies against cyberattacks” and that there are “limited circumstances in which military cyber forces would be asked to defend civilian critical infrastructure -- the Department will not posture itself to defend every private sector network” (U.S. DoD 2023, 13). In short, NATO member militaries do not believe they play a major role in cyber-defense of CI that initiates or occurs amidst war due to environment, effectiveness, and authorization complexities. As one interviewee noted: “There is a contradiction between the fear of cyberattacks, [and the fact that] we [the people]... don't want the military to play a bigger role” (Participant 18, 2019).\n## Critical discussion of the military perspective There are three key findings that arise from the empirical evidence. First: the military members affirm the perception of the blurred nature of cyber-CMR described above. Second: the minimal military involvement raises urgent questions regarding CI that will be targeted in war. Third: while regulations have improved in the past few years, it is the private corporations that are principally responsible for protecting CI from sophisticated state-sponsored cyberattacks during war. These findings invite a re-examination of the role of the military in 21st century conflicts.\n### A reflection of political will and political choices One of the explanations invoked by the interviewees for why the military is not more involved in the cyber-defense of CI is because the military currently lacks the financial and human resources to do so (the effectiveness narrative). Some might claim that it is unreasonable to reassign some military funding for cyber-defense of CI in the face of “defense austerity” -- although in the U.S. this notion is debatable, as the proposed 2024 budget for the entire DoD totaled $842 billion (Congressional Budget Office 2023). One interviewee argued that this objection is misplaced, as taking proactive security measures prior to an “inevitable cyberattack against critical infrastructure” is a more fiscally responsible decision from the outset (Participant 4, 2019).\nFunds already allocated to the acquisition of traditional kinetic weapons could (again, hypothetically) be redirected toward: the military's development of defensive cyber technologies for CI, the recruitment of more military cyber personnel, and the expansion and implementation of CIP military training programs. Other interviewees instead reiterated an absence of political will for states to invest highly in something as intangible as cybersecurity: “Guns and tanks and fighter jets are sexier. They're sexier and easier for politicians to show off for their next election campaign, that they're doing something for national security... [They're] not really able to show off lines of code” (Focus group, 2019).\nAside from the fiscal element is the ostensible “novelty” and “unknowable-ness” of cyberspace as to why they “should not” be involved in defense of CI (the environment narrative). Confusion surrounding cyberspace's distinct character is something that is debated in the literature. Nonetheless, there is a risk of “succumbing to the shock of the new”. Erroneously perceiving the form of a domain as inherently enigmatic stymies progress toward establishing effective defense systems. Considering other “newer” domains of war, one interviewee compared cyberspace to the air force: no “historical accident... the air force was born out of the need for defense from attacks in airspace in the 20th century” (Participant 28, 2019). It is a political choice to allocate the main face of defense in war to private corporations.\nMoreover, whilst the military is prima facie prohibited from operating on domestic soil, the authorization narrative should be interrogated further. Indeed, the military could -- and would -- be called upon by the state to operate in its sovereign territory if there is an actual use of physical force tantamount to an armed attack. In the face of cyberattacks that do reach the level of an armed attack and that could trigger NATO's Article 5, conceivably, the military would be authorized to get involved in the cyber-defense of civilian CI systems. Theoretically at least, cyber aggressions comparable to armed attacks do not pose a significantly new challenge for civil--military relations. Nonetheless, the research finds that even with this kind of attack that could constitute casus belli, or occur during war, uncertainty remains within the military regarding the extent to which they would be authorized (or able) to get involved in the cyber-defense of private networks. Even when faced with cyberattacks that would amount to an armed attack, or during war, the military would not be able to effectively help defend CI. The militaries' current (and limited) ability and expectation to provide cyber-defense of CI is a political calculation. One defense personnel reflected: “I feel that there is a growing need for more cyber units in the military, and since cyber has now been recognized as a proper domain of armed conflict on par with air, land, sea and in some cases also space, I think it will happen... It is just a question of how it will evolve, and through which means. (Participant 16, 2019)” Nevertheless, according to the interviewees, this is likely only after some “catastrophic” cyberattack on CI (Participants 8 and 29, 2019). The current decision to rely heavily on private corporations, albeit with mandatory reporting and compliance mechanisms, is a political choice.\n### Concerns surrounding “dual-use” infrastructures A further implication of minimal military involvement is how to deal with “dual-use” CI. Civilian CI has been and will continue to be targeted by adversarial actors as part of war. One interviewee stated: “There is no such thing as a ‘military' cyberattack; 90% of the time it will be against civilian infrastructure” (Participant 22, 2019). According to another: “Adversaries will -- and already do -- attack critical infrastructure as a primary target via cyberspace, because it's what we would do” (Participant 7, 2019). States will likely seek to disable CI in war in order to gain a military advantage.\nAs per international cyber norms regarding responsible state behavior, there is a prohibition of “cyber operations that cause intentional damage or impairment to critical infrastructure (CI)”. CI should be -- in the words of then U.S. President Joe Biden -- “‘off limits' to attack” (cited in Haataja 2022, 425). Of course, only military objects and combatants are liable to be lawfully targeted in war; according to the International Humanitarian Law (IHL) principle of distinction, intentionally targeting civilians and civilian CI (including via cyber) is prohibited. Nevertheless, the urgency of preparing the military to contribute to the defense of CI is even more apparent given the potential for civilian CI to be rendered a liable military objective. This is because civilian CI can: i) become co-opted for military purposes, ii) have a “military utility,” or iii) be “dual-use”.\nThere are three concerns raised here. First, if (privately owned) CI networks become “dual-use” or are of “military utility,” they become military objectives and thus may be lawfully targeted. As Horowitz (2024, 327) notes: a “privately owned civilian aviation air traffic control tower that the enemy military temporarily uses to enable offensive operations” might be rendered a military objective “because of its ‘use.'” Moreover, according to the Tallinn Manual 2.0: if critical infrastructure is being used by both civilian and military ends, and it is “impossible” to differentiate between the civilian and military parts of a system, “the entire network... qualifies as a military objective”.\nSecond, because of the invisible nature of cyberspace, it is additionally challenging to differentiate between civilian vs. military cyber infrastructures. As such, there is foreseeably a large scope for misinterpretation and accidental military targeting of CI. Third, it is unclear whether preparatory acts on “dual-use” infrastructures during peacetime -- such as the insertion of dormant malware -- constitutes an attack or strictly cyber-espionage. Haataja (2022, 424, 428) highlights that there is a danger for pre-positioned adversarial code in CI that could be activated later, a practice known as “persistent presence” in CI. Simply planting malware or creating “backdoors” certainly violates international cyber norms and could be considered a breach of a state's obligation under international law (others consider such cyber norms “voluntary, non-binding”). But such cyber-operations themselves are unlikely to rise to the level of an armed attack. Activating a dormant malware in a privately owned CI, such as a nuclear powerplant, causing it to explode, would foreseeably reach that threshold. All of this points to the complexity of defending CI from cyberattacks that constitute casus belli or may be pursued in war.\n### A degree of (risky) faith in the private sector Private corporations that own and operate CI ought to provide appropriate cyber-defensive measures -- especially to protect what one interviewee called “low-hanging fruits” (Participant 3, 2019). Nonetheless, as one interviewee noted: “We can't expect private companies to protect themselves against state-sponsored attacks” (Participant 23, 2019). Many interviewees expressed having “faith” in private corporations adhering to proper standards and regulations: “We hope they [the private corporations] do the right thing” (Participant 8, 2019).\nUsing the physical domain as an analogy, the private owners of a power grid would be expected to employ a reasonable degree of security -- locking doors, installing surveillance cameras, erecting wire fences, and employing security guards, and so on. However, the security guard would not be expected to defend against an attack that rises to a use of force tantamount with war. Defense from in-coming ballistic missiles would fall to the state and -- foreseeably -- the air force: “In the physical world, we don't require companies to have an air force, or submarines, or to really look at the pointy end of an attack”.\nYet whilst companies have oversight, assistance, and mandatory regulations from government, the front line of defense in cyberspace remains the purview of companies. It is often in their profit margins interests to ensure their cyber-defenses are in order, and to work closely and collaboratively with government agencies to redress vulnerabilities or incursions. Beyond purely monetary interests, corporations could be appealed to do so on the notion of “loyalty”. They may be incentivized to effectively participate in the provision of cyber-defense based on “a moral commitment to ‘solidarity' and ‘community responsibility'”. One senior government official iterated this patriotic duty to “protect our lifestyle” (Participant 22, 2019). For instance, when asked about who is defending Ukrainian CI from Russian cyberattacks, one retired general responded: “The private corporations in Ukraine are doing an excellent job” (General [retd.], personal communication with author, 2022). Similarly, Matania and Sommer (2023, 3) note that “Tech Titans” (Google, Microsoft, Meta, Apple, SpaceX and Amazon) are playing a meaningful role in the armed conflict in Ukraine.\nThat said, as one interviewee reflected: “appealing towards companies' patriotism... is probably not the safest way to do things” (Participant 13, 2019). Even if a private corporation is “homegrown,” it does not guarantee that they are, in fact, patriotic. “Company Over Country” was Meta CEO and Founder Mark Zuckerberg's early motto. Similarly, the whistle blower Haugen (2021, 2) iterated that -- when torn between “its own profits and [the U.S.'] safety,” Meta “consistently... favor[ed] its own profits.” This demonstrates that American-owned corporations have prioritized financial gains over that of the security of the American people. Such a dynamic becomes even more problematic if CI corporations in NATO member states are outsourced and owned by foreign corporations.\nPerhaps “profits before patriotism” is strictly a feature of peacetime: once it comes to war, the dynamic will flip. For instance, by May 2022 Google had pledged approximately $55 million in support of Ukraine's resistance of Russian aggression. Similarly, within days of the full-scale invasion, Microsoft moved Ukraine's critical government data to its cloud storage platform. This was because most of the data was “extremely vulnerable to missile attacks, and their physical destruction could paralyze the entire work of the country's top leadership”.\nYet the view that corporations would be driven by patriotism (or, more accurately, defense of liberal values) over profit hinges on two, risky assumptions. In the first instance, it takes for granted that the CI private corporation heralds from, or is ideologically aligned with, the country under (cyber)attack -- which is not necessarily always the case. It supposes the private corporation may not be under pressure from the attacking-state or wishes to remain neutral, or had been convinced to allow the attack to take place (due to corruption, coercion, or ideological leanings). There is no guarantee for support. There is no expectation for patriotism even from corporations that are (for lack of a better word) “home grown.”\nIn the second instance, it is also not clear how long “patriotic” support or commitment to democratic liberal ideals -- even if it is forthcoming -- might last. While Elon Musk's SpaceX initially sent Starlink satellites to the Ukrainian military for free, it eventually stated it could no longer foot the bill, and the Pentagon had to pick up the tab -- once the reliance on Musk's service had been firmly established (conceivably with an agenda to accrue profits). Moreover, demonstrating the selectivity of private sector support, when the Ukrainian military conducted an offensive into the Russian-held Crimea, they begged Elon Musk to turn on its satellite service in the Russian-controlled area, but he refused to do so because (according to his post on X) he feared SpaceX's complicity in “a major act of war and conflict escalation”. Betting on private corporations' patriotism and political alliances or appetite for war, over that of their foundational and raison d'être interests in profit, is to gamble with national (cyber) defense. If there is a profit to be made, corporations might choose to get involved in conflicts (even distant ones), but they might stop to be involved when it is no longer financially advisable.\nOur empirical data suggests that -- unlike kinetic acts of war emanating in land, air, and sea -- the military is not responsible for defending against state-sponsored acts of aggression against CI via cyberspace. However, trusting private corporations to adequately defend against cyberattacks in war is a risky security strategy.\n## Should militaries be more involved? Normative and practical considerations As detailed in the previous section, multiple interviewees remarked on the risks associated with dual-use infrastructure and with being overly reliant on private corporations to provide cyber-defense of CI. Relatedly, some participants expressed concerns about not being readied and resourced to defend CI against cyberattacks. This prompts the question: might there be a case for increasing military involvement in cyber-defense of CI? After all, the military is the principal body responsible for defending civilians (on behalf of the state) from acts of aggression rising to war. Former NATO Deputy Secretary General Rose Gottemoeller et al. (2022) expressed the need for NATO Allies to be better prepared in response to cyberattacks. This requirement is especially pertinent, as Burton (2015, 302) remarks, “cyber operations are increasingly part of [conflicts involving NATO forces] and an element of the strategy of NATO's main state adversaries.” To be clear, we are not in any way suggesting a “military-takes-all,” zero-sum approach to defending CI from cyberattacks that trigger Article 5. The normative question is whether militaries should be readied -- as a last line of defense -- to help protect alongside private corporations and public bodies (such as intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and federal and local cyber task forces).\nOne objection to greater military involvement is the potential for escalation. A cyber-defensive operation led by the military could be perceived by an adversary as a cyber countermeasure, resulting in a “tit-for-tat escalation of cyberattacks and responses, each one more serious than the last”. An increased role of the military in providing cyber-defense of CI may therefore lead to “a permissive normative-legal environment in which states are more likely than before to resort to uses of force”.\nA related normative concern is that the increased role of the military in cyber-defense of CI begets the militarization of cyberspace. The perception of the military being involved in a civilian network, even for strictly defensive purposes, may render it a military target. But simply because the military may be called upon, as a last resort, to aid in the cyber-defense of CI does not render the civilian objective ipso facto a military target. In the same way that the military might be called upon to help defend a hospital (for instance) from kinetic attacks, the military presence does not automatically render the hospital a liable military objective.\nAnother further objection might be that introducing the military as an agent of cyber-defense of CI risks increasing the potential for abuse -- notably, through mass militarized surveillance or the military placing pressure on private corporations to act in certain ways. Relatedly, there may be normative concerns regarding competing authorities -- an unnecessary duplication of responsibilities and confusion over which entity precisely (the private organization vs. intelligence agency vs. the military) acts in what contexts. Within the extant literature, Public--Private Partnerships in CI protection are already regarded as notoriously fraught with complications pertaining to cooperation, information sharing, and trust. For instance, one interviewee noted that -- on the issue of information sharing of breaches -- “private companies won't ‘sho their hand'... they would rather sell the intelligence than give it away for free” (Participant 9, 2019). Surely adding another agent into the mix will make cyber-defense more complex.\nA reply to these two objections is that the military should only get involved when: i) the private entity is unable or unwilling to respond, ii) that the aid of the existing public agencies is insufficient, or iii) that the cyberattack would (through its scale and effects) constitute an armed attack. What should be envisaged is a live, cooperative triage system, whereby the military might be deployed only to help defend CI, should the attack foreseeably trigger war or take place in war, or if other responders have failed to address the threat and require additional assistance.\nOne further objection is that increasing military involvement generates a moral hazard for the private sector. Specifically, if the military is offering a pseudo-“security umbrella,” private corporations may be disincentivized to invest in necessary cybersecurity measures and instead increase their risk tolerance (as per prospect theory). Cybersecurity is costly and time-consuming; saving on cybersecurity would likely increase corporations' profits, and energy and resources could be redirected to other parts of business.\nHowever, there are several considerations that would foreseeably mitigate this moral hazard. Corporations risk extreme reputational damage and services by relying too heavily on possible military defense: corporations must still provide adequate levels of cybersecurity that sufficiently defend against the vast majority of cyberattacks, which are criminal or low-level intrusions. Further, corporations would rather deal with cyber-defense issues in house and (as our interviewees noted) are wary about freely “opening the doors” to the military. These are serious objections to increasing military involvement. But it is also pertinent to examine the normative implications if states do not increase military involvement.\nFirst, the existing requirement for private corporations to be on the “front line” of cyber-defense of CI means demanding that civilians be responsible for defending against disastrous acts of (cyber)war. Even if they are not explicitly conscripted (more on this below) it is the civilian employees of those private sectors who nonetheless currently shoulder national cybersecurity duties. “Like the soldiers in the fortress,” Brenner and Clarke (emphasis added, 2010, 1032) reflect, “computer personnel confronting a cyberattack are responsible for defending their ‘territory' from hostile activity.”\nThis blurring of civilian and military spheres -- the expectation of civilians in corporations to not only contribute to but bear the weight of defending the state from cyber-attacks in war -- opens Pandora's box regarding pressing legal, normative, and practical questions. Is the expectation to participate in cyber-defense during war articulated in the employees' contracts? Are these civilian employees permitted to excuse themselves, or conscientiously object to participating in war, or will they be forced to fight, albeit with code over cobalt? Are employees aware of this possibility as part of their day job? If civilian operators on the cyber front-line “abandon their posts” -- literally removing hands from keyboards -- should they be court-martialed?\nWorse still: What if individual civilians, unbeknownst to their corporate managers, sympathize with the aggressor state, or have been compromised by the aggressor (via blackmail, bribery, or disinformation)? This may lead employees to feign cyber-defense and even aid the cyberattacker. Indeed, one of the interviewees worried that “moles are already there in the private sector,” and that such “moles” may be feeding sensitive information to adversaries, or even disrupting the systems on behalf of a foreign state (Participant 15, 2019). After all, these privately employed civilians (unlike military personnel) have not pledged allegiance to their (respective) flags. Even if the corporation leadership is patriotic, how can we be sure of the political allegiances of its civilian employees, especially as many are unlikely to have undergone security checks? If private corporations are “fighting” in war, might such corporations (or their CEOs, like Musk, or individual civilian operators) be tempted to aggressively hack-back?\nFurthermore, at what point does a civilian (both based in and, crucially, outside the country waging war) become a direct participant in hostilities and become a liable target for cyber and kinetic strikes under IHL? Horowitz (2024, 322) remarks that -- following an “expansive interpretation of the temporal element of [direct participation in hostilities (DPH)]” under IHL -- “a tech company employee who engages in DPH,” including strictly cyber-defense, “even if only infrequently during a work week from their office, might lose protection from attack not only while they engage in those specific acts of DPH but also continuously from morning to night and at home for an extended period of time.” Even if a narrow view of the temporal aspect of DPH is adopted -- wherein a civilian may only be targeted “for such time” that she is actively contributing to military activity via cyber-defense -- this dynamic creates a “revolving door” for civilians “who repeatedly engage in DPH”. Civilians forfeit and regain protection status depending on whether their hands are, quite literally in that moment, on the keyboard.\nCivilians who are completely oblivious of their contribution to hostilities retain their protection status. Might that be an argument for not telling private corporation employees about their foreseeable role in defending against cyberattacks in war? This seems ethically dubious, as it raises a host of questions surrounding transparency and individuals' agency. Civilian tech employees also do not forfeit their protection status when acting in “self-defense or in defense of others against violence prohibited against IHL,” such as “looting, rape, and murder by marauding” (emphasis added, Melzer 2009, 61, cited in; Horowitz 2024, 319). But civilian employees would forfeit their protected status (and become liable to targeting) if they are knowingly responding to cyberattacks that are permissible under IHL. Further still, if an individual tech employee is engaged in DPH and commits a violation of IHL that amounts to war crimes, they become liable under international criminal law. To what extent are civilian employees aware of this when they join a private corporation and are expected to fight in (cyber)wars to protect CI?\nSecond, if the military is not responsible for defending privately owned CI from devastating cyberattacks triggering and during war, then this means acknowledging that the military is seemingly responsible for defending the civilian population only in certain ways when it comes to CI (Participant 3, 2019). To be precise, it means the military is responsible for: i) defending CI from attacks emanating from the “physical domain,” ii) thwarting cyberattacks that target their own military or government systems, iii) mounting offensive cyber operations against adversarial CI, and iv) intelligence gathering and (if possible) sharing with companies. Correspondingly, the civilian population must be made aware of, and consent to, the reality that an entire arm of the state will not be readied or resourced to protect against a catastrophic cyberattack against CI amounting to or during war.\nThird, as private corporations are required to shoulder enhanced duties to protect themselves (and the civilians who depend on them), they will be driven to amass more wealth and influence to fulfil the responsibilities demanded of them by states. After all, the flipside of the adage “with great power comes great responsibility” is with great responsibility comes the requirement to obtain the power to fulfil that responsibility. The foreseeable result is that private corporations will become even more powerful, and the public sector even more dependent on private corporations to guarantee national cybersecurity.\nThe worry, then, is that demanding private corporations to act like states means permitting -- indeed, requiring -- private corporations to fulfil the responsibilities of states. But private corporations are not states. CEOs are not democratically elected by the civilian populations they are (ostensibly) charged to protect. Their main pursuit is not protection but profit. There is no requirement for patriotism.\nMaybe these consternations are mute: private corporations could simply be subsumed under government control during war time via nationalization. Yet this dynamic circles back to the issues raised above pertaining to an overreliance on civilian consent or conscription. May individual employees conscientiously object to participating in war? If so, this will leave a lacuna for cyber-defense, as the military has not thus far been readied-and-resourced to respond (according to the interviewees). If not, this means conscripting employees to participate in war -- via cyber -- when they do not wish to; this may spell a cyber-equivalent to the “non-firing phenomenon” (where soldiers fail to shoot or to shoot accurately at the enemy). These questions highlight the further dissolution between civilians and the military in cyberspace.\nAs two interviewees noted: “by the time [the adversary is] in our systems, it's already too late” (Participant 18, 2019), and “if I were thinking about the current threats, I would be sleepless” (Participant 14, 2019). Relying heavily on private corporations and, crucially, their civilian employees to defend CI in war prompts a required reassessment and renegotiation regarding the role of the military (as the warfighting machine) in the digital age. Perhaps before states begin forcibly requiring civilian employees of private corporations to provide cyber-defense of CI in/as part of war, the military (alongside relevant public and private bodies) should be better equipped to help protect.\n## Conclusion NATO has long recognized cyberspace as a domain of war alongside air, land, and sea. Whilst the threat of cyberattacks has been widely debated, political and military leaders have consistently warned that adversaries will target CI with cyberattacks to initiate and prosecute conflict. Despite these concerns, there has been limited attention afforded to how Civil--Military Relations theory makes sense of cyberspace, and almost no empirical inquiry into how militaries understand their role in cyber-defense.\nTo fill this gap in defense studies literature, we conducted extensive, original elite interviews with military members across 12 NATO countries. Our data provided empirical evidence to confirm the theoretical opacity in cyber-CMR. It remains unclear at which point the military might be asked to get involved in the cyber-defense of CI, and it seems that they would not be capable to help, even in war. Militaries play a role in gathering and sharing intelligence, defending forward, and reacting (via cyber or kinetic measures) after the fact. But they do not play a role in actively defending civilian CI as they would in other domains of war (Participant 12, 2019). According to our interviewees, this is because the military could not act (effectiveness narrative), should not act (environment narrative), and is not permitted to act (authorization narrative). Instead, the interviewees pointed to the fact that private owners and operators of CI play a central role in war.\nGiven this dynamic, the article then explores concerns around allocation of financial resources, “dual-use” infrastructures, and “having faith” in the private sector to “do the right thing.” The final part of the paper then controversially asks whether the military ought to be more involved. This section unpacked the serious legal, normative, and practical considerations with the private sector -- specifically, their civilian employees -- being on the front line of cyber-defense in war. To what extent should civilian employees be expected to act qua the military to defend against a cyberattack triggering or occurring in war? Are engineers in private corporations aware that they could become a direct participant in hostilities under IHL (and thereby forfeit their protection status as civilians)? What are the consequences of civilians abandoning their post or refusing to partake in defensive war? May they -- should they -- be court-martialed?\nBy raising these questions, this article galvanizes future research into determining if and how the military should be more involved or whether and when civilians should be conscripted into cyberwars. Additional investigations should involve interviewing the private owners and operators of CI to ascertain i) their views on the military's role in defending their CI, and ii) how they understand their own role in cyber-defense in 21st century wars. Future research may also seek to determine whether greater military involvement into cyber-defense of CI could act as a deterrent against potential adversaries, contributing to a burgeoning literature debating the applicability of deterrence strategy in cyberspace (see Borghard and Lonergan 2023; Lilli 2021; Schneider 2019). Finally, further research could conduct a cross-cultural comparison to highlight differences among NATO states and examine how competitor states, such as Russia and China, guarantee their cyber-defense of CI in war. This is especially pertinent, as the CMR separation in such autocracies is less stark.\nIn conclusion, as one NATO senior military officer noted: How states provide for the defense of CI from cyberattacks that trigger and feature in war is “fundamentally a societal choice” (Participant 13, 2019). For now, the officer continued, “we are hoping and praying the private companies have their defenses in order” (Participant 13, 2019)."

However, cyberattacks against privately owned and operated civilian critical infrastructure (CI) are challenging this traditional distinction. Understanding the protection of CI from cyberattacks that constitute casus belli within NATO states is especially pressing, as the livelihoods of 1 billion people across 31 countries are at stake (NATO 2023a). In 2014, NATO formally acknowledged that cyberattacks could be considered an armed attack and thus could trigger Article 5 (Collective Defense) of the NATO Charter (NATO 2014). Since 2016, the Alliance has recognized cyberspace as a domain of military operations in which it \"must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea\" (NATO 2016a).

    "affirmed in 2021 that smaller cyberattacks could -- cumulatively -- amount to an armed attack (NATO 2021). More recently, the U.S. 2023 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy (U.S. DoD 2023, 7) notes: “U.S. adversaries regularly use malicious cyber activity to target our critical infrastructure. In crisis, they will seek to hinder U.S. military mobilization, sow chaos, and harm the American people.” This is because CI are the very “systems upon which modern society, economy, and polity are seen to depend” (CISA n.d.) and so the disruption or destruction of which would have severe consequences for national security. Indeed, as Haataja (2022, 425) notes, there is a pervasive “recognition of the potentially devastating impact that cyber operations on CI can have.”\n\nWhilst there has been significant development in mandatory regulation for private corporations regarding cyber-defense, the role of militaries in protecting civilian CI from cyberattacks that can trigger or occur in war has received very little empirical attention. This absence is curious, especially as the military is the traditional state organ tasked with defending the nation against external threats arising to the level of an armed attack.\n\nSuch a lacuna might be explained by the fact that the prevailing theoretical approach to the role of the military -- Civil--Military Relations (CMR) -- struggles to coherently account for cyberspace as a new “domain” of conflict. Cyberspace raises questions pertaining to the role of the military in 21st century conflicts, creating tensions between prevailing CMR assumptions and the new ways in which wars are fought. This is because “cyberspace pushes questions of traditional boundaries of sovereignty, as well as blurs lines between the civilian and security sector” (Lantis and Bloomberg 2018, 152). State-sponsored adversarial attacks in cyberspace even challenge the very notion of war itself (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022). As a result, there is a theoretical opacity in CMR regarding the military's duties in defending privately owned civilian CI from cyberattacks that both trigger and occur in war.\n\nGreater scholarly enquiry is therefore required to interrogate this theoretical muddiness inherent in cyber-CMR. Specifically, almost no empirical attention has been afforded to test whether this cyber-CMR tension is reflected in the military's own understanding of its role in cyber-defense of civilian CI. This article aims to fill this gap. It does so by drawing on 31 semi-structured interviews and 1 focus group with cyber experts from 12 NATO states to test this theoretical opacity. How do military cyber experts from NATO member states understand their role in defending critical infrastructure against cyberattacks? We find that -- unlike acts of aggression emanating from land, air, and sea -- NATO military members believe they can not, should not, and are not authorized to defend CI against cyberattacks that could constitute casus belli. Instead, despite recognizing that cyberattacks against CI could trigger or form part of “the next war”, NATO member states rely on private owners and operators for the provision and protection of CI. This finding is crucial, as it challenges preconceived notions of the military taking the lead in defending the state (including from cyberattacks) during war. Departing from the extant literature, the article then critically explores the practical and normative implications of having private corporations on the front line of cyber-defense of CI, and the military taking a backseat during (cyber)war.\n\nThe paper begins with an overview of the prevailing theoretical framework for understanding the role of the military in conflict -- CMR. This is crucial to make sense of how militaries understand their role in defending the nation in/through cyberspace. After a review of the article's methodology, we present the empirical data obtained from the",
    "interviews. This is followed by a discussion of the findings, highlighting the problematic logic of the current dynamic, and a normative and practical consideration of whether the military ought to be more involved in cyber-defense of civilian CI. The conclusion summarizes the findings and scopes avenues for future research.\n\n## (Cyber) Civil--Military Relations\n\nCMR elucidates the relationship between the armed forces, the people, and the state's civilian authorities: it stresses civilian control over the military, defines what it means to be a professional soldier in a democratic society (Huntington 1957; Janowitz 1960), and identifies which items of the national security agenda fall to the military (Finer 1962; Huntington 1957). It is with this latter aspect of CMR with which we are principally concerned because it pertains to the role of the military in cyber operations, and in the protection of critical infrastructure. The consensus in the literature and in practice has been to try to maintain the separation between the military and civilians when it comes to critical infrastructure protection (CIP) (Pačka and Mareš 2021). However, the development of cyberspace challenges the foundational theoretical assumptions of CMR in three ways.\n\nFirst, cyberspace inherently blurs the traditional division between foreign and domestic theatres, which has authorization complexities for the military operating on home soil. One of the main tenets of CMR is that the military “does not generally operate or deploy domestically” (Rudesill 2021, 247--248). As a result, the focus of the military (acting on behalf and at the behest of the civilian government) has been on defending against physical, foreign threats. Yet, this view has been somewhat altered since the collapse of the Soviet Union, when the new threat environment drew to the fore a more diverse set of security imperatives. Non-traditional security threats, such as terrorism, civil conflicts, pandemics, and natural disasters, have “compelled a world-wide re-thinking of the roles and missions of armed forces” within the CMR literature (Diamond, and Plattner 1996, x). “[V]irtually everywhere”, Bruneau and Matei (2012, 2) contend, “militaries and other security instruments are taking on new roles and missions”, such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR).\n\nThe changing character of national security forces militaries to adapt to a wider array of missions and to develop a broader purpose. But the military's focus largely remains on providing security from physical, external threats (Goodman 1996). In the 21st century, technological transformations altered the character of security and war yet again, forcing scholars to question whether CMR needs to be adjusted to protect states in “non-traditional battlefields,” notably cyberspace and outerspace. The boundaries between domestic and external security threats became increasingly obscured by transnational digital information systems (Rudesill 2021).\n\nAn important implication of this reality for CMR is a change of the main locus of military operations: “soldiers operating on the home front” might come to be seen as the rule rather than the exception (Rudesill 2021, 248). As put by Burton (2015, 302), cyberattacks “occur over a globally linked network of computer systems and can be launched without warning, in milliseconds, from anywhere on the planet.” Cyberspace, he argues, creates a new challenge for security organizations like NATO, which has “traditionally focused on geographically",
    "proximate security threats” (Burton 2015, 302). This brought others to argue that soldiers will be securing networks and countering intrusions against critical infrastructure (Jensen and Work 2018). The nature of transnational cyber threats, therefore, has important implications for the future role of the military, urging states to reconsider whether a physical, territorial distinction -- a separation between domestic and foreign theatres of operations -- is justified (or indeed even possible) in cyberspace.\n\nSecond, cyberspace challenges CMR's clear distinction between civilian and military domains because the cyberspace environment is inherently different from that of traditional, physical domains of war (land, air, and sea). As such, the traditional CMR boundaries between military and civilian spheres have become increasingly hazy. Pačka and Mareš (2021, 437) note: “In a common national security and defense ecosystem, the roles of players such as an army, police, intelligence agency, and others are set clearly and there is an evident division of labor ... cyberspace constantly changes the boundaries.” Cyberspace is “blurring the lines between the traditional expertise of the uniformed military and the roles and responsibilities of civilians” (Beehner, Brooks, and Maurer 2021, 5). This is especially the case because aggressions in cyberspace often target civilian persons or infrastructure (Sewall 2021).\n\nAs militaries become more involved in the cyber domain, they will inevitably conduct their operations over “international and domestic computer infrastructure that supports the dense lattice of digital-age civilian life” (Rudesill 2021, 248). As Sharpe, Trichas, and Terrill (2024, 5) note, “recognition of ... cyberspace as a critical domain ... represents a paradigm shift in military strategy.” Further distorting the distinction between civilian and military spheres is the fact that technological infrastructure is often dual-use and that militaries rely increasingly on civilian networks for their own operations (Fasana 2018). Consensus amongst CMR scholars seems to be that the uniqueness of the cyber domain requires “unorthodox” and innovative approaches to the organization of security and defense (Kallberg and Cook 2017, 8130), challenging, in the words of Brooks (2016, 359), existing “walls” between civilians and the military. As summarized by Chayes (2015, 187): “Civil and military roles are not easily sorted out in the area of cyberattacks and cyber warfare.”\n\nThird, cyberspace forces a revision not only of what it means to fight wars and of who is involved in warfighting but of the delineation between war and peace itself (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022; Sewall 2021). Constant contact and interconnectedness are key features of cyberspace, favoring initiative and pre-emption over passivity and reactive defense, meaning that states are incentivized to persistently exploit adversary vulnerabilities in order to gain and maintain the advantage (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022). This challenges the dominant Western understanding of war, premised on “use of force” and “armed attack” as the crossing of what is usually considered to be the boundary between war and peace. Unlike with conventional warfare, there is seemingly no strict division between war and peace in cyberspace. States are in a constant state of competition. NATO holds the view that “cyberspace is contested at all times” (NATO 2022). Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett (2022, 123) argue that this requires a paradigm shift in policy and strategy planning, one that would focus on an “increased tempo” of cyber military operations outside their own network, and continuous preparation and execution of cyber campaigns.",
    "As the complexities of cyberspace are challenging the long-held clear division between war and peace, by extension, the clear separation between civilian and military spheres is also contested. Is there a need for “an increased tempo” of cyber military operations not only outside the defense's network but outside the unique context of war? That the military might play a role outside of warfighting is not new to cyberspace, as discussed above, and so it is justified to address the challenge of continuous competition in cyberspace and activities occurring in this space between peace and war.\n\nThe question that then flows from this is whether it matters at all when a cyberattack against CI reaches the threshold of an armed attack and triggers Article 5, especially with regards to the roles and responsibilities of cyber-defense. Surely, it does matter, because -- traditionally -- if states are at war, different agents become responsible for action (namely, the military). Yet in cyberspace, this does not seem to be the case, with this responsibility being entrusted to private actors even during conflict. Instead, it seems that the dissolution of the war-peace continuum in cyberspace is making it difficult for states to identify the appropriate response to cyberattacks against the nation's CI, both during the crisis phase, before Article 5 is invoked, and during war. It is with these kinds of cyberattacks, that could constitute casus belli or occur in war, that this article is concerned.\n\nOwing to these complexities, it is unclear “whether civil-military relations are sufficiently calibrated to protect ... in these non-traditional battlefields” where “warfare encompass[es] ... less-understood cyber-tools” (Beehner, Brooks, and Maurer 2021, 3). The foundational assumptions built into CMR paradigmatically accept that the military's role is in defending against physical, external threats, focused within war time and is wedded to the distinction between civilian and military responsibilities. But, as others have noted, cyberspace generates theoretical tensions regarding the applicability of these three a priori accepted precepts.\n\n## Research design and methodology: NATO case study\n\nIf cyberattacks on CI will inevitably feature in 21st century conflicts, then it is urgent to understand if and how the military, as the institution responsible for warfighting and defense on behalf of the state, understands its role. In other words, it is of paramount importance to test whether existing theoretical tensions are reflected empirically -- by going straight to the source. The justification for casing our study to NATO is because the alliance represents a significant proportion of the global population and serves as a key exemplar of dominant Western perspectives.\n\nWe conducted 31 semi-structured interviews with military and defense cyber subject matter experts (SMEs) from 12 NATO member states, and 1 focus group of 7 military cyber experts. Representatives from Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Estonia, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US) participated in the research. These countries were chosen based on access (at the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Tallinn and at the NATO Headquarters in Brussels) and expertise within the NATO alliance regarding cyber-defense, including states that are technologically advanced and at the forefront of cyber affairs in practice, and others that are not as well positioned. Among NATO states, cyber-defense of CI is a national responsibility and as such, strategies vary across nations but clear similarities can be found. This illustrates that regardless of a state's level of",
    "“cyber-awareness,” most NATO members share similar views on the role of the military regarding the cyber-defense of CI. It also illuminates an apparent disconnect between traditional CMR assumptions regarding the role of the military in territorial defense against external threats and current military perceptions across NATO states. It is also important to note that cyber-offense has its own very specific construct -- Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies (SCEPVA) -- which we do not explore in this paper.\n\nBy “cyber subject matter experts” we mean military members (officers and enlisted) and civilians (policy advisors) working for defense ministries and at the NATO Headquarters, whose principal occupation is with matters of cyberspace -- both offense and defense. The interview participants included senior military officials (including two-star generals) and cyber experts and lawyers from the military and other government departments (including ministries of defense and intelligence agencies) from NATO member states.\n\nInterviewees were assured that their views would not be taken as representative of NATO or their “home” state, military, or department, and that their identity would be anonymized. Accordingly, quotes have not been assigned to specific roles or states in order to mitigate the risks associated with attribution, particularly those arising from cross-referencing. The goal of conducting these interviews was not to examine differences in cultural approaches across NATO members, although this would be a valuable future study.\n\nA note on limitations. One limitation pertaining to the approach of this research is that, by focusing on military perspectives only, the research excludes other crucial stakeholders such as private-sector partners and other public agencies like police, local cyber task forces and computer emergency response teams (CERTS). Notably, we do not examine what the private owners and operators of CI (CEOs and/or employees) consider as the appropriate role of the military in cyber-defense. This question, albeit important, requires a separate, substantive future investigation -- one that, due to space constraints, we could not explore here. Instead, our interest lies with understanding the military's role in defending the nation against cyberattacks, a question that is best answered by those working in defense who are across the current military cyber posture. That said, the participants also included representatives from intelligence agencies, who work closely with their military counterparts and who have important responsibilities in both cyber-offense and cyber-defense in many countries. These interviewees were well placed to differentiate the role of the military and that of intelligence agencies in responding to a cyber event, confirming some issues raised by defense interviewees in terms of cyber-CMR.\n\n## NATO militaries' perceptions of cyber-defense of CI\n\nIn the words of the interviewees, the purpose of the military is to “serve, protect, and defend” the state and the population against foreign aggression. However, when asked how the military discharges this responsibility to protect citizens from adversarial cyberattacks on CI either triggering or happening in war, all of the interviewees stated that the military was ill-suited or ill-prepared to intervene, even in the case where it might be asked to do so. We also found that, despite cyberspace being recognized as a domain of",
    "military operations, military members' understanding of their role reflects the complexities of the cyber war-peace continuum. Three recurring narratives emerged from the interviewees when describing the limits of their role. Each chime with the three tensions articulated in cyber-CMR above: the uniqueness of the domain, the blurring of foreign/domestic theaters, and what this means for understanding war. To begin, however, we survey how militaries presently engage in cyber-defense of CI.\n\n### Defending forward, persistent engagement, and integrated deterrence\n\nNATO member militaries are engaged in collecting, analyzing, and exchanging intelligence with other government agencies, the private sector, and NATO allies (U.S. DoD 2023). Information collection and sharing is considered an integral aspect of cyber-defense (NATO 2016b, U.S. DoD 2023). When private corporations identify a threat in their system and pass that information along to government agencies, such public agencies then make recommendations regarding how the private companies ought to rectify the vulnerability and voluntarily assist in that process (which, in many instances, can be declined by the corporation). Yet, importantly (for reasons we explore below), according to one of our interviewees: “the government won't go into anyone's systems: they have a coordination role, but otherwise it's hands off the keyboard” (Participant 18, 2019).\n\nMoreover, NATO state militaries are authorized (and indeed required) to take proactive measures to ensure the cybersecurity of their own military systems -- principally to ensure continued operability across the traditional, physical domains of armed conflict. The desire to enhance the cyber resilience of the Alliance was reiterated at the 2023 Vilnius Summit (NATO 2023b). As a senior military officer explained, however, “the primary concern of the military is to ensure our cyber systems are working so we can do kinetic defense: the military has a monopoly on kinetic defense, not cyber” (Participant 12, 2019).\n\nA few of the interviewees stated that the military is engaged in what has long been understood as “active defense:” “defensive operations that involve direct engagement with sophisticated adversaries in DoD-controlled cyberspace” (DARPA 2012). The U.S. in particular has employed the notion of “defending forward” (Healey 2019; Kosseff et al. 2019) which aims to pre-emptively “stop threats before they reach their targets” (U.S. Department of Defense 2018, 2) and which was developed in response to criticisms that the military was not proactively defending critical infrastructure against cyberattacks (Former US Cyber Command official, personal communication with author, 2020). “Defending forward,” “active defense,” and “persistent engagement” were born out of the recognition that the U.S. could not expect private corporations to defend themselves against the full power of an adversarial state. Both approaches form part of what the U.S. now regards as “integrated deterrence,” developed in the most recent DoD Cyber Strategy (2023, 2), which focuses on using military cyber capabilities “in concert with other instruments of national power.”\n\nFurther still, the military would likely be the apparatus called upon by the state in the “response” phase of a devastating cyberattack (Participants 8, 14, 16, 22). The military would be responsible for launching a cyber or kinetic counter-offensive, following appropriate attribution processes (proportionality, necessity, and distinction factors",
    "considered). But such responses are necessarily ex post facto. As was expressed in the focus group (2019): “Reacting after the fact is a losing strategy.” Until then, the front line of defense -- with public sector support, especially intelligence agencies -- is the private corporations.\n\n### The effectiveness narrative: can not\n\nPreviously, it has been thought that -- in the context of NATO and specifically the U.S. -- the resources and expertise on cyber-defense and cyberwar was retained by the military (Burton 2015; O'Connell 2012). Our empirical evidence finds the opposite to be the case. Most of the interviewees argued that their respective militaries currently lack the necessary resources, human-power, and relevant expertise required to effectively defend CI from cyberattacks. As a result, the interviewees consistently highlighted that, due to the nature of the domain, the military is unable to protect civilian CI from cyberattacks -- even those that can trigger or occur in war. One interviewee compared this lack of cyber capability with traditional, kinetic attacks: “The military is the only institution or organization to defend against armed attacks, because they're the only ones who have fighter planes. But in a cyberattack, Cyber Command won't be first [to respond], because they don't have the capability” (Participant 19, 2019). Another senior military officer (Participant 3, 2019) reflected that attention ought to be focused on pragmatically determining which organization is likely to be most successful in providing cyber-defense: “It's about having the right tools, and the right knowledge ... the military might not be best placed to defend certain infrastructure.” For instance, interviewees rightly pointed out that in many countries intelligence agencies play a significant role in the cyber-defense of the nation and its critical infrastructure, notably by advising and assisting other government agencies and the private sector (see for instance GCHQ n.d.; Government of Canada n.d.).\n\nA few interviewees also noted that because the private corporations that own and operate CI use different and often “tailor-made” platforms, it would be almost impossible for cyber experts in the military to be sufficiently knowledgeable to defend across all the different systems. It is “unimaginable” for the military to help, one interviewee reflected, “because they are completely unfamiliar with the systems” (Participant 9, 2019).\n\nSome of the interviewees argued that it would be financially ineffective or even prohibitively expensive to have the military provide cyber-defense for CI: it is “better to let the private sector deal with it,” because having the government provide the cyber-defense for critical infrastructure would be “implausible and expensive” (Participant 12, 2019). “Private corporations should be responsible,” one interviewee stated, “otherwise there would be a lot of taxpayers' money required to provide [protection for] those systems -- like a ‘cybersecurity tax' for providing cyber-defense of critical infrastructure” (Participant 9, 2019). The interviewees' perception echoes the sentiment highlighted in the literature on critical infrastructure protection that private owners are best placed to establish cyber-defenses (Carr 2016; Dunn Cavelty and Suter 2009; Newlove-Eriksson, Giacomello, and Eriksson 2018; Pačka and Mareš 2021).",
    "The environment narrative: should not\n\nWhen discussing why the military does not play a greater role in protecting CI from cyberattacks -- as they would if the “armed attack” was emanating from other domains of war -- the interviewees stated that this is because “cyberspace is fundamentally different” (Participant 15, 2019). The participants overwhelmingly referred to cyberspace's ubiquitous, borderless, fluid, and invisible nature. The interviewees emphasized the relatively abstract characteristics of cyberspace identified in the literature (Barnard-Wills and Ashenden 2012; Branch 2021; Mainwaring 2020; Wright 2018) as affecting the military's ability to help defend. One government official simply stated: “cyber is a different domain; we haven't figured out how it works” (Participant 22, 2019). Another interviewee reflected: “In cyber, the fog of war is heightened” (Participant 11, 2019). Interviewees also referred to the difficulty of determining whether sovereignty is applicable to cyberspace and where borders might begin and end, thereby touching on the ongoing debate between NATO member states about whether sovereignty is applicable to cyberspace.\n\nIn most instances, the interviewees' reference to sovereignty was intended to highlight that, unlike in sea, air, and land -- which have clear, physical borders that can be transgressed -- cyberspace has no such border. The interviewees often highlighted the difficulty of defending against cyberattacks by comparing cyberspace with the physical domains of warfighting: “You can see equipment like frigates and airplanes,” one interviewee noted, “but you can't see firewalls or malicious code” (Focus group 2019).\n\nA majority of interviewees also argued that the military does not have a significant role in defending CI from cyberattacks that could trigger war or happen in war because -- again, in contrast to the physical domain -- it is an “unchartered territory” and so “the line between government and private” is “blurred” (Participants 16, 18 and 26, 2019). A few interviewees drew parallels with the other services, claiming that “we've had an army, navy, and air force for a long time, but cyberspace is new” (Participant 13, 2019). These comments are reminiscent of the remarks made by Lt. Col. Kurt Sanger, Chief Judge Advocate for National Security Law at U.S. Cyber Command at the 2019 CyCon U.S: “For most of the domains, you have thousands of years and millions of warriors contributing to the lessons that you're now learning ... We don't have that in cyberspace” (Sanger 2019, quoted in Pomerleau 2019). In short, cyberspace itself was thought by the interviewees as an inherently exposed space, with points of vulnerabilities too vast to comprehend. As one officer put it, “cyberspace is un-defendable” (Participant 12, 2019). These responses align with what Cate (2015, 307) identifies as the prevailing “sense of despair about the size and complexity of the challenge.”\n\nOur empirical evidence highlights that the military believes it should not play a significant role in defending CI. In doing so, it thereby supports the extant theoretical claim that cyberspace distorts the lines between the domestic vs. foreign spheres and forces an alteration of traditional territorial and sovereign conceptions of defense. This further illustrates the dissolution of the traditional division between civilian and military sectors in CMR due to the unprecedented nature of the domain.",
    "The authorization narrative: not permitted\n\nThe last narrative that emerged from the interviewees' responses is that of “authorization.” A third of the interviewees noted that the military is not permitted to operate on domestic soil. Typically, within NATO states, the military is not automatically authorized to conduct what are considered police enforcement duties: for instance, the U.S. Posse Comitatus Act, signed in 1878, is designed to prohibit the deployment of the military to enforce domestic civilian policies and practices “unless expressly authorized by the Constitution or an act of Congress” (Congressional Research Service 2018). It seems that this is what most of the interviewees were referring to when raising concerns regarding “authorization.” Many participants explained that this is a “design reality” of the democratic system, which means that states are constrained and restrained by their legal environment (Participants 1, 2 and 13, 2019). As one interviewee articulated, “the legislation is not adjusted for the realities of cyberspace” (Participant 7, 2019), while another reflected, “if we want to live in a liberal, democratic society, this is what we get” (Participant 17, 2019).\n\nSome interviewees highlighted that the military would be called upon, by the state, to operate in the territory of that sovereign state in the instance that there is an actual use of physical force against the state. As one interviewee explained: “Obviously if our ‘friends' in the East rolled tanks across the border right now, our forces would be authorized to act in the state to repel that assault. It wouldn't be the police's job” (Participant 15, 2019).\n\nAdditionally, a few interviewees raised concerns regarding privacy as a barrier to greater military involvement. One military officer noted that: “[People] are OK that we have ships, border patrol, flight deterrence ... But with cyber, people don't want the government to look into their Internet connectivity” (Participant 18, 2019). Overall, the interviewees consistently stated that the military would be called upon to protect the sovereign state from a land invasion, naval assault, or airborne missile strike against CI -- but this would not be the case regarding a comparable assault emanating from cyberspace.\n\nThe three narratives empirically confirm the tension highlighted in the literature on cyber-CMR. It further resonates with the 2023 U.S. Cyber Strategy that the Department of Defense “lacks the authority to employ military forces to defend private companies against cyberattacks” and that there are “limited circumstances in which military cyber forces would be asked to defend civilian critical infrastructure -- the Department will not posture itself to defend every private sector network” (U.S. DoD 2023, 13). In short, NATO member militaries do not believe they play a major role in cyber-defense of CI that initiates or occurs amidst war due to environment, effectiveness, and authorization complexities. As one interviewee noted: “There is a contradiction between the fear of cyberattacks, [and the fact that] we [the people] ... don't want the military to play a bigger role” (Participant 18, 2019).\n\n## Critical discussion of the military perspective\n\nThere are three key findings that arise from the empirical evidence. First: the military members affirm the perception of the blurred nature of cyber-CMR described above. Second: the minimal military involvement raises urgent questions regarding CI that will",
    "be targeted in war. Third: while regulations have improved in the past few years, it is the private corporations that are principally responsible for protecting CI from sophisticated state-sponsored cyberattacks during war. These findings invite a re-examination of the role of the military in 21st century conflicts.\n\n### A reflection of political will and political choices\n\nOne of the explanations invoked by the interviewees for why the military is not more involved in the cyber-defense of CI is because the military currently lacks the financial and human resources to do so (the effectiveness narrative). Some might claim that it is unreasonable to reassign some military funding for cyber-defense of CI in the face of “defense austerity” -- although in the U.S. this notion is debatable, as the proposed 2024 budget for the entire DoD totaled $842 billion (Congressional Budget Office 2023). One interviewee argued that this objection is misplaced, as taking proactive security measures prior to an “inevitable cyberattack against critical infrastructure” is a more fiscally responsible decision from the outset (Participant 4, 2019).\n\nFunds already allocated to the acquisition of traditional kinetic weapons could (again, hypothetically) be redirected toward: the military's development of defensive cyber technologies for CI, the recruitment of more military cyber personnel, and the expansion and implementation of CIP military training programs. Other interviewees instead reiterated an absence of political will for states to invest highly in something as intangible as cybersecurity: “Guns and tanks and fighter jets are sexier. They're sexier and easier for politicians to show off for their next election campaign, that they're doing something for national security ... [They're] not really able to show off lines of code” (Focus group, 2019).\n\nAside from the fiscal element is the ostensible “novelty” and “unknowable-ness” of cyberspace as to why they “should not” be involved in defense of CI (the environment narrative). Confusion surrounding cyberspace's distinct character is something that is debated in the literature (Bringsjord and Licato 2015). Nonetheless, there is a risk of “succumbing to the shock of the new” (Betz and Stevens 2011, 87). Erroneously perceiving the form of a domain as inherently enigmatic stymies progress toward establishing effective defense systems. Considering other “newer” domains of war, one interviewee compared cyberspace to the air force: no “historical accident ... the air force was born out of the need for defense from attacks in airspace in the 20th century” (Participant 28, 2019). It is a political choice to allocate the main face of defense in war to private corporations.\n\nMoreover, whilst the military is prima facie prohibited from operating on domestic soil, the authorization narrative should be interrogated further. Indeed, the military could -- and would -- be called upon by the state to operate in its sovereign territory if there is an actual use of physical force tantamount to an armed attack. In the face of cyberattacks that do reach the level of an armed attack and that could trigger NATO's Article 5, conceivably, the military would be authorized to get involved in the cyber-defense of civilian CI systems. Theoretically at least, cyber aggressions comparable to armed attacks do not pose a significantly new challenge for civil--military relations. Nonetheless, the research finds that even with this kind of attack that could constitute casus belli, or occur during war, uncertainty remains within the military regarding the",
    "extent to which they would be authorized (or able) to get involved in the cyber-defense of private networks. Even when faced with cyberattacks that would amount to an armed attack, or during war, the military would not be able to effectively help defend CI. The militaries' current (and limited) ability and expectation to provide cyber-defense of CI is a political calculation. One defense personnel reflected: “I feel that there is a growing need for more cyber units in the military, and since cyber has now been recognized as a proper domain of armed conflict on par with air, land, sea and in some cases also space, I think it will happen ... It is just a question of how it will evolve, and through which means. (Participant 16, 2019)”\n\nNevertheless, according to the interviewees, this is likely only after some “catastrophic” cyberattack on CI (Participants 8 and 29, 2019). The current decision to rely heavily on private corporations, albeit with mandatory reporting and compliance mechanisms, is a political choice.\n\n### Concerns surrounding “dual-use” infrastructures\n\nA further implication of minimal military involvement is how to deal with “dual-use” CI. Civilian CI has been and will continue to be targeted by adversarial actors as part of war (Wallace and Reeves 2020). One interviewee stated: “There is no such thing as a ‘military' cyberattack; 90% of the time it will be against civilian infrastructure” (Participant 22, 2019). According to another: “Adversaries will -- and already do -- attack critical infrastructure as a primary target via cyberspace, because it's what we would do” (Participant 7, 2019). States will likely seek to disable CI in war in order to gain a military advantage.\n\nAs per international cyber norms regarding responsible state behavior, there is a prohibition of “cyber operations that cause intentional damage or impairment to critical infrastructure (CI)” (Haataja 2022, 423). CI should be -- in the words of then U.S. President Joe Biden -- “‘off limits' to attack” (cited in Haataja 2022, 425). Of course, only military objects and combatants are liable to be lawfully targeted in war; according to the International Humanitarian Law (IHL) principle of distinction, intentionally targeting civilians and civilian CI (including via cyber) is prohibited (ICRC 2023). Nevertheless, the urgency of preparing the military to contribute to the defense of CI is even more apparent given the potential for civilian CI to be rendered a liable military objective. This is because civilian CI can: i) become co-opted for military purposes, ii) have a “military utility,” or iii) be “dual-use” (Schmitt 2017, 128--135).\n\nThere are three concerns raised here. First, if (privately owned) CI networks become “dual-use” or are of “military utility,” they become military objectives and thus may be lawfully targeted. As Horowitz (2024, 327) notes: a “privately owned civilian aviation air traffic control tower that the enemy military temporarily uses to enable offensive operations” might be rendered a military objective “because of its ‘use.'” Moreover, according to the Tallinn Manual 2.0: if critical infrastructure is being used by both civilian and military ends, and it is “impossible” to differentiate between the civilian and military parts of a system, “the entire network ... qualifies as a military objective” (Schmitt 2017, 135).\n\nSecond, because of the invisible nature of cyberspace, it is additionally challenging to differentiate between civilian vs. military cyber infrastructures. As such, there is",
    "foreseeably a large scope for misinterpretation and accidental military targeting of CI. Third, it is unclear whether preparatory acts on “dual-use” infrastructures during peacetime -- such as the insertion of dormant malware -- constitutes an attack or strictly cyber-espionage. Haataja (2022, 424, 428) highlights that there is a danger for pre-positioned adversarial code in CI that could be activated later, a practice known as “persistent presence” in CI. Simply planting malware or creating “backdoors” certainly violates international cyber norms and could be considered a breach of a state's obligation under international law (others consider such cyber norms “voluntary, non-binding”) (Haataja 2022, 428--31). But such cyber-operations themselves are unlikely to rise to the level of an armed attack. Activating a dormant malware in a privately owned CI, such as a nuclear powerplant, causing it to explode, would foreseeably reach that threshold. All of this points to the complexity of defending CI from cyberattacks that constitute casus belli or may be pursued in war.\n\n### A degree of (risky) faith in the private sector\n\nPrivate corporations that own and operate CI ought to provide appropriate cyber-defensive measures -- especially to protect what one interviewee called “low-hanging fruits” (Participant 3, 2019). Nonetheless, as one interviewee noted: “We can't expect private companies to protect themselves against state-sponsored attacks” (Participant 23, 2019). Many interviewees expressed having “faith” in private corporations adhering to proper standards and regulations: “We hope they [the private corporations] do the right thing” (Participant 8, 2019).\n\nUsing the physical domain as an analogy, the private owners of a power grid would be expected to employ a reasonable degree of security -- locking doors, installing surveillance cameras, erecting wire fences, and employing security guards, and so on. However, the security guard would not be expected to defend against an attack that rises to a use of force tantamount with war. Defense from in-coming ballistic missiles would fall to the state and -- foreseeably -- the air force: “In the physical world, we don't require companies to have an air force, or submarines, or to really look at the pointy end of an attack” (Hanson 2021).\n\nYet whilst companies have oversight, assistance, and mandatory regulations from government, the front line of defense in cyberspace remains the purview of companies. It is often in their profit margins interests to ensure their cyber-defenses are in order, and to work closely and collaboratively with government agencies to redress vulnerabilities or incursions. Beyond purely monetary interests, corporations could be appealed to do so on the notion of “loyalty” (Christensen and Petersen 2017, 1440). They may be incentivized to effectively participate in the provision of cyber-defense based on “a moral commitment to ‘solidarity' and ‘community responsibility'” (Christensen and Petersen 2017, 1440). One senior government official iterated this patriotic duty to “protect our lifestyle” (Participant 22, 2019). For instance, when asked about who is defending Ukrainian CI from Russian cyberattacks, one retired general responded: “The private corporations in Ukraine are doing an excellent job” (General [retd.], personal communication with author, 2022). Similarly, Matania and Sommer (2023, 3) note that “Tech Titans” (Google,",
    "Microsoft, Meta, Apple, SpaceX and Amazon) are playing a meaningful role in the armed conflict in Ukraine.\n\nThat said, as one interviewee reflected: “appealing towards companies' patriotism ... is probably not the safest way to do things” (Participant 13, 2019). Even if a private corporation is “homegrown,” it does not guarantee that they are, in fact, patriotic. “Company Over Country” was Meta CEO and Founder Mark Zuckerberg's early motto (Losse 2018). Similarly, the whistle blower Haugen (2021, 2) iterated that -- when torn between “its own profits and [the U.S.'] safety,” Meta “consistently ... favor[ed] its own profits.” This demonstrates that American-owned corporations have prioritized financial gains over that of the security of the American people. Such a dynamic becomes even more problematic if CI corporations in NATO member states are outsourced and owned by foreign corporations.\n\nPerhaps “profits before patriotism” is strictly a feature of peacetime: once it comes to war, the dynamic will flip. For instance, by May 2022 Google had pledged approximately $55 million in support of Ukraine's resistance of Russian aggression (Matania and Sommer 2023, 11). Similarly, within days of the full-scale invasion, Microsoft moved Ukraine's critical government data to its cloud storage platform (Microsoft 2022). This was because most of the data was “extremely vulnerable to missile attacks, and their physical destruction could paralyze the entire work of the country's top leadership” (Microsoft 2023).\n\nYet the view that corporations would be driven by patriotism (or, more accurately, defense of liberal values) over profit hinges on two, risky assumptions. In the first instance, it takes for granted that the CI private corporation heralds from, or is ideologically aligned with, the country under (cyber)attack -- which is not necessarily always the case. It supposes the private corporation may not be under pressure from the attacking-state or wishes to remain neutral, or had been convinced to allow the attack to take place (due to corruption, coercion, or ideological leanings). There is no guarantee for support. There is no expectation for patriotism even from corporations that are (for lack of a better word) “home grown.”\n\nIn the second instance, it is also not clear how long “patriotic” support or commitment to democratic liberal ideals -- even if it is forthcoming -- might last. While Elon Musk's SpaceX initially sent Starlink satellites to the Ukrainian military for free, it eventually stated it could no longer foot the bill, and the Pentagon had to pick up the tab -- once the reliance on Musk's service had been firmly established (conceivably with an agenda to accrue profits). Moreover, demonstrating the selectivity of private sector support, when the Ukrainian military conducted an offensive into the Russian-held Crimea, they begged Elon Musk to turn on its satellite service in the Russian-controlled area, but he refused to do so because (according to his post on X) he feared SpaceX's complicity in “a major act of war and conflict escalation” (Musk 2023). Betting on private corporations' patriotism and political alliances or appetite for war, over that of their foundational and raison d'être interests in profit, is to gamble with national (cyber) defense. If there is a profit to be made, corporations might choose to get involved in conflicts (even distant ones), but they might stop to be involved when it is no longer financially advisable.\n\nOur empirical data suggests that -- unlike kinetic acts of war emanating in land, air, and sea -- the military is not responsible for defending against state-sponsored acts of",
    "aggression against CI via cyberspace. However, trusting private corporations to adequately defend against cyberattacks in war is a risky security strategy.\n\n## Should militaries be more involved? Normative and practical considerations\n\nAs detailed in the previous section, multiple interviewees remarked on the risks associated with dual-use infrastructure and with being overly reliant on private corporations to provide cyber-defense of CI. Relatedly, some participants expressed concerns about not being readied and resourced to defend CI against cyberattacks. This prompts the question: might there be a case for increasing military involvement in cyber-defense of CI? After all, the military is the principal body responsible for defending civilians (on behalf of the state) from acts of aggression rising to war. Former NATO Deputy Secretary General Rose Gottemoeller et al. (2022) expressed the need for NATO Allies to be better prepared in response to cyberattacks. This requirement is especially pertinent, as Burton (2015, 302) remarks, “cyber operations are increasingly part of [conflicts involving NATO forces] and an element of the strategy of NATO's main state adversaries.” To be clear, we are not in any way suggesting a “military-takes-all,” zero-sum approach to defending CI from cyberattacks that trigger Article 5. The normative question is whether militaries should be readied -- as a last line of defense -- to help protect alongside private corporations and public bodies (such as intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and federal and local cyber task forces).\n\nOne objection to greater military involvement is the potential for escalation. A cyber-defensive operation led by the military could be perceived by an adversary as a cyber countermeasure, resulting in a “tit-for-tat escalation of cyberattacks and responses, each one more serious than the last” (Hollis and Ohlin 2018, 448). An increased role of the military in providing cyber-defense of CI may therefore lead to “a permissive normative-legal environment in which states are more likely than before to resort to uses of force” (Heinze and Neilsen 2020, 186).\n\nA related normative concern is that the increased role of the military in cyber-defense of CI begets the militarization of cyberspace. The perception of the military being involved in a civilian network, even for strictly defensive purposes, may render it a military target. But simply because the military may be called upon, as a last resort, to aid in the cyber-defense of CI does not render the civilian objective ipso facto a military target. In the same way that the military might be called upon to help defend a hospital (for instance) from kinetic attacks, the military presence does not automatically render the hospital a liable military objective.\n\nAnother further objection might be that introducing the military as an agent of cyber-defense of CI risks increasing the potential for abuse -- notably, through mass militarized surveillance or the military placing pressure on private corporations to act in certain ways. Relatedly, there may be normative concerns regarding competing authorities -- an unnecessary duplication of responsibilities and confusion over which entity precisely (the private organization vs. intelligence agency vs. the military) acts in what contexts. Within the extant literature, Public--Private Partnerships in CI protection are already regarded as notoriously fraught with complications pertaining to cooperation, information sharing, and trust (Carr 2016; Dunn Cavelty and Suter 2009). For instance, one interviewee noted that -- on the issue of information sharing of breaches -- “private companies won't ‘sho",
    "their hand' ... they would rather sell the intelligence than give it away for free” (Participant 9, 2019). Surely adding another agent into the mix will make cyber-defense more complex.\n\nA reply to these two objections is that the military should only get involved when: i) the private entity is unable or unwilling to respond, ii) that the aid of the existing public agencies is insufficient, or iii) that the cyberattack would (through its scale and effects) constitute an armed attack. What should be envisaged is a live, cooperative triage system, whereby the military might be deployed only to help defend CI, should the attack foreseeably trigger war or take place in war, or if other responders have failed to address the threat and require additional assistance.\n\nOne further objection is that increasing military involvement generates a moral hazard for the private sector. Specifically, if the military is offering a pseudo-“security umbrella,” private corporations may be disincentivized to invest in necessary cybersecurity measures and instead increase their risk tolerance (as per prospect theory). Cybersecurity is costly and time-consuming; saving on cybersecurity would likely increase corporations' profits, and energy and resources could be redirected to other parts of business.\n\nHowever, there are several considerations that would foreseeably mitigate this moral hazard. Corporations risk extreme reputational damage and services by relying too heavily on possible military defense: corporations must still provide adequate levels of cybersecurity that sufficiently defend against the vast majority of cyberattacks, which are criminal or low-level intrusions. Further, corporations would rather deal with cyber-defense issues in house and (as our interviewees noted) are wary about freely “opening the doors” to the military. These are serious objections to increasing military involvement. But it is also pertinent to examine the normative implications if states do not increase military involvement.\n\nFirst, the existing requirement for private corporations to be on the “front line” of cyber-defense of CI means demanding that civilians be responsible for defending against disastrous acts of (cyber)war. Even if they are not explicitly conscripted (more on this below) it is the civilian employees of those private sectors who nonetheless currently shoulder national cybersecurity duties. “Like the soldiers in the fortress,” Brenner and Clarke (emphasis added, 2010, 1032) reflect, “computer personnel confronting a cyberattack are responsible for defending their ‘territory' from hostile activity.”\n\nThis blurring of civilian and military spheres -- the expectation of civilians in corporations to not only contribute to but bear the weight of defending the state from cyber-attacks in war -- opens Pandora's box regarding pressing legal, normative, and practical questions. Is the expectation to participate in cyber-defense during war articulated in the employees' contracts? Are these civilian employees permitted to excuse themselves, or conscientiously object to participating in war, or will they be forced to fight, albeit with code over cobalt? Are employees aware of this possibility as part of their day job? If civilian operators on the cyber front-line “abandon their posts” -- literally removing hands from keyboards -- should they be court-martialed?\n\nWorse still: What if individual civilians, unbeknownst to their corporate managers, sympathize with the aggressor state, or have been compromised by the aggressor (via blackmail, bribery, or disinformation)? This may lead employees to feign cyber-defense and even aid the cyberattacker. Indeed, one of the interviewees worried that “moles are already there in the private sector,” and that such “moles” may be feeding",
    "sensitive information to adversaries, or even disrupting the systems on behalf of a foreign state (Participant 15, 2019). After all, these privately employed civilians (unlike military personnel) have not pledged allegiance to their (respective) flags. Even if the corporation leadership is patriotic, how can we be sure of the political allegiances of its civilian employees, especially as many are unlikely to have undergone security checks? If private corporations are “fighting” in war, might such corporations (or their CEOs, like Musk, or individual civilian operators) be tempted to aggressively hack-back?\n\nFurthermore, at what point does a civilian (both based in and, crucially, outside the country waging war) become a direct participant in hostilities and become a liable target for cyber and kinetic strikes under IHL? Horowitz (2024, 322) remarks that -- following an “expansive interpretation of the temporal element of [direct participation in hostilities (DPH)]” under IHL -- “a tech company employee who engages in DPH,” including strictly cyber-defense, “even if only infrequently during a work week from their office, might lose protection from attack not only while they engage in those specific acts of DPH but also continuously from morning to night and at home for an extended period of time.” Even if a narrow view of the temporal aspect of DPH is adopted -- wherein a civilian may only be targeted “for such time” that she is actively contributing to military activity via cyber-defense -- this dynamic creates a “revolving door” for civilians “who repeatedly engage in DPH” (Horowitz 2024, 322). Civilians forfeit and regain protection status depending on whether their hands are, quite literally in that moment, on the keyboard.\n\nCivilians who are completely oblivious of their contribution to hostilities retain their protection status (Horowitz 2024, 319). Might that be an argument for not telling private corporation employees about their foreseeable role in defending against cyberattacks in war? This seems ethically dubious, as it raises a host of questions surrounding transparency and individuals' agency. Civilian tech employees also do not forfeit their protection status when acting in “self-defense or in defense of others against violence prohibited against IHL,” such as “looting, rape, and murder by marauding” (emphasis added, Melzer 2009, 61, cited in; Horowitz 2024, 319). But civilian employees would forfeit their protected status (and become liable to targeting) if they are knowingly responding to cyberattacks that are permissible under IHL. Further still, if an individual tech employee is engaged in DPH and commits a violation of IHL that amounts to war crimes, they become liable under international criminal law (Horowitz 2024, 336). To what extent are civilian employees aware of this when they join a private corporation and are expected to fight in (cyber)wars to protect CI?\n\nSecond, if the military is not responsible for defending privately owned CI from devastating cyberattacks triggering and during war, then this means acknowledging that the military is seemingly responsible for defending the civilian population only in certain ways when it comes to CI (Participant 3, 2019). To be precise, it means the military is responsible for: i) defending CI from attacks emanating from the “physical domain,” ii) thwarting cyberattacks that target their own military or government systems, iii) mounting offensive cyber operations against adversarial CI, and iv) intelligence gathering and (if possible) sharing with companies. Correspondingly, the civilian population must be made aware of, and consent to, the reality that an entire arm of the state",
    "will not be readied or resourced to protect against a catastrophic cyberattack against CI amounting to or during war.\n\nThird, as private corporations are required to shoulder enhanced duties to protect themselves (and the civilians who depend on them), they will be driven to amass more wealth and influence to fulfil the responsibilities demanded of them by states. After all, the flipside of the adage “with great power comes great responsibility” is with great responsibility comes the requirement to obtain the power to fulfil that responsibility. The foreseeable result is that private corporations will become even more powerful, and the public sector even more dependent on private corporations to guarantee national cybersecurity.\n\nThe worry, then, is that demanding private corporations to act like states means permitting -- indeed, requiring -- private corporations to fulfil the responsibilities of states. But private corporations are not states. CEOs are not democratically elected by the civilian populations they are (ostensibly) charged to protect. Their main pursuit is not protection but profit. There is no requirement for patriotism.\n\nMaybe these consternations are mute: private corporations could simply be subsumed under government control during war time via nationalization. Yet this dynamic circles back to the issues raised above pertaining to an overreliance on civilian consent or conscription. May individual employees conscientiously object to participating in war? If so, this will leave a lacuna for cyber-defense, as the military has not thus far been readied-and-resourced to respond (according to the interviewees). If not, this means conscripting employees to participate in war -- via cyber -- when they do not wish to; this may spell a cyber-equivalent to the “non-firing phenomenon” (where soldiers fail to shoot or to shoot accurately at the enemy). These questions highlight the further dissolution between civilians and the military in cyberspace.\n\nAs two interviewees noted: “by the time [the adversary is] in our systems, it's already too late” (Participant 18, 2019), and “if I were thinking about the current threats, I would be sleepless” (Participant 14, 2019). Relying heavily on private corporations and, crucially, their civilian employees to defend CI in war prompts a required reassessment and renegotiation regarding the role of the military (as the warfighting machine) in the digital age. Perhaps before states begin forcibly requiring civilian employees of private corporations to provide cyber-defense of CI in/as part of war, the military (alongside relevant public and private bodies) should be better equipped to help protect.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nNATO has long recognized cyberspace as a domain of war alongside air, land, and sea. Whilst the threat of cyberattacks has been widely debated, political and military leaders have consistently warned that adversaries will target CI with cyberattacks to initiate and prosecute conflict. Despite these concerns, there has been limited attention afforded to how Civil--Military Relations theory makes sense of cyberspace, and almost no empirical inquiry into how militaries understand their role in cyber-defense.\n\nTo fill this gap in defense studies literature, we conducted extensive, original elite interviews with military members across 12 NATO countries. Our data provided empirical evidence to confirm the theoretical opacity in cyber-CMR. It remains unclear at which point the military might be asked to get involved in the cyber-defense of CI, and it seems",
    "that they would not be capable to help, even in war. Militaries play a role in gathering and sharing intelligence, defending forward, and reacting (via cyber or kinetic measures) after the fact. But they do not play a role in actively defending civilian CI as they would in other domains of war (Participant 12, 2019). According to our interviewees, this is because the military could not act (effectiveness narrative), should not act (environment narrative), and is not permitted to act (authorization narrative). Instead, the interviewees pointed to the fact that private owners and operators of CI play a central role in war.\n\nGiven this dynamic, the article then explores concerns around allocation of financial resources, “dual-use” infrastructures, and “having faith” in the private sector to “do the right thing.” The final part of the paper then controversially asks whether the military ought to be more involved. This section unpacked the serious legal, normative, and practical considerations with the private sector -- specifically, their civilian employees -- being on the front line of cyber-defense in war. To what extent should civilian employees be expected to act qua the military to defend against a cyberattack triggering or occurring in war? Are engineers in private corporations aware that they could become a direct participant in hostilities under IHL (and thereby forfeit their protection status as civilians)? What are the consequences of civilians abandoning their post or refusing to partake in defensive war? May they -- should they -- be court-martialed?\n\nBy raising these questions, this article galvanizes future research into determining if and how the military should be more involved or whether and when civilians should be conscripted into cyberwars. Additional investigations should involve interviewing the private owners and operators of CI to ascertain i) their views on the military's role in defending their CI, and ii) how they understand their own role in cyber-defense in 21st century wars. Future research may also seek to determine whether greater military involvement into cyber-defense of CI could act as a deterrent against potential adversaries, contributing to a burgeoning literature debating the applicability of deterrence strategy in cyberspace (see Borghard and Lonergan 2023; Lilli 2021; Schneider 2019). Finally, further research could conduct a cross-cultural comparison to highlight differences among NATO states and examine how competitor states, such as Russia and China, guarantee their cyber-defense of CI in war. This is especially pertinent, as the CMR separation in such autocracies is less stark.\n\nIn conclusion, as one NATO senior military officer noted: How states provide for the defense of CI from cyberattacks that trigger and feature in war is “fundamentally a societal choice” (Participant 13, 2019). For now, the officer continued, “we are hoping and praying the private companies have their defenses in order” (Participant 13, 2019).\n\n## Notes\n\n1. Participant 18.\n2. NATO does not provide a single universal definition of cyberspace. Based on its strategic documents, we can deduce, like Stevens and Burton (2023), that cyberspace is generally understood as “the global domain of interconnected information technology infrastructures.” This includes Internet and telecommunications networks, computer systems and networks, and data stored and transmitted through these systems.\n3. The current definition of CI in the U.S. includes 16 sectors: chemical, commercial, communications (regarded as especially critical due to its “enabling function” across all other CI), critical manufacturing, dams, defence industrial base, emergency services, energy,",
    "financial, food and agriculture, government facilities, healthcare, information technology (hardware, software, and the Internet), nuclear, transportation systems, water and waste. Other NATO members share similar definitions. See European Commission (2024); NPSA (n.d.); Public Safety Canada (n.d.).Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies (SCEPVA) refers to “the voluntary provision of cyber capabilities and effects by member nations to support collective defense and operational missions” (NATO n.d.).Eight other interviewees made the same comment.Some argue that the decentralised nature of cyberspace undermines the power of states and their control over physical territories; others suggest that cyberspace expands the extra-territorial capacities of states to promote their interests. See Deibert and Pauly (2019); Ministère des Armées (2019).Privacy falls beyond the scope of our investigation.It is important to note that there is opacity surrounding the intersection of international cyber norms and international law. See Hataaja (2022).We are grateful to one of the reviewers for pointing this out.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Tallinn, where we conducted this research, and the interviewees who participated in this study.

    "abstract": "Severe state and state-sponsored cyberattacks against critical infrastructure (CI) is a pressing issue in contemporary conflicts. NATO member states have recognized cyberspace as a new domain of war – one through which adversaries will target CI to both commence and prosecute conflict. Given this: How do NATO member state militaries understand their part in protecting civilian CI from cyberattacks that constitute casus belli? Drawing on original, empirical evidence – 31 interviews and 1 focus group with senior military, defense, and intelligence cyber experts from 12 NATO states – this article argues that militaries regard themselves as unable, unauthorized, and ill-suited to protect CI from cyberattacks that initiate or occur in war. Instead, NATO member states overwhelmingly rely on private corporations (notably their civilian employees) for the protection of CI – including in violent conflict. This article provides original, empirical evidence to confirm the claim that the theory of Civil-Military Relations (CMR) falters when applied to cyberspace. It also asks cutting normative questions attendant with private corporations being on the front line of cyber-defense during war and argues that cyberspace obfuscates the boundaries of modern-day conflicts. This forces a re-examination of the military's role in 21st century wars.",
