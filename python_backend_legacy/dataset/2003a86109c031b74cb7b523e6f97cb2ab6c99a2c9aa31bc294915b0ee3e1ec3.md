The application of this 'liberal cyber order' has been resisted by Russia and China who seek a greater role for the territorial state in cyberspace governance. They have long sought new, binding rules to this effect with little success. The UN cybercrime convention bucks the trend of informal, non-binding agreements in this domain. Through an empirical analysis of proposals advanced by Russia and China during negotiations toward the cybercrime convention, this article demonstrates how they have sought to use it to develop rules that blunt the advantages enjoyed by Western liberal economies and major transnational actors in the current order. Going beyond the regulation of cybercrime, Russian and Chinese proposals empower states to thwart disruptive and intelligence-gathering cyber operations that may be conducted globally by Western adversaries. Additionally, they enhance the state's regulatory capacity over private actors at home and abroad, limiting the ability of businesses or NGOs to shape cybersecurity and human rights standards around the transfer, retention and access of data.\n# KEYWORDS:\n- Cybercrime treaty\n- cyber sovereignty\n- liberal international order\n- cybersecurity governance\n# 1. Introduction\nWhat kind of global governance regime do China and Russia seek for cyberspace? As authoritarian states with strong restrictions on the online activities of individuals, businesses and NGOs, do they simply seek greater autonomy to regulate digital technologies in their territory without foreign intervention? China and Russia have been robustly engaged, for over two decades, in discussions on internet governance at the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) (Murgia and Gross Citation 2020; Yoo Citation 2023), regional cooperative institutions and multi-stakeholder entities such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) (Kennedy Citation 2013; Negro Citation 2020; Yan Citation 2015). Chinese and Russian proposals advanced at these forums have the effect of increasing states' capacity to manage the territorial conduct of private actors.\nThe proposals advanced by both states at international forums also signal their geopolitical interests in cyberspace. Discussions on international cybersecurity in the UN General Assembly's First Committee, where Russia and China have competed with the 'like-minded' Footnote 1 countries led by the United States and European Union on specific proposals, throw into relief those interests (Basu, Poetranto, and Lau Citation 2021; Tiirmaa-Klaar Citation 2021). Through their First Committee proposals, Russia and China have sought to limit the ability of Western adversaries to engage in offensive cyber operations against their digital assets and infrastructure, and simultaneously to legitimize their own strategies and practices (for example, their increasing use of proxies or 'cyber mercenaries') (Maurer Citation 2017; Sukumar Citation 2017).\nBy dint of institutional design and the fragmented nature of the cyber 'regime complex' (Nye Citation 2014), discussions on internet governance, cybercrime and norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace have hitherto taken place across a number of international forums. This fragmentation has occluded from analysis a complete picture of the systemic changes that Russia and China pursue for the governance of cyberspace. Given that they are major cyber powers, it is important to understand whether and why both states seek to influence how other states govern territorial networks to advance their own broader geopolitical and geoeconomic ambitions for the domain. For instance, China and Russia would want for other states to have greater agency over domestic networks, whether for the purpose of requesting them to thwart Western cyber operations, curtail the growing influence of Western technology companies whom they see as proxies of the US or its allies, or clamp down on foreign voices and institutions critical of them. Conversely, implementing tougher restrictions on online activity at home may often require China and Russia to seek data from abroad for investigative and prosecutorial purposes. For such data requests to succeed, states must not only be aligned on what counts as criminal activity in cyberspace, there should also be few procedural hurdles for interstate data transfers. These objectives require a major reconfiguration of the way in which states currently engage with each other in cyberspace, and with private actors both domestically and internationally.\nTo be sure, Russian and Chinese objectives for cyberspace governance differ in important respects. As Flonk notes, Russia relies more on policy-oriented measures to regulate internet infrastructure, users and networks than China, where technical infrastructure such as the Great Chinese Firewall allows for a high degree of centralisation over content control and platforms governance (Flonk Citation 2021). Secondly, with significantly higher economic stakes in cyberspace, China's geopolitical outlook differs somewhat from Russia's. China's cyber diplomacy and proposals are driven by a desire to support Chinese technology companies while seeking a significant degree of state control over ICT activities at home and abroad. Russia, on the other hand, does not have a significant domestic technology industry and is therefore arguably less concerned about the geoeconomic consequences of its cyber diplomacy (Broeders, Adamson, and Creemers Citation 2019). Finally, China is more selective than Russia in the execution of cyber operations. While Moscow undertakes a broad range of disruptive and\ndestructive cyber operations, including those aimed at systemic political destabilisation, Beijing has restricted itself to undertaking operations that incrementally advance its economic or security objectives. The difference could be attributed to the blowback that Chinese industry and states agencies would face as good-faith participants and key influencers of standards development (Russel and Berger Citation 2021) and digital markets were they to undertake cyber operations that cause widespread instability or degrade the availability of global internet services.\nThese differences notwithstanding, scholars have long highlighted the strong convergence of views between Russia and China in their ideological opposition to the liberal international order and to its application to cyberspace. This ‘liberal cyber order’ is marked not only by substantive norms that govern state behaviour in cyberspace but also by who sets those norms (Rovner Citation 2023). Open data flows, multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms and deference to the exercise of civil, political and economic liberties online constitute the defining characteristics of the liberal cyber order, whose influence on the internet is historical and still discernible (Deibert and Crete-Nishihata Citation 2012; Farrell and Newman Citation 2021; Hollis and Raustiala Citation 2022). In geopolitical terms, this order privileges liberal democracies and their constituents – in particular the United States and its trans-Atlantic allies who have helped incubate the growth of the internet since its early years – as rule-shapers (Farrell and Newman Citation 2021, Citation 2024). China and Russia are united in their goal to ‘reform the liberal cyber order’ (Wu Citation 2021), which includes upending liberal norms (Flonk Citation 2021) as well as the institutional governance mechanisms that are its mainstay (Raymond and Sherman Citation 2024). China and Russia are not the only actors who seek a ‘post-liberal cyberspace’ (Barrinha and Renard Citation 2020), but they are certainly its most powerful proponents, and frequent fellow travellers in diplomatic forums.\nThis article highlights Russian and Chinese efforts to orchestrate such a systemic reform or reconfiguration of the liberal cyber order through the proposed cybercrime convention currently negotiated by an Ad Hoc Committee (AHC) of the United Nations. While the AHC was established to develop a binding international instrument for states to tackle cybercrime – in official terms, counter the ‘use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) for criminal purposes’ – we show that Russia and China have sought for it to regulate activities that go well beyond the treaty’s intended scope. Their proposals, as this article empirically demonstrates, not only address cybercrime, but also implicate international cybersecurity governance and cross-border data access.\nChinese and Russian proposals at the AHC push for states to have greater control over digital infrastructure and activities. As this article's review of the literature highlights, this is consistent with longstanding Chinese and Russian views on cyberspace governance. Nonetheless, the AHC negotiations also demonstrate that their championing of 'cyber sovereignty' (Creemers Citation 2020; Stadnik Citation 2021; Thumfart Citation 2021; Zeng, Stevens, and Chen Citation 2017) is oriented towards specific objectives that in turn reveal China and Russia's aspirations towards\nsystemic changes in cyberspace governance. Their proposals empower the territorial state to regulate certain cyber operations of geopolitical concern to China and Russia. In the guise of addressing cybercrime, they also allow states to shape policies and standards on the storage and security of data, to exert control over digital activities abroad that bear on territorial concerns, and to fashion the governance of cross-border data flows as an exclusively intergovernmental prerogative with few procedural or human rights safeguards. Taken together, these proposals undermine key tenets of the liberal cyber order, that, through open networks and digital markets, have conferred geopolitical and geoeconomic advantages to liberal democracies and transnational actors based largely in Western states. Indeed, we present these findings as helping to advance a theoretical frontier in the literature on Chinese and Russian approaches to cyberspace governance. Whereas extant analyses (see Section 2) have shone a spotlight on the domestic and global impact of China and Russia's sovereignty-centric proposals, newer scholarship has begun to examine the order-level consequences of such proposals. China and Russia, these scholars note, foreground the territorial state in cyberspace for explicitly systemic objectives (Wu Citation 2021) and have attempted 'hegemonic socialisation', i.e. persuading states who are likely to agree to order-level changes (Hulvey Citation 2021, Citation 2022). Meanwhile, the order-level impact of their proposals has been clearly acknowledged and addressed as such by states like Brazil and India (Basu Citation 2024; Paulus Citation 2024), whose support is crucial for any major change to the liberal cyber order.\nAnalysing cybercrime proposals by Russia and China contextually and holistically is also important because their presentation before the AHC itself cannot be considered coincidental or opportunistic. The AHC negotiations are expressly oriented towards a treaty, in contrast to the non-binding, voluntary 'norms' on responsible behaviour that have hitherto guided interstate engagement in this domain. Moscow and Beijing have long sought to set multilateral rules not only for international cybersecurity (Levinson Citation 2021) but also for internet governance, mainly via the ITU (Radu and Gregorio Citation 2023). Those efforts have thus far not succeeded (Grigsby Citation 2017). Attempts by both states to promote technical standards that allow for greater state control over the governance of critical internet resources have not yet gained currency in multi-stakeholder forums that set standards for the internet (Hogeveen Citation 2022). Given the backdrop of 'pervasive informality' (Sukumar, Broeders, and Kello Citation 2024) in intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder models of cyberspace governance, the AHC provides a rare avenue for Russia and China to shoehorn their proposals into an instrument that binds the conduct of states.\nAt the time of writing, a draft convention text has been agreed upon by all participating states at the AHC. The final convention is expected to be adopted at a formal General Assembly vote later in 2024 (UNODC Citation 2024). As our empirical findings reveal, several proposals by Russia and China were rejected in earlier versions of the AHC draft text, while some others were reintroduced by either state in later stages of negotiation. Even if those proposals fail to gain\nacceptance, their tabling, and in some cases, persistent diplomatic efforts to push them through, indicate the importance both states attach to them, and their contribution to systemic reordering in cyberspace.\nSection 2 reviews the literature on Chinese and Russian approaches to cyberspace governance, framed against the backdrop of their broader challenge to the liberal international order. This section highlights why it is important to study their AHC proposals within this broader context, and why Russia and China have specifically sought the AHC to float those proposals. Section 3 offers a background to the cybercrime negotiations and explains how the article collected and reviewed data on Chinese and Russian AHC proposals. Section 4 forms the empirical core of this paper. It highlights various AHC proposals made by both states, dividing them into two broad categories that reflect the essence of their challenge to the liberal cyber order: one, proposals to constrain the actions of strategic Western adversaries who benefit from open digital networks, and two, proposals to enhance territorial and extraterritorial control over private actors.\n## 2. China and Russia’s challenge to the liberal cyber order\nInternational order refers to the ‘explicit principles, rules, and institutions’ that manage and reflect ‘core relationships’ and ‘settled expectations’ between states (Ikenberry Citation 2001). The liberal international order is broadly premised on three elements: freer trade and security cooperation that is based on predictable and recognised rules, cooperation through multilateral institutions that is increasingly shifting to informal mechanisms, and the progressive growth of liberal democratic values and institutional arrangements across societies (Acharya Citation 2017; Ikenberry Citation 2010). Applying the liberal domestic values of ‘predictability, access, and representation’ to international politics (Deudney and Ikenberry Citation 1999), the LIO allows private actors – especially with transnational interests such as corporations and NGOs – to engage and seek direct representation in rules, norms or institutions (Handreider Citation 1978; Moravcsik Citation 2003; Scherer et al. Citation 2006).\nIn recent years, international relations scholarship has extensively debated the challenge posed by ‘revisionist’ powers like Russia and China to the LIO across regimes such as international security, trade and climate (Johnston Citation 2019; Lake, Martin, and Risse Citation 2021; Weiss and Wallace Citation 2021; Zürn Citation 2018). The nature of Chinese and Russian challenges to the LIO differ substantially. China, according to Goddard (Citation 2018), is a ‘bridging revisionist’ that is likely to use the existing international economic and political order to foment ‘rule-based revolution’, i.e. to transform existing rules over time to those more disposed to its interests. If its geoeconomic diplomacy in particular is any indication, China does not seek an overhaul of the LIO, but ‘prefers a more conservative version that emphasises Westphalian norms of sovereignty and non-interference’ (Weiss and Wallace Citation 2021). Russia, with fewer economic stakes in the LIO, has been more inclined to test its limits through ‘violent\naction' (Goddard Citation 2018) in contravention of basic tenets of the UN Charter and modern international relations. The outcomes of their challenges to the LIO depend in large measure on the approaches of emerging powers – with some of whom the liberal order still resonates ideologically or economically, despite their differences with the hegemon, the United States (Efstathopoulos Citation 2021). In this regard, Russia and China's joint emphasis on ‘hollowing out’ the LIO into its constitutive sovereignty elements (Johnston Citation 2019) – the sovereign equality of states, treaty-based agreements in lieu of informal agreements, consent-based dispute settlement mechanisms – may appeal to a broader audience, including emerging powers (Dugard Citation 2023).\nThe challenge posed by Russia and China to the LIO presents a necessary context to the understanding of ‘cyber ordering’ or the organisation of relations between states in cyberspace (Kello Citation 2017). As Barrinha and Renard note, cyberspace was itself the creation of the liberal order – characterised by open networks as well as private and decentralised governance (Barrinha and Renard Citation 2020). As is now widely acknowledged, various aspects of the cyber order have faced contestation from state and non-state actors in recent decades, resulting in a ‘retreat of liberal values’ (Barrinha and Renard Citation 2020; Deibert and Rohozinski Citation 2011; Mueller Citation 2017). As powerful nation states, China and Russia present the most potent challenge to the order. The remainder of this section reviews extant scholarship that analyses the Chinese and Russian challenge to the liberal cyber order, with a particular focus on cybersecurity governance. Then it highlights why studying proposals at the AHC negotiations offer a clearer picture of the alternative framework of rules that Russia and China want in cyberspace.\n## 2.1. Russian and Chinese approaches to global cybersecurity governance\nWe identify three strands of scholarship examining China and Russia’s approach to cybersecurity governance. The first strand includes conceptual and empirical assessments of the notion of cyber sovereignty, deployed discursively by both countries in domestic and international settings. This body of scholarship offers important insights into the evolution of domestic policy discourse and legislation by China and Russia to attain ‘cyber sovereignty’ and ‘information security’ respectively, two related concepts that have been at the crux of both countries’ approaches to the governance of cyberspace.\nChina’s evocation of ‘cyber sovereignty’ as a policy goal can be traced back to the 2010 White Paper on the internet in China published by the state council, the country’s apex administrative body (Information Office of the State Council Citation 2010). The concept has since made an appearance in speeches by China’s political leadership as well as its international cyberspace strategy (People’s Republic of China Citation 2017). Tracing its discursive evolution over the years, scholars have distilled ‘cyber sovereignty’ into two main components (Creemers Citation 2020; Fung Citation 2022). The first constitutive element is the core role of the state in\n'information management' (Fung Citation 2022), mainly by asserting territorial control over both domestic and foreign non-state actors. Such control may be exerted through technical measures or regulations around online activities within its jurisdiction (Deibert Citation 2015; Qiao-Franco Citation 2024). Control over the information environment is also exerted by facilitating a shift in global internet governance away from multi-stakeholder processes to articulate policy or technical standards towards intergovernmental processes under the auspices of the UN (Creemers Citation 2020; Fung Citation 2022).\nThe second constitutive element of cyber sovereignty is the equality of states in cyberspace (Zeng, Stevens, and Chen Citation 2017) which China has framed primarily in terms of the right to non-interference in a state's internal affairs. On the other hand, Russia's policy discourse on 'information security' has a longer lineage, but is essentially aligned with many of the aforesaid goals of China. First articulated in the 2000 Doctrine on Information Security, this concept is presented as a 'triad' of state, society and individual interests, whose protection from internal and external threats is ultimately the remit of the government (Stadnik Citation 2021). Over time, Russian controls over digital networks have mimicked Chinese measures (Weber Citation 2017). Such measures in Russia include online content filtering, mandatory data localisation, protection of critical information infrastructure and the 2019 Law on the Russian segment of the internet that aims to ward off external threats through centralised internet traffic routing and a national domain name system (Hakala and Melnchyuk Citation 2021; Stadnik Citation 2021). Russia has also sought the development of a legally-binding instrument for cyberspace, and to restrain states from weaponizing 'information to undermine the political, economic and social system' of others (Korzak Citation 2021).\nChina and Russia's pursuit of cyber sovereignty and information security is largely animated by the survival of its political institutions and the quest for social stability. However, there is also an important global dimension to these concepts, which the second strand of scholarship unpacks (Barrinha and Turner Citation 2024; Flonk, Jachtenfuchs, and Obendiek Citation 2020; Gao Citation 2022; Jiang Citation 2010; Nocetti Citation 2015). Analyses of Chinese and Russian proposals made at international forums have highlighted their substantive impact on users, businesses and NGOs as well as inter-state relations. Beijing and Moscow have emerged as entrepreneurs of 'illiberal norms' (Flonk Citation 2021), relating mainly to the control of online content and the governance of digital platforms, in venues such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), BRICS and the UN. Their proposals also contribute to the creation of 'sovereignty spheres', where states articulate policy and set standards on online content and internet governance, often superseding global, multi-stakeholder processes (Flonk, Jachtenfuchs, and Obendiek Citation 2020). Why would other states that have benefited from global standards opt into such sovereignty enclaves? Simmons and Hulvey note that states are 'anxious [of being] overwhelmed by global forces', among which the internet figures prominently (Simmons and Hulvey Citation 2022). Facing a 'sovereign identity crisis' in the age of the internet, they\nargue, states develop ‘border orientation preferences’ to ensure digital policies mirror the governance of territorial boundaries (Simmons and Hulvey Citation 2022). In this way, they try to ensure state-society relations are not destabilised by globalisation or open information flows.\nFinally, a third strand of scholarship examines how China and Russia engage tactically with norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace (Creemers Citation 2021; Fung Citation 2022; Raymond and Sherman Citation 2024). This literature has contributed significantly to the study of ‘cyber diplomacy’ by major powers and non-state actors. It focuses especially on the diplomatic rhetoric and narratives (Barrinha and Turner Citation 2024; Hansel Citation 2023) deployed by Moscow and Beijing to bolster support for their proposals (Fung Citation 2022), as well as their gaming of multilateral negotiation procedures – supporting consensus-based agreements, limiting private participation, ‘stack[ing] the deck’ with illiberal initiatives (Raymond and Sherman Citation 2024) – for the same purpose.\nTo summarise, China and Russia’s engagement with cybersecurity governance is characterised in the literature as driven mainly by the pursuit of cyber sovereignty, i.e. the enhancement of the state’s capacity to govern territorial networks and digital assets. The most conspicuous tool deployed in the pursuit of cyber sovereignty is online content control. Both states have engaged in diplomatic efforts to export their model of cyber sovereignty, especially to developing countries. The emergence of ‘sovereignty spheres’ akin to China and Russia, scholars point out, is likely to cause the ‘fragmentation’ of the liberal cyber order (Flonk, Jachtenfuchs, and Obendiek Citation 2020). Fragmentation, as per existing literature, could refer either to the fragmentation of regulatory regimes across jurisdictions, including liberal economies (Bradford Citation 2023), or to the technical splintering of the internet into non-interoperable, territorial networks (Drake, Cerf, and Kleinwachter Citation 2016). Pertinently, Mueller cautions against exaggerating the prospect of the technical fragmentation of the internet (Mueller Citation 2017, 17, 18). Fragmentation, he notes, is possible only if a critical mass of internet-users defect from the global internet, establishing technical incompatibilities that could sustain multiple ‘internets’ for a significant period of time. The economic and security costs of such defections may not outweigh the network benefits (Mueller Citation 2017; Polatin-Reuben and Wright Citation 2014). That said, Chinese industry players like Huawei have presented proposals on technical standards on ‘decentralised internet infrastructure’ at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). These proposals have been socialised by Chinese actors as ‘New IP’ technologies, which aim to ‘[reinvent] the internet's core architecture,’ (Hoffmann, Lazanski, and Taylor Citation 2020) and potentially create ‘non-interoperable networks’ across the globe (Sharp Citation 2020). The main challenge to the liberal cyber order consequently lies not only in a possible technical fragmentation of the internet but in ongoing attempts to subject its governance, domestically and internationally, to the territorial state.\n## 2.2. Significance of the Ad Hoc Committee on cybercrime\nThe enhanced cyber sovereignty of states, especially developing countries, allow them to resist ‘US [economic and political] hegemony in cyberspace’ (Gao Citation 2022). As challengers to the liberal cyber order, this is admittedly an important goal for China and Russia. Nevertheless, as major global players themselves, both states seek rules in a sovereignty-centric cyber order that specifically benefit them, drawing in no small part on their own traditional strengths and preferences in dealing exclusively with governments abroad. The following paragraphs highlight what those goals might be, why it has been challenging for China and Russia to achieve them, and how the AHC acquires salience in this context.\nAs a systemic objective, China and Russia seek to constrain certain inherent advantages that Western economies enjoy in the liberal cyber order. An open and free internet – a core tenet of the liberal order – not only has normative appeal but also confers instrumental geopolitical advantages to Western liberal states (Lahmann Citation 2021), to which both states are especially sensitive (Lokot and Wijermars Citation 2023). ‘Internet freedom’, which has been a key US foreign policy goal, is also an enabler of market access for multinational corporations – many of them based in the US – to gain from digital economies around the world (DeNardis and Hackl Citation 2015; Farrell Citation 2006; Farrell and Newman Citation 2021). It is a tool for soft power promotion in cyberspace, facilitating the import of Western cultural, ideological and intellectual motifs and themes by developing states (Rothkopf Citation 1997). An open internet is also beneficial to covert and overt military, intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the West that enjoy ‘home-field advantage’ (Buchanan Citation 2022) in a domain largely developed and innovated upon in liberal economies. Strategic adversaries such as China and Russia want to constrain the capabilities of the United States and like-minded countries to gather intelligence and ‘persistently engage’ (Goldsmith Citation 2022; US Cyber Command Citation 2022) digital networks to surveil and mount offensive cyber operations.\nAchieving this broader goal through the reform of existing multilateral institutions has proved challenging for Russia and China. Firstly, new rules that enhance the sovereign capacities of states are likely to be incompatible with rules incubated by existing liberal regimes, in which both Russia and China are willing participants. Any attempt to coerce other states into their preferred regimes will invite retaliation or be simply ignored for other, preferential regimes (Cha Citation 2023). Even if China or Russia were to set new rules, their challenge would be to draw away middle powers or developing countries, whose economic or security dependencies with advanced liberal economies may compel them to stick with existing regimes. The ‘counterhegemonic coalitions’ (Schweller and Pu Citation 2011) that both states have sought to incubate have had little success drawing in countries that were not already in their geopolitical orbit. Initiatives such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s Code of Conduct on Information Security or the China-promoted Global Initiative on Data Security seem unlikely to register acknowledgment\namong broader multilateral initiatives (Kynge Citation 2023). In China's case particularly, it has struggled also to shore up support for 'counter-institutionalization' in global economic governance, through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) that do not conflict with the Bretton Woods institutions but attempt to 'decrease [their] relevance' (Zürn Citation 2018). In the domain of international security, prospects for counter-institutionalization are likely to be even harder (Zürn Citation 2018).\nFurthermore, the world is witnessing a discernible shift towards informal global governance (Snidal Citation 2021; Westerwinter, Abbott, and Biersteker Citation 2021), undermining efforts by Russia and China to create a new international order through binding rules. Empirically documented by scholars of international law and international relations, this phenomenon has catalysed the proliferation of informal alliances, ad hoc coalitions and task forces in economic and security domains (Bradley, Goldsmith, and Hathaway Citation 2023; Reykers et al. Citation 2023). This shift has arguably been precipitated by the US's turn towards non-binding agreements, largely for reasons of domestic politics, such as difficulties in getting Senate ratification of treaties or the lack of interest in treaty-based cooperation from populist elites (Copelovitch and Pevehouse Citation 2019). The relative decline in traditional multilateral governance deprives China and Russia, among others, of opportunities to supplant existing rules and formal regimes. The cybersecurity regime is a prime example of this phenomenon, being characterised by 'pervasive informality' (Sukumar, Broeders, and Kello Citation 2024). At the UN, for instance, Russia has for more than two decades sought an international treaty on cybersecurity, only to have its proposals rebuffed by Western countries (Farrell and Newman Citation 2021). Neither the UN GGE nor the OEWG, the two main multilateral venues for discussions on international cybersecurity, has the power to bind states with its recommendations, and both have articulated in their stead voluntary norms suggesting the contours of 'responsible state behaviour' for the domain (Kavanagh Citation 2017). Informal global governance, including in cyberspace, has paved the way for private entities to forge multi-stakeholder partnerships in various governance domains (Johnstone, Sukumar, and Trachtman Citation 2023). In comparison to treaty negotiations, which traditionally offer limited roles for NGOs and private actors to offer substantive inputs, informal channels tend to be more open and inclusive.\nThe AHC negotiations arguably address both concerns for Russia and China, and explain the scope of their proposals. Although there exists an international cybercrime instrument – the Budapest Convention – it is not signed by either state, nor for that matter by the overwhelming majority of developing countries in Asia and Africa. There is little need to develop a ‘counter-institutional’ coalition against the Budapest Convention, when most major non-signatories have expressed their reservations about the instrument. The AHC, on the other hand, comprises all UN member states, making it easier for Russia and China to build coalitions and attract countries into their orbit on their specific proposals. To be sure, both still need to engage in diplomacy to\nevangelise their proposals and appear to acknowledge this reality (Barrinha and Turner Citation 2024; Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024). As Barrinha and Turner (Citation 2024) note, Russia even took a more accommodative stand towards non-state actor participation in the cybercrime discussions in order to shore up international support.\nSecondly, the AHC discussions were very clearly geared towards a cybercrime treaty which would create binding rules. This treaty bucks the trend of informal agreements in this domain. Shoehoring proposals on cybersecurity into the cybercrime convention allowed China and Russia to address topics that either are off the table at the UN GGE or OEWG, such as cyber-enabled espionage, or do not limit the use of offensive cyber weapons by (Western) states. Consequently, their AHC proposals reflected the regulation of a whole gamut of issues that have systemic, 'order'-level effects on cyberspace. Prior to highlighting those proposals in finer detail, a brief background on the negotiations themselves is necessary.\n# 3. Cybercrime negotiations at the United Nations\nThe 'Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) for Criminal Purposes' negotiated by an intergovernmental Ad Hoc Committee will be the first binding UN instrument on any issue pertaining to the governance of cyberspace. The AHC was established by the UN General Assembly in 2019. Like the Budapest Convention developed by the Council of Europe – in some respects the precursor not only to this instrument but also to several regional agreements on cybercrime (Shires Citation 2024) – the objective of the AHC is to develop global benchmarks on identifying cybercrime and enabling international cooperation to address it.\nThe political backdrop to the AHC negotiations is important. Neither Russia nor China are signatories to the Budapest Convention. China has stayed away from the Budapest Convention for two reasons: firstly, signing the CoE Convention would be contrary to its longstanding position that global governance, including of cyberspace, should be under the aegis of the UN; secondly, China has also argued that it was not consulted when the Budapest Convention was being drafted (Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024). Russia, until its expulsion in 2022 from the body, remained the only Council of Europe member not to have signed the Budapest Convention. Moscow has offered three reasons for its decision: the low number of offences addressed by the Budapest Convention; the lack of official statistics regarding its implementation; and the Convention's allowing states to access data located in another state without the latter's authorisation, thereby violating its sovereignty (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Citation 2021).\nRussia has instead been a longstanding champion for a cybercrime treaty negotiated under the auspices of the UN (Gullo and Rodriguez Citation 2023). Cybercrime discussions at the UN\nwere previously guided through an open-ended Intergovernmental Expert Group to Conduct a Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime (United Nations General Assembly Citation 2011). The UN General Assembly resolution of December 2019 that established the AHC was a culmination of an effort by Russia to lay the diplomatic and procedural groundwork for a successful vote (Lederer Citation 2019; Rowe Citation 2020). In 2018, for example, Russia managed to push through a resolution requiring that the Secretary General collate country perspectives on cybercrime (United Nations General Assembly Citation 2018). Importantly, this resolution was titled 'Countering the use of information and communications technologies for criminal purposes', rather than simply a 'convention on cybercrime'. The 2018 resolution marked a clear and important departure from the way 'cybercrime' had been used in international discussions, especially around the Budapest Convention and also in Expert Group discussions (Hakmeh and Tropina Citation 2021). As the next section highlights, this shift is significant because it correlates to Russia and China seeking an expansive scope for the AHC convention by bringing a broad range of criminal activities within its ambit (Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024).\nWhile Europe, the United States and other like-minded states initially opposed the establishment of the AHC and did not support the Russian proposal, they have since participated actively in various negotiation sessions and intersessional consultations (Lewis and Painter Citation 2023). The AHC negotiations commenced in 2022 with plans originally for at least six negotiating sessions. At the time of writing, all planned negotiating sessions have been completed. No consensus outcome was attained at the originally stipulated concluding session in January 2024 and negotiators requested more time to complete deliberations. Consequently, a final session was scheduled for July-August 2024, during which a draft convention text was agreed upon by all participating countries. A General Assembly vote is expected in December 2024 to formally adopt the treaty (Digi Watch Citation 2024). Civil society groups and human rights campaigns have criticised the final text of the treaty due to insufficient human rights safeguards; its overly broad scope and presentation alongside a General Assembly resolution that could enable the reintroduction of cyber-enabled crimes; threats to security researchers; cementing expansive surveillance powers; enabling extensive data sharing without compatible human rights standards and safeguards and a lack of provisions on government accountability (Article 19 Citation 2024; Rodriquez Citation 2024; Tropina Citation 2024).\nThe Ad Hoc Committee was made up of the representatives of all UN member states and allowed the participation of non-voting private stakeholders, including civil society organisations and technology companies. Footnote 2 The negotiations were divided into eight broad thematic clusters, which ended up as the various operating sections of the final text of the draft convention. These included general provisions, relating to: criminalisation; jurisdiction; procedural measures of cooperation, especially among law enforcement agencies; general measures of international cooperation; preventive measures; and proposals on technical assistance and information exchange as well as mechanisms of implementation.\nAt the first three sessions, states contributed various draft provisions that could be integrated into each cluster. In April and September 2023, states held discussions on a Consolidated Negotiating Document (CND) that was prepared by the Chair.\nWhile Russia and China have been active in all sessions, the former was more active than the latter. At the first AHC session in early 2022, Russia even suggested that the AHC adopt the complete text of a draft convention it first published in 2021. At the second and third sessions, Russia and China made joint proposals, especially on procedural cooperation, which are elaborated upon in the next section. To be sure, while Russia and China have led efforts on proposals challenging the liberal cyber order at the AHC, other countries including Pakistan and Iran have also been vocal about specific concerns, such as removing human rights safeguards within the Convention (Bannelier Citation 2023). While a detailed examination of these efforts is outside the scope of this paper, it is pertinent to note that Russia and China are not working in isolation but often collaborating with a small coalition of states to effect their proposals.\n## 3.1. Data collection and analysis\nThis article's analysis of Russian and Chinese proposals at the AHC is based primarily on a review of six documents containing proposals advanced by participating states prior to each negotiating session at the AHC. The first two documents pertain to proposals advanced separately by Russia (Russia Draft Citation 2021) and China (China Suggestion Citation 2022) at the first AHC negotiating session in February 2022. The subsequent two documents analysed were jointly published by Russia, China and several developing countries in June 2022 (Russia Joint Proposal June Citation 2022) as well as in September 2022. Finally, we reviewed two versions of the Consolidated Negotiating Document (CND) – tabled in April 2023 (Ad Hoc Committee April Citation 2023) and September 2023 Footnote 3 before the AHC – that contain red line-edits to the draft convention made by all negotiating parties. The CND/DTC was tabled by the Chair of the AHC and did not indicate in any way whether red-line edits (or even the text in black letters) were likely to find place in the final draft of the convention. States had the option to reintroduce proposals and object to existing proposals until the final stage of negotiations. Red-line edits made by states or coalitions of states are particularly valuable for our analysis as looking at them helps in attributing specific proposals to states and tracking their evolution. The Chair of the AHC additionally convened informal consultations, closed working groups on certain articles/ clusters of articles and multi-stakeholder consultations. However, as details of these meetings are not on public record, they are not included in our analysis.\nIn addition to proposals tabled at all six negotiation sessions, we also reviewed publicly accessible oral statements made by Russia, China, the United States, the EU and other like-minded countries accessed through the United Nations Web Television (UN WebTV) portal. In all, we reviewed documentary and media sources dating from February 2022 to September 2023.\nFootnote 4 To triangulate our analysis, we consulted secondary literature including media coverage of the negotiations and analyses from blogs and podcasts authored by diplomats, legal practitioners and scholars.\n# 4. Unpacking Chinese and Russian proposals at the AHC\nThis section highlights two sets of Chinese and Russian proposals at the AHC that, by enhancing the territorial capacity of states, attempt to limit strategic operations undertaken by their Western adversaries as well as the ability of influential non-state actors to set global technical standards or advance norms on cybersecurity and human rights. The first set of proposals seek the criminalisation of certain offensive cyber operations against critical information infrastructure (CII) and for the purpose of conducting espionage. Russia and China's goal here is to ensure that the openness of global digital networks do not allow adversaries the operational ability and freedom to execute such operations. A second category of proposals facilitate greater territorial and extra-territorial control of states over data, users and digital infrastructure. They do so not just through an expansive approach to defining crimes in cyberspace, but also through proposals to expand the jurisdiction of states over users and data abroad that are implicated in the commission of a crime in their own territories. These proposals on extra-territorial jurisdiction are complemented by those that relax procedural and human rights safeguards on the cross-border sharing of data between law enforcement agencies.\nTaken in toto, these proposals offer an alternative framework of rules that blunt key attributes of the liberal cyber order highlighted in Section II and consequently limit the inherent advantages enjoyed by Western states and transnational private actors in this order.\nhighlights both sets of proposals, along with the specific provisions or changes Russia and China have sought at various stages of the AHC negotiations.\n# Table 1. Summary of relevant proposals advanced by Russia and China at the AHC.\n# 4.1. Constraining strategic adversaries in cyberspace\nChina and Russia have called on states at the AHC to criminalise cyber operations targeting critical infrastructure as well as cyber-enabled espionage. To be sure, Russia and China have arguably engaged in cyber operations that would fall foul of the same provisions they seek in this regard. Their own acts of commission have not deterred their AHC diplomacy arguably for two reasons. The first explanation is that Russia and China perceive for themselves an exceptional status in an alternative cyber order, in much the same way they routinely accuse the United States and its allies of 'hypocritical' actions that contravene the liberal order (Cai Citation 2019, 160).\nHere, the distinction between the approaches of Russia and China is important. Russia has long sought binding rules against the targeting of critical infrastructure, while its conduct, both through operations undertaken by state agencies and via state-supported private groups, has been in flagrant contradiction to those proposals (Korzak Citation 2021). Moscow, which is more 'confrontational and disruptive' (Broeders, Adamson, and Creemers Citation 2019) towards the liberal cyber order, is apparently comfortable with its simultaneous championing and violation of cybersecurity rules. China, on the other hand, has been less forthcoming with specific proposals for cyberspace and tends more to point out the 'double standards' (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China Citation 2023) of the US, particularly in relation to surveillance and espionage. This distinction, as the following paragraphs show, is reflected in the two countries' degree of willingness to push their proposals at the AHC in the face of opposition – Russia more, China less so. A second, issue-specific explanation is that Russia and China have both turned increasingly towards private actors to undertake disruptive or data-gathering operations (Lonergan Citation 2022; Maurer Citation 2017). In contrast to Western liberal economies, which rely on cyber commands and intelligence agencies that are operationally or institutionally accountable to domestic oversight mechanisms, Russia and China's cyber statecraft is characterised by their reliance on proxies (Giles Citation 2023; Hmaidi Citation 2023; Sherman Citation 2022). Unsurprisingly, their AHC proposals criminalise only the conduct of states, allowing both states to claim plausible deniability for proxy actions and exploit the challenges of legally attributing proxy cyber operations to governments. Chinese and Russian proposals at the AHC specifically take aim against US policies such as 'persistent engagement' and 'defend forward', which seek to disrupt 'malicious cyber activity at its source' through the 'proactive' monitoring of foreign networks by US government agencies (Fischerkeller and Harknett Citation 2019; US Cyber Command Citation 2022).\n## 4.2. Critical infrastructure and cyber operations\nThe protection of CI has been discussed at the UN GGE and OEWG for nearly a decade. In 2015, the UN GGE articulated a norm calling on states to 'not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity' that 'intentionally damaged critical infrastructure or otherwise [impaired]' its use (Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, Citation 2015). Since its publication, several multi-stakeholder and intergovernmental bodies have articulated their own version of the norm, specifying either guidelines around state behaviour with respect to CI or identifying certain sectors as 'critical' and therefore deserving of protection (Kouloufakos Citation 2023). Turning the attention of the UN GGE towards the protection of CI has been a longstanding goal of all major actors involved in the process, but in Russia's case, its proposals should also be viewed in the broader geopolitical context of its diplomacy towards a cybersecurity treaty at the UN (Lilly and Cheravitch Citation 2020).\nMoscow's pursuit of a UN cybersecurity treaty was itself an attempt to constrain the development and use by the US and its allies of cyber offensive capabilities and generally limit the (then) advantages that the latter had in this domain (Croft Citation 2012 ; Demidov and Chernenko Citation 2015 ). The GGE format of discussions was the result of a US-Russia compromise to develop a 'framework of responsible state behaviour' through voluntary guidelines in lieu of a new treaty. The 2015 UN GGE's norm on the protection of CI, however, limited only those actions that would violate a state's obligations under existing international law. In other words, the norm concerned itself exclusively with cyber operations that either qualified as a 'use of force' or otherwise resulted in a major loss of functionality or physical effects (Haataja Citation 2023 ). Intelligence or espionage operations, including those with the intent of embedding themselves within critical infrastructure for the purposes of deploying countermeasures or 'active cyber defence' measures (Broeders Citation 2021 ) would be potentially excluded. The sixth UN GGE in 2021 affirmed this view (Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, Citation 2021 ).\nWith the GGE process not delivering the outcome it hoped for, Russia has since turned its attention towards the AHC. In 2022, the lead Russian negotiator to the UN GGE suggested that 'cybercrime is frequently used to disguise attacks against critical infrastructure [and] undermine [the] political and economic situation of governments' (Ministry of Foreign Affairs Citation 2022). Moscow has sought to criminalise 'unlawful interference' with critical infrastructure and critical information infrastructure (CII) since the first session of AHC negotiations, notwithstanding initial opposition from the US and like-minded countries in the European Union (Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes Citation 2023; \"EU Statement - UN Ad-Hoc Committee for a UN Convention on Cybercrime: Objectives and Scope of the Convention and EEAS.\" Citation 2022). Specifically, the Russian proposal suggests that parties should adopt 'legislative and other measures as are necessary under domestic law' to criminalise the creation of software or other digital information that can interfere with CII to destroy, impede or even copy information contained therein (Russia First Draft Article Citation 10 bis Citation 2021) [emphasis added]. The proposal makes clear that surveillance and intelligence-gathering operations would be covered under its remit. Further, the provision also criminalises non-compliance by private actors with government-issued guidelines related to securing CII if such non-compliance results in an attack or damage to information systems. The effect of this proposal is that multinational companies who supply or operate industrial control systems could also be implicated by domestic penal provisions.\nIn the UNGA First Committee, China too has called on states to refrain from targeting the 'critical infrastructures of other states' (People's Republic of China Citation 2017). Further, China has passed domestic legislation protecting CII, imposing duties and responsibilities on operators (Data Security Law of the People's Republic of China Citation 2021). China's first\nsubmission at the AHC sought to criminalise the ‘intrusion and destruction of ICTs facilities, systems, data or CII’. The Chinese proposal seeks to criminalise not only illegal ‘access’ and ‘interference’ with computer data and ‘information systems’ but also the lesser ‘infringement of critical information infrastructure’ (China Suggestion, Article Citation 3 ( Citation 1 ) Citation 2021 ). The protection of CII is also flagged by several joint Russian and Chinese proposals on international cooperation in the AHC. One such proposal seeks an ‘equal right’ to states for ‘the protection of its information resources and critical information infrastructures from misuse and unauthorised interference’ (Russia Joint Proposal June Citation 2022 , Art. 46 (5)). As the above statements indicate, China and Russia’s emphasis at the AHC is on CII, and not CI per se . While most countries share common perceptions of what constitutes CII (ITU-World Bank Citation 2021 ; Cybersecurity Authority of Singapore Citation 2018 ; Russia First Draft Citation 2021 ), it is still important to distinguish it from critical infrastructure. CII refers to information or communication systems or any other network resources that are by themselves required for discharging ‘vital’ services within a nation or essential to the uninterrupted functioning of critical infrastructure such as industrial control systems. Broad international convergence on many definitional aspects of CII notwithstanding, China’s position in particular – underpinned by its domestic law – is notable in the present context. China’s CII Security Protection Regulations, which took effect in 2021, defines CII to include systems whose ‘data leakage’ may ‘gravely harm’, inter alia , the ‘public interest’ (Data Security Law of the People’s Republic of China Citation 2021 ). In contrast, the EU’s focus, for example, is on the destruction or disruption of such infrastructure. Consistent with Russian proposals (Russia First Draft Citation 2021 , Article 11), and reading China’s AHC proposals alongside its domestic regulation (China’s Suggestion Citation 2021 , Article 3(2)), it would appear that Beijing has pursued a catch-all approach to CII as well as actions targeting such infrastructure that would be proscribed (including surveillance and espionage).\nWhile the Russian proposal on CII was removed in the Draft Text of the Convention (DTC) tabled by the AHC Chair before the Sixth Negotiating Session in September 2023, Moscow proposed its reintroduction into the negotiating process in the final session (Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes Citation 2023 , Article 10 bis). Notably, China did not support Russia's proposal to reintroduce criminal provisions on CII. US agencies assess that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been targeting and compromising US critical infrastructure potentially to leverage such access during conflict (United States Department of Defense Citation 2023 ; Washington Post Citation 2023 ). If accurate, these assessments would partly explain China's reluctance to push harder for criminal penalties against compromising CII through a cybercrime treaty. There is also the important consideration, noted at the beginning of this article, of China's global economic interests in cyberspace which outstrip those of Russia. China arguably would consider itself better off with some cybercrime treaty than none at all, which Russia's maximalist bargaining threatened to do at various stages of the AHC.\n## 4.3. Cyber-enabled espionage\nA related issue on which China and Russia have both floated AHC proposals is espionage. The issue of cyber-enabled espionage has been the proverbial ‘elephant in the room’ as far as international cybersecurity discussions are concerned (Broeders Citation 2024). Save for the US—China cybersecurity agreement that proscribed espionage for economic purposes (Yoo Citation 2015), there are no major international agreements that address the issue, either in terms of legal provisions or normative guardrails. On the other hand, China and Russia have sought to use the AHC negotiations on cybercrime to address cross-border espionage. To be sure, the Budapest Convention calls on states to criminalise electronic ‘interception without right’ that is committed ‘intentionally’. States could also require commission with ‘dishonest intent’ (Budapest Convention Citation 2001, Article 3) for criminality. However, as scholars have noted, the Budapest Convention only addresses the criminality of individual actions, and therefore is limited in addressing state espionage (Crootof Citation 2019; Rowe Citation 2020).\nIn contrast, China proposed at the AHC negotiations to hold states accountable for the interception of data (China Suggestion, Article Citation 4 (Citation 1) Citation 2022). The proposal read:\nStates shall not directly collect the data stored in foreign states from enterprises or individuals by technical means bypassing network security protection measures if such measures are against the laws of that foreign state.\nThe proposal not only highlighted a restriction on state activity, but also specifically emphasised the need to shield ‘enterprises and individuals’ from espionage activities. The Budapest Convention, in comparison, only refers to interception ‘to and from’ computer systems. While cyber operations that ‘bypass network security protection measures’ could refer to both disruptive operations as well as cyber-enabled espionage, China’s proposal should be read in the context of its domestic measures aimed at countering espionage. In 2023, China revised its counter-espionage law to include expansively the protection of ‘documents, data, materials and items related to national security and interests’ (Zhang Citation 2023). The revision specifically emphasised cyber operations, whether destructive or intelligence-gathering in nature, that targeted critical information infrastructure and ‘confidential-related units’ within state organs in China. The objective of the revised law is ostensibly to discourage multinational corporations and their employees from collaborating with foreign spy agencies (Marsh and Waldersee Citation 2023; Reuters Citation 2023) and has even resulted in the detention of a foreign national accused of spying (Global Times Citation 2023a; Global Times Citation 2023b). The geopolitical context is especially significant: in light of Chinese attempts to isolate itself from much of the world in the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, Western intelligence agencies have publicly emphasised the need to build ‘strong human intelligence capability’ in the country (Barnes and Wong Citation 2023; CGTN Citation 2023). Through its AHC proposal,\nChina sought not only to secure an international commitment that mirrored its domestic law but ultimately to provide it the legal imprimatur to thwart and deter US and Western intelligence operations that undermine its geopolitical or geoeconomic interests (Azcarate Citation 2023). Meanwhile, Beijing itself has reportedly leaned on proxy actors who make use of increasingly sophisticated methods for cyber espionage, that gives it greater room for deniability. Take for instance, the use by Chinese actors of disaggregate, compromised nodes such as private servers and IoT devices that make attribution to a single group or entity challenging (Raggi Citation 2024).\nRussia's original proposal tabled at the first AHC session similarly sought to criminalise the use of 'technical means to intercept traffic data and data processed by means of ICT that are not intended for public use' (Russia First Draft Citation 2021, Article 7). This is similar to the formulation in the Budapest Convention, although it is slightly modified to stipulate that interception carried out without 'appropriate authorisation' or in 'violation of established rules' should be unlawful. The Budapest Convention's formulation on interception, as noted previously, is more permissive towards espionage and only proscribes those operations conducted 'without right' by another state. Russia's standard is narrower, and allows for states to determine by domestic regulation what constitutes 'inappropriate' interception.\n## 4.4. Enhancing sovereign capacity against domestic and extraterritorial threats\nA second set of AHC proposals by Russia and China seeks to enhance the ability of governments to 'detect, suppress, investigate and prosecute' criminal activities – designated so by domestic law – within their own territories but also abroad (DTC September 2023, Article 1(1); Russia First Draft Citation 2021, Article 31). The latter objective has been sought through procedural measures that ease access to electronic evidence located in other countries and the dilution of human rights safeguards, especially in relation to the handling of data transferred between states. In promoting these proposals, China and Russia's overarching goal is arguably to limit the power of multinational technology companies as well as civil society organisations and coalitions, which are mainly based in, or draw their market strength or legitimacy from, advanced liberal economies. As highlighted previously, the effect of these proposals would be to limit the technical standard or policy-setting capacity of influential private actors on data governance and security, such as encryption and data storage. Admittedly, these proposals would also limit the ability of Chinese and Russian companies to set standards and shape policy. This outcome is in line with the heightened degrees of control, both from a policy and corporate governance perspective, that both states have exerted over their major technology players in recent years (Zhang Citation 2024).\nWe study six sets of proposals within this broader category (see) that advance this objective.\n## 4.5. Addressing ‘cyber-enabled’ crimes\nThe first category of proposals pertains to the types of crimes that can be prosecuted through the AHC convention. Both states have sought the criminalisation of ‘cyber-enabled’ crimes, i.e. crimes that have an ICT component relevant to their commission, as opposed to ‘cyber-dependent’ crimes, which fit more the traditional ‘CIA’ crimes – targeted by the Budapest Convention – that affect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of systems (Wilkinson Citation 2023). Many of these cyber-enabled crimes relate to the publication of online content, which is tightly regulated in authoritarian states. The AHC’s title itself – a committee to elaborate a treaty on ‘the use of ICTs for criminal purposes’ – was the effort of Russian resolutions at the UN General Assembly (Wilkinson Citation 2023). Non-government organizations (NGOs) and civil society organisations have not only decried the inclusion of content-related crimes as posing a ‘heightened risk’ (Privacy International and Electronic Frontier Foundation Citation 2022) to the exercise of human rights but also as impeding the work of journalists or whistle-blowers (Electronic Frontier Foundation Citation 2022). Russia and China have sought also to criminalise, respectively, ‘digital data to mislead the user’ and the ‘dissemination of false information’ (Martin Citation 2023), although these proposals have generated concern among industry and civil society (Bannelier Citation 2023). Neither formulation appears to have made it to the final rounds of negotiations. Russia, along with a number of developing countries, also proposed an all-encompassing clause to ensure the cybercrime treaty did not ‘preclude a State Party from establishing as an offence any other unlawful act committed intentionally with the use of information and communication technologies that causes significant damage’, which remains a legally ambiguous threshold (DTC September 2023, Art. 15 undecies). Targeting a broad range of ‘cyber-enabled crimes’ mirrors domestic criminal law provisions in both China and Russia and has been viewed by some experts as a means of legitimising and exporting their domestic governance models (Iyengar, Gamer and Rathi Citation 2023). Instrumentally, China’s focus has been on crimes faced by its own law enforcement agencies (Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024). Wider criminal provisions in domestic law and international treaty law boost state authority to assert control over individuals and companies that use cyberspace.\n## 4.6. Provisions on mutual legal assistance, human rights, jurisdiction and non-state actors\nBeyond seeking an expansive scope for the cybercrime treaty, we identify five areas where China and Russia have pushed for greater power for states to regulate digital activities at home and abroad. First, Russia has sought through the AHC convention to limit exemptions and safeguards against mutual legal assistance (MLA) requests by a state. These include rejecting clauses that allow states to refuse MLA requests for the prosecution of political offences (DTC September 2023, Art. 40 Clause 21 (c) bis) or those motivated by a ‘person's sex, race, language, religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinions’ (DTC September 2023, Art. 40 Clause 21 (c) ter).\nSecond, both China and Russia have advocated procedural reforms to domestic criminal law that would enable the easier prosecution of crimes committed through the use of ICTs. Russia has sought to ‘ensure that electronic evidence derived or extracted from [any ICT] shall have the probative value in criminal procedure’ (DTC September 2023, Article 30 bis). China and Russia have suggested that states should establish ‘relevant legal procedures and technical standards for the collection, retention and provision of electronic evidence to ensure the authenticity, integrity and legality of electronic evidence’ (DTC September 2023, Article 30 ter).\nThird, these states have, along with others, sought to limit human rights safeguards against the prosecution of cybercrime. Russia has objected to several proposals that introduce human rights safeguards against criminal prosecution, including in the case of ‘persons and groups in vulnerable situations’ (DTC September 2023, Article 5(2)). Moscow has also rejected a proposal to include the effective protection of human rights as a key element of cross-border technical assistance and capacity-building (DTC September 2023, Article 54). While China has not backed Russia on the proposal to remove human rights safeguards altogether, it has resisted attempts to introduce oversight mechanisms or limitations in the way governments can process and retain personal data transferred between states under the AHC convention (DTC September 2023, Article 36 sub-clause 2). Russia has also sought the use of the term ‘unlawful’ across the Consolidated Negotiation Text of the AHC draft to refer to specific acts that invite criminal prosecution. In contrast, the US, EU and like-minded countries prefer the phrase ‘without right’, which is more commonly used in the Budapest Convention. This distinction is important: ‘unlawful’ actions would be determined solely on the basis of domestic legislation, whereas the more permissive formulation ‘without right’ acknowledges the universal legitimacy of certain actions, such as accessing a free and open public computer system, instituting ‘protection activities’ (such as stronger encryption or cybersecurity safeguards) with the permission of those involved in transmitting data, or those actions taken in the pursuit of human rights such as privacy or free expression (Budapest Convention Citation 2001).\nFourth, Russia and China’s efforts to regulate extraterritorial activity go beyond proposals for expansive MLA. Notably, Russia has sought to extend states’ jurisdiction to cases in which ‘the offence is committed wholly or partly outside [their territory] but its effect in the territory [would] constitute an offence or result in the commission of an offense’ (DTC September 2023, Art. 22 sub-clause 2 c bis). Similarly, Russia has sought automatic jurisdiction for states if the ‘offence is committed against the State Party’ (DTC September 2023, Article 22 sub-clause 2 d). China has qualified its support to Russia’s invocation of the ‘effects doctrine’ Footnote ⁵ (Estey Citation 1997). Jurisdiction, in China’s view, should be based on a ‘true and sufficient’ link with criminal activities, giving priority to the place where the consequence of criminal activity occurs, where it is committed and the location of the perpetrator (China Suggestion Citation 3 (Citation 7) Citation 2022).\nFinally, both states have sought explicit control over internet service providers by national agencies. Such proposals have been an integral part of all Russian and Chinese drafts and contributions made to the AHC over six negotiating sessions. In its first draft proposal submitted to the AHC, Russia included two articles that specifically address the role of the private sector and ISPs, and also sought a code of conduct for their governance (Russian Federation Citation 2021, Article 43). China's proposals, while not as extensive, require companies and service providers to 'take technical measures and other necessary measures to effectively respond to criminal activities' (China's Suggestion Citation 2022, Article 3 (6)). Notably, both states have sought the criminalisation of the 'unlawful provision of service', understood as the providing of essentially any digitally-enabled service with 'the intent that the service or technical support be used for the commission of any of the offences' (DTC September 2023, Article 10 ter). Presumably, the service provider's 'intent' in this case would be discerned by states themselves, which enables the prosecution of any service provider that does not restrict internet services to communities or geographic areas proscribed by the state. Given the broad scope of offences that Russia and China, along with other authoritarian regimes, want to criminalise, this proposal could severely restrict the scope of operation of Virtual Private Networks or even secure messaging platforms that are set up with the intention of enabling secure and private communication away from the gaze of the state. These proposals are notable and offer important context to what China sees as the role of ISPs in 'decentralised internet infrastructure' models that it has floated at standards bodies.\nRussia's push for greater control over extraterritorial activity also throws into relief its original justification for not signing the Budapest Convention. Moscow has long expressed concerns over Article 32 of the Budapest Convention because it enables cross-border law enforcement access to territorial data without authorisation from the respective State Party. At the AHC negotiations, Russia has proposed that all cooperation under the cybercrime convention happens exclusively with the authorisation of State Parties. The cumulative effect of Russia's proposals would be that states become the sole arbiters of cross-border data access, but also have few procedural safeguards or human rights restrictions to refuse sharing data with other governments.\n# 5. Cybercrime negotiations and the future of the liberal cyber order\nRussia and China's proposals at the AHC reflect their efforts to shape systemically the governance of cyberspace, away from its liberal underpinnings. They attempt to reconfigure the norms and rules governing international relations in cyberspace by casting the territorial state as its main actor. Much like Western states have benefitted from a liberal order rooted in the dilution of the territorial state and the delegation of key cyberspace governance functions to private actors\n(Farrell and Newman Citation 2021), Russia and China seek geopolitical advantages from the alternative order they propose.\nDraft measures on the protection of CII and the criminalisation of cyber-enabled espionage constrain the freedom that Western intelligence agencies and commands enjoy in cyberspace for information-gathering and disruptive operations. On the other hand, stronger control over online content and the activities of digital services providers as well as weaker procedural and substantive safeguards on cross-border data-sharing between governments ensure that states can regulate private actors at home and also exert control over the data of users and entities held abroad (Harvey and Moore Citation 2022). The goal of these proposals is to limit the autonomy and influence of (mostly) Western technology companies in determining data flows and cybersecurity outcomes through their in-house policies and technical standards (Klonick Citation 2017).\nRussia and China's pursuit of an alternative cyber order is backed by several statements on issues discussed in the paper. While a detailed examination of these statements and strategies is outside the scope of this paper, we highlight a few notable examples. Beijing's repeated references to the US's 'empire of hacking' (Reuters Citation 2023) and Moscow's claims of US targeting critical infrastructure for subversive 'political and economic' operations suggest that their proposals at the AHC are motivated by overarching geopolitical motives, rather than by narrow domestic ones (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Citation 2022). Further, both countries have tried to use the platform of the AHC to promote their model among developing countries through language referencing the need for a systemic shift in cyberspace governance. China has declared that the AHC treaty should 'adjust [to] and create new contours for ensuring the security of states' (China Intervention Sixth Session Morning, UN Web TV 2023, 01:01:00 to 01:07:00). This messaging has been emphasised repeatedly by the Russian delegation as well. An article written by the Deputy Head of the Russian delegation amidst the AHC negotiations argued that the 'prospects for the global digitalisation process as a whole, the effectiveness and dynamics which depend on ensuring security, are in question' (Chernukhin Citation 2023).\nIndeed, Russia and China's diplomatic strategies at the AHC appear to exploit the Global South's 'discontent' against the LIO (Endaylalu Citation 2022). Both states have argued that debates on human rights are manufactured by states (liberal economies) who seek to 'retain their dominant position in the information sphere' at the cost of 'practical cooperation' on cybercrime (Russian Federation Citation 2022). In other words, the messaging here is not that human rights are bad, but that developing nations have more urgent priorities which are not highlighted in the current order. Relatedly, both states have also underlined the need for new rules to prosecute cybercrime, appealing to the deeply felt sentiment among African and Asian countries to be norm-makers and not norm-takers (Acharya Citation 2011). China's opening intervention at AHC negotiations stressed that including 'cyber-enabled crimes' in the cybercrime treaty is a way of ensuring that international law kept 'pace with the trends' (China, Intervention Sixth Session Morning, UN\nWeb TV 2023, 01:01:00 to 01:07:00). Russia has emphasised the fact that many countries stayed away from the Budapest Convention because they were not involved in its creation (Seger Citation 2016), denouncing the instrument as having failed to win the 'minds and hearts' of the developing world (Chernukhin Citation 2023).\nAs illustrates, Russia and China's own cyber diplomacy at the AHC has received steady support from some of its allies, but many developing countries and emerging powers (Chivvis and Geaghan-Breiner Citation 2024) have largely remained silent in response.\n# Table 2. States' responses to China and Russia's proposals at September 2023 negotiations.\nThe Draft Text of Convention (DTC) circulated by the AHC's chair in September 2023 omitted several proposals from China and Russia, especially on the scope and coverage of 'cyber-enabled crimes' as well as protection of CII. However, Russia attempted to reinsert all those proposals back into the DTC as red-line edits. China, as has illustrated, appears to have been less persistent in terms of reintroducing its original proposals. China's more moderate approach, as indicated in the first half of this paper, arguably reflects its heightened economic stake in cyberspace, compared to Russia's all-or-nothing strategy. Further, Russia's approach to the AHC negotiations reflects its strategy in the UN GGE and UN OEWG, where it scoped out similarly maximalist positions before engaging in last-minute, backroom deals to secure consensus within both groups. Chinese cyber diplomacy generally tends to avoid such grand bargains, and in the AHC appears to have prioritised some of its proposals over others.\nRegardless of their outcomes, it is clear from Russia and China's proposals that both states view the proposed AHC convention on cybercrime as an opportunity to chart new rules for the road for cyberspace. In a domain characterised mainly by informal norms of responsible behaviour and technical standards – a consequence of the liberal ordering of cyberspace – both states have arguably found it difficult to challenge the economic and normative clout of major private actors and to constrain the strategic advantages of powerful Western adversaries. They have sought consequently to use the prospective AHC treaty to usher in a cyber order that lends primacy to the territorial state – not only to govern domestic digital activity but also to shape international data flows and the use of offensive cyber capabilities.\n# Acknowledgement\nThe authors thank Isabella Wilkinson for comments on a previous draft of this article.\n# Disclosure statement\nThe authors report that there are no competing interests to declare.",
  "flat_text": "# ABSTRACT\nCyberspace is still characterised by features that draw from the liberal international order into which it was born: namely, open data flows and multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms that allow private actors to shape global technical or normative standards. The application of this 'liberal cyber order' has been resisted by Russia and China who seek a greater role for the territorial state in cyberspace governance. They have long sought new, binding rules to this effect with little success. The UN cybercrime convention bucks the trend of informal, non-binding agreements in this domain. Through an empirical analysis of proposals advanced by Russia and China during negotiations toward the cybercrime convention, this article demonstrates how they have sought to use it to develop rules that blunt the advantages enjoyed by Western liberal economies and major transnational actors in the current order. Going beyond the regulation of cybercrime, Russian and Chinese proposals empower states to thwart disruptive and intelligence-gathering cyber operations that may be conducted globally by Western adversaries. Additionally, they enhance the state's regulatory capacity over private actors at home and abroad, limiting the ability of businesses or NGOs to shape cybersecurity and human rights standards around the transfer, retention and access of data.\n# KEYWORDS:\n- Cybercrime treaty\n- cyber sovereignty\n- liberal international order\n- cybersecurity governance\n# 1. Introduction\nWhat kind of global governance regime do China and Russia seek for cyberspace? As authoritarian states with strong restrictions on the online activities of individuals, businesses and NGOs, do they simply seek greater autonomy to regulate digital technologies in their territory without foreign intervention? China and Russia have been robustly engaged, for over two decades, in discussions on internet governance at the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) (Murgia and Gross Citation 2020; Yoo Citation 2023), regional cooperative institutions and multi-stakeholder entities such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) (Kennedy Citation 2013; Negro Citation 2020; Yan Citation 2015). Chinese and Russian proposals advanced at these forums have the effect of increasing states' capacity to manage the territorial conduct of private actors.\nThe proposals advanced by both states at international forums also signal their geopolitical interests in cyberspace. Discussions on international cybersecurity in the UN General Assembly's First Committee, where Russia and China have competed with the 'like-minded' Footnote 1 countries led by the United States and European Union on specific proposals, throw into relief those interests (Basu, Poetranto, and Lau Citation 2021; Tiirmaa-Klaar Citation 2021). Through their First Committee proposals, Russia and China have sought to limit the ability of Western adversaries to engage in offensive cyber operations against their digital assets and infrastructure, and simultaneously to legitimize their own strategies and practices (for example, their increasing use of proxies or 'cyber mercenaries') (Maurer Citation 2017; Sukumar Citation 2017).\nBy dint of institutional design and the fragmented nature of the cyber 'regime complex' (Nye Citation 2014), discussions on internet governance, cybercrime and norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace have hitherto taken place across a number of international forums. This fragmentation has occluded from analysis a complete picture of the systemic changes that Russia and China pursue for the governance of cyberspace. Given that they are major cyber powers, it is important to understand whether and why both states seek to influence how other states govern territorial networks to advance their own broader geopolitical and geoeconomic ambitions for the domain. For instance, China and Russia would want for other states to have greater agency over domestic networks, whether for the purpose of requesting them to thwart Western cyber operations, curtail the growing influence of Western technology companies whom they see as proxies of the US or its allies, or clamp down on foreign voices and institutions critical of them. Conversely, implementing tougher restrictions on online activity at home may often require China and Russia to seek data from abroad for investigative and prosecutorial purposes. For such data requests to succeed, states must not only be aligned on what counts as criminal activity in cyberspace, there should also be few procedural hurdles for interstate data transfers. These objectives require a major reconfiguration of the way in which states currently engage with each other in cyberspace, and with private actors both domestically and internationally.\nTo be sure, Russian and Chinese objectives for cyberspace governance differ in important respects. As Flonk notes, Russia relies more on policy-oriented measures to regulate internet infrastructure, users and networks than China, where technical infrastructure such as the Great Chinese Firewall allows for a high degree of centralisation over content control and platforms governance (Flonk Citation 2021). Secondly, with significantly higher economic stakes in cyberspace, China's geopolitical outlook differs somewhat from Russia's. China's cyber diplomacy and proposals are driven by a desire to support Chinese technology companies while seeking a significant degree of state control over ICT activities at home and abroad. Russia, on the other hand, does not have a significant domestic technology industry and is therefore arguably less concerned about the geoeconomic consequences of its cyber diplomacy (Broeders, Adamson, and Creemers Citation 2019). Finally, China is more selective than Russia in the execution of cyber operations. While Moscow undertakes a broad range of disruptive and\ndestructive cyber operations, including those aimed at systemic political destabilisation, Beijing has restricted itself to undertaking operations that incrementally advance its economic or security objectives. The difference could be attributed to the blowback that Chinese industry and states agencies would face as good-faith participants and key influencers of standards development (Russel and Berger Citation 2021) and digital markets were they to undertake cyber operations that cause widespread instability or degrade the availability of global internet services.\nThese differences notwithstanding, scholars have long highlighted the strong convergence of views between Russia and China in their ideological opposition to the liberal international order and to its application to cyberspace. This ‘liberal cyber order’ is marked not only by substantive norms that govern state behaviour in cyberspace but also by who sets those norms (Rovner Citation 2023). Open data flows, multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms and deference to the exercise of civil, political and economic liberties online constitute the defining characteristics of the liberal cyber order, whose influence on the internet is historical and still discernible (Deibert and Crete-Nishihata Citation 2012; Farrell and Newman Citation 2021; Hollis and Raustiala Citation 2022). In geopolitical terms, this order privileges liberal democracies and their constituents – in particular the United States and its trans-Atlantic allies who have helped incubate the growth of the internet since its early years – as rule-shapers (Farrell and Newman Citation 2021, Citation 2024). China and Russia are united in their goal to ‘reform the liberal cyber order’ (Wu Citation 2021), which includes upending liberal norms (Flonk Citation 2021) as well as the institutional governance mechanisms that are its mainstay (Raymond and Sherman Citation 2024). China and Russia are not the only actors who seek a ‘post-liberal cyberspace’ (Barrinha and Renard Citation 2020), but they are certainly its most powerful proponents, and frequent fellow travellers in diplomatic forums.\nThis article highlights Russian and Chinese efforts to orchestrate such a systemic reform or reconfiguration of the liberal cyber order through the proposed cybercrime convention currently negotiated by an Ad Hoc Committee (AHC) of the United Nations. While the AHC was established to develop a binding international instrument for states to tackle cybercrime – in official terms, counter the ‘use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) for criminal purposes’ – we show that Russia and China have sought for it to regulate activities that go well beyond the treaty’s intended scope. Their proposals, as this article empirically demonstrates, not only address cybercrime, but also implicate international cybersecurity governance and cross-border data access.\nChinese and Russian proposals at the AHC push for states to have greater control over digital infrastructure and activities. As this article's review of the literature highlights, this is consistent with longstanding Chinese and Russian views on cyberspace governance. Nonetheless, the AHC negotiations also demonstrate that their championing of 'cyber sovereignty' (Creemers Citation 2020; Stadnik Citation 2021; Thumfart Citation 2021; Zeng, Stevens, and Chen Citation 2017) is oriented towards specific objectives that in turn reveal China and Russia's aspirations towards\nsystemic changes in cyberspace governance. Their proposals empower the territorial state to regulate certain cyber operations of geopolitical concern to China and Russia. In the guise of addressing cybercrime, they also allow states to shape policies and standards on the storage and security of data, to exert control over digital activities abroad that bear on territorial concerns, and to fashion the governance of cross-border data flows as an exclusively intergovernmental prerogative with few procedural or human rights safeguards. Taken together, these proposals undermine key tenets of the liberal cyber order, that, through open networks and digital markets, have conferred geopolitical and geoeconomic advantages to liberal democracies and transnational actors based largely in Western states. Indeed, we present these findings as helping to advance a theoretical frontier in the literature on Chinese and Russian approaches to cyberspace governance. Whereas extant analyses (see Section 2) have shone a spotlight on the domestic and global impact of China and Russia's sovereignty-centric proposals, newer scholarship has begun to examine the order-level consequences of such proposals. China and Russia, these scholars note, foreground the territorial state in cyberspace for explicitly systemic objectives (Wu Citation 2021) and have attempted 'hegemonic socialisation', i.e. persuading states who are likely to agree to order-level changes (Hulvey Citation 2021, Citation 2022). Meanwhile, the order-level impact of their proposals has been clearly acknowledged and addressed as such by states like Brazil and India (Basu Citation 2024; Paulus Citation 2024), whose support is crucial for any major change to the liberal cyber order.\nAnalysing cybercrime proposals by Russia and China contextually and holistically is also important because their presentation before the AHC itself cannot be considered coincidental or opportunistic. The AHC negotiations are expressly oriented towards a treaty, in contrast to the non-binding, voluntary 'norms' on responsible behaviour that have hitherto guided interstate engagement in this domain. Moscow and Beijing have long sought to set multilateral rules not only for international cybersecurity (Levinson Citation 2021) but also for internet governance, mainly via the ITU (Radu and Gregorio Citation 2023). Those efforts have thus far not succeeded (Grigsby Citation 2017). Attempts by both states to promote technical standards that allow for greater state control over the governance of critical internet resources have not yet gained currency in multi-stakeholder forums that set standards for the internet (Hogeveen Citation 2022). Given the backdrop of 'pervasive informality' (Sukumar, Broeders, and Kello Citation 2024) in intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder models of cyberspace governance, the AHC provides a rare avenue for Russia and China to shoehorn their proposals into an instrument that binds the conduct of states.\nAt the time of writing, a draft convention text has been agreed upon by all participating states at the AHC. The final convention is expected to be adopted at a formal General Assembly vote later in 2024 (UNODC Citation 2024). As our empirical findings reveal, several proposals by Russia and China were rejected in earlier versions of the AHC draft text, while some others were reintroduced by either state in later stages of negotiation. Even if those proposals fail to gain\nacceptance, their tabling, and in some cases, persistent diplomatic efforts to push them through, indicate the importance both states attach to them, and their contribution to systemic reordering in cyberspace.\nSection 2 reviews the literature on Chinese and Russian approaches to cyberspace governance, framed against the backdrop of their broader challenge to the liberal international order. This section highlights why it is important to study their AHC proposals within this broader context, and why Russia and China have specifically sought the AHC to float those proposals. Section 3 offers a background to the cybercrime negotiations and explains how the article collected and reviewed data on Chinese and Russian AHC proposals. Section 4 forms the empirical core of this paper. It highlights various AHC proposals made by both states, dividing them into two broad categories that reflect the essence of their challenge to the liberal cyber order: one, proposals to constrain the actions of strategic Western adversaries who benefit from open digital networks, and two, proposals to enhance territorial and extraterritorial control over private actors.\n## 2. China and Russia’s challenge to the liberal cyber order\nInternational order refers to the ‘explicit principles, rules, and institutions’ that manage and reflect ‘core relationships’ and ‘settled expectations’ between states (Ikenberry Citation 2001). The liberal international order is broadly premised on three elements: freer trade and security cooperation that is based on predictable and recognised rules, cooperation through multilateral institutions that is increasingly shifting to informal mechanisms, and the progressive growth of liberal democratic values and institutional arrangements across societies (Acharya Citation 2017; Ikenberry Citation 2010). Applying the liberal domestic values of ‘predictability, access, and representation’ to international politics (Deudney and Ikenberry Citation 1999), the LIO allows private actors – especially with transnational interests such as corporations and NGOs – to engage and seek direct representation in rules, norms or institutions (Handreider Citation 1978; Moravcsik Citation 2003; Scherer et al. Citation 2006).\nIn recent years, international relations scholarship has extensively debated the challenge posed by ‘revisionist’ powers like Russia and China to the LIO across regimes such as international security, trade and climate (Johnston Citation 2019; Lake, Martin, and Risse Citation 2021; Weiss and Wallace Citation 2021; Zürn Citation 2018). The nature of Chinese and Russian challenges to the LIO differ substantially. China, according to Goddard (Citation 2018), is a ‘bridging revisionist’ that is likely to use the existing international economic and political order to foment ‘rule-based revolution’, i.e. to transform existing rules over time to those more disposed to its interests. If its geoeconomic diplomacy in particular is any indication, China does not seek an overhaul of the LIO, but ‘prefers a more conservative version that emphasises Westphalian norms of sovereignty and non-interference’ (Weiss and Wallace Citation 2021). Russia, with fewer economic stakes in the LIO, has been more inclined to test its limits through ‘violent\naction' (Goddard Citation 2018) in contravention of basic tenets of the UN Charter and modern international relations. The outcomes of their challenges to the LIO depend in large measure on the approaches of emerging powers – with some of whom the liberal order still resonates ideologically or economically, despite their differences with the hegemon, the United States (Efstathopoulos Citation 2021). In this regard, Russia and China's joint emphasis on ‘hollowing out’ the LIO into its constitutive sovereignty elements (Johnston Citation 2019) – the sovereign equality of states, treaty-based agreements in lieu of informal agreements, consent-based dispute settlement mechanisms – may appeal to a broader audience, including emerging powers (Dugard Citation 2023).\nThe challenge posed by Russia and China to the LIO presents a necessary context to the understanding of ‘cyber ordering’ or the organisation of relations between states in cyberspace (Kello Citation 2017). As Barrinha and Renard note, cyberspace was itself the creation of the liberal order – characterised by open networks as well as private and decentralised governance (Barrinha and Renard Citation 2020). As is now widely acknowledged, various aspects of the cyber order have faced contestation from state and non-state actors in recent decades, resulting in a ‘retreat of liberal values’ (Barrinha and Renard Citation 2020; Deibert and Rohozinski Citation 2011; Mueller Citation 2017). As powerful nation states, China and Russia present the most potent challenge to the order. The remainder of this section reviews extant scholarship that analyses the Chinese and Russian challenge to the liberal cyber order, with a particular focus on cybersecurity governance. Then it highlights why studying proposals at the AHC negotiations offer a clearer picture of the alternative framework of rules that Russia and China want in cyberspace.\n## 2.1. Russian and Chinese approaches to global cybersecurity governance\nWe identify three strands of scholarship examining China and Russia’s approach to cybersecurity governance. The first strand includes conceptual and empirical assessments of the notion of cyber sovereignty, deployed discursively by both countries in domestic and international settings. This body of scholarship offers important insights into the evolution of domestic policy discourse and legislation by China and Russia to attain ‘cyber sovereignty’ and ‘information security’ respectively, two related concepts that have been at the crux of both countries’ approaches to the governance of cyberspace.\nChina’s evocation of ‘cyber sovereignty’ as a policy goal can be traced back to the 2010 White Paper on the internet in China published by the state council, the country’s apex administrative body (Information Office of the State Council Citation 2010). The concept has since made an appearance in speeches by China’s political leadership as well as its international cyberspace strategy (People’s Republic of China Citation 2017). Tracing its discursive evolution over the years, scholars have distilled ‘cyber sovereignty’ into two main components (Creemers Citation 2020; Fung Citation 2022). The first constitutive element is the core role of the state in\n'information management' (Fung Citation 2022), mainly by asserting territorial control over both domestic and foreign non-state actors. Such control may be exerted through technical measures or regulations around online activities within its jurisdiction (Deibert Citation 2015; Qiao-Franco Citation 2024). Control over the information environment is also exerted by facilitating a shift in global internet governance away from multi-stakeholder processes to articulate policy or technical standards towards intergovernmental processes under the auspices of the UN (Creemers Citation 2020; Fung Citation 2022).\nThe second constitutive element of cyber sovereignty is the equality of states in cyberspace (Zeng, Stevens, and Chen Citation 2017) which China has framed primarily in terms of the right to non-interference in a state's internal affairs. On the other hand, Russia's policy discourse on 'information security' has a longer lineage, but is essentially aligned with many of the aforesaid goals of China. First articulated in the 2000 Doctrine on Information Security, this concept is presented as a 'triad' of state, society and individual interests, whose protection from internal and external threats is ultimately the remit of the government (Stadnik Citation 2021). Over time, Russian controls over digital networks have mimicked Chinese measures (Weber Citation 2017). Such measures in Russia include online content filtering, mandatory data localisation, protection of critical information infrastructure and the 2019 Law on the Russian segment of the internet that aims to ward off external threats through centralised internet traffic routing and a national domain name system (Hakala and Melnchyuk Citation 2021; Stadnik Citation 2021). Russia has also sought the development of a legally-binding instrument for cyberspace, and to restrain states from weaponizing 'information to undermine the political, economic and social system' of others (Korzak Citation 2021).\nChina and Russia's pursuit of cyber sovereignty and information security is largely animated by the survival of its political institutions and the quest for social stability. However, there is also an important global dimension to these concepts, which the second strand of scholarship unpacks (Barrinha and Turner Citation 2024; Flonk, Jachtenfuchs, and Obendiek Citation 2020; Gao Citation 2022; Jiang Citation 2010; Nocetti Citation 2015). Analyses of Chinese and Russian proposals made at international forums have highlighted their substantive impact on users, businesses and NGOs as well as inter-state relations. Beijing and Moscow have emerged as entrepreneurs of 'illiberal norms' (Flonk Citation 2021), relating mainly to the control of online content and the governance of digital platforms, in venues such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), BRICS and the UN. Their proposals also contribute to the creation of 'sovereignty spheres', where states articulate policy and set standards on online content and internet governance, often superseding global, multi-stakeholder processes (Flonk, Jachtenfuchs, and Obendiek Citation 2020). Why would other states that have benefited from global standards opt into such sovereignty enclaves? Simmons and Hulvey note that states are 'anxious [of being] overwhelmed by global forces', among which the internet figures prominently (Simmons and Hulvey Citation 2022). Facing a 'sovereign identity crisis' in the age of the internet, they\nargue, states develop ‘border orientation preferences’ to ensure digital policies mirror the governance of territorial boundaries (Simmons and Hulvey Citation 2022). In this way, they try to ensure state-society relations are not destabilised by globalisation or open information flows.\nFinally, a third strand of scholarship examines how China and Russia engage tactically with norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace (Creemers Citation 2021; Fung Citation 2022; Raymond and Sherman Citation 2024). This literature has contributed significantly to the study of ‘cyber diplomacy’ by major powers and non-state actors. It focuses especially on the diplomatic rhetoric and narratives (Barrinha and Turner Citation 2024; Hansel Citation 2023) deployed by Moscow and Beijing to bolster support for their proposals (Fung Citation 2022), as well as their gaming of multilateral negotiation procedures – supporting consensus-based agreements, limiting private participation, ‘stack[ing] the deck’ with illiberal initiatives (Raymond and Sherman Citation 2024) – for the same purpose.\nTo summarise, China and Russia’s engagement with cybersecurity governance is characterised in the literature as driven mainly by the pursuit of cyber sovereignty, i.e. the enhancement of the state’s capacity to govern territorial networks and digital assets. The most conspicuous tool deployed in the pursuit of cyber sovereignty is online content control. Both states have engaged in diplomatic efforts to export their model of cyber sovereignty, especially to developing countries. The emergence of ‘sovereignty spheres’ akin to China and Russia, scholars point out, is likely to cause the ‘fragmentation’ of the liberal cyber order (Flonk, Jachtenfuchs, and Obendiek Citation 2020). Fragmentation, as per existing literature, could refer either to the fragmentation of regulatory regimes across jurisdictions, including liberal economies (Bradford Citation 2023), or to the technical splintering of the internet into non-interoperable, territorial networks (Drake, Cerf, and Kleinwachter Citation 2016). Pertinently, Mueller cautions against exaggerating the prospect of the technical fragmentation of the internet (Mueller Citation 2017, 17, 18). Fragmentation, he notes, is possible only if a critical mass of internet-users defect from the global internet, establishing technical incompatibilities that could sustain multiple ‘internets’ for a significant period of time. The economic and security costs of such defections may not outweigh the network benefits (Mueller Citation 2017; Polatin-Reuben and Wright Citation 2014). That said, Chinese industry players like Huawei have presented proposals on technical standards on ‘decentralised internet infrastructure’ at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). These proposals have been socialised by Chinese actors as ‘New IP’ technologies, which aim to ‘[reinvent] the internet's core architecture,’ (Hoffmann, Lazanski, and Taylor Citation 2020) and potentially create ‘non-interoperable networks’ across the globe (Sharp Citation 2020). The main challenge to the liberal cyber order consequently lies not only in a possible technical fragmentation of the internet but in ongoing attempts to subject its governance, domestically and internationally, to the territorial state.\n## 2.2. Significance of the Ad Hoc Committee on cybercrime\nThe enhanced cyber sovereignty of states, especially developing countries, allow them to resist ‘US [economic and political] hegemony in cyberspace’ (Gao Citation 2022). As challengers to the liberal cyber order, this is admittedly an important goal for China and Russia. Nevertheless, as major global players themselves, both states seek rules in a sovereignty-centric cyber order that specifically benefit them, drawing in no small part on their own traditional strengths and preferences in dealing exclusively with governments abroad. The following paragraphs highlight what those goals might be, why it has been challenging for China and Russia to achieve them, and how the AHC acquires salience in this context.\nAs a systemic objective, China and Russia seek to constrain certain inherent advantages that Western economies enjoy in the liberal cyber order. An open and free internet – a core tenet of the liberal order – not only has normative appeal but also confers instrumental geopolitical advantages to Western liberal states (Lahmann Citation 2021), to which both states are especially sensitive (Lokot and Wijermars Citation 2023). ‘Internet freedom’, which has been a key US foreign policy goal, is also an enabler of market access for multinational corporations – many of them based in the US – to gain from digital economies around the world (DeNardis and Hackl Citation 2015; Farrell Citation 2006; Farrell and Newman Citation 2021). It is a tool for soft power promotion in cyberspace, facilitating the import of Western cultural, ideological and intellectual motifs and themes by developing states (Rothkopf Citation 1997). An open internet is also beneficial to covert and overt military, intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the West that enjoy ‘home-field advantage’ (Buchanan Citation 2022) in a domain largely developed and innovated upon in liberal economies. Strategic adversaries such as China and Russia want to constrain the capabilities of the United States and like-minded countries to gather intelligence and ‘persistently engage’ (Goldsmith Citation 2022; US Cyber Command Citation 2022) digital networks to surveil and mount offensive cyber operations.\nAchieving this broader goal through the reform of existing multilateral institutions has proved challenging for Russia and China. Firstly, new rules that enhance the sovereign capacities of states are likely to be incompatible with rules incubated by existing liberal regimes, in which both Russia and China are willing participants. Any attempt to coerce other states into their preferred regimes will invite retaliation or be simply ignored for other, preferential regimes (Cha Citation 2023). Even if China or Russia were to set new rules, their challenge would be to draw away middle powers or developing countries, whose economic or security dependencies with advanced liberal economies may compel them to stick with existing regimes. The ‘counterhegemonic coalitions’ (Schweller and Pu Citation 2011) that both states have sought to incubate have had little success drawing in countries that were not already in their geopolitical orbit. Initiatives such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s Code of Conduct on Information Security or the China-promoted Global Initiative on Data Security seem unlikely to register acknowledgment\namong broader multilateral initiatives (Kynge Citation 2023). In China's case particularly, it has struggled also to shore up support for 'counter-institutionalization' in global economic governance, through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) that do not conflict with the Bretton Woods institutions but attempt to 'decrease [their] relevance' (Zürn Citation 2018). In the domain of international security, prospects for counter-institutionalization are likely to be even harder (Zürn Citation 2018).\nFurthermore, the world is witnessing a discernible shift towards informal global governance (Snidal Citation 2021; Westerwinter, Abbott, and Biersteker Citation 2021), undermining efforts by Russia and China to create a new international order through binding rules. Empirically documented by scholars of international law and international relations, this phenomenon has catalysed the proliferation of informal alliances, ad hoc coalitions and task forces in economic and security domains (Bradley, Goldsmith, and Hathaway Citation 2023; Reykers et al. Citation 2023). This shift has arguably been precipitated by the US's turn towards non-binding agreements, largely for reasons of domestic politics, such as difficulties in getting Senate ratification of treaties or the lack of interest in treaty-based cooperation from populist elites (Copelovitch and Pevehouse Citation 2019). The relative decline in traditional multilateral governance deprives China and Russia, among others, of opportunities to supplant existing rules and formal regimes. The cybersecurity regime is a prime example of this phenomenon, being characterised by 'pervasive informality' (Sukumar, Broeders, and Kello Citation 2024). At the UN, for instance, Russia has for more than two decades sought an international treaty on cybersecurity, only to have its proposals rebuffed by Western countries (Farrell and Newman Citation 2021). Neither the UN GGE nor the OEWG, the two main multilateral venues for discussions on international cybersecurity, has the power to bind states with its recommendations, and both have articulated in their stead voluntary norms suggesting the contours of 'responsible state behaviour' for the domain (Kavanagh Citation 2017). Informal global governance, including in cyberspace, has paved the way for private entities to forge multi-stakeholder partnerships in various governance domains (Johnstone, Sukumar, and Trachtman Citation 2023). In comparison to treaty negotiations, which traditionally offer limited roles for NGOs and private actors to offer substantive inputs, informal channels tend to be more open and inclusive.\nThe AHC negotiations arguably address both concerns for Russia and China, and explain the scope of their proposals. Although there exists an international cybercrime instrument – the Budapest Convention – it is not signed by either state, nor for that matter by the overwhelming majority of developing countries in Asia and Africa. There is little need to develop a ‘counter-institutional’ coalition against the Budapest Convention, when most major non-signatories have expressed their reservations about the instrument. The AHC, on the other hand, comprises all UN member states, making it easier for Russia and China to build coalitions and attract countries into their orbit on their specific proposals. To be sure, both still need to engage in diplomacy to\nevangelise their proposals and appear to acknowledge this reality (Barrinha and Turner Citation 2024; Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024). As Barrinha and Turner (Citation 2024) note, Russia even took a more accommodative stand towards non-state actor participation in the cybercrime discussions in order to shore up international support.\nSecondly, the AHC discussions were very clearly geared towards a cybercrime treaty which would create binding rules. This treaty bucks the trend of informal agreements in this domain. Shoehoring proposals on cybersecurity into the cybercrime convention allowed China and Russia to address topics that either are off the table at the UN GGE or OEWG, such as cyber-enabled espionage, or do not limit the use of offensive cyber weapons by (Western) states. Consequently, their AHC proposals reflected the regulation of a whole gamut of issues that have systemic, 'order'-level effects on cyberspace. Prior to highlighting those proposals in finer detail, a brief background on the negotiations themselves is necessary.\n# 3. Cybercrime negotiations at the United Nations\nThe 'Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) for Criminal Purposes' negotiated by an intergovernmental Ad Hoc Committee will be the first binding UN instrument on any issue pertaining to the governance of cyberspace. The AHC was established by the UN General Assembly in 2019. Like the Budapest Convention developed by the Council of Europe – in some respects the precursor not only to this instrument but also to several regional agreements on cybercrime (Shires Citation 2024) – the objective of the AHC is to develop global benchmarks on identifying cybercrime and enabling international cooperation to address it.\nThe political backdrop to the AHC negotiations is important. Neither Russia nor China are signatories to the Budapest Convention. China has stayed away from the Budapest Convention for two reasons: firstly, signing the CoE Convention would be contrary to its longstanding position that global governance, including of cyberspace, should be under the aegis of the UN; secondly, China has also argued that it was not consulted when the Budapest Convention was being drafted (Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024). Russia, until its expulsion in 2022 from the body, remained the only Council of Europe member not to have signed the Budapest Convention. Moscow has offered three reasons for its decision: the low number of offences addressed by the Budapest Convention; the lack of official statistics regarding its implementation; and the Convention's allowing states to access data located in another state without the latter's authorisation, thereby violating its sovereignty (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Citation 2021).\nRussia has instead been a longstanding champion for a cybercrime treaty negotiated under the auspices of the UN (Gullo and Rodriguez Citation 2023). Cybercrime discussions at the UN\nwere previously guided through an open-ended Intergovernmental Expert Group to Conduct a Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime (United Nations General Assembly Citation 2011). The UN General Assembly resolution of December 2019 that established the AHC was a culmination of an effort by Russia to lay the diplomatic and procedural groundwork for a successful vote (Lederer Citation 2019; Rowe Citation 2020). In 2018, for example, Russia managed to push through a resolution requiring that the Secretary General collate country perspectives on cybercrime (United Nations General Assembly Citation 2018). Importantly, this resolution was titled 'Countering the use of information and communications technologies for criminal purposes', rather than simply a 'convention on cybercrime'. The 2018 resolution marked a clear and important departure from the way 'cybercrime' had been used in international discussions, especially around the Budapest Convention and also in Expert Group discussions (Hakmeh and Tropina Citation 2021). As the next section highlights, this shift is significant because it correlates to Russia and China seeking an expansive scope for the AHC convention by bringing a broad range of criminal activities within its ambit (Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024).\nWhile Europe, the United States and other like-minded states initially opposed the establishment of the AHC and did not support the Russian proposal, they have since participated actively in various negotiation sessions and intersessional consultations (Lewis and Painter Citation 2023). The AHC negotiations commenced in 2022 with plans originally for at least six negotiating sessions. At the time of writing, all planned negotiating sessions have been completed. No consensus outcome was attained at the originally stipulated concluding session in January 2024 and negotiators requested more time to complete deliberations. Consequently, a final session was scheduled for July-August 2024, during which a draft convention text was agreed upon by all participating countries. A General Assembly vote is expected in December 2024 to formally adopt the treaty (Digi Watch Citation 2024). Civil society groups and human rights campaigns have criticised the final text of the treaty due to insufficient human rights safeguards; its overly broad scope and presentation alongside a General Assembly resolution that could enable the reintroduction of cyber-enabled crimes; threats to security researchers; cementing expansive surveillance powers; enabling extensive data sharing without compatible human rights standards and safeguards and a lack of provisions on government accountability (Article 19 Citation 2024; Rodriquez Citation 2024; Tropina Citation 2024).\nThe Ad Hoc Committee was made up of the representatives of all UN member states and allowed the participation of non-voting private stakeholders, including civil society organisations and technology companies. Footnote 2 The negotiations were divided into eight broad thematic clusters, which ended up as the various operating sections of the final text of the draft convention. These included general provisions, relating to: criminalisation; jurisdiction; procedural measures of cooperation, especially among law enforcement agencies; general measures of international cooperation; preventive measures; and proposals on technical assistance and information exchange as well as mechanisms of implementation.\nAt the first three sessions, states contributed various draft provisions that could be integrated into each cluster. In April and September 2023, states held discussions on a Consolidated Negotiating Document (CND) that was prepared by the Chair.\nWhile Russia and China have been active in all sessions, the former was more active than the latter. At the first AHC session in early 2022, Russia even suggested that the AHC adopt the complete text of a draft convention it first published in 2021. At the second and third sessions, Russia and China made joint proposals, especially on procedural cooperation, which are elaborated upon in the next section. To be sure, while Russia and China have led efforts on proposals challenging the liberal cyber order at the AHC, other countries including Pakistan and Iran have also been vocal about specific concerns, such as removing human rights safeguards within the Convention (Bannelier Citation 2023). While a detailed examination of these efforts is outside the scope of this paper, it is pertinent to note that Russia and China are not working in isolation but often collaborating with a small coalition of states to effect their proposals.\n## 3.1. Data collection and analysis\nThis article's analysis of Russian and Chinese proposals at the AHC is based primarily on a review of six documents containing proposals advanced by participating states prior to each negotiating session at the AHC. The first two documents pertain to proposals advanced separately by Russia (Russia Draft Citation 2021) and China (China Suggestion Citation 2022) at the first AHC negotiating session in February 2022. The subsequent two documents analysed were jointly published by Russia, China and several developing countries in June 2022 (Russia Joint Proposal June Citation 2022) as well as in September 2022. Finally, we reviewed two versions of the Consolidated Negotiating Document (CND) – tabled in April 2023 (Ad Hoc Committee April Citation 2023) and September 2023 Footnote 3 before the AHC – that contain red line-edits to the draft convention made by all negotiating parties. The CND/DTC was tabled by the Chair of the AHC and did not indicate in any way whether red-line edits (or even the text in black letters) were likely to find place in the final draft of the convention. States had the option to reintroduce proposals and object to existing proposals until the final stage of negotiations. Red-line edits made by states or coalitions of states are particularly valuable for our analysis as looking at them helps in attributing specific proposals to states and tracking their evolution. The Chair of the AHC additionally convened informal consultations, closed working groups on certain articles/ clusters of articles and multi-stakeholder consultations. However, as details of these meetings are not on public record, they are not included in our analysis.\nIn addition to proposals tabled at all six negotiation sessions, we also reviewed publicly accessible oral statements made by Russia, China, the United States, the EU and other like-minded countries accessed through the United Nations Web Television (UN WebTV) portal. In all, we reviewed documentary and media sources dating from February 2022 to September 2023.\nFootnote 4 To triangulate our analysis, we consulted secondary literature including media coverage of the negotiations and analyses from blogs and podcasts authored by diplomats, legal practitioners and scholars.\n# 4. Unpacking Chinese and Russian proposals at the AHC\nThis section highlights two sets of Chinese and Russian proposals at the AHC that, by enhancing the territorial capacity of states, attempt to limit strategic operations undertaken by their Western adversaries as well as the ability of influential non-state actors to set global technical standards or advance norms on cybersecurity and human rights. The first set of proposals seek the criminalisation of certain offensive cyber operations against critical information infrastructure (CII) and for the purpose of conducting espionage. Russia and China's goal here is to ensure that the openness of global digital networks do not allow adversaries the operational ability and freedom to execute such operations. A second category of proposals facilitate greater territorial and extra-territorial control of states over data, users and digital infrastructure. They do so not just through an expansive approach to defining crimes in cyberspace, but also through proposals to expand the jurisdiction of states over users and data abroad that are implicated in the commission of a crime in their own territories. These proposals on extra-territorial jurisdiction are complemented by those that relax procedural and human rights safeguards on the cross-border sharing of data between law enforcement agencies.\nTaken in toto, these proposals offer an alternative framework of rules that blunt key attributes of the liberal cyber order highlighted in Section II and consequently limit the inherent advantages enjoyed by Western states and transnational private actors in this order.\nhighlights both sets of proposals, along with the specific provisions or changes Russia and China have sought at various stages of the AHC negotiations.\n# Table 1. Summary of relevant proposals advanced by Russia and China at the AHC.\n# 4.1. Constraining strategic adversaries in cyberspace\nChina and Russia have called on states at the AHC to criminalise cyber operations targeting critical infrastructure as well as cyber-enabled espionage. To be sure, Russia and China have arguably engaged in cyber operations that would fall foul of the same provisions they seek in this regard. Their own acts of commission have not deterred their AHC diplomacy arguably for two reasons. The first explanation is that Russia and China perceive for themselves an exceptional status in an alternative cyber order, in much the same way they routinely accuse the United States and its allies of 'hypocritical' actions that contravene the liberal order (Cai Citation 2019, 160).\nHere, the distinction between the approaches of Russia and China is important. Russia has long sought binding rules against the targeting of critical infrastructure, while its conduct, both through operations undertaken by state agencies and via state-supported private groups, has been in flagrant contradiction to those proposals (Korzak Citation 2021). Moscow, which is more 'confrontational and disruptive' (Broeders, Adamson, and Creemers Citation 2019) towards the liberal cyber order, is apparently comfortable with its simultaneous championing and violation of cybersecurity rules. China, on the other hand, has been less forthcoming with specific proposals for cyberspace and tends more to point out the 'double standards' (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China Citation 2023) of the US, particularly in relation to surveillance and espionage. This distinction, as the following paragraphs show, is reflected in the two countries' degree of willingness to push their proposals at the AHC in the face of opposition – Russia more, China less so. A second, issue-specific explanation is that Russia and China have both turned increasingly towards private actors to undertake disruptive or data-gathering operations (Lonergan Citation 2022; Maurer Citation 2017). In contrast to Western liberal economies, which rely on cyber commands and intelligence agencies that are operationally or institutionally accountable to domestic oversight mechanisms, Russia and China's cyber statecraft is characterised by their reliance on proxies (Giles Citation 2023; Hmaidi Citation 2023; Sherman Citation 2022). Unsurprisingly, their AHC proposals criminalise only the conduct of states, allowing both states to claim plausible deniability for proxy actions and exploit the challenges of legally attributing proxy cyber operations to governments. Chinese and Russian proposals at the AHC specifically take aim against US policies such as 'persistent engagement' and 'defend forward', which seek to disrupt 'malicious cyber activity at its source' through the 'proactive' monitoring of foreign networks by US government agencies (Fischerkeller and Harknett Citation 2019; US Cyber Command Citation 2022).\n## 4.2. Critical infrastructure and cyber operations\nThe protection of CI has been discussed at the UN GGE and OEWG for nearly a decade. In 2015, the UN GGE articulated a norm calling on states to 'not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity' that 'intentionally damaged critical infrastructure or otherwise [impaired]' its use (Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, Citation 2015). Since its publication, several multi-stakeholder and intergovernmental bodies have articulated their own version of the norm, specifying either guidelines around state behaviour with respect to CI or identifying certain sectors as 'critical' and therefore deserving of protection (Kouloufakos Citation 2023). Turning the attention of the UN GGE towards the protection of CI has been a longstanding goal of all major actors involved in the process, but in Russia's case, its proposals should also be viewed in the broader geopolitical context of its diplomacy towards a cybersecurity treaty at the UN (Lilly and Cheravitch Citation 2020).\nMoscow's pursuit of a UN cybersecurity treaty was itself an attempt to constrain the development and use by the US and its allies of cyber offensive capabilities and generally limit the (then) advantages that the latter had in this domain (Croft Citation 2012 ; Demidov and Chernenko Citation 2015 ). The GGE format of discussions was the result of a US-Russia compromise to develop a 'framework of responsible state behaviour' through voluntary guidelines in lieu of a new treaty. The 2015 UN GGE's norm on the protection of CI, however, limited only those actions that would violate a state's obligations under existing international law. In other words, the norm concerned itself exclusively with cyber operations that either qualified as a 'use of force' or otherwise resulted in a major loss of functionality or physical effects (Haataja Citation 2023 ). Intelligence or espionage operations, including those with the intent of embedding themselves within critical infrastructure for the purposes of deploying countermeasures or 'active cyber defence' measures (Broeders Citation 2021 ) would be potentially excluded. The sixth UN GGE in 2021 affirmed this view (Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, Citation 2021 ).\nWith the GGE process not delivering the outcome it hoped for, Russia has since turned its attention towards the AHC. In 2022, the lead Russian negotiator to the UN GGE suggested that 'cybercrime is frequently used to disguise attacks against critical infrastructure [and] undermine [the] political and economic situation of governments' (Ministry of Foreign Affairs Citation 2022). Moscow has sought to criminalise 'unlawful interference' with critical infrastructure and critical information infrastructure (CII) since the first session of AHC negotiations, notwithstanding initial opposition from the US and like-minded countries in the European Union (Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes Citation 2023; \"EU Statement - UN Ad-Hoc Committee for a UN Convention on Cybercrime: Objectives and Scope of the Convention and EEAS.\" Citation 2022). Specifically, the Russian proposal suggests that parties should adopt 'legislative and other measures as are necessary under domestic law' to criminalise the creation of software or other digital information that can interfere with CII to destroy, impede or even copy information contained therein (Russia First Draft Article Citation 10 bis Citation 2021) [emphasis added]. The proposal makes clear that surveillance and intelligence-gathering operations would be covered under its remit. Further, the provision also criminalises non-compliance by private actors with government-issued guidelines related to securing CII if such non-compliance results in an attack or damage to information systems. The effect of this proposal is that multinational companies who supply or operate industrial control systems could also be implicated by domestic penal provisions.\nIn the UNGA First Committee, China too has called on states to refrain from targeting the 'critical infrastructures of other states' (People's Republic of China Citation 2017). Further, China has passed domestic legislation protecting CII, imposing duties and responsibilities on operators (Data Security Law of the People's Republic of China Citation 2021). China's first\nsubmission at the AHC sought to criminalise the ‘intrusion and destruction of ICTs facilities, systems, data or CII’. The Chinese proposal seeks to criminalise not only illegal ‘access’ and ‘interference’ with computer data and ‘information systems’ but also the lesser ‘infringement of critical information infrastructure’ (China Suggestion, Article Citation 3 ( Citation 1 ) Citation 2021 ). The protection of CII is also flagged by several joint Russian and Chinese proposals on international cooperation in the AHC. One such proposal seeks an ‘equal right’ to states for ‘the protection of its information resources and critical information infrastructures from misuse and unauthorised interference’ (Russia Joint Proposal June Citation 2022 , Art. 46 (5)). As the above statements indicate, China and Russia’s emphasis at the AHC is on CII, and not CI per se . While most countries share common perceptions of what constitutes CII (ITU-World Bank Citation 2021 ; Cybersecurity Authority of Singapore Citation 2018 ; Russia First Draft Citation 2021 ), it is still important to distinguish it from critical infrastructure. CII refers to information or communication systems or any other network resources that are by themselves required for discharging ‘vital’ services within a nation or essential to the uninterrupted functioning of critical infrastructure such as industrial control systems. Broad international convergence on many definitional aspects of CII notwithstanding, China’s position in particular – underpinned by its domestic law – is notable in the present context. China’s CII Security Protection Regulations, which took effect in 2021, defines CII to include systems whose ‘data leakage’ may ‘gravely harm’, inter alia , the ‘public interest’ (Data Security Law of the People’s Republic of China Citation 2021 ). In contrast, the EU’s focus, for example, is on the destruction or disruption of such infrastructure. Consistent with Russian proposals (Russia First Draft Citation 2021 , Article 11), and reading China’s AHC proposals alongside its domestic regulation (China’s Suggestion Citation 2021 , Article 3(2)), it would appear that Beijing has pursued a catch-all approach to CII as well as actions targeting such infrastructure that would be proscribed (including surveillance and espionage).\nWhile the Russian proposal on CII was removed in the Draft Text of the Convention (DTC) tabled by the AHC Chair before the Sixth Negotiating Session in September 2023, Moscow proposed its reintroduction into the negotiating process in the final session (Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes Citation 2023 , Article 10 bis). Notably, China did not support Russia's proposal to reintroduce criminal provisions on CII. US agencies assess that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been targeting and compromising US critical infrastructure potentially to leverage such access during conflict (United States Department of Defense Citation 2023 ; Washington Post Citation 2023 ). If accurate, these assessments would partly explain China's reluctance to push harder for criminal penalties against compromising CII through a cybercrime treaty. There is also the important consideration, noted at the beginning of this article, of China's global economic interests in cyberspace which outstrip those of Russia. China arguably would consider itself better off with some cybercrime treaty than none at all, which Russia's maximalist bargaining threatened to do at various stages of the AHC.\n## 4.3. Cyber-enabled espionage\nA related issue on which China and Russia have both floated AHC proposals is espionage. The issue of cyber-enabled espionage has been the proverbial ‘elephant in the room’ as far as international cybersecurity discussions are concerned (Broeders Citation 2024). Save for the US—China cybersecurity agreement that proscribed espionage for economic purposes (Yoo Citation 2015), there are no major international agreements that address the issue, either in terms of legal provisions or normative guardrails. On the other hand, China and Russia have sought to use the AHC negotiations on cybercrime to address cross-border espionage. To be sure, the Budapest Convention calls on states to criminalise electronic ‘interception without right’ that is committed ‘intentionally’. States could also require commission with ‘dishonest intent’ (Budapest Convention Citation 2001, Article 3) for criminality. However, as scholars have noted, the Budapest Convention only addresses the criminality of individual actions, and therefore is limited in addressing state espionage (Crootof Citation 2019; Rowe Citation 2020).\nIn contrast, China proposed at the AHC negotiations to hold states accountable for the interception of data (China Suggestion, Article Citation 4 (Citation 1) Citation 2022). The proposal read:\nStates shall not directly collect the data stored in foreign states from enterprises or individuals by technical means bypassing network security protection measures if such measures are against the laws of that foreign state.\nThe proposal not only highlighted a restriction on state activity, but also specifically emphasised the need to shield ‘enterprises and individuals’ from espionage activities. The Budapest Convention, in comparison, only refers to interception ‘to and from’ computer systems. While cyber operations that ‘bypass network security protection measures’ could refer to both disruptive operations as well as cyber-enabled espionage, China’s proposal should be read in the context of its domestic measures aimed at countering espionage. In 2023, China revised its counter-espionage law to include expansively the protection of ‘documents, data, materials and items related to national security and interests’ (Zhang Citation 2023). The revision specifically emphasised cyber operations, whether destructive or intelligence-gathering in nature, that targeted critical information infrastructure and ‘confidential-related units’ within state organs in China. The objective of the revised law is ostensibly to discourage multinational corporations and their employees from collaborating with foreign spy agencies (Marsh and Waldersee Citation 2023; Reuters Citation 2023) and has even resulted in the detention of a foreign national accused of spying (Global Times Citation 2023a; Global Times Citation 2023b). The geopolitical context is especially significant: in light of Chinese attempts to isolate itself from much of the world in the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, Western intelligence agencies have publicly emphasised the need to build ‘strong human intelligence capability’ in the country (Barnes and Wong Citation 2023; CGTN Citation 2023). Through its AHC proposal,\nChina sought not only to secure an international commitment that mirrored its domestic law but ultimately to provide it the legal imprimatur to thwart and deter US and Western intelligence operations that undermine its geopolitical or geoeconomic interests (Azcarate Citation 2023). Meanwhile, Beijing itself has reportedly leaned on proxy actors who make use of increasingly sophisticated methods for cyber espionage, that gives it greater room for deniability. Take for instance, the use by Chinese actors of disaggregate, compromised nodes such as private servers and IoT devices that make attribution to a single group or entity challenging (Raggi Citation 2024).\nRussia's original proposal tabled at the first AHC session similarly sought to criminalise the use of 'technical means to intercept traffic data and data processed by means of ICT that are not intended for public use' (Russia First Draft Citation 2021, Article 7). This is similar to the formulation in the Budapest Convention, although it is slightly modified to stipulate that interception carried out without 'appropriate authorisation' or in 'violation of established rules' should be unlawful. The Budapest Convention's formulation on interception, as noted previously, is more permissive towards espionage and only proscribes those operations conducted 'without right' by another state. Russia's standard is narrower, and allows for states to determine by domestic regulation what constitutes 'inappropriate' interception.\n## 4.4. Enhancing sovereign capacity against domestic and extraterritorial threats\nA second set of AHC proposals by Russia and China seeks to enhance the ability of governments to 'detect, suppress, investigate and prosecute' criminal activities – designated so by domestic law – within their own territories but also abroad (DTC September 2023, Article 1(1); Russia First Draft Citation 2021, Article 31). The latter objective has been sought through procedural measures that ease access to electronic evidence located in other countries and the dilution of human rights safeguards, especially in relation to the handling of data transferred between states. In promoting these proposals, China and Russia's overarching goal is arguably to limit the power of multinational technology companies as well as civil society organisations and coalitions, which are mainly based in, or draw their market strength or legitimacy from, advanced liberal economies. As highlighted previously, the effect of these proposals would be to limit the technical standard or policy-setting capacity of influential private actors on data governance and security, such as encryption and data storage. Admittedly, these proposals would also limit the ability of Chinese and Russian companies to set standards and shape policy. This outcome is in line with the heightened degrees of control, both from a policy and corporate governance perspective, that both states have exerted over their major technology players in recent years (Zhang Citation 2024).\nWe study six sets of proposals within this broader category (see) that advance this objective.\n## 4.5. Addressing ‘cyber-enabled’ crimes\nThe first category of proposals pertains to the types of crimes that can be prosecuted through the AHC convention. Both states have sought the criminalisation of ‘cyber-enabled’ crimes, i.e. crimes that have an ICT component relevant to their commission, as opposed to ‘cyber-dependent’ crimes, which fit more the traditional ‘CIA’ crimes – targeted by the Budapest Convention – that affect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of systems (Wilkinson Citation 2023). Many of these cyber-enabled crimes relate to the publication of online content, which is tightly regulated in authoritarian states. The AHC’s title itself – a committee to elaborate a treaty on ‘the use of ICTs for criminal purposes’ – was the effort of Russian resolutions at the UN General Assembly (Wilkinson Citation 2023). Non-government organizations (NGOs) and civil society organisations have not only decried the inclusion of content-related crimes as posing a ‘heightened risk’ (Privacy International and Electronic Frontier Foundation Citation 2022) to the exercise of human rights but also as impeding the work of journalists or whistle-blowers (Electronic Frontier Foundation Citation 2022). Russia and China have sought also to criminalise, respectively, ‘digital data to mislead the user’ and the ‘dissemination of false information’ (Martin Citation 2023), although these proposals have generated concern among industry and civil society (Bannelier Citation 2023). Neither formulation appears to have made it to the final rounds of negotiations. Russia, along with a number of developing countries, also proposed an all-encompassing clause to ensure the cybercrime treaty did not ‘preclude a State Party from establishing as an offence any other unlawful act committed intentionally with the use of information and communication technologies that causes significant damage’, which remains a legally ambiguous threshold (DTC September 2023, Art. 15 undecies). Targeting a broad range of ‘cyber-enabled crimes’ mirrors domestic criminal law provisions in both China and Russia and has been viewed by some experts as a means of legitimising and exporting their domestic governance models (Iyengar, Gamer and Rathi Citation 2023). Instrumentally, China’s focus has been on crimes faced by its own law enforcement agencies (Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024). Wider criminal provisions in domestic law and international treaty law boost state authority to assert control over individuals and companies that use cyberspace.\n## 4.6. Provisions on mutual legal assistance, human rights, jurisdiction and non-state actors\nBeyond seeking an expansive scope for the cybercrime treaty, we identify five areas where China and Russia have pushed for greater power for states to regulate digital activities at home and abroad. First, Russia has sought through the AHC convention to limit exemptions and safeguards against mutual legal assistance (MLA) requests by a state. These include rejecting clauses that allow states to refuse MLA requests for the prosecution of political offences (DTC September 2023, Art. 40 Clause 21 (c) bis) or those motivated by a ‘person's sex, race, language, religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinions’ (DTC September 2023, Art. 40 Clause 21 (c) ter).\nSecond, both China and Russia have advocated procedural reforms to domestic criminal law that would enable the easier prosecution of crimes committed through the use of ICTs. Russia has sought to ‘ensure that electronic evidence derived or extracted from [any ICT] shall have the probative value in criminal procedure’ (DTC September 2023, Article 30 bis). China and Russia have suggested that states should establish ‘relevant legal procedures and technical standards for the collection, retention and provision of electronic evidence to ensure the authenticity, integrity and legality of electronic evidence’ (DTC September 2023, Article 30 ter).\nThird, these states have, along with others, sought to limit human rights safeguards against the prosecution of cybercrime. Russia has objected to several proposals that introduce human rights safeguards against criminal prosecution, including in the case of ‘persons and groups in vulnerable situations’ (DTC September 2023, Article 5(2)). Moscow has also rejected a proposal to include the effective protection of human rights as a key element of cross-border technical assistance and capacity-building (DTC September 2023, Article 54). While China has not backed Russia on the proposal to remove human rights safeguards altogether, it has resisted attempts to introduce oversight mechanisms or limitations in the way governments can process and retain personal data transferred between states under the AHC convention (DTC September 2023, Article 36 sub-clause 2). Russia has also sought the use of the term ‘unlawful’ across the Consolidated Negotiation Text of the AHC draft to refer to specific acts that invite criminal prosecution. In contrast, the US, EU and like-minded countries prefer the phrase ‘without right’, which is more commonly used in the Budapest Convention. This distinction is important: ‘unlawful’ actions would be determined solely on the basis of domestic legislation, whereas the more permissive formulation ‘without right’ acknowledges the universal legitimacy of certain actions, such as accessing a free and open public computer system, instituting ‘protection activities’ (such as stronger encryption or cybersecurity safeguards) with the permission of those involved in transmitting data, or those actions taken in the pursuit of human rights such as privacy or free expression (Budapest Convention Citation 2001).\nFourth, Russia and China’s efforts to regulate extraterritorial activity go beyond proposals for expansive MLA. Notably, Russia has sought to extend states’ jurisdiction to cases in which ‘the offence is committed wholly or partly outside [their territory] but its effect in the territory [would] constitute an offence or result in the commission of an offense’ (DTC September 2023, Art. 22 sub-clause 2 c bis). Similarly, Russia has sought automatic jurisdiction for states if the ‘offence is committed against the State Party’ (DTC September 2023, Article 22 sub-clause 2 d). China has qualified its support to Russia’s invocation of the ‘effects doctrine’ Footnote ⁵ (Estey Citation 1997). Jurisdiction, in China’s view, should be based on a ‘true and sufficient’ link with criminal activities, giving priority to the place where the consequence of criminal activity occurs, where it is committed and the location of the perpetrator (China Suggestion Citation 3 (Citation 7) Citation 2022).\nFinally, both states have sought explicit control over internet service providers by national agencies. Such proposals have been an integral part of all Russian and Chinese drafts and contributions made to the AHC over six negotiating sessions. In its first draft proposal submitted to the AHC, Russia included two articles that specifically address the role of the private sector and ISPs, and also sought a code of conduct for their governance (Russian Federation Citation 2021, Article 43). China's proposals, while not as extensive, require companies and service providers to 'take technical measures and other necessary measures to effectively respond to criminal activities' (China's Suggestion Citation 2022, Article 3 (6)). Notably, both states have sought the criminalisation of the 'unlawful provision of service', understood as the providing of essentially any digitally-enabled service with 'the intent that the service or technical support be used for the commission of any of the offences' (DTC September 2023, Article 10 ter). Presumably, the service provider's 'intent' in this case would be discerned by states themselves, which enables the prosecution of any service provider that does not restrict internet services to communities or geographic areas proscribed by the state. Given the broad scope of offences that Russia and China, along with other authoritarian regimes, want to criminalise, this proposal could severely restrict the scope of operation of Virtual Private Networks or even secure messaging platforms that are set up with the intention of enabling secure and private communication away from the gaze of the state. These proposals are notable and offer important context to what China sees as the role of ISPs in 'decentralised internet infrastructure' models that it has floated at standards bodies.\nRussia's push for greater control over extraterritorial activity also throws into relief its original justification for not signing the Budapest Convention. Moscow has long expressed concerns over Article 32 of the Budapest Convention because it enables cross-border law enforcement access to territorial data without authorisation from the respective State Party. At the AHC negotiations, Russia has proposed that all cooperation under the cybercrime convention happens exclusively with the authorisation of State Parties. The cumulative effect of Russia's proposals would be that states become the sole arbiters of cross-border data access, but also have few procedural safeguards or human rights restrictions to refuse sharing data with other governments.\n# 5. Cybercrime negotiations and the future of the liberal cyber order\nRussia and China's proposals at the AHC reflect their efforts to shape systemically the governance of cyberspace, away from its liberal underpinnings. They attempt to reconfigure the norms and rules governing international relations in cyberspace by casting the territorial state as its main actor. Much like Western states have benefitted from a liberal order rooted in the dilution of the territorial state and the delegation of key cyberspace governance functions to private actors\n(Farrell and Newman Citation 2021), Russia and China seek geopolitical advantages from the alternative order they propose.\nDraft measures on the protection of CII and the criminalisation of cyber-enabled espionage constrain the freedom that Western intelligence agencies and commands enjoy in cyberspace for information-gathering and disruptive operations. On the other hand, stronger control over online content and the activities of digital services providers as well as weaker procedural and substantive safeguards on cross-border data-sharing between governments ensure that states can regulate private actors at home and also exert control over the data of users and entities held abroad (Harvey and Moore Citation 2022). The goal of these proposals is to limit the autonomy and influence of (mostly) Western technology companies in determining data flows and cybersecurity outcomes through their in-house policies and technical standards (Klonick Citation 2017).\nRussia and China's pursuit of an alternative cyber order is backed by several statements on issues discussed in the paper. While a detailed examination of these statements and strategies is outside the scope of this paper, we highlight a few notable examples. Beijing's repeated references to the US's 'empire of hacking' (Reuters Citation 2023) and Moscow's claims of US targeting critical infrastructure for subversive 'political and economic' operations suggest that their proposals at the AHC are motivated by overarching geopolitical motives, rather than by narrow domestic ones (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Citation 2022). Further, both countries have tried to use the platform of the AHC to promote their model among developing countries through language referencing the need for a systemic shift in cyberspace governance. China has declared that the AHC treaty should 'adjust [to] and create new contours for ensuring the security of states' (China Intervention Sixth Session Morning, UN Web TV 2023, 01:01:00 to 01:07:00). This messaging has been emphasised repeatedly by the Russian delegation as well. An article written by the Deputy Head of the Russian delegation amidst the AHC negotiations argued that the 'prospects for the global digitalisation process as a whole, the effectiveness and dynamics which depend on ensuring security, are in question' (Chernukhin Citation 2023).\nIndeed, Russia and China's diplomatic strategies at the AHC appear to exploit the Global South's 'discontent' against the LIO (Endaylalu Citation 2022). Both states have argued that debates on human rights are manufactured by states (liberal economies) who seek to 'retain their dominant position in the information sphere' at the cost of 'practical cooperation' on cybercrime (Russian Federation Citation 2022). In other words, the messaging here is not that human rights are bad, but that developing nations have more urgent priorities which are not highlighted in the current order. Relatedly, both states have also underlined the need for new rules to prosecute cybercrime, appealing to the deeply felt sentiment among African and Asian countries to be norm-makers and not norm-takers (Acharya Citation 2011). China's opening intervention at AHC negotiations stressed that including 'cyber-enabled crimes' in the cybercrime treaty is a way of ensuring that international law kept 'pace with the trends' (China, Intervention Sixth Session Morning, UN\nWeb TV 2023, 01:01:00 to 01:07:00). Russia has emphasised the fact that many countries stayed away from the Budapest Convention because they were not involved in its creation (Seger Citation 2016), denouncing the instrument as having failed to win the 'minds and hearts' of the developing world (Chernukhin Citation 2023).\nAs illustrates, Russia and China's own cyber diplomacy at the AHC has received steady support from some of its allies, but many developing countries and emerging powers (Chivvis and Geaghan-Breiner Citation 2024) have largely remained silent in response.\n# Table 2. States' responses to China and Russia's proposals at September 2023 negotiations.\nThe Draft Text of Convention (DTC) circulated by the AHC's chair in September 2023 omitted several proposals from China and Russia, especially on the scope and coverage of 'cyber-enabled crimes' as well as protection of CII. However, Russia attempted to reinsert all those proposals back into the DTC as red-line edits. China, as has illustrated, appears to have been less persistent in terms of reintroducing its original proposals. China's more moderate approach, as indicated in the first half of this paper, arguably reflects its heightened economic stake in cyberspace, compared to Russia's all-or-nothing strategy. Further, Russia's approach to the AHC negotiations reflects its strategy in the UN GGE and UN OEWG, where it scoped out similarly maximalist positions before engaging in last-minute, backroom deals to secure consensus within both groups. Chinese cyber diplomacy generally tends to avoid such grand bargains, and in the AHC appears to have prioritised some of its proposals over others.\nRegardless of their outcomes, it is clear from Russia and China's proposals that both states view the proposed AHC convention on cybercrime as an opportunity to chart new rules for the road for cyberspace. In a domain characterised mainly by informal norms of responsible behaviour and technical standards – a consequence of the liberal ordering of cyberspace – both states have arguably found it difficult to challenge the economic and normative clout of major private actors and to constrain the strategic advantages of powerful Western adversaries. They have sought consequently to use the prospective AHC treaty to usher in a cyber order that lends primacy to the territorial state – not only to govern domestic digital activity but also to shape international data flows and the use of offensive cyber capabilities.\n# Acknowledgement\nThe authors thank Isabella Wilkinson for comments on a previous draft of this article.\n# Disclosure statement\nThe authors report that there are no competing interests to declare.",

    "# 1. Introduction": "What kind of global governance regime do China and Russia seek for cyberspace? As authoritarian states with strong restrictions on the online activities of individuals, businesses and NGOs, do they simply seek greater autonomy to regulate digital technologies in their territory without foreign intervention? China and Russia have been robustly engaged, for over two decades, in discussions on internet governance at the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) (Murgia and Gross Citation 2020; Yoo Citation 2023), regional cooperative institutions and multi-stakeholder entities such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) (Kennedy Citation 2013; Negro Citation 2020; Yan Citation 2015). Chinese and Russian proposals advanced at these forums have the effect of increasing states' capacity to manage the territorial conduct of private actors.\nThe proposals advanced by both states at international forums also signal their geopolitical interests in cyberspace. Discussions on international cybersecurity in the UN General Assembly's First Committee, where Russia and China have competed with the 'like-minded' Footnote 1 countries led by the United States and European Union on specific proposals, throw into relief those interests (Basu, Poetranto, and Lau Citation 2021; Tiirmaa-Klaar Citation 2021). Through their First Committee proposals, Russia and China have sought to limit the ability of Western adversaries to engage in offensive cyber operations against their digital assets and infrastructure, and simultaneously to legitimize their own strategies and practices (for example, their increasing use of proxies or 'cyber mercenaries') (Maurer Citation 2017; Sukumar Citation 2017).\nBy dint of institutional design and the fragmented nature of the cyber 'regime complex' (Nye Citation 2014), discussions on internet governance, cybercrime and norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace have hitherto taken place across a number of international forums. This fragmentation has occluded from analysis a complete picture of the systemic changes that Russia and China pursue for the governance of cyberspace. Given that they are major cyber powers, it is important to understand whether and why both states seek to influence how other states govern territorial networks to advance their own broader geopolitical and geoeconomic ambitions for the domain. For instance, China and Russia would want for other states to have greater agency over domestic networks, whether for the purpose of requesting them to thwart Western cyber operations, curtail the growing influence of Western technology companies whom they see as proxies of the US or its allies, or clamp down on foreign voices and institutions critical of them. Conversely, implementing tougher restrictions on online activity at home may often require China and Russia to seek data from abroad for investigative and prosecutorial purposes. For such data requests to succeed, states must not only be aligned on what counts as criminal activity in cyberspace, there should also be few procedural hurdles for interstate data transfers. These objectives require a major reconfiguration of the way in which states currently engage with each other in cyberspace, and with private actors both domestically and internationally.\nTo be sure, Russian and Chinese objectives for cyberspace governance differ in important respects. As Flonk notes, Russia relies more on policy-oriented measures to regulate internet infrastructure, users and networks than China, where technical infrastructure such as the Great Chinese Firewall allows for a high degree of centralisation over content control and platforms governance (Flonk Citation 2021). Secondly, with significantly higher economic stakes in cyberspace, China's geopolitical outlook differs somewhat from Russia's. China's cyber diplomacy and proposals are driven by a desire to support Chinese technology companies while seeking a significant degree of state control over ICT activities at home and abroad. Russia, on the other hand, does not have a significant domestic technology industry and is therefore arguably less concerned about the geoeconomic consequences of its cyber diplomacy (Broeders, Adamson, and Creemers Citation 2019). Finally, China is more selective than Russia in the execution of cyber operations. While Moscow undertakes a broad range of disruptive and\ndestructive cyber operations, including those aimed at systemic political destabilisation, Beijing has restricted itself to undertaking operations that incrementally advance its economic or security objectives. The difference could be attributed to the blowback that Chinese industry and states agencies would face as good-faith participants and key influencers of standards development (Russel and Berger Citation 2021) and digital markets were they to undertake cyber operations that cause widespread instability or degrade the availability of global internet services.\nThese differences notwithstanding, scholars have long highlighted the strong convergence of views between Russia and China in their ideological opposition to the liberal international order and to its application to cyberspace. This ‘liberal cyber order’ is marked not only by substantive norms that govern state behaviour in cyberspace but also by who sets those norms (Rovner Citation 2023). Open data flows, multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms and deference to the exercise of civil, political and economic liberties online constitute the defining characteristics of the liberal cyber order, whose influence on the internet is historical and still discernible (Deibert and Crete-Nishihata Citation 2012; Farrell and Newman Citation 2021; Hollis and Raustiala Citation 2022). In geopolitical terms, this order privileges liberal democracies and their constituents – in particular the United States and its trans-Atlantic allies who have helped incubate the growth of the internet since its early years – as rule-shapers (Farrell and Newman Citation 2021, Citation 2024). China and Russia are united in their goal to ‘reform the liberal cyber order’ (Wu Citation 2021), which includes upending liberal norms (Flonk Citation 2021) as well as the institutional governance mechanisms that are its mainstay (Raymond and Sherman Citation 2024). China and Russia are not the only actors who seek a ‘post-liberal cyberspace’ (Barrinha and Renard Citation 2020), but they are certainly its most powerful proponents, and frequent fellow travellers in diplomatic forums.\nThis article highlights Russian and Chinese efforts to orchestrate such a systemic reform or reconfiguration of the liberal cyber order through the proposed cybercrime convention currently negotiated by an Ad Hoc Committee (AHC) of the United Nations. While the AHC was established to develop a binding international instrument for states to tackle cybercrime – in official terms, counter the ‘use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) for criminal purposes’ – we show that Russia and China have sought for it to regulate activities that go well beyond the treaty’s intended scope. Their proposals, as this article empirically demonstrates, not only address cybercrime, but also implicate international cybersecurity governance and cross-border data access.\nChinese and Russian proposals at the AHC push for states to have greater control over digital infrastructure and activities. As this article's review of the literature highlights, this is consistent with longstanding Chinese and Russian views on cyberspace governance. Nonetheless, the AHC negotiations also demonstrate that their championing of 'cyber sovereignty' (Creemers Citation 2020; Stadnik Citation 2021; Thumfart Citation 2021; Zeng, Stevens, and Chen Citation 2017) is oriented towards specific objectives that in turn reveal China and Russia's aspirations towards\nsystemic changes in cyberspace governance. Their proposals empower the territorial state to regulate certain cyber operations of geopolitical concern to China and Russia. In the guise of addressing cybercrime, they also allow states to shape policies and standards on the storage and security of data, to exert control over digital activities abroad that bear on territorial concerns, and to fashion the governance of cross-border data flows as an exclusively intergovernmental prerogative with few procedural or human rights safeguards. Taken together, these proposals undermine key tenets of the liberal cyber order, that, through open networks and digital markets, have conferred geopolitical and geoeconomic advantages to liberal democracies and transnational actors based largely in Western states. Indeed, we present these findings as helping to advance a theoretical frontier in the literature on Chinese and Russian approaches to cyberspace governance. Whereas extant analyses (see Section 2) have shone a spotlight on the domestic and global impact of China and Russia's sovereignty-centric proposals, newer scholarship has begun to examine the order-level consequences of such proposals. China and Russia, these scholars note, foreground the territorial state in cyberspace for explicitly systemic objectives (Wu Citation 2021) and have attempted 'hegemonic socialisation', i.e. persuading states who are likely to agree to order-level changes (Hulvey Citation 2021, Citation 2022). Meanwhile, the order-level impact of their proposals has been clearly acknowledged and addressed as such by states like Brazil and India (Basu Citation 2024; Paulus Citation 2024), whose support is crucial for any major change to the liberal cyber order.\nAnalysing cybercrime proposals by Russia and China contextually and holistically is also important because their presentation before the AHC itself cannot be considered coincidental or opportunistic. The AHC negotiations are expressly oriented towards a treaty, in contrast to the non-binding, voluntary 'norms' on responsible behaviour that have hitherto guided interstate engagement in this domain. Moscow and Beijing have long sought to set multilateral rules not only for international cybersecurity (Levinson Citation 2021) but also for internet governance, mainly via the ITU (Radu and Gregorio Citation 2023). Those efforts have thus far not succeeded (Grigsby Citation 2017). Attempts by both states to promote technical standards that allow for greater state control over the governance of critical internet resources have not yet gained currency in multi-stakeholder forums that set standards for the internet (Hogeveen Citation 2022). Given the backdrop of 'pervasive informality' (Sukumar, Broeders, and Kello Citation 2024) in intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder models of cyberspace governance, the AHC provides a rare avenue for Russia and China to shoehorn their proposals into an instrument that binds the conduct of states.\nAt the time of writing, a draft convention text has been agreed upon by all participating states at the AHC. The final convention is expected to be adopted at a formal General Assembly vote later in 2024 (UNODC Citation 2024). As our empirical findings reveal, several proposals by Russia and China were rejected in earlier versions of the AHC draft text, while some others were reintroduced by either state in later stages of negotiation. Even if those proposals fail to gain\nacceptance, their tabling, and in some cases, persistent diplomatic efforts to push them through, indicate the importance both states attach to them, and their contribution to systemic reordering in cyberspace.\nSection 2 reviews the literature on Chinese and Russian approaches to cyberspace governance, framed against the backdrop of their broader challenge to the liberal international order. This section highlights why it is important to study their AHC proposals within this broader context, and why Russia and China have specifically sought the AHC to float those proposals. Section 3 offers a background to the cybercrime negotiations and explains how the article collected and reviewed data on Chinese and Russian AHC proposals. Section 4 forms the empirical core of this paper. It highlights various AHC proposals made by both states, dividing them into two broad categories that reflect the essence of their challenge to the liberal cyber order: one, proposals to constrain the actions of strategic Western adversaries who benefit from open digital networks, and two, proposals to enhance territorial and extraterritorial control over private actors.",
    "## 2. China and Russia’s challenge to the liberal cyber order": "International order refers to the ‘explicit principles, rules, and institutions’ that manage and reflect ‘core relationships’ and ‘settled expectations’ between states (Ikenberry Citation 2001). The liberal international order is broadly premised on three elements: freer trade and security cooperation that is based on predictable and recognised rules, cooperation through multilateral institutions that is increasingly shifting to informal mechanisms, and the progressive growth of liberal democratic values and institutional arrangements across societies (Acharya Citation 2017; Ikenberry Citation 2010). Applying the liberal domestic values of ‘predictability, access, and representation’ to international politics (Deudney and Ikenberry Citation 1999), the LIO allows private actors – especially with transnational interests such as corporations and NGOs – to engage and seek direct representation in rules, norms or institutions (Handreider Citation 1978; Moravcsik Citation 2003; Scherer et al. Citation 2006).\nIn recent years, international relations scholarship has extensively debated the challenge posed by ‘revisionist’ powers like Russia and China to the LIO across regimes such as international security, trade and climate (Johnston Citation 2019; Lake, Martin, and Risse Citation 2021; Weiss and Wallace Citation 2021; Zürn Citation 2018). The nature of Chinese and Russian challenges to the LIO differ substantially. China, according to Goddard , is a ‘bridging revisionist’ that is likely to use the existing international economic and political order to foment ‘rule-based revolution’, i.e. to transform existing rules over time to those more disposed to its interests. If its geoeconomic diplomacy in particular is any indication, China does not seek an overhaul of the LIO, but ‘prefers a more conservative version that emphasises Westphalian norms of sovereignty and non-interference’ (Weiss and Wallace Citation 2021). Russia, with fewer economic stakes in the LIO, has been more inclined to test its limits through ‘violent\naction' (Goddard Citation 2018) in contravention of basic tenets of the UN Charter and modern international relations. The outcomes of their challenges to the LIO depend in large measure on the approaches of emerging powers – with some of whom the liberal order still resonates ideologically or economically, despite their differences with the hegemon, the United States (Efstathopoulos Citation 2021). In this regard, Russia and China's joint emphasis on ‘hollowing out’ the LIO into its constitutive sovereignty elements (Johnston Citation 2019) – the sovereign equality of states, treaty-based agreements in lieu of informal agreements, consent-based dispute settlement mechanisms – may appeal to a broader audience, including emerging powers (Dugard Citation 2023).\nThe challenge posed by Russia and China to the LIO presents a necessary context to the understanding of ‘cyber ordering’ or the organisation of relations between states in cyberspace (Kello Citation 2017). As Barrinha and Renard note, cyberspace was itself the creation of the liberal order – characterised by open networks as well as private and decentralised governance (Barrinha and Renard Citation 2020). As is now widely acknowledged, various aspects of the cyber order have faced contestation from state and non-state actors in recent decades, resulting in a ‘retreat of liberal values’ (Barrinha and Renard Citation 2020; Deibert and Rohozinski Citation 2011; Mueller Citation 2017). As powerful nation states, China and Russia present the most potent challenge to the order. The remainder of this section reviews extant scholarship that analyses the Chinese and Russian challenge to the liberal cyber order, with a particular focus on cybersecurity governance. Then it highlights why studying proposals at the AHC negotiations offer a clearer picture of the alternative framework of rules that Russia and China want in cyberspace.\n## 2.1. Russian and Chinese approaches to global cybersecurity governance\nWe identify three strands of scholarship examining China and Russia’s approach to cybersecurity governance. The first strand includes conceptual and empirical assessments of the notion of cyber sovereignty, deployed discursively by both countries in domestic and international settings. This body of scholarship offers important insights into the evolution of domestic policy discourse and legislation by China and Russia to attain ‘cyber sovereignty’ and ‘information security’ respectively, two related concepts that have been at the crux of both countries’ approaches to the governance of cyberspace.\nChina’s evocation of ‘cyber sovereignty’ as a policy goal can be traced back to the 2010 White Paper on the internet in China published by the state council, the country’s apex administrative body (Information Office of the State Council Citation 2010). The concept has since made an appearance in speeches by China’s political leadership as well as its international cyberspace strategy (People’s Republic of China Citation 2017). Tracing its discursive evolution over the years, scholars have distilled ‘cyber sovereignty’ into two main components (Creemers Citation 2020; Fung Citation 2022). The first constitutive element is the core role of the state in\n'information management' (Fung Citation 2022), mainly by asserting territorial control over both domestic and foreign non-state actors. Such control may be exerted through technical measures or regulations around online activities within its jurisdiction (Deibert Citation 2015; Qiao-Franco Citation 2024). Control over the information environment is also exerted by facilitating a shift in global internet governance away from multi-stakeholder processes to articulate policy or technical standards towards intergovernmental processes under the auspices of the UN (Creemers Citation 2020; Fung Citation 2022).\nThe second constitutive element of cyber sovereignty is the equality of states in cyberspace (Zeng, Stevens, and Chen Citation 2017) which China has framed primarily in terms of the right to non-interference in a state's internal affairs. On the other hand, Russia's policy discourse on 'information security' has a longer lineage, but is essentially aligned with many of the aforesaid goals of China. First articulated in the 2000 Doctrine on Information Security, this concept is presented as a 'triad' of state, society and individual interests, whose protection from internal and external threats is ultimately the remit of the government (Stadnik Citation 2021). Over time, Russian controls over digital networks have mimicked Chinese measures (Weber Citation 2017). Such measures in Russia include online content filtering, mandatory data localisation, protection of critical information infrastructure and the 2019 Law on the Russian segment of the internet that aims to ward off external threats through centralised internet traffic routing and a national domain name system (Hakala and Melnchyuk Citation 2021; Stadnik Citation 2021). Russia has also sought the development of a legally-binding instrument for cyberspace, and to restrain states from weaponizing 'information to undermine the political, economic and social system' of others (Korzak Citation 2021).\nChina and Russia's pursuit of cyber sovereignty and information security is largely animated by the survival of its political institutions and the quest for social stability. However, there is also an important global dimension to these concepts, which the second strand of scholarship unpacks (Barrinha and Turner Citation 2024; Flonk, Jachtenfuchs, and Obendiek Citation 2020; Gao Citation 2022; Jiang Citation 2010; Nocetti Citation 2015). Analyses of Chinese and Russian proposals made at international forums have highlighted their substantive impact on users, businesses and NGOs as well as inter-state relations. Beijing and Moscow have emerged as entrepreneurs of 'illiberal norms' (Flonk Citation 2021), relating mainly to the control of online content and the governance of digital platforms, in venues such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), BRICS and the UN. Their proposals also contribute to the creation of 'sovereignty spheres', where states articulate policy and set standards on online content and internet governance, often superseding global, multi-stakeholder processes (Flonk, Jachtenfuchs, and Obendiek Citation 2020). Why would other states that have benefited from global standards opt into such sovereignty enclaves? Simmons and Hulvey note that states are 'anxious [of being] overwhelmed by global forces', among which the internet figures prominently (Simmons and Hulvey Citation 2022). Facing a 'sovereign identity crisis' in the age of the internet, they\nargue, states develop ‘border orientation preferences’ to ensure digital policies mirror the governance of territorial boundaries (Simmons and Hulvey Citation 2022). In this way, they try to ensure state-society relations are not destabilised by globalisation or open information flows.\nFinally, a third strand of scholarship examines how China and Russia engage tactically with norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace (Creemers Citation 2021; Fung Citation 2022; Raymond and Sherman Citation 2024). This literature has contributed significantly to the study of ‘cyber diplomacy’ by major powers and non-state actors. It focuses especially on the diplomatic rhetoric and narratives (Barrinha and Turner Citation 2024; Hansel Citation 2023) deployed by Moscow and Beijing to bolster support for their proposals (Fung Citation 2022), as well as their gaming of multilateral negotiation procedures – supporting consensus-based agreements, limiting private participation, ‘stack[ing] the deck’ with illiberal initiatives (Raymond and Sherman Citation 2024) – for the same purpose.\nTo summarise, China and Russia’s engagement with cybersecurity governance is characterised in the literature as driven mainly by the pursuit of cyber sovereignty, i.e. the enhancement of the state’s capacity to govern territorial networks and digital assets. The most conspicuous tool deployed in the pursuit of cyber sovereignty is online content control. Both states have engaged in diplomatic efforts to export their model of cyber sovereignty, especially to developing countries. The emergence of ‘sovereignty spheres’ akin to China and Russia, scholars point out, is likely to cause the ‘fragmentation’ of the liberal cyber order (Flonk, Jachtenfuchs, and Obendiek Citation 2020). Fragmentation, as per existing literature, could refer either to the fragmentation of regulatory regimes across jurisdictions, including liberal economies (Bradford Citation 2023), or to the technical splintering of the internet into non-interoperable, territorial networks (Drake, Cerf, and Kleinwachter Citation 2016). Pertinently, Mueller cautions against exaggerating the prospect of the technical fragmentation of the internet (Mueller Citation 2017, 17, 18). Fragmentation, he notes, is possible only if a critical mass of internet-users defect from the global internet, establishing technical incompatibilities that could sustain multiple ‘internets’ for a significant period of time. The economic and security costs of such defections may not outweigh the network benefits (Mueller Citation 2017; Polatin-Reuben and Wright Citation 2014). That said, Chinese industry players like Huawei have presented proposals on technical standards on ‘decentralised internet infrastructure’ at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). These proposals have been socialised by Chinese actors as ‘New IP’ technologies, which aim to ‘[reinvent] the internet's core architecture,’ (Hoffmann, Lazanski, and Taylor Citation 2020) and potentially create ‘non-interoperable networks’ across the globe (Sharp Citation 2020). The main challenge to the liberal cyber order consequently lies not only in a possible technical fragmentation of the internet but in ongoing attempts to subject its governance, domestically and internationally, to the territorial state.\n## 2.2. Significance of the Ad Hoc Committee on cybercrime\nThe enhanced cyber sovereignty of states, especially developing countries, allow them to resist ‘US [economic and political] hegemony in cyberspace’ (Gao Citation 2022). As challengers to the liberal cyber order, this is admittedly an important goal for China and Russia. Nevertheless, as major global players themselves, both states seek rules in a sovereignty-centric cyber order that specifically benefit them, drawing in no small part on their own traditional strengths and preferences in dealing exclusively with governments abroad. The following paragraphs highlight what those goals might be, why it has been challenging for China and Russia to achieve them, and how the AHC acquires salience in this context.\nAs a systemic objective, China and Russia seek to constrain certain inherent advantages that Western economies enjoy in the liberal cyber order. An open and free internet – a core tenet of the liberal order – not only has normative appeal but also confers instrumental geopolitical advantages to Western liberal states (Lahmann Citation 2021), to which both states are especially sensitive (Lokot and Wijermars Citation 2023). ‘Internet freedom’, which has been a key US foreign policy goal, is also an enabler of market access for multinational corporations – many of them based in the US – to gain from digital economies around the world (DeNardis and Hackl Citation 2015; Farrell Citation 2006; Farrell and Newman Citation 2021). It is a tool for soft power promotion in cyberspace, facilitating the import of Western cultural, ideological and intellectual motifs and themes by developing states (Rothkopf Citation 1997). An open internet is also beneficial to covert and overt military, intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the West that enjoy ‘home-field advantage’ (Buchanan Citation 2022) in a domain largely developed and innovated upon in liberal economies. Strategic adversaries such as China and Russia want to constrain the capabilities of the United States and like-minded countries to gather intelligence and ‘persistently engage’ (Goldsmith Citation 2022; US Cyber Command Citation 2022) digital networks to surveil and mount offensive cyber operations.\nAchieving this broader goal through the reform of existing multilateral institutions has proved challenging for Russia and China. Firstly, new rules that enhance the sovereign capacities of states are likely to be incompatible with rules incubated by existing liberal regimes, in which both Russia and China are willing participants. Any attempt to coerce other states into their preferred regimes will invite retaliation or be simply ignored for other, preferential regimes (Cha Citation 2023). Even if China or Russia were to set new rules, their challenge would be to draw away middle powers or developing countries, whose economic or security dependencies with advanced liberal economies may compel them to stick with existing regimes. The ‘counterhegemonic coalitions’ (Schweller and Pu Citation 2011) that both states have sought to incubate have had little success drawing in countries that were not already in their geopolitical orbit. Initiatives such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s Code of Conduct on Information Security or the China-promoted Global Initiative on Data Security seem unlikely to register acknowledgment\namong broader multilateral initiatives (Kynge Citation 2023). In China's case particularly, it has struggled also to shore up support for 'counter-institutionalization' in global economic governance, through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) that do not conflict with the Bretton Woods institutions but attempt to 'decrease [their] relevance' (Zürn Citation 2018). In the domain of international security, prospects for counter-institutionalization are likely to be even harder (Zürn Citation 2018).\nFurthermore, the world is witnessing a discernible shift towards informal global governance (Snidal Citation 2021; Westerwinter, Abbott, and Biersteker Citation 2021), undermining efforts by Russia and China to create a new international order through binding rules. Empirically documented by scholars of international law and international relations, this phenomenon has catalysed the proliferation of informal alliances, ad hoc coalitions and task forces in economic and security domains (Bradley, Goldsmith, and Hathaway Citation 2023; Reykers et al. Citation 2023). This shift has arguably been precipitated by the US's turn towards non-binding agreements, largely for reasons of domestic politics, such as difficulties in getting Senate ratification of treaties or the lack of interest in treaty-based cooperation from populist elites (Copelovitch and Pevehouse Citation 2019). The relative decline in traditional multilateral governance deprives China and Russia, among others, of opportunities to supplant existing rules and formal regimes. The cybersecurity regime is a prime example of this phenomenon, being characterised by 'pervasive informality' (Sukumar, Broeders, and Kello Citation 2024). At the UN, for instance, Russia has for more than two decades sought an international treaty on cybersecurity, only to have its proposals rebuffed by Western countries (Farrell and Newman Citation 2021). Neither the UN GGE nor the OEWG, the two main multilateral venues for discussions on international cybersecurity, has the power to bind states with its recommendations, and both have articulated in their stead voluntary norms suggesting the contours of 'responsible state behaviour' for the domain (Kavanagh Citation 2017). Informal global governance, including in cyberspace, has paved the way for private entities to forge multi-stakeholder partnerships in various governance domains (Johnstone, Sukumar, and Trachtman Citation 2023). In comparison to treaty negotiations, which traditionally offer limited roles for NGOs and private actors to offer substantive inputs, informal channels tend to be more open and inclusive.\nThe AHC negotiations arguably address both concerns for Russia and China, and explain the scope of their proposals. Although there exists an international cybercrime instrument – the Budapest Convention – it is not signed by either state, nor for that matter by the overwhelming majority of developing countries in Asia and Africa. There is little need to develop a ‘counter-institutional’ coalition against the Budapest Convention, when most major non-signatories have expressed their reservations about the instrument. The AHC, on the other hand, comprises all UN member states, making it easier for Russia and China to build coalitions and attract countries into their orbit on their specific proposals. To be sure, both still need to engage in diplomacy to\nevangelise their proposals and appear to acknowledge this reality (Barrinha and Turner Citation 2024; Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024). As Barrinha and Turner  note, Russia even took a more accommodative stand towards non-state actor participation in the cybercrime discussions in order to shore up international support.\nSecondly, the AHC discussions were very clearly geared towards a cybercrime treaty which would create binding rules. This treaty bucks the trend of informal agreements in this domain. Shoehoring proposals on cybersecurity into the cybercrime convention allowed China and Russia to address topics that either are off the table at the UN GGE or OEWG, such as cyber-enabled espionage, or do not limit the use of offensive cyber weapons by (Western) states. Consequently, their AHC proposals reflected the regulation of a whole gamut of issues that have systemic, 'order'-level effects on cyberspace. Prior to highlighting those proposals in finer detail, a brief background on the negotiations themselves is necessary.",
    "# 3. Cybercrime negotiations at the United Nations": "The 'Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) for Criminal Purposes' negotiated by an intergovernmental Ad Hoc Committee will be the first binding UN instrument on any issue pertaining to the governance of cyberspace. The AHC was established by the UN General Assembly in 2019. Like the Budapest Convention developed by the Council of Europe – in some respects the precursor not only to this instrument but also to several regional agreements on cybercrime (Shires Citation 2024) – the objective of the AHC is to develop global benchmarks on identifying cybercrime and enabling international cooperation to address it.\nThe political backdrop to the AHC negotiations is important. Neither Russia nor China are signatories to the Budapest Convention. China has stayed away from the Budapest Convention for two reasons: firstly, signing the CoE Convention would be contrary to its longstanding position that global governance, including of cyberspace, should be under the aegis of the UN; secondly, China has also argued that it was not consulted when the Budapest Convention was being drafted (Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024). Russia, until its expulsion in 2022 from the body, remained the only Council of Europe member not to have signed the Budapest Convention. Moscow has offered three reasons for its decision: the low number of offences addressed by the Budapest Convention; the lack of official statistics regarding its implementation; and the Convention's allowing states to access data located in another state without the latter's authorisation, thereby violating its sovereignty (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Citation 2021).\nRussia has instead been a longstanding champion for a cybercrime treaty negotiated under the auspices of the UN (Gullo and Rodriguez Citation 2023). Cybercrime discussions at the UN\nwere previously guided through an open-ended Intergovernmental Expert Group to Conduct a Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime (United Nations General Assembly Citation 2011). The UN General Assembly resolution of December 2019 that established the AHC was a culmination of an effort by Russia to lay the diplomatic and procedural groundwork for a successful vote (Lederer Citation 2019; Rowe Citation 2020). In 2018, for example, Russia managed to push through a resolution requiring that the Secretary General collate country perspectives on cybercrime (United Nations General Assembly Citation 2018). Importantly, this resolution was titled 'Countering the use of information and communications technologies for criminal purposes', rather than simply a 'convention on cybercrime'. The 2018 resolution marked a clear and important departure from the way 'cybercrime' had been used in international discussions, especially around the Budapest Convention and also in Expert Group discussions (Hakmeh and Tropina Citation 2021). As the next section highlights, this shift is significant because it correlates to Russia and China seeking an expansive scope for the AHC convention by bringing a broad range of criminal activities within its ambit (Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024).\nWhile Europe, the United States and other like-minded states initially opposed the establishment of the AHC and did not support the Russian proposal, they have since participated actively in various negotiation sessions and intersessional consultations (Lewis and Painter Citation 2023). The AHC negotiations commenced in 2022 with plans originally for at least six negotiating sessions. At the time of writing, all planned negotiating sessions have been completed. No consensus outcome was attained at the originally stipulated concluding session in January 2024 and negotiators requested more time to complete deliberations. Consequently, a final session was scheduled for July-August 2024, during which a draft convention text was agreed upon by all participating countries. A General Assembly vote is expected in December 2024 to formally adopt the treaty (Digi Watch Citation 2024). Civil society groups and human rights campaigns have criticised the final text of the treaty due to insufficient human rights safeguards; its overly broad scope and presentation alongside a General Assembly resolution that could enable the reintroduction of cyber-enabled crimes; threats to security researchers; cementing expansive surveillance powers; enabling extensive data sharing without compatible human rights standards and safeguards and a lack of provisions on government accountability (Article 19 Citation 2024; Rodriquez Citation 2024; Tropina Citation 2024).\nThe Ad Hoc Committee was made up of the representatives of all UN member states and allowed the participation of non-voting private stakeholders, including civil society organisations and technology companies. Footnote 2 The negotiations were divided into eight broad thematic clusters, which ended up as the various operating sections of the final text of the draft convention. These included general provisions, relating to: criminalisation; jurisdiction; procedural measures of cooperation, especially among law enforcement agencies; general measures of international cooperation; preventive measures; and proposals on technical assistance and information exchange as well as mechanisms of implementation.\nAt the first three sessions, states contributed various draft provisions that could be integrated into each cluster. In April and September 2023, states held discussions on a Consolidated Negotiating Document (CND) that was prepared by the Chair.\nWhile Russia and China have been active in all sessions, the former was more active than the latter. At the first AHC session in early 2022, Russia even suggested that the AHC adopt the complete text of a draft convention it first published in 2021. At the second and third sessions, Russia and China made joint proposals, especially on procedural cooperation, which are elaborated upon in the next section. To be sure, while Russia and China have led efforts on proposals challenging the liberal cyber order at the AHC, other countries including Pakistan and Iran have also been vocal about specific concerns, such as removing human rights safeguards within the Convention (Bannelier Citation 2023). While a detailed examination of these efforts is outside the scope of this paper, it is pertinent to note that Russia and China are not working in isolation but often collaborating with a small coalition of states to effect their proposals.\n## 3.1. Data collection and analysis\nThis article's analysis of Russian and Chinese proposals at the AHC is based primarily on a review of six documents containing proposals advanced by participating states prior to each negotiating session at the AHC. The first two documents pertain to proposals advanced separately by Russia (Russia Draft Citation 2021) and China (China Suggestion Citation 2022) at the first AHC negotiating session in February 2022. The subsequent two documents analysed were jointly published by Russia, China and several developing countries in June 2022 (Russia Joint Proposal June Citation 2022) as well as in September 2022. Finally, we reviewed two versions of the Consolidated Negotiating Document (CND) – tabled in April 2023 (Ad Hoc Committee April Citation 2023) and September 2023 Footnote 3 before the AHC – that contain red line-edits to the draft convention made by all negotiating parties. The CND/DTC was tabled by the Chair of the AHC and did not indicate in any way whether red-line edits (or even the text in black letters) were likely to find place in the final draft of the convention. States had the option to reintroduce proposals and object to existing proposals until the final stage of negotiations. Red-line edits made by states or coalitions of states are particularly valuable for our analysis as looking at them helps in attributing specific proposals to states and tracking their evolution. The Chair of the AHC additionally convened informal consultations, closed working groups on certain articles/ clusters of articles and multi-stakeholder consultations. However, as details of these meetings are not on public record, they are not included in our analysis.\nIn addition to proposals tabled at all six negotiation sessions, we also reviewed publicly accessible oral statements made by Russia, China, the United States, the EU and other like-minded countries accessed through the United Nations Web Television (UN WebTV) portal. In all, we reviewed documentary and media sources dating from February 2022 to September 2023.\nFootnote 4 To triangulate our analysis, we consulted secondary literature including media coverage of the negotiations and analyses from blogs and podcasts authored by diplomats, legal practitioners and scholars.",
    "# 4. Unpacking Chinese and Russian proposals at the AHC": "This section highlights two sets of Chinese and Russian proposals at the AHC that, by enhancing the territorial capacity of states, attempt to limit strategic operations undertaken by their Western adversaries as well as the ability of influential non-state actors to set global technical standards or advance norms on cybersecurity and human rights. The first set of proposals seek the criminalisation of certain offensive cyber operations against critical information infrastructure (CII) and for the purpose of conducting espionage. Russia and China's goal here is to ensure that the openness of global digital networks do not allow adversaries the operational ability and freedom to execute such operations. A second category of proposals facilitate greater territorial and extra-territorial control of states over data, users and digital infrastructure. They do so not just through an expansive approach to defining crimes in cyberspace, but also through proposals to expand the jurisdiction of states over users and data abroad that are implicated in the commission of a crime in their own territories. These proposals on extra-territorial jurisdiction are complemented by those that relax procedural and human rights safeguards on the cross-border sharing of data between law enforcement agencies.\nTaken in toto, these proposals offer an alternative framework of rules that blunt key attributes of the liberal cyber order highlighted in Section II and consequently limit the inherent advantages enjoyed by Western states and transnational private actors in this order.\nhighlights both sets of proposals, along with the specific provisions or changes Russia and China have sought at various stages of the AHC negotiations.\n# Table 1. Summary of relevant proposals advanced by Russia and China at the AHC.\n# 4.1. Constraining strategic adversaries in cyberspace\nChina and Russia have called on states at the AHC to criminalise cyber operations targeting critical infrastructure as well as cyber-enabled espionage. To be sure, Russia and China have arguably engaged in cyber operations that would fall foul of the same provisions they seek in this regard. Their own acts of commission have not deterred their AHC diplomacy arguably for two reasons. The first explanation is that Russia and China perceive for themselves an exceptional status in an alternative cyber order, in much the same way they routinely accuse the United States and its allies of 'hypocritical' actions that contravene the liberal order (Cai Citation 2019, 160).\nHere, the distinction between the approaches of Russia and China is important. Russia has long sought binding rules against the targeting of critical infrastructure, while its conduct, both through operations undertaken by state agencies and via state-supported private groups, has been in flagrant contradiction to those proposals (Korzak Citation 2021). Moscow, which is more 'confrontational and disruptive' (Broeders, Adamson, and Creemers Citation 2019) towards the liberal cyber order, is apparently comfortable with its simultaneous championing and violation of cybersecurity rules. China, on the other hand, has been less forthcoming with specific proposals for cyberspace and tends more to point out the 'double standards' (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China Citation 2023) of the US, particularly in relation to surveillance and espionage. This distinction, as the following paragraphs show, is reflected in the two countries' degree of willingness to push their proposals at the AHC in the face of opposition – Russia more, China less so. A second, issue-specific explanation is that Russia and China have both turned increasingly towards private actors to undertake disruptive or data-gathering operations (Lonergan Citation 2022; Maurer Citation 2017). In contrast to Western liberal economies, which rely on cyber commands and intelligence agencies that are operationally or institutionally accountable to domestic oversight mechanisms, Russia and China's cyber statecraft is characterised by their reliance on proxies (Giles Citation 2023; Hmaidi Citation 2023; Sherman Citation 2022). Unsurprisingly, their AHC proposals criminalise only the conduct of states, allowing both states to claim plausible deniability for proxy actions and exploit the challenges of legally attributing proxy cyber operations to governments. Chinese and Russian proposals at the AHC specifically take aim against US policies such as 'persistent engagement' and 'defend forward', which seek to disrupt 'malicious cyber activity at its source' through the 'proactive' monitoring of foreign networks by US government agencies (Fischerkeller and Harknett Citation 2019; US Cyber Command Citation 2022).\n## 4.2. Critical infrastructure and cyber operations\nThe protection of CI has been discussed at the UN GGE and OEWG for nearly a decade. In 2015, the UN GGE articulated a norm calling on states to 'not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity' that 'intentionally damaged critical infrastructure or otherwise [impaired]' its use (Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, Citation 2015). Since its publication, several multi-stakeholder and intergovernmental bodies have articulated their own version of the norm, specifying either guidelines around state behaviour with respect to CI or identifying certain sectors as 'critical' and therefore deserving of protection (Kouloufakos Citation 2023). Turning the attention of the UN GGE towards the protection of CI has been a longstanding goal of all major actors involved in the process, but in Russia's case, its proposals should also be viewed in the broader geopolitical context of its diplomacy towards a cybersecurity treaty at the UN (Lilly and Cheravitch Citation 2020).\nMoscow's pursuit of a UN cybersecurity treaty was itself an attempt to constrain the development and use by the US and its allies of cyber offensive capabilities and generally limit the (then) advantages that the latter had in this domain (Croft Citation 2012 ; Demidov and Chernenko Citation 2015 ). The GGE format of discussions was the result of a US-Russia compromise to develop a 'framework of responsible state behaviour' through voluntary guidelines in lieu of a new treaty. The 2015 UN GGE's norm on the protection of CI, however, limited only those actions that would violate a state's obligations under existing international law. In other words, the norm concerned itself exclusively with cyber operations that either qualified as a 'use of force' or otherwise resulted in a major loss of functionality or physical effects (Haataja Citation 2023 ). Intelligence or espionage operations, including those with the intent of embedding themselves within critical infrastructure for the purposes of deploying countermeasures or 'active cyber defence' measures (Broeders Citation 2021 ) would be potentially excluded. The sixth UN GGE in 2021 affirmed this view (Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, Citation 2021 ).\nWith the GGE process not delivering the outcome it hoped for, Russia has since turned its attention towards the AHC. In 2022, the lead Russian negotiator to the UN GGE suggested that 'cybercrime is frequently used to disguise attacks against critical infrastructure [and] undermine [the] political and economic situation of governments' (Ministry of Foreign Affairs Citation 2022). Moscow has sought to criminalise 'unlawful interference' with critical infrastructure and critical information infrastructure (CII) since the first session of AHC negotiations, notwithstanding initial opposition from the US and like-minded countries in the European Union (Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes Citation 2023; \"EU Statement - UN Ad-Hoc Committee for a UN Convention on Cybercrime: Objectives and Scope of the Convention and EEAS.\" Citation 2022). Specifically, the Russian proposal suggests that parties should adopt 'legislative and other measures as are necessary under domestic law' to criminalise the creation of software or other digital information that can interfere with CII to destroy, impede or even copy information contained therein (Russia First Draft Article Citation 10 bis Citation 2021) [emphasis added]. The proposal makes clear that surveillance and intelligence-gathering operations would be covered under its remit. Further, the provision also criminalises non-compliance by private actors with government-issued guidelines related to securing CII if such non-compliance results in an attack or damage to information systems. The effect of this proposal is that multinational companies who supply or operate industrial control systems could also be implicated by domestic penal provisions.\nIn the UNGA First Committee, China too has called on states to refrain from targeting the 'critical infrastructures of other states' (People's Republic of China Citation 2017). Further, China has passed domestic legislation protecting CII, imposing duties and responsibilities on operators (Data Security Law of the People's Republic of China Citation 2021). China's first\nsubmission at the AHC sought to criminalise the ‘intrusion and destruction of ICTs facilities, systems, data or CII’. The Chinese proposal seeks to criminalise not only illegal ‘access’ and ‘interference’ with computer data and ‘information systems’ but also the lesser ‘infringement of critical information infrastructure’ (China Suggestion, Article Citation 3 ( Citation 1 ) Citation 2021 ). The protection of CII is also flagged by several joint Russian and Chinese proposals on international cooperation in the AHC. One such proposal seeks an ‘equal right’ to states for ‘the protection of its information resources and critical information infrastructures from misuse and unauthorised interference’ (Russia Joint Proposal June Citation 2022 , Art. 46 (5)). As the above statements indicate, China and Russia’s emphasis at the AHC is on CII, and not CI per se . While most countries share common perceptions of what constitutes CII (ITU-World Bank Citation 2021 ; Cybersecurity Authority of Singapore Citation 2018 ; Russia First Draft Citation 2021 ), it is still important to distinguish it from critical infrastructure. CII refers to information or communication systems or any other network resources that are by themselves required for discharging ‘vital’ services within a nation or essential to the uninterrupted functioning of critical infrastructure such as industrial control systems. Broad international convergence on many definitional aspects of CII notwithstanding, China’s position in particular – underpinned by its domestic law – is notable in the present context. China’s CII Security Protection Regulations, which took effect in 2021, defines CII to include systems whose ‘data leakage’ may ‘gravely harm’, inter alia , the ‘public interest’ (Data Security Law of the People’s Republic of China Citation 2021 ). In contrast, the EU’s focus, for example, is on the destruction or disruption of such infrastructure. Consistent with Russian proposals (Russia First Draft Citation 2021 , Article 11), and reading China’s AHC proposals alongside its domestic regulation (China’s Suggestion Citation 2021 , Article 3(2)), it would appear that Beijing has pursued a catch-all approach to CII as well as actions targeting such infrastructure that would be proscribed (including surveillance and espionage).\nWhile the Russian proposal on CII was removed in the Draft Text of the Convention (DTC) tabled by the AHC Chair before the Sixth Negotiating Session in September 2023, Moscow proposed its reintroduction into the negotiating process in the final session (Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes Citation 2023 , Article 10 bis). Notably, China did not support Russia's proposal to reintroduce criminal provisions on CII. US agencies assess that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been targeting and compromising US critical infrastructure potentially to leverage such access during conflict (United States Department of Defense Citation 2023 ; Washington Post Citation 2023 ). If accurate, these assessments would partly explain China's reluctance to push harder for criminal penalties against compromising CII through a cybercrime treaty. There is also the important consideration, noted at the beginning of this article, of China's global economic interests in cyberspace which outstrip those of Russia. China arguably would consider itself better off with some cybercrime treaty than none at all, which Russia's maximalist bargaining threatened to do at various stages of the AHC.\n## 4.3. Cyber-enabled espionage\nA related issue on which China and Russia have both floated AHC proposals is espionage. The issue of cyber-enabled espionage has been the proverbial ‘elephant in the room’ as far as international cybersecurity discussions are concerned (Broeders Citation 2024). Save for the US—China cybersecurity agreement that proscribed espionage for economic purposes (Yoo Citation 2015), there are no major international agreements that address the issue, either in terms of legal provisions or normative guardrails. On the other hand, China and Russia have sought to use the AHC negotiations on cybercrime to address cross-border espionage. To be sure, the Budapest Convention calls on states to criminalise electronic ‘interception without right’ that is committed ‘intentionally’. States could also require commission with ‘dishonest intent’ (Budapest Convention Citation 2001, Article 3) for criminality. However, as scholars have noted, the Budapest Convention only addresses the criminality of individual actions, and therefore is limited in addressing state espionage (Crootof Citation 2019; Rowe Citation 2020).\nIn contrast, China proposed at the AHC negotiations to hold states accountable for the interception of data (China Suggestion, Article Citation 4 (Citation 1) Citation 2022). The proposal read:\nStates shall not directly collect the data stored in foreign states from enterprises or individuals by technical means bypassing network security protection measures if such measures are against the laws of that foreign state.\nThe proposal not only highlighted a restriction on state activity, but also specifically emphasised the need to shield ‘enterprises and individuals’ from espionage activities. The Budapest Convention, in comparison, only refers to interception ‘to and from’ computer systems. While cyber operations that ‘bypass network security protection measures’ could refer to both disruptive operations as well as cyber-enabled espionage, China’s proposal should be read in the context of its domestic measures aimed at countering espionage. In 2023, China revised its counter-espionage law to include expansively the protection of ‘documents, data, materials and items related to national security and interests’ (Zhang Citation 2023). The revision specifically emphasised cyber operations, whether destructive or intelligence-gathering in nature, that targeted critical information infrastructure and ‘confidential-related units’ within state organs in China. The objective of the revised law is ostensibly to discourage multinational corporations and their employees from collaborating with foreign spy agencies (Marsh and Waldersee Citation 2023; Reuters Citation 2023) and has even resulted in the detention of a foreign national accused of spying (Global Times Citation 2023a; Global Times Citation 2023b). The geopolitical context is especially significant: in light of Chinese attempts to isolate itself from much of the world in the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, Western intelligence agencies have publicly emphasised the need to build ‘strong human intelligence capability’ in the country (Barnes and Wong Citation 2023; CGTN Citation 2023). Through its AHC proposal,\nChina sought not only to secure an international commitment that mirrored its domestic law but ultimately to provide it the legal imprimatur to thwart and deter US and Western intelligence operations that undermine its geopolitical or geoeconomic interests (Azcarate Citation 2023). Meanwhile, Beijing itself has reportedly leaned on proxy actors who make use of increasingly sophisticated methods for cyber espionage, that gives it greater room for deniability. Take for instance, the use by Chinese actors of disaggregate, compromised nodes such as private servers and IoT devices that make attribution to a single group or entity challenging (Raggi Citation 2024).\nRussia's original proposal tabled at the first AHC session similarly sought to criminalise the use of 'technical means to intercept traffic data and data processed by means of ICT that are not intended for public use' (Russia First Draft Citation 2021, Article 7). This is similar to the formulation in the Budapest Convention, although it is slightly modified to stipulate that interception carried out without 'appropriate authorisation' or in 'violation of established rules' should be unlawful. The Budapest Convention's formulation on interception, as noted previously, is more permissive towards espionage and only proscribes those operations conducted 'without right' by another state. Russia's standard is narrower, and allows for states to determine by domestic regulation what constitutes 'inappropriate' interception.\n## 4.4. Enhancing sovereign capacity against domestic and extraterritorial threats\nA second set of AHC proposals by Russia and China seeks to enhance the ability of governments to 'detect, suppress, investigate and prosecute' criminal activities – designated so by domestic law – within their own territories but also abroad (DTC September 2023, Article 1(1); Russia First Draft Citation 2021, Article 31). The latter objective has been sought through procedural measures that ease access to electronic evidence located in other countries and the dilution of human rights safeguards, especially in relation to the handling of data transferred between states. In promoting these proposals, China and Russia's overarching goal is arguably to limit the power of multinational technology companies as well as civil society organisations and coalitions, which are mainly based in, or draw their market strength or legitimacy from, advanced liberal economies. As highlighted previously, the effect of these proposals would be to limit the technical standard or policy-setting capacity of influential private actors on data governance and security, such as encryption and data storage. Admittedly, these proposals would also limit the ability of Chinese and Russian companies to set standards and shape policy. This outcome is in line with the heightened degrees of control, both from a policy and corporate governance perspective, that both states have exerted over their major technology players in recent years (Zhang Citation 2024).\nWe study six sets of proposals within this broader category (see) that advance this objective.\n## 4.5. Addressing ‘cyber-enabled’ crimes\nThe first category of proposals pertains to the types of crimes that can be prosecuted through the AHC convention. Both states have sought the criminalisation of ‘cyber-enabled’ crimes, i.e. crimes that have an ICT component relevant to their commission, as opposed to ‘cyber-dependent’ crimes, which fit more the traditional ‘CIA’ crimes – targeted by the Budapest Convention – that affect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of systems (Wilkinson Citation 2023). Many of these cyber-enabled crimes relate to the publication of online content, which is tightly regulated in authoritarian states. The AHC’s title itself – a committee to elaborate a treaty on ‘the use of ICTs for criminal purposes’ – was the effort of Russian resolutions at the UN General Assembly (Wilkinson Citation 2023). Non-government organizations (NGOs) and civil society organisations have not only decried the inclusion of content-related crimes as posing a ‘heightened risk’ (Privacy International and Electronic Frontier Foundation Citation 2022) to the exercise of human rights but also as impeding the work of journalists or whistle-blowers (Electronic Frontier Foundation Citation 2022). Russia and China have sought also to criminalise, respectively, ‘digital data to mislead the user’ and the ‘dissemination of false information’ (Martin Citation 2023), although these proposals have generated concern among industry and civil society (Bannelier Citation 2023). Neither formulation appears to have made it to the final rounds of negotiations. Russia, along with a number of developing countries, also proposed an all-encompassing clause to ensure the cybercrime treaty did not ‘preclude a State Party from establishing as an offence any other unlawful act committed intentionally with the use of information and communication technologies that causes significant damage’, which remains a legally ambiguous threshold (DTC September 2023, Art. 15 undecies). Targeting a broad range of ‘cyber-enabled crimes’ mirrors domestic criminal law provisions in both China and Russia and has been viewed by some experts as a means of legitimising and exporting their domestic governance models (Iyengar, Gamer and Rathi Citation 2023). Instrumentally, China’s focus has been on crimes faced by its own law enforcement agencies (Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024). Wider criminal provisions in domestic law and international treaty law boost state authority to assert control over individuals and companies that use cyberspace.\n## 4.6. Provisions on mutual legal assistance, human rights, jurisdiction and non-state actors\nBeyond seeking an expansive scope for the cybercrime treaty, we identify five areas where China and Russia have pushed for greater power for states to regulate digital activities at home and abroad. First, Russia has sought through the AHC convention to limit exemptions and safeguards against mutual legal assistance (MLA) requests by a state. These include rejecting clauses that allow states to refuse MLA requests for the prosecution of political offences (DTC September 2023, Art. 40 Clause 21 (c) bis) or those motivated by a ‘person's sex, race, language, religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinions’ (DTC September 2023, Art. 40 Clause 21 (c) ter).\nSecond, both China and Russia have advocated procedural reforms to domestic criminal law that would enable the easier prosecution of crimes committed through the use of ICTs. Russia has sought to ‘ensure that electronic evidence derived or extracted from [any ICT] shall have the probative value in criminal procedure’ (DTC September 2023, Article 30 bis). China and Russia have suggested that states should establish ‘relevant legal procedures and technical standards for the collection, retention and provision of electronic evidence to ensure the authenticity, integrity and legality of electronic evidence’ (DTC September 2023, Article 30 ter).\nThird, these states have, along with others, sought to limit human rights safeguards against the prosecution of cybercrime. Russia has objected to several proposals that introduce human rights safeguards against criminal prosecution, including in the case of ‘persons and groups in vulnerable situations’ (DTC September 2023, Article 5(2)). Moscow has also rejected a proposal to include the effective protection of human rights as a key element of cross-border technical assistance and capacity-building (DTC September 2023, Article 54). While China has not backed Russia on the proposal to remove human rights safeguards altogether, it has resisted attempts to introduce oversight mechanisms or limitations in the way governments can process and retain personal data transferred between states under the AHC convention (DTC September 2023, Article 36 sub-clause 2). Russia has also sought the use of the term ‘unlawful’ across the Consolidated Negotiation Text of the AHC draft to refer to specific acts that invite criminal prosecution. In contrast, the US, EU and like-minded countries prefer the phrase ‘without right’, which is more commonly used in the Budapest Convention. This distinction is important: ‘unlawful’ actions would be determined solely on the basis of domestic legislation, whereas the more permissive formulation ‘without right’ acknowledges the universal legitimacy of certain actions, such as accessing a free and open public computer system, instituting ‘protection activities’ (such as stronger encryption or cybersecurity safeguards) with the permission of those involved in transmitting data, or those actions taken in the pursuit of human rights such as privacy or free expression (Budapest Convention Citation 2001).\nFourth, Russia and China’s efforts to regulate extraterritorial activity go beyond proposals for expansive MLA. Notably, Russia has sought to extend states’ jurisdiction to cases in which ‘the offence is committed wholly or partly outside [their territory] but its effect in the territory [would] constitute an offence or result in the commission of an offense’ (DTC September 2023, Art. 22 sub-clause 2 c bis). Similarly, Russia has sought automatic jurisdiction for states if the ‘offence is committed against the State Party’ (DTC September 2023, Article 22 sub-clause 2 d). China has qualified its support to Russia’s invocation of the ‘effects doctrine’ Footnote ⁵ (Estey Citation 1997). Jurisdiction, in China’s view, should be based on a ‘true and sufficient’ link with criminal activities, giving priority to the place where the consequence of criminal activity occurs, where it is committed and the location of the perpetrator (China Suggestion Citation 3 (Citation 7) Citation 2022).\nFinally, both states have sought explicit control over internet service providers by national agencies. Such proposals have been an integral part of all Russian and Chinese drafts and contributions made to the AHC over six negotiating sessions. In its first draft proposal submitted to the AHC, Russia included two articles that specifically address the role of the private sector and ISPs, and also sought a code of conduct for their governance (Russian Federation Citation 2021, Article 43). China's proposals, while not as extensive, require companies and service providers to 'take technical measures and other necessary measures to effectively respond to criminal activities' (China's Suggestion Citation 2022, Article 3 (6)). Notably, both states have sought the criminalisation of the 'unlawful provision of service', understood as the providing of essentially any digitally-enabled service with 'the intent that the service or technical support be used for the commission of any of the offences' (DTC September 2023, Article 10 ter). Presumably, the service provider's 'intent' in this case would be discerned by states themselves, which enables the prosecution of any service provider that does not restrict internet services to communities or geographic areas proscribed by the state. Given the broad scope of offences that Russia and China, along with other authoritarian regimes, want to criminalise, this proposal could severely restrict the scope of operation of Virtual Private Networks or even secure messaging platforms that are set up with the intention of enabling secure and private communication away from the gaze of the state. These proposals are notable and offer important context to what China sees as the role of ISPs in 'decentralised internet infrastructure' models that it has floated at standards bodies.\nRussia's push for greater control over extraterritorial activity also throws into relief its original justification for not signing the Budapest Convention. Moscow has long expressed concerns over Article 32 of the Budapest Convention because it enables cross-border law enforcement access to territorial data without authorisation from the respective State Party. At the AHC negotiations, Russia has proposed that all cooperation under the cybercrime convention happens exclusively with the authorisation of State Parties. The cumulative effect of Russia's proposals would be that states become the sole arbiters of cross-border data access, but also have few procedural safeguards or human rights restrictions to refuse sharing data with other governments.",
    "# 5. Cybercrime negotiations and the future of the liberal cyber order": "Russia and China's proposals at the AHC reflect their efforts to shape systemically the governance of cyberspace, away from its liberal underpinnings. They attempt to reconfigure the norms and rules governing international relations in cyberspace by casting the territorial state as its main actor. Much like Western states have benefitted from a liberal order rooted in the dilution of the territorial state and the delegation of key cyberspace governance functions to private actors\n(Farrell and Newman Citation 2021), Russia and China seek geopolitical advantages from the alternative order they propose.\nDraft measures on the protection of CII and the criminalisation of cyber-enabled espionage constrain the freedom that Western intelligence agencies and commands enjoy in cyberspace for information-gathering and disruptive operations. On the other hand, stronger control over online content and the activities of digital services providers as well as weaker procedural and substantive safeguards on cross-border data-sharing between governments ensure that states can regulate private actors at home and also exert control over the data of users and entities held abroad (Harvey and Moore Citation 2022). The goal of these proposals is to limit the autonomy and influence of (mostly) Western technology companies in determining data flows and cybersecurity outcomes through their in-house policies and technical standards (Klonick Citation 2017).\nRussia and China's pursuit of an alternative cyber order is backed by several statements on issues discussed in the paper. While a detailed examination of these statements and strategies is outside the scope of this paper, we highlight a few notable examples. Beijing's repeated references to the US's 'empire of hacking' (Reuters Citation 2023) and Moscow's claims of US targeting critical infrastructure for subversive 'political and economic' operations suggest that their proposals at the AHC are motivated by overarching geopolitical motives, rather than by narrow domestic ones (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Citation 2022). Further, both countries have tried to use the platform of the AHC to promote their model among developing countries through language referencing the need for a systemic shift in cyberspace governance. China has declared that the AHC treaty should 'adjust [to] and create new contours for ensuring the security of states' (China Intervention Sixth Session Morning, UN Web TV 2023, 01:01:00 to 01:07:00). This messaging has been emphasised repeatedly by the Russian delegation as well. An article written by the Deputy Head of the Russian delegation amidst the AHC negotiations argued that the 'prospects for the global digitalisation process as a whole, the effectiveness and dynamics which depend on ensuring security, are in question' (Chernukhin Citation 2023).\nIndeed, Russia and China's diplomatic strategies at the AHC appear to exploit the Global South's 'discontent' against the LIO (Endaylalu Citation 2022). Both states have argued that debates on human rights are manufactured by states (liberal economies) who seek to 'retain their dominant position in the information sphere' at the cost of 'practical cooperation' on cybercrime (Russian Federation Citation 2022). In other words, the messaging here is not that human rights are bad, but that developing nations have more urgent priorities which are not highlighted in the current order. Relatedly, both states have also underlined the need for new rules to prosecute cybercrime, appealing to the deeply felt sentiment among African and Asian countries to be norm-makers and not norm-takers (Acharya Citation 2011). China's opening intervention at AHC negotiations stressed that including 'cyber-enabled crimes' in the cybercrime treaty is a way of ensuring that international law kept 'pace with the trends' (China, Intervention Sixth Session Morning, UN\nWeb TV 2023, 01:01:00 to 01:07:00). Russia has emphasised the fact that many countries stayed away from the Budapest Convention because they were not involved in its creation (Seger Citation 2016), denouncing the instrument as having failed to win the 'minds and hearts' of the developing world (Chernukhin Citation 2023).\nAs illustrates, Russia and China's own cyber diplomacy at the AHC has received steady support from some of its allies, but many developing countries and emerging powers (Chivvis and Geaghan-Breiner Citation 2024) have largely remained silent in response.\n# Table 2. States' responses to China and Russia's proposals at September 2023 negotiations.\nThe Draft Text of Convention (DTC) circulated by the AHC's chair in September 2023 omitted several proposals from China and Russia, especially on the scope and coverage of 'cyber-enabled crimes' as well as protection of CII. However, Russia attempted to reinsert all those proposals back into the DTC as red-line edits. China, as has illustrated, appears to have been less persistent in terms of reintroducing its original proposals. China's more moderate approach, as indicated in the first half of this paper, arguably reflects its heightened economic stake in cyberspace, compared to Russia's all-or-nothing strategy. Further, Russia's approach to the AHC negotiations reflects its strategy in the UN GGE and UN OEWG, where it scoped out similarly maximalist positions before engaging in last-minute, backroom deals to secure consensus within both groups. Chinese cyber diplomacy generally tends to avoid such grand bargains, and in the AHC appears to have prioritised some of its proposals over others.\nRegardless of their outcomes, it is clear from Russia and China's proposals that both states view the proposed AHC convention on cybercrime as an opportunity to chart new rules for the road for cyberspace. In a domain characterised mainly by informal norms of responsible behaviour and technical standards – a consequence of the liberal ordering of cyberspace – both states have arguably found it difficult to challenge the economic and normative clout of major private actors and to constrain the strategic advantages of powerful Western adversaries. They have sought consequently to use the prospective AHC treaty to usher in a cyber order that lends primacy to the territorial state – not only to govern domestic digital activity but also to shape international data flows and the use of offensive cyber capabilities.\n# Acknowledgement\nThe authors thank Isabella Wilkinson for comments on a previous draft of this article.\n# Disclosure statement\nThe authors report that there are no competing interests to declare."

The application of this 'liberal cyber order' has been resisted by Russia and China who seek a greater role for the territorial state in cyberspace governance. They have long sought new, binding rules to this effect with little success. The UN cybercrime convention bucks the trend of informal, non-binding agreements in this domain. Through an empirical analysis of proposals advanced by Russia and China during negotiations toward the cybercrime convention, this article demonstrates how they have sought to use it to develop rules that blunt the advantages enjoyed by Western liberal economies and major transnational actors in the current order. Going beyond the regulation of cybercrime, Russian and Chinese proposals empower states to thwart disruptive and intelligence-gathering cyber operations that may be conducted globally by Western adversaries. Additionally, they enhance the state's regulatory capacity over private actors at home and abroad, limiting the ability of businesses or NGOs to shape cybersecurity and human rights standards around the transfer, retention and access of data.\n# KEYWORDS:\n- Cybercrime treaty\n- cyber sovereignty\n- liberal international order\n- cybersecurity governance\n# 1. Introduction\nWhat kind of global governance regime do China and Russia seek for cyberspace? As authoritarian states with strong restrictions on the online activities of individuals, businesses and NGOs, do they simply seek greater autonomy to regulate digital technologies in their territory without foreign intervention? China and Russia have been robustly engaged, for over two decades, in discussions on internet governance at the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) (Murgia and Gross Citation 2020; Yoo Citation 2023), regional cooperative institutions and multi-stakeholder entities such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) (Kennedy Citation 2013; Negro Citation 2020; Yan Citation 2015). Chinese and Russian proposals advanced at these forums have the effect of increasing states' capacity to manage the territorial conduct of private actors.\nThe proposals advanced by both states at international forums also signal their geopolitical interests in cyberspace. Discussions on international cybersecurity in the UN General Assembly's First Committee, where Russia and China have competed with the 'like-minded' Footnote 1 countries led by the United States and European Union on specific proposals, throw into relief those interests (Basu, Poetranto, and Lau Citation 2021; Tiirmaa-Klaar Citation 2021). Through their First Committee proposals, Russia and China have sought to limit the ability of Western adversaries to engage in offensive cyber operations against their digital assets and infrastructure, and simultaneously to legitimize their own strategies and practices (for example, their increasing use of proxies or 'cyber mercenaries') (Maurer Citation 2017; Sukumar Citation 2017).\nBy dint of institutional design and the fragmented nature of the cyber 'regime complex' (Nye Citation 2014), discussions on internet governance, cybercrime and norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace have hitherto taken place across a number of international forums. This fragmentation has occluded from analysis a complete picture of the systemic changes that Russia and China pursue for the governance of cyberspace. Given that they are major cyber powers, it is important to understand whether and why both states seek to influence how other states govern territorial networks to advance their own broader geopolitical and geoeconomic ambitions for the domain. For instance, China and Russia would want for other states to have greater agency over domestic networks, whether for the purpose of requesting them to thwart Western cyber operations, curtail the growing influence of Western technology companies whom they see as proxies of the US or its allies, or clamp down on foreign voices and institutions critical of them. Conversely, implementing tougher restrictions on online activity at home may often require China and Russia to seek data from abroad for investigative and prosecutorial purposes. For such data requests to succeed, states must not only be aligned on what counts as criminal activity in cyberspace, there should also be few procedural hurdles for interstate data transfers. These objectives require a major reconfiguration of the way in which states currently engage with each other in cyberspace, and with private actors both domestically and internationally.\nTo be sure, Russian and Chinese objectives for cyberspace governance differ in important respects. As Flonk notes, Russia relies more on policy-oriented measures to regulate internet infrastructure, users and networks than China, where technical infrastructure such as the Great Chinese Firewall allows for a high degree of centralisation over content control and platforms governance (Flonk Citation 2021). Secondly, with significantly higher economic stakes in cyberspace, China's geopolitical outlook differs somewhat from Russia's. China's cyber diplomacy and proposals are driven by a desire to support Chinese technology companies while seeking a significant degree of state control over ICT activities at home and abroad. Russia, on the other hand, does not have a significant domestic technology industry and is therefore arguably less concerned about the geoeconomic consequences of its cyber diplomacy (Broeders, Adamson, and Creemers Citation 2019). Finally, China is more selective than Russia in the execution of cyber operations. While Moscow undertakes a broad range of disruptive and\ndestructive cyber operations, including those aimed at systemic political destabilisation, Beijing has restricted itself to undertaking operations that incrementally advance its economic or security objectives. The difference could be attributed to the blowback that Chinese industry and states agencies would face as good-faith participants and key influencers of standards development (Russel and Berger Citation 2021) and digital markets were they to undertake cyber operations that cause widespread instability or degrade the availability of global internet services.\nThese differences notwithstanding, scholars have long highlighted the strong convergence of views between Russia and China in their ideological opposition to the liberal international order and to its application to cyberspace. This ‘liberal cyber order’ is marked not only by substantive norms that govern state behaviour in cyberspace but also by who sets those norms (Rovner Citation 2023). Open data flows, multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms and deference to the exercise of civil, political and economic liberties online constitute the defining characteristics of the liberal cyber order, whose influence on the internet is historical and still discernible (Deibert and Crete-Nishihata Citation 2012; Farrell and Newman Citation 2021; Hollis and Raustiala Citation 2022). In geopolitical terms, this order privileges liberal democracies and their constituents – in particular the United States and its trans-Atlantic allies who have helped incubate the growth of the internet since its early years – as rule-shapers (Farrell and Newman Citation 2021, Citation 2024). China and Russia are united in their goal to ‘reform the liberal cyber order’ (Wu Citation 2021), which includes upending liberal norms (Flonk Citation 2021) as well as the institutional governance mechanisms that are its mainstay (Raymond and Sherman Citation 2024). China and Russia are not the only actors who seek a ‘post-liberal cyberspace’ (Barrinha and Renard Citation 2020), but they are certainly its most powerful proponents, and frequent fellow travellers in diplomatic forums.\nThis article highlights Russian and Chinese efforts to orchestrate such a systemic reform or reconfiguration of the liberal cyber order through the proposed cybercrime convention currently negotiated by an Ad Hoc Committee (AHC) of the United Nations. While the AHC was established to develop a binding international instrument for states to tackle cybercrime – in official terms, counter the ‘use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) for criminal purposes’ – we show that Russia and China have sought for it to regulate activities that go well beyond the treaty’s intended scope. Their proposals, as this article empirically demonstrates, not only address cybercrime, but also implicate international cybersecurity governance and cross-border data access.\nChinese and Russian proposals at the AHC push for states to have greater control over digital infrastructure and activities. As this article's review of the literature highlights, this is consistent with longstanding Chinese and Russian views on cyberspace governance. Nonetheless, the AHC negotiations also demonstrate that their championing of 'cyber sovereignty' (Creemers Citation 2020; Stadnik Citation 2021; Thumfart Citation 2021; Zeng, Stevens, and Chen Citation 2017) is oriented towards specific objectives that in turn reveal China and Russia's aspirations towards\nsystemic changes in cyberspace governance. Their proposals empower the territorial state to regulate certain cyber operations of geopolitical concern to China and Russia. In the guise of addressing cybercrime, they also allow states to shape policies and standards on the storage and security of data, to exert control over digital activities abroad that bear on territorial concerns, and to fashion the governance of cross-border data flows as an exclusively intergovernmental prerogative with few procedural or human rights safeguards. Taken together, these proposals undermine key tenets of the liberal cyber order, that, through open networks and digital markets, have conferred geopolitical and geoeconomic advantages to liberal democracies and transnational actors based largely in Western states. Indeed, we present these findings as helping to advance a theoretical frontier in the literature on Chinese and Russian approaches to cyberspace governance. Whereas extant analyses (see Section 2) have shone a spotlight on the domestic and global impact of China and Russia's sovereignty-centric proposals, newer scholarship has begun to examine the order-level consequences of such proposals. China and Russia, these scholars note, foreground the territorial state in cyberspace for explicitly systemic objectives (Wu Citation 2021) and have attempted 'hegemonic socialisation', i.e. persuading states who are likely to agree to order-level changes (Hulvey Citation 2021, Citation 2022). Meanwhile, the order-level impact of their proposals has been clearly acknowledged and addressed as such by states like Brazil and India (Basu Citation 2024; Paulus Citation 2024), whose support is crucial for any major change to the liberal cyber order.\nAnalysing cybercrime proposals by Russia and China contextually and holistically is also important because their presentation before the AHC itself cannot be considered coincidental or opportunistic. The AHC negotiations are expressly oriented towards a treaty, in contrast to the non-binding, voluntary 'norms' on responsible behaviour that have hitherto guided interstate engagement in this domain. Moscow and Beijing have long sought to set multilateral rules not only for international cybersecurity (Levinson Citation 2021) but also for internet governance, mainly via the ITU (Radu and Gregorio Citation 2023). Those efforts have thus far not succeeded (Grigsby Citation 2017). Attempts by both states to promote technical standards that allow for greater state control over the governance of critical internet resources have not yet gained currency in multi-stakeholder forums that set standards for the internet (Hogeveen Citation 2022). Given the backdrop of 'pervasive informality' (Sukumar, Broeders, and Kello Citation 2024) in intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder models of cyberspace governance, the AHC provides a rare avenue for Russia and China to shoehorn their proposals into an instrument that binds the conduct of states.\nAt the time of writing, a draft convention text has been agreed upon by all participating states at the AHC. The final convention is expected to be adopted at a formal General Assembly vote later in 2024 (UNODC Citation 2024). As our empirical findings reveal, several proposals by Russia and China were rejected in earlier versions of the AHC draft text, while some others were reintroduced by either state in later stages of negotiation. Even if those proposals fail to gain\nacceptance, their tabling, and in some cases, persistent diplomatic efforts to push them through, indicate the importance both states attach to them, and their contribution to systemic reordering in cyberspace.\nSection 2 reviews the literature on Chinese and Russian approaches to cyberspace governance, framed against the backdrop of their broader challenge to the liberal international order. This section highlights why it is important to study their AHC proposals within this broader context, and why Russia and China have specifically sought the AHC to float those proposals. Section 3 offers a background to the cybercrime negotiations and explains how the article collected and reviewed data on Chinese and Russian AHC proposals. Section 4 forms the empirical core of this paper. It highlights various AHC proposals made by both states, dividing them into two broad categories that reflect the essence of their challenge to the liberal cyber order: one, proposals to constrain the actions of strategic Western adversaries who benefit from open digital networks, and two, proposals to enhance territorial and extraterritorial control over private actors.\n## 2. China and Russia’s challenge to the liberal cyber order\nInternational order refers to the ‘explicit principles, rules, and institutions’ that manage and reflect ‘core relationships’ and ‘settled expectations’ between states (Ikenberry Citation 2001). The liberal international order is broadly premised on three elements: freer trade and security cooperation that is based on predictable and recognised rules, cooperation through multilateral institutions that is increasingly shifting to informal mechanisms, and the progressive growth of liberal democratic values and institutional arrangements across societies (Acharya Citation 2017; Ikenberry Citation 2010). Applying the liberal domestic values of ‘predictability, access, and representation’ to international politics (Deudney and Ikenberry Citation 1999), the LIO allows private actors – especially with transnational interests such as corporations and NGOs – to engage and seek direct representation in rules, norms or institutions (Handreider Citation 1978; Moravcsik Citation 2003; Scherer et al. Citation 2006).\nIn recent years, international relations scholarship has extensively debated the challenge posed by ‘revisionist’ powers like Russia and China to the LIO across regimes such as international security, trade and climate (Johnston Citation 2019; Lake, Martin, and Risse Citation 2021; Weiss and Wallace Citation 2021; Zürn Citation 2018). The nature of Chinese and Russian challenges to the LIO differ substantially. China, according to Goddard (Citation 2018), is a ‘bridging revisionist’ that is likely to use the existing international economic and political order to foment ‘rule-based revolution’, i.e. to transform existing rules over time to those more disposed to its interests. If its geoeconomic diplomacy in particular is any indication, China does not seek an overhaul of the LIO, but ‘prefers a more conservative version that emphasises Westphalian norms of sovereignty and non-interference’ (Weiss and Wallace Citation 2021). Russia, with fewer economic stakes in the LIO, has been more inclined to test its limits through ‘violent\naction' (Goddard Citation 2018) in contravention of basic tenets of the UN Charter and modern international relations. The outcomes of their challenges to the LIO depend in large measure on the approaches of emerging powers – with some of whom the liberal order still resonates ideologically or economically, despite their differences with the hegemon, the United States (Efstathopoulos Citation 2021). In this regard, Russia and China's joint emphasis on ‘hollowing out’ the LIO into its constitutive sovereignty elements (Johnston Citation 2019) – the sovereign equality of states, treaty-based agreements in lieu of informal agreements, consent-based dispute settlement mechanisms – may appeal to a broader audience, including emerging powers (Dugard Citation 2023).\nThe challenge posed by Russia and China to the LIO presents a necessary context to the understanding of ‘cyber ordering’ or the organisation of relations between states in cyberspace (Kello Citation 2017). As Barrinha and Renard note, cyberspace was itself the creation of the liberal order – characterised by open networks as well as private and decentralised governance (Barrinha and Renard Citation 2020). As is now widely acknowledged, various aspects of the cyber order have faced contestation from state and non-state actors in recent decades, resulting in a ‘retreat of liberal values’ (Barrinha and Renard Citation 2020; Deibert and Rohozinski Citation 2011; Mueller Citation 2017). As powerful nation states, China and Russia present the most potent challenge to the order. The remainder of this section reviews extant scholarship that analyses the Chinese and Russian challenge to the liberal cyber order, with a particular focus on cybersecurity governance. Then it highlights why studying proposals at the AHC negotiations offer a clearer picture of the alternative framework of rules that Russia and China want in cyberspace.\n## 2.1. Russian and Chinese approaches to global cybersecurity governance\nWe identify three strands of scholarship examining China and Russia’s approach to cybersecurity governance. The first strand includes conceptual and empirical assessments of the notion of cyber sovereignty, deployed discursively by both countries in domestic and international settings. This body of scholarship offers important insights into the evolution of domestic policy discourse and legislation by China and Russia to attain ‘cyber sovereignty’ and ‘information security’ respectively, two related concepts that have been at the crux of both countries’ approaches to the governance of cyberspace.\nChina’s evocation of ‘cyber sovereignty’ as a policy goal can be traced back to the 2010 White Paper on the internet in China published by the state council, the country’s apex administrative body (Information Office of the State Council Citation 2010). The concept has since made an appearance in speeches by China’s political leadership as well as its international cyberspace strategy (People’s Republic of China Citation 2017). Tracing its discursive evolution over the years, scholars have distilled ‘cyber sovereignty’ into two main components (Creemers Citation 2020; Fung Citation 2022). The first constitutive element is the core role of the state in\n'information management' (Fung Citation 2022), mainly by asserting territorial control over both domestic and foreign non-state actors. Such control may be exerted through technical measures or regulations around online activities within its jurisdiction (Deibert Citation 2015; Qiao-Franco Citation 2024). Control over the information environment is also exerted by facilitating a shift in global internet governance away from multi-stakeholder processes to articulate policy or technical standards towards intergovernmental processes under the auspices of the UN (Creemers Citation 2020; Fung Citation 2022).\nThe second constitutive element of cyber sovereignty is the equality of states in cyberspace (Zeng, Stevens, and Chen Citation 2017) which China has framed primarily in terms of the right to non-interference in a state's internal affairs. On the other hand, Russia's policy discourse on 'information security' has a longer lineage, but is essentially aligned with many of the aforesaid goals of China. First articulated in the 2000 Doctrine on Information Security, this concept is presented as a 'triad' of state, society and individual interests, whose protection from internal and external threats is ultimately the remit of the government (Stadnik Citation 2021). Over time, Russian controls over digital networks have mimicked Chinese measures (Weber Citation 2017). Such measures in Russia include online content filtering, mandatory data localisation, protection of critical information infrastructure and the 2019 Law on the Russian segment of the internet that aims to ward off external threats through centralised internet traffic routing and a national domain name system (Hakala and Melnchyuk Citation 2021; Stadnik Citation 2021). Russia has also sought the development of a legally-binding instrument for cyberspace, and to restrain states from weaponizing 'information to undermine the political, economic and social system' of others (Korzak Citation 2021).\nChina and Russia's pursuit of cyber sovereignty and information security is largely animated by the survival of its political institutions and the quest for social stability. However, there is also an important global dimension to these concepts, which the second strand of scholarship unpacks (Barrinha and Turner Citation 2024; Flonk, Jachtenfuchs, and Obendiek Citation 2020; Gao Citation 2022; Jiang Citation 2010; Nocetti Citation 2015). Analyses of Chinese and Russian proposals made at international forums have highlighted their substantive impact on users, businesses and NGOs as well as inter-state relations. Beijing and Moscow have emerged as entrepreneurs of 'illiberal norms' (Flonk Citation 2021), relating mainly to the control of online content and the governance of digital platforms, in venues such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), BRICS and the UN. Their proposals also contribute to the creation of 'sovereignty spheres', where states articulate policy and set standards on online content and internet governance, often superseding global, multi-stakeholder processes (Flonk, Jachtenfuchs, and Obendiek Citation 2020). Why would other states that have benefited from global standards opt into such sovereignty enclaves? Simmons and Hulvey note that states are 'anxious [of being] overwhelmed by global forces', among which the internet figures prominently (Simmons and Hulvey Citation 2022). Facing a 'sovereign identity crisis' in the age of the internet, they\nargue, states develop ‘border orientation preferences’ to ensure digital policies mirror the governance of territorial boundaries (Simmons and Hulvey Citation 2022). In this way, they try to ensure state-society relations are not destabilised by globalisation or open information flows.\nFinally, a third strand of scholarship examines how China and Russia engage tactically with norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace (Creemers Citation 2021; Fung Citation 2022; Raymond and Sherman Citation 2024). This literature has contributed significantly to the study of ‘cyber diplomacy’ by major powers and non-state actors. It focuses especially on the diplomatic rhetoric and narratives (Barrinha and Turner Citation 2024; Hansel Citation 2023) deployed by Moscow and Beijing to bolster support for their proposals (Fung Citation 2022), as well as their gaming of multilateral negotiation procedures – supporting consensus-based agreements, limiting private participation, ‘stack[ing] the deck’ with illiberal initiatives (Raymond and Sherman Citation 2024) – for the same purpose.\nTo summarise, China and Russia’s engagement with cybersecurity governance is characterised in the literature as driven mainly by the pursuit of cyber sovereignty, i.e. the enhancement of the state’s capacity to govern territorial networks and digital assets. The most conspicuous tool deployed in the pursuit of cyber sovereignty is online content control. Both states have engaged in diplomatic efforts to export their model of cyber sovereignty, especially to developing countries. The emergence of ‘sovereignty spheres’ akin to China and Russia, scholars point out, is likely to cause the ‘fragmentation’ of the liberal cyber order (Flonk, Jachtenfuchs, and Obendiek Citation 2020). Fragmentation, as per existing literature, could refer either to the fragmentation of regulatory regimes across jurisdictions, including liberal economies (Bradford Citation 2023), or to the technical splintering of the internet into non-interoperable, territorial networks (Drake, Cerf, and Kleinwachter Citation 2016). Pertinently, Mueller cautions against exaggerating the prospect of the technical fragmentation of the internet (Mueller Citation 2017, 17, 18). Fragmentation, he notes, is possible only if a critical mass of internet-users defect from the global internet, establishing technical incompatibilities that could sustain multiple ‘internets’ for a significant period of time. The economic and security costs of such defections may not outweigh the network benefits (Mueller Citation 2017; Polatin-Reuben and Wright Citation 2014). That said, Chinese industry players like Huawei have presented proposals on technical standards on ‘decentralised internet infrastructure’ at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). These proposals have been socialised by Chinese actors as ‘New IP’ technologies, which aim to ‘[reinvent] the internet's core architecture,’ (Hoffmann, Lazanski, and Taylor Citation 2020) and potentially create ‘non-interoperable networks’ across the globe (Sharp Citation 2020). The main challenge to the liberal cyber order consequently lies not only in a possible technical fragmentation of the internet but in ongoing attempts to subject its governance, domestically and internationally, to the territorial state.\n## 2.2. Significance of the Ad Hoc Committee on cybercrime\nThe enhanced cyber sovereignty of states, especially developing countries, allow them to resist ‘US [economic and political] hegemony in cyberspace’ (Gao Citation 2022). As challengers to the liberal cyber order, this is admittedly an important goal for China and Russia. Nevertheless, as major global players themselves, both states seek rules in a sovereignty-centric cyber order that specifically benefit them, drawing in no small part on their own traditional strengths and preferences in dealing exclusively with governments abroad. The following paragraphs highlight what those goals might be, why it has been challenging for China and Russia to achieve them, and how the AHC acquires salience in this context.\nAs a systemic objective, China and Russia seek to constrain certain inherent advantages that Western economies enjoy in the liberal cyber order. An open and free internet – a core tenet of the liberal order – not only has normative appeal but also confers instrumental geopolitical advantages to Western liberal states (Lahmann Citation 2021), to which both states are especially sensitive (Lokot and Wijermars Citation 2023). ‘Internet freedom’, which has been a key US foreign policy goal, is also an enabler of market access for multinational corporations – many of them based in the US – to gain from digital economies around the world (DeNardis and Hackl Citation 2015; Farrell Citation 2006; Farrell and Newman Citation 2021). It is a tool for soft power promotion in cyberspace, facilitating the import of Western cultural, ideological and intellectual motifs and themes by developing states (Rothkopf Citation 1997). An open internet is also beneficial to covert and overt military, intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the West that enjoy ‘home-field advantage’ (Buchanan Citation 2022) in a domain largely developed and innovated upon in liberal economies. Strategic adversaries such as China and Russia want to constrain the capabilities of the United States and like-minded countries to gather intelligence and ‘persistently engage’ (Goldsmith Citation 2022; US Cyber Command Citation 2022) digital networks to surveil and mount offensive cyber operations.\nAchieving this broader goal through the reform of existing multilateral institutions has proved challenging for Russia and China. Firstly, new rules that enhance the sovereign capacities of states are likely to be incompatible with rules incubated by existing liberal regimes, in which both Russia and China are willing participants. Any attempt to coerce other states into their preferred regimes will invite retaliation or be simply ignored for other, preferential regimes (Cha Citation 2023). Even if China or Russia were to set new rules, their challenge would be to draw away middle powers or developing countries, whose economic or security dependencies with advanced liberal economies may compel them to stick with existing regimes. The ‘counterhegemonic coalitions’ (Schweller and Pu Citation 2011) that both states have sought to incubate have had little success drawing in countries that were not already in their geopolitical orbit. Initiatives such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s Code of Conduct on Information Security or the China-promoted Global Initiative on Data Security seem unlikely to register acknowledgment\namong broader multilateral initiatives (Kynge Citation 2023). In China's case particularly, it has struggled also to shore up support for 'counter-institutionalization' in global economic governance, through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) that do not conflict with the Bretton Woods institutions but attempt to 'decrease [their] relevance' (Zürn Citation 2018). In the domain of international security, prospects for counter-institutionalization are likely to be even harder (Zürn Citation 2018).\nFurthermore, the world is witnessing a discernible shift towards informal global governance (Snidal Citation 2021; Westerwinter, Abbott, and Biersteker Citation 2021), undermining efforts by Russia and China to create a new international order through binding rules. Empirically documented by scholars of international law and international relations, this phenomenon has catalysed the proliferation of informal alliances, ad hoc coalitions and task forces in economic and security domains (Bradley, Goldsmith, and Hathaway Citation 2023; Reykers et al. Citation 2023). This shift has arguably been precipitated by the US's turn towards non-binding agreements, largely for reasons of domestic politics, such as difficulties in getting Senate ratification of treaties or the lack of interest in treaty-based cooperation from populist elites (Copelovitch and Pevehouse Citation 2019). The relative decline in traditional multilateral governance deprives China and Russia, among others, of opportunities to supplant existing rules and formal regimes. The cybersecurity regime is a prime example of this phenomenon, being characterised by 'pervasive informality' (Sukumar, Broeders, and Kello Citation 2024). At the UN, for instance, Russia has for more than two decades sought an international treaty on cybersecurity, only to have its proposals rebuffed by Western countries (Farrell and Newman Citation 2021). Neither the UN GGE nor the OEWG, the two main multilateral venues for discussions on international cybersecurity, has the power to bind states with its recommendations, and both have articulated in their stead voluntary norms suggesting the contours of 'responsible state behaviour' for the domain (Kavanagh Citation 2017). Informal global governance, including in cyberspace, has paved the way for private entities to forge multi-stakeholder partnerships in various governance domains (Johnstone, Sukumar, and Trachtman Citation 2023). In comparison to treaty negotiations, which traditionally offer limited roles for NGOs and private actors to offer substantive inputs, informal channels tend to be more open and inclusive.\nThe AHC negotiations arguably address both concerns for Russia and China, and explain the scope of their proposals. Although there exists an international cybercrime instrument – the Budapest Convention – it is not signed by either state, nor for that matter by the overwhelming majority of developing countries in Asia and Africa. There is little need to develop a ‘counter-institutional’ coalition against the Budapest Convention, when most major non-signatories have expressed their reservations about the instrument. The AHC, on the other hand, comprises all UN member states, making it easier for Russia and China to build coalitions and attract countries into their orbit on their specific proposals. To be sure, both still need to engage in diplomacy to\nevangelise their proposals and appear to acknowledge this reality (Barrinha and Turner Citation 2024; Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024). As Barrinha and Turner (Citation 2024) note, Russia even took a more accommodative stand towards non-state actor participation in the cybercrime discussions in order to shore up international support.\nSecondly, the AHC discussions were very clearly geared towards a cybercrime treaty which would create binding rules. This treaty bucks the trend of informal agreements in this domain. Shoehoring proposals on cybersecurity into the cybercrime convention allowed China and Russia to address topics that either are off the table at the UN GGE or OEWG, such as cyber-enabled espionage, or do not limit the use of offensive cyber weapons by (Western) states. Consequently, their AHC proposals reflected the regulation of a whole gamut of issues that have systemic, 'order'-level effects on cyberspace. Prior to highlighting those proposals in finer detail, a brief background on the negotiations themselves is necessary.\n# 3. Cybercrime negotiations at the United Nations\nThe 'Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) for Criminal Purposes' negotiated by an intergovernmental Ad Hoc Committee will be the first binding UN instrument on any issue pertaining to the governance of cyberspace. The AHC was established by the UN General Assembly in 2019. Like the Budapest Convention developed by the Council of Europe – in some respects the precursor not only to this instrument but also to several regional agreements on cybercrime (Shires Citation 2024) – the objective of the AHC is to develop global benchmarks on identifying cybercrime and enabling international cooperation to address it.\nThe political backdrop to the AHC negotiations is important. Neither Russia nor China are signatories to the Budapest Convention. China has stayed away from the Budapest Convention for two reasons: firstly, signing the CoE Convention would be contrary to its longstanding position that global governance, including of cyberspace, should be under the aegis of the UN; secondly, China has also argued that it was not consulted when the Budapest Convention was being drafted (Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024). Russia, until its expulsion in 2022 from the body, remained the only Council of Europe member not to have signed the Budapest Convention. Moscow has offered three reasons for its decision: the low number of offences addressed by the Budapest Convention; the lack of official statistics regarding its implementation; and the Convention's allowing states to access data located in another state without the latter's authorisation, thereby violating its sovereignty (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Citation 2021).\nRussia has instead been a longstanding champion for a cybercrime treaty negotiated under the auspices of the UN (Gullo and Rodriguez Citation 2023). Cybercrime discussions at the UN\nwere previously guided through an open-ended Intergovernmental Expert Group to Conduct a Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime (United Nations General Assembly Citation 2011). The UN General Assembly resolution of December 2019 that established the AHC was a culmination of an effort by Russia to lay the diplomatic and procedural groundwork for a successful vote (Lederer Citation 2019; Rowe Citation 2020). In 2018, for example, Russia managed to push through a resolution requiring that the Secretary General collate country perspectives on cybercrime (United Nations General Assembly Citation 2018). Importantly, this resolution was titled 'Countering the use of information and communications technologies for criminal purposes', rather than simply a 'convention on cybercrime'. The 2018 resolution marked a clear and important departure from the way 'cybercrime' had been used in international discussions, especially around the Budapest Convention and also in Expert Group discussions (Hakmeh and Tropina Citation 2021). As the next section highlights, this shift is significant because it correlates to Russia and China seeking an expansive scope for the AHC convention by bringing a broad range of criminal activities within its ambit (Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024).\nWhile Europe, the United States and other like-minded states initially opposed the establishment of the AHC and did not support the Russian proposal, they have since participated actively in various negotiation sessions and intersessional consultations (Lewis and Painter Citation 2023). The AHC negotiations commenced in 2022 with plans originally for at least six negotiating sessions. At the time of writing, all planned negotiating sessions have been completed. No consensus outcome was attained at the originally stipulated concluding session in January 2024 and negotiators requested more time to complete deliberations. Consequently, a final session was scheduled for July-August 2024, during which a draft convention text was agreed upon by all participating countries. A General Assembly vote is expected in December 2024 to formally adopt the treaty (Digi Watch Citation 2024). Civil society groups and human rights campaigns have criticised the final text of the treaty due to insufficient human rights safeguards; its overly broad scope and presentation alongside a General Assembly resolution that could enable the reintroduction of cyber-enabled crimes; threats to security researchers; cementing expansive surveillance powers; enabling extensive data sharing without compatible human rights standards and safeguards and a lack of provisions on government accountability (Article 19 Citation 2024; Rodriquez Citation 2024; Tropina Citation 2024).\nThe Ad Hoc Committee was made up of the representatives of all UN member states and allowed the participation of non-voting private stakeholders, including civil society organisations and technology companies. Footnote 2 The negotiations were divided into eight broad thematic clusters, which ended up as the various operating sections of the final text of the draft convention. These included general provisions, relating to: criminalisation; jurisdiction; procedural measures of cooperation, especially among law enforcement agencies; general measures of international cooperation; preventive measures; and proposals on technical assistance and information exchange as well as mechanisms of implementation.\nAt the first three sessions, states contributed various draft provisions that could be integrated into each cluster. In April and September 2023, states held discussions on a Consolidated Negotiating Document (CND) that was prepared by the Chair.\nWhile Russia and China have been active in all sessions, the former was more active than the latter. At the first AHC session in early 2022, Russia even suggested that the AHC adopt the complete text of a draft convention it first published in 2021. At the second and third sessions, Russia and China made joint proposals, especially on procedural cooperation, which are elaborated upon in the next section. To be sure, while Russia and China have led efforts on proposals challenging the liberal cyber order at the AHC, other countries including Pakistan and Iran have also been vocal about specific concerns, such as removing human rights safeguards within the Convention (Bannelier Citation 2023). While a detailed examination of these efforts is outside the scope of this paper, it is pertinent to note that Russia and China are not working in isolation but often collaborating with a small coalition of states to effect their proposals.\n## 3.1. Data collection and analysis\nThis article's analysis of Russian and Chinese proposals at the AHC is based primarily on a review of six documents containing proposals advanced by participating states prior to each negotiating session at the AHC. The first two documents pertain to proposals advanced separately by Russia (Russia Draft Citation 2021) and China (China Suggestion Citation 2022) at the first AHC negotiating session in February 2022. The subsequent two documents analysed were jointly published by Russia, China and several developing countries in June 2022 (Russia Joint Proposal June Citation 2022) as well as in September 2022. Finally, we reviewed two versions of the Consolidated Negotiating Document (CND) – tabled in April 2023 (Ad Hoc Committee April Citation 2023) and September 2023 Footnote 3 before the AHC – that contain red line-edits to the draft convention made by all negotiating parties. The CND/DTC was tabled by the Chair of the AHC and did not indicate in any way whether red-line edits (or even the text in black letters) were likely to find place in the final draft of the convention. States had the option to reintroduce proposals and object to existing proposals until the final stage of negotiations. Red-line edits made by states or coalitions of states are particularly valuable for our analysis as looking at them helps in attributing specific proposals to states and tracking their evolution. The Chair of the AHC additionally convened informal consultations, closed working groups on certain articles/ clusters of articles and multi-stakeholder consultations. However, as details of these meetings are not on public record, they are not included in our analysis.\nIn addition to proposals tabled at all six negotiation sessions, we also reviewed publicly accessible oral statements made by Russia, China, the United States, the EU and other like-minded countries accessed through the United Nations Web Television (UN WebTV) portal. In all, we reviewed documentary and media sources dating from February 2022 to September 2023.\nFootnote 4 To triangulate our analysis, we consulted secondary literature including media coverage of the negotiations and analyses from blogs and podcasts authored by diplomats, legal practitioners and scholars.\n# 4. Unpacking Chinese and Russian proposals at the AHC\nThis section highlights two sets of Chinese and Russian proposals at the AHC that, by enhancing the territorial capacity of states, attempt to limit strategic operations undertaken by their Western adversaries as well as the ability of influential non-state actors to set global technical standards or advance norms on cybersecurity and human rights. The first set of proposals seek the criminalisation of certain offensive cyber operations against critical information infrastructure (CII) and for the purpose of conducting espionage. Russia and China's goal here is to ensure that the openness of global digital networks do not allow adversaries the operational ability and freedom to execute such operations. A second category of proposals facilitate greater territorial and extra-territorial control of states over data, users and digital infrastructure. They do so not just through an expansive approach to defining crimes in cyberspace, but also through proposals to expand the jurisdiction of states over users and data abroad that are implicated in the commission of a crime in their own territories. These proposals on extra-territorial jurisdiction are complemented by those that relax procedural and human rights safeguards on the cross-border sharing of data between law enforcement agencies.\nTaken in toto, these proposals offer an alternative framework of rules that blunt key attributes of the liberal cyber order highlighted in Section II and consequently limit the inherent advantages enjoyed by Western states and transnational private actors in this order.\nhighlights both sets of proposals, along with the specific provisions or changes Russia and China have sought at various stages of the AHC negotiations.\n# Table 1. Summary of relevant proposals advanced by Russia and China at the AHC.\n# 4.1. Constraining strategic adversaries in cyberspace\nChina and Russia have called on states at the AHC to criminalise cyber operations targeting critical infrastructure as well as cyber-enabled espionage. To be sure, Russia and China have arguably engaged in cyber operations that would fall foul of the same provisions they seek in this regard. Their own acts of commission have not deterred their AHC diplomacy arguably for two reasons. The first explanation is that Russia and China perceive for themselves an exceptional status in an alternative cyber order, in much the same way they routinely accuse the United States and its allies of 'hypocritical' actions that contravene the liberal order (Cai Citation 2019, 160).\nHere, the distinction between the approaches of Russia and China is important. Russia has long sought binding rules against the targeting of critical infrastructure, while its conduct, both through operations undertaken by state agencies and via state-supported private groups, has been in flagrant contradiction to those proposals (Korzak Citation 2021). Moscow, which is more 'confrontational and disruptive' (Broeders, Adamson, and Creemers Citation 2019) towards the liberal cyber order, is apparently comfortable with its simultaneous championing and violation of cybersecurity rules. China, on the other hand, has been less forthcoming with specific proposals for cyberspace and tends more to point out the 'double standards' (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China Citation 2023) of the US, particularly in relation to surveillance and espionage. This distinction, as the following paragraphs show, is reflected in the two countries' degree of willingness to push their proposals at the AHC in the face of opposition – Russia more, China less so. A second, issue-specific explanation is that Russia and China have both turned increasingly towards private actors to undertake disruptive or data-gathering operations (Lonergan Citation 2022; Maurer Citation 2017). In contrast to Western liberal economies, which rely on cyber commands and intelligence agencies that are operationally or institutionally accountable to domestic oversight mechanisms, Russia and China's cyber statecraft is characterised by their reliance on proxies (Giles Citation 2023; Hmaidi Citation 2023; Sherman Citation 2022). Unsurprisingly, their AHC proposals criminalise only the conduct of states, allowing both states to claim plausible deniability for proxy actions and exploit the challenges of legally attributing proxy cyber operations to governments. Chinese and Russian proposals at the AHC specifically take aim against US policies such as 'persistent engagement' and 'defend forward', which seek to disrupt 'malicious cyber activity at its source' through the 'proactive' monitoring of foreign networks by US government agencies (Fischerkeller and Harknett Citation 2019; US Cyber Command Citation 2022).\n## 4.2. Critical infrastructure and cyber operations\nThe protection of CI has been discussed at the UN GGE and OEWG for nearly a decade. In 2015, the UN GGE articulated a norm calling on states to 'not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity' that 'intentionally damaged critical infrastructure or otherwise [impaired]' its use (Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, Citation 2015). Since its publication, several multi-stakeholder and intergovernmental bodies have articulated their own version of the norm, specifying either guidelines around state behaviour with respect to CI or identifying certain sectors as 'critical' and therefore deserving of protection (Kouloufakos Citation 2023). Turning the attention of the UN GGE towards the protection of CI has been a longstanding goal of all major actors involved in the process, but in Russia's case, its proposals should also be viewed in the broader geopolitical context of its diplomacy towards a cybersecurity treaty at the UN (Lilly and Cheravitch Citation 2020).\nMoscow's pursuit of a UN cybersecurity treaty was itself an attempt to constrain the development and use by the US and its allies of cyber offensive capabilities and generally limit the (then) advantages that the latter had in this domain (Croft Citation 2012 ; Demidov and Chernenko Citation 2015 ). The GGE format of discussions was the result of a US-Russia compromise to develop a 'framework of responsible state behaviour' through voluntary guidelines in lieu of a new treaty. The 2015 UN GGE's norm on the protection of CI, however, limited only those actions that would violate a state's obligations under existing international law. In other words, the norm concerned itself exclusively with cyber operations that either qualified as a 'use of force' or otherwise resulted in a major loss of functionality or physical effects (Haataja Citation 2023 ). Intelligence or espionage operations, including those with the intent of embedding themselves within critical infrastructure for the purposes of deploying countermeasures or 'active cyber defence' measures (Broeders Citation 2021 ) would be potentially excluded. The sixth UN GGE in 2021 affirmed this view (Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, Citation 2021 ).\nWith the GGE process not delivering the outcome it hoped for, Russia has since turned its attention towards the AHC. In 2022, the lead Russian negotiator to the UN GGE suggested that 'cybercrime is frequently used to disguise attacks against critical infrastructure [and] undermine [the] political and economic situation of governments' (Ministry of Foreign Affairs Citation 2022). Moscow has sought to criminalise 'unlawful interference' with critical infrastructure and critical information infrastructure (CII) since the first session of AHC negotiations, notwithstanding initial opposition from the US and like-minded countries in the European Union (Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes Citation 2023; \"EU Statement - UN Ad-Hoc Committee for a UN Convention on Cybercrime: Objectives and Scope of the Convention and EEAS.\" Citation 2022). Specifically, the Russian proposal suggests that parties should adopt 'legislative and other measures as are necessary under domestic law' to criminalise the creation of software or other digital information that can interfere with CII to destroy, impede or even copy information contained therein (Russia First Draft Article Citation 10 bis Citation 2021) [emphasis added]. The proposal makes clear that surveillance and intelligence-gathering operations would be covered under its remit. Further, the provision also criminalises non-compliance by private actors with government-issued guidelines related to securing CII if such non-compliance results in an attack or damage to information systems. The effect of this proposal is that multinational companies who supply or operate industrial control systems could also be implicated by domestic penal provisions.\nIn the UNGA First Committee, China too has called on states to refrain from targeting the 'critical infrastructures of other states' (People's Republic of China Citation 2017). Further, China has passed domestic legislation protecting CII, imposing duties and responsibilities on operators (Data Security Law of the People's Republic of China Citation 2021). China's first\nsubmission at the AHC sought to criminalise the ‘intrusion and destruction of ICTs facilities, systems, data or CII’. The Chinese proposal seeks to criminalise not only illegal ‘access’ and ‘interference’ with computer data and ‘information systems’ but also the lesser ‘infringement of critical information infrastructure’ (China Suggestion, Article Citation 3 ( Citation 1 ) Citation 2021 ). The protection of CII is also flagged by several joint Russian and Chinese proposals on international cooperation in the AHC. One such proposal seeks an ‘equal right’ to states for ‘the protection of its information resources and critical information infrastructures from misuse and unauthorised interference’ (Russia Joint Proposal June Citation 2022 , Art. 46 (5)). As the above statements indicate, China and Russia’s emphasis at the AHC is on CII, and not CI per se . While most countries share common perceptions of what constitutes CII (ITU-World Bank Citation 2021 ; Cybersecurity Authority of Singapore Citation 2018 ; Russia First Draft Citation 2021 ), it is still important to distinguish it from critical infrastructure. CII refers to information or communication systems or any other network resources that are by themselves required for discharging ‘vital’ services within a nation or essential to the uninterrupted functioning of critical infrastructure such as industrial control systems. Broad international convergence on many definitional aspects of CII notwithstanding, China’s position in particular – underpinned by its domestic law – is notable in the present context. China’s CII Security Protection Regulations, which took effect in 2021, defines CII to include systems whose ‘data leakage’ may ‘gravely harm’, inter alia , the ‘public interest’ (Data Security Law of the People’s Republic of China Citation 2021 ). In contrast, the EU’s focus, for example, is on the destruction or disruption of such infrastructure. Consistent with Russian proposals (Russia First Draft Citation 2021 , Article 11), and reading China’s AHC proposals alongside its domestic regulation (China’s Suggestion Citation 2021 , Article 3(2)), it would appear that Beijing has pursued a catch-all approach to CII as well as actions targeting such infrastructure that would be proscribed (including surveillance and espionage).\nWhile the Russian proposal on CII was removed in the Draft Text of the Convention (DTC) tabled by the AHC Chair before the Sixth Negotiating Session in September 2023, Moscow proposed its reintroduction into the negotiating process in the final session (Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes Citation 2023 , Article 10 bis). Notably, China did not support Russia's proposal to reintroduce criminal provisions on CII. US agencies assess that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been targeting and compromising US critical infrastructure potentially to leverage such access during conflict (United States Department of Defense Citation 2023 ; Washington Post Citation 2023 ). If accurate, these assessments would partly explain China's reluctance to push harder for criminal penalties against compromising CII through a cybercrime treaty. There is also the important consideration, noted at the beginning of this article, of China's global economic interests in cyberspace which outstrip those of Russia. China arguably would consider itself better off with some cybercrime treaty than none at all, which Russia's maximalist bargaining threatened to do at various stages of the AHC.\n## 4.3. Cyber-enabled espionage\nA related issue on which China and Russia have both floated AHC proposals is espionage. The issue of cyber-enabled espionage has been the proverbial ‘elephant in the room’ as far as international cybersecurity discussions are concerned (Broeders Citation 2024). Save for the US—China cybersecurity agreement that proscribed espionage for economic purposes (Yoo Citation 2015), there are no major international agreements that address the issue, either in terms of legal provisions or normative guardrails. On the other hand, China and Russia have sought to use the AHC negotiations on cybercrime to address cross-border espionage. To be sure, the Budapest Convention calls on states to criminalise electronic ‘interception without right’ that is committed ‘intentionally’. States could also require commission with ‘dishonest intent’ (Budapest Convention Citation 2001, Article 3) for criminality. However, as scholars have noted, the Budapest Convention only addresses the criminality of individual actions, and therefore is limited in addressing state espionage (Crootof Citation 2019; Rowe Citation 2020).\nIn contrast, China proposed at the AHC negotiations to hold states accountable for the interception of data (China Suggestion, Article Citation 4 (Citation 1) Citation 2022). The proposal read:\nStates shall not directly collect the data stored in foreign states from enterprises or individuals by technical means bypassing network security protection measures if such measures are against the laws of that foreign state.\nThe proposal not only highlighted a restriction on state activity, but also specifically emphasised the need to shield ‘enterprises and individuals’ from espionage activities. The Budapest Convention, in comparison, only refers to interception ‘to and from’ computer systems. While cyber operations that ‘bypass network security protection measures’ could refer to both disruptive operations as well as cyber-enabled espionage, China’s proposal should be read in the context of its domestic measures aimed at countering espionage. In 2023, China revised its counter-espionage law to include expansively the protection of ‘documents, data, materials and items related to national security and interests’ (Zhang Citation 2023). The revision specifically emphasised cyber operations, whether destructive or intelligence-gathering in nature, that targeted critical information infrastructure and ‘confidential-related units’ within state organs in China. The objective of the revised law is ostensibly to discourage multinational corporations and their employees from collaborating with foreign spy agencies (Marsh and Waldersee Citation 2023; Reuters Citation 2023) and has even resulted in the detention of a foreign national accused of spying (Global Times Citation 2023a; Global Times Citation 2023b). The geopolitical context is especially significant: in light of Chinese attempts to isolate itself from much of the world in the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, Western intelligence agencies have publicly emphasised the need to build ‘strong human intelligence capability’ in the country (Barnes and Wong Citation 2023; CGTN Citation 2023). Through its AHC proposal,\nChina sought not only to secure an international commitment that mirrored its domestic law but ultimately to provide it the legal imprimatur to thwart and deter US and Western intelligence operations that undermine its geopolitical or geoeconomic interests (Azcarate Citation 2023). Meanwhile, Beijing itself has reportedly leaned on proxy actors who make use of increasingly sophisticated methods for cyber espionage, that gives it greater room for deniability. Take for instance, the use by Chinese actors of disaggregate, compromised nodes such as private servers and IoT devices that make attribution to a single group or entity challenging (Raggi Citation 2024).\nRussia's original proposal tabled at the first AHC session similarly sought to criminalise the use of 'technical means to intercept traffic data and data processed by means of ICT that are not intended for public use' (Russia First Draft Citation 2021, Article 7). This is similar to the formulation in the Budapest Convention, although it is slightly modified to stipulate that interception carried out without 'appropriate authorisation' or in 'violation of established rules' should be unlawful. The Budapest Convention's formulation on interception, as noted previously, is more permissive towards espionage and only proscribes those operations conducted 'without right' by another state. Russia's standard is narrower, and allows for states to determine by domestic regulation what constitutes 'inappropriate' interception.\n## 4.4. Enhancing sovereign capacity against domestic and extraterritorial threats\nA second set of AHC proposals by Russia and China seeks to enhance the ability of governments to 'detect, suppress, investigate and prosecute' criminal activities – designated so by domestic law – within their own territories but also abroad (DTC September 2023, Article 1(1); Russia First Draft Citation 2021, Article 31). The latter objective has been sought through procedural measures that ease access to electronic evidence located in other countries and the dilution of human rights safeguards, especially in relation to the handling of data transferred between states. In promoting these proposals, China and Russia's overarching goal is arguably to limit the power of multinational technology companies as well as civil society organisations and coalitions, which are mainly based in, or draw their market strength or legitimacy from, advanced liberal economies. As highlighted previously, the effect of these proposals would be to limit the technical standard or policy-setting capacity of influential private actors on data governance and security, such as encryption and data storage. Admittedly, these proposals would also limit the ability of Chinese and Russian companies to set standards and shape policy. This outcome is in line with the heightened degrees of control, both from a policy and corporate governance perspective, that both states have exerted over their major technology players in recent years (Zhang Citation 2024).\nWe study six sets of proposals within this broader category (see) that advance this objective.\n## 4.5. Addressing ‘cyber-enabled’ crimes\nThe first category of proposals pertains to the types of crimes that can be prosecuted through the AHC convention. Both states have sought the criminalisation of ‘cyber-enabled’ crimes, i.e. crimes that have an ICT component relevant to their commission, as opposed to ‘cyber-dependent’ crimes, which fit more the traditional ‘CIA’ crimes – targeted by the Budapest Convention – that affect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of systems (Wilkinson Citation 2023). Many of these cyber-enabled crimes relate to the publication of online content, which is tightly regulated in authoritarian states. The AHC’s title itself – a committee to elaborate a treaty on ‘the use of ICTs for criminal purposes’ – was the effort of Russian resolutions at the UN General Assembly (Wilkinson Citation 2023). Non-government organizations (NGOs) and civil society organisations have not only decried the inclusion of content-related crimes as posing a ‘heightened risk’ (Privacy International and Electronic Frontier Foundation Citation 2022) to the exercise of human rights but also as impeding the work of journalists or whistle-blowers (Electronic Frontier Foundation Citation 2022). Russia and China have sought also to criminalise, respectively, ‘digital data to mislead the user’ and the ‘dissemination of false information’ (Martin Citation 2023), although these proposals have generated concern among industry and civil society (Bannelier Citation 2023). Neither formulation appears to have made it to the final rounds of negotiations. Russia, along with a number of developing countries, also proposed an all-encompassing clause to ensure the cybercrime treaty did not ‘preclude a State Party from establishing as an offence any other unlawful act committed intentionally with the use of information and communication technologies that causes significant damage’, which remains a legally ambiguous threshold (DTC September 2023, Art. 15 undecies). Targeting a broad range of ‘cyber-enabled crimes’ mirrors domestic criminal law provisions in both China and Russia and has been viewed by some experts as a means of legitimising and exporting their domestic governance models (Iyengar, Gamer and Rathi Citation 2023). Instrumentally, China’s focus has been on crimes faced by its own law enforcement agencies (Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024). Wider criminal provisions in domestic law and international treaty law boost state authority to assert control over individuals and companies that use cyberspace.\n## 4.6. Provisions on mutual legal assistance, human rights, jurisdiction and non-state actors\nBeyond seeking an expansive scope for the cybercrime treaty, we identify five areas where China and Russia have pushed for greater power for states to regulate digital activities at home and abroad. First, Russia has sought through the AHC convention to limit exemptions and safeguards against mutual legal assistance (MLA) requests by a state. These include rejecting clauses that allow states to refuse MLA requests for the prosecution of political offences (DTC September 2023, Art. 40 Clause 21 (c) bis) or those motivated by a ‘person's sex, race, language, religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinions’ (DTC September 2023, Art. 40 Clause 21 (c) ter).\nSecond, both China and Russia have advocated procedural reforms to domestic criminal law that would enable the easier prosecution of crimes committed through the use of ICTs. Russia has sought to ‘ensure that electronic evidence derived or extracted from [any ICT] shall have the probative value in criminal procedure’ (DTC September 2023, Article 30 bis). China and Russia have suggested that states should establish ‘relevant legal procedures and technical standards for the collection, retention and provision of electronic evidence to ensure the authenticity, integrity and legality of electronic evidence’ (DTC September 2023, Article 30 ter).\nThird, these states have, along with others, sought to limit human rights safeguards against the prosecution of cybercrime. Russia has objected to several proposals that introduce human rights safeguards against criminal prosecution, including in the case of ‘persons and groups in vulnerable situations’ (DTC September 2023, Article 5(2)). Moscow has also rejected a proposal to include the effective protection of human rights as a key element of cross-border technical assistance and capacity-building (DTC September 2023, Article 54). While China has not backed Russia on the proposal to remove human rights safeguards altogether, it has resisted attempts to introduce oversight mechanisms or limitations in the way governments can process and retain personal data transferred between states under the AHC convention (DTC September 2023, Article 36 sub-clause 2). Russia has also sought the use of the term ‘unlawful’ across the Consolidated Negotiation Text of the AHC draft to refer to specific acts that invite criminal prosecution. In contrast, the US, EU and like-minded countries prefer the phrase ‘without right’, which is more commonly used in the Budapest Convention. This distinction is important: ‘unlawful’ actions would be determined solely on the basis of domestic legislation, whereas the more permissive formulation ‘without right’ acknowledges the universal legitimacy of certain actions, such as accessing a free and open public computer system, instituting ‘protection activities’ (such as stronger encryption or cybersecurity safeguards) with the permission of those involved in transmitting data, or those actions taken in the pursuit of human rights such as privacy or free expression (Budapest Convention Citation 2001).\nFourth, Russia and China’s efforts to regulate extraterritorial activity go beyond proposals for expansive MLA. Notably, Russia has sought to extend states’ jurisdiction to cases in which ‘the offence is committed wholly or partly outside [their territory] but its effect in the territory [would] constitute an offence or result in the commission of an offense’ (DTC September 2023, Art. 22 sub-clause 2 c bis). Similarly, Russia has sought automatic jurisdiction for states if the ‘offence is committed against the State Party’ (DTC September 2023, Article 22 sub-clause 2 d). China has qualified its support to Russia’s invocation of the ‘effects doctrine’ Footnote ⁵ (Estey Citation 1997). Jurisdiction, in China’s view, should be based on a ‘true and sufficient’ link with criminal activities, giving priority to the place where the consequence of criminal activity occurs, where it is committed and the location of the perpetrator (China Suggestion Citation 3 (Citation 7) Citation 2022).\nFinally, both states have sought explicit control over internet service providers by national agencies. Such proposals have been an integral part of all Russian and Chinese drafts and contributions made to the AHC over six negotiating sessions. In its first draft proposal submitted to the AHC, Russia included two articles that specifically address the role of the private sector and ISPs, and also sought a code of conduct for their governance (Russian Federation Citation 2021, Article 43). China's proposals, while not as extensive, require companies and service providers to 'take technical measures and other necessary measures to effectively respond to criminal activities' (China's Suggestion Citation 2022, Article 3 (6)). Notably, both states have sought the criminalisation of the 'unlawful provision of service', understood as the providing of essentially any digitally-enabled service with 'the intent that the service or technical support be used for the commission of any of the offences' (DTC September 2023, Article 10 ter). Presumably, the service provider's 'intent' in this case would be discerned by states themselves, which enables the prosecution of any service provider that does not restrict internet services to communities or geographic areas proscribed by the state. Given the broad scope of offences that Russia and China, along with other authoritarian regimes, want to criminalise, this proposal could severely restrict the scope of operation of Virtual Private Networks or even secure messaging platforms that are set up with the intention of enabling secure and private communication away from the gaze of the state. These proposals are notable and offer important context to what China sees as the role of ISPs in 'decentralised internet infrastructure' models that it has floated at standards bodies.\nRussia's push for greater control over extraterritorial activity also throws into relief its original justification for not signing the Budapest Convention. Moscow has long expressed concerns over Article 32 of the Budapest Convention because it enables cross-border law enforcement access to territorial data without authorisation from the respective State Party. At the AHC negotiations, Russia has proposed that all cooperation under the cybercrime convention happens exclusively with the authorisation of State Parties. The cumulative effect of Russia's proposals would be that states become the sole arbiters of cross-border data access, but also have few procedural safeguards or human rights restrictions to refuse sharing data with other governments.\n# 5. Cybercrime negotiations and the future of the liberal cyber order\nRussia and China's proposals at the AHC reflect their efforts to shape systemically the governance of cyberspace, away from its liberal underpinnings. They attempt to reconfigure the norms and rules governing international relations in cyberspace by casting the territorial state as its main actor. Much like Western states have benefitted from a liberal order rooted in the dilution of the territorial state and the delegation of key cyberspace governance functions to private actors\n(Farrell and Newman Citation 2021), Russia and China seek geopolitical advantages from the alternative order they propose.\nDraft measures on the protection of CII and the criminalisation of cyber-enabled espionage constrain the freedom that Western intelligence agencies and commands enjoy in cyberspace for information-gathering and disruptive operations. On the other hand, stronger control over online content and the activities of digital services providers as well as weaker procedural and substantive safeguards on cross-border data-sharing between governments ensure that states can regulate private actors at home and also exert control over the data of users and entities held abroad (Harvey and Moore Citation 2022). The goal of these proposals is to limit the autonomy and influence of (mostly) Western technology companies in determining data flows and cybersecurity outcomes through their in-house policies and technical standards (Klonick Citation 2017).\nRussia and China's pursuit of an alternative cyber order is backed by several statements on issues discussed in the paper. While a detailed examination of these statements and strategies is outside the scope of this paper, we highlight a few notable examples. Beijing's repeated references to the US's 'empire of hacking' (Reuters Citation 2023) and Moscow's claims of US targeting critical infrastructure for subversive 'political and economic' operations suggest that their proposals at the AHC are motivated by overarching geopolitical motives, rather than by narrow domestic ones (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Citation 2022). Further, both countries have tried to use the platform of the AHC to promote their model among developing countries through language referencing the need for a systemic shift in cyberspace governance. China has declared that the AHC treaty should 'adjust [to] and create new contours for ensuring the security of states' (China Intervention Sixth Session Morning, UN Web TV 2023, 01:01:00 to 01:07:00). This messaging has been emphasised repeatedly by the Russian delegation as well. An article written by the Deputy Head of the Russian delegation amidst the AHC negotiations argued that the 'prospects for the global digitalisation process as a whole, the effectiveness and dynamics which depend on ensuring security, are in question' (Chernukhin Citation 2023).\nIndeed, Russia and China's diplomatic strategies at the AHC appear to exploit the Global South's 'discontent' against the LIO (Endaylalu Citation 2022). Both states have argued that debates on human rights are manufactured by states (liberal economies) who seek to 'retain their dominant position in the information sphere' at the cost of 'practical cooperation' on cybercrime (Russian Federation Citation 2022). In other words, the messaging here is not that human rights are bad, but that developing nations have more urgent priorities which are not highlighted in the current order. Relatedly, both states have also underlined the need for new rules to prosecute cybercrime, appealing to the deeply felt sentiment among African and Asian countries to be norm-makers and not norm-takers (Acharya Citation 2011). China's opening intervention at AHC negotiations stressed that including 'cyber-enabled crimes' in the cybercrime treaty is a way of ensuring that international law kept 'pace with the trends' (China, Intervention Sixth Session Morning, UN\nWeb TV 2023, 01:01:00 to 01:07:00). Russia has emphasised the fact that many countries stayed away from the Budapest Convention because they were not involved in its creation (Seger Citation 2016), denouncing the instrument as having failed to win the 'minds and hearts' of the developing world (Chernukhin Citation 2023).\nAs illustrates, Russia and China's own cyber diplomacy at the AHC has received steady support from some of its allies, but many developing countries and emerging powers (Chivvis and Geaghan-Breiner Citation 2024) have largely remained silent in response.\n# Table 2. States' responses to China and Russia's proposals at September 2023 negotiations.\nThe Draft Text of Convention (DTC) circulated by the AHC's chair in September 2023 omitted several proposals from China and Russia, especially on the scope and coverage of 'cyber-enabled crimes' as well as protection of CII. However, Russia attempted to reinsert all those proposals back into the DTC as red-line edits. China, as has illustrated, appears to have been less persistent in terms of reintroducing its original proposals. China's more moderate approach, as indicated in the first half of this paper, arguably reflects its heightened economic stake in cyberspace, compared to Russia's all-or-nothing strategy. Further, Russia's approach to the AHC negotiations reflects its strategy in the UN GGE and UN OEWG, where it scoped out similarly maximalist positions before engaging in last-minute, backroom deals to secure consensus within both groups. Chinese cyber diplomacy generally tends to avoid such grand bargains, and in the AHC appears to have prioritised some of its proposals over others.\nRegardless of their outcomes, it is clear from Russia and China's proposals that both states view the proposed AHC convention on cybercrime as an opportunity to chart new rules for the road for cyberspace. In a domain characterised mainly by informal norms of responsible behaviour and technical standards – a consequence of the liberal ordering of cyberspace – both states have arguably found it difficult to challenge the economic and normative clout of major private actors and to constrain the strategic advantages of powerful Western adversaries. They have sought consequently to use the prospective AHC treaty to usher in a cyber order that lends primacy to the territorial state – not only to govern domestic digital activity but also to shape international data flows and the use of offensive cyber capabilities.\n# Acknowledgement\nThe authors thank Isabella Wilkinson for comments on a previous draft of this article.\n# Disclosure statement\nThe authors report that there are no competing interests to declare.",

The application of this 'liberal cyber order' has been resisted by Russia and China who seek a greater role for the territorial state in cyberspace governance. They have long sought new, binding rules to this effect with little success. The UN cybercrime convention bucks the trend of informal, non-binding agreements in this domain. Through an empirical analysis of proposals advanced by Russia and China during negotiations toward the cybercrime convention, this article demonstrates how they have sought to use it to develop rules that blunt the advantages enjoyed by Western liberal economies and major transnational actors in the current order. Going beyond the regulation of cybercrime, Russian and Chinese proposals empower states to thwart disruptive and intelligence-gathering cyber operations that may be conducted globally by Western adversaries. Additionally, they enhance the state's regulatory capacity over private actors at home and abroad, limiting the ability of businesses or NGOs to shape cybersecurity and human rights standards around the transfer, retention and access of data.\n# KEYWORDS:\n- Cybercrime treaty\n- cyber sovereignty\n- liberal international order\n- cybersecurity governance\n# 1. Introduction\nWhat kind of global governance regime do China and Russia seek for cyberspace? As authoritarian states with strong restrictions on the online activities of individuals, businesses and NGOs, do they simply seek greater autonomy to regulate digital technologies in their territory without foreign intervention? China and Russia have been robustly engaged, for over two decades, in discussions on internet governance at the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) (Murgia and Gross Citation 2020; Yoo Citation 2023), regional cooperative institutions and multi-stakeholder entities such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) (Kennedy Citation 2013; Negro Citation 2020; Yan Citation 2015). Chinese and Russian proposals advanced at these forums have the effect of increasing states' capacity to manage the territorial conduct of private actors.\nThe proposals advanced by both states at international forums also signal their geopolitical interests in cyberspace. Discussions on international cybersecurity in the UN General Assembly's First Committee, where Russia and China have competed with the 'like-minded' Footnote 1 countries led by the United States and European Union on specific proposals, throw into relief those interests (Basu, Poetranto, and Lau Citation 2021; Tiirmaa-Klaar Citation 2021). Through their First Committee proposals, Russia and China have sought to limit the ability of Western adversaries to engage in offensive cyber operations against their digital assets and infrastructure, and simultaneously to legitimize their own strategies and practices (for example, their increasing use of proxies or 'cyber mercenaries') (Maurer Citation 2017; Sukumar Citation 2017).\nBy dint of institutional design and the fragmented nature of the cyber 'regime complex' (Nye Citation 2014), discussions on internet governance, cybercrime and norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace have hitherto taken place across a number of international forums. This fragmentation has occluded from analysis a complete picture of the systemic changes that Russia and China pursue for the governance of cyberspace. Given that they are major cyber powers, it is important to understand whether and why both states seek to influence how other states govern territorial networks to advance their own broader geopolitical and geoeconomic ambitions for the domain. For instance, China and Russia would want for other states to have greater agency over domestic networks, whether for the purpose of requesting them to thwart Western cyber operations, curtail the growing influence of Western technology companies whom they see as proxies of the US or its allies, or clamp down on foreign voices and institutions critical of them. Conversely, implementing tougher restrictions on online activity at home may often require China and Russia to seek data from abroad for investigative and prosecutorial purposes. For such data requests to succeed, states must not only be aligned on what counts as criminal activity in cyberspace, there should also be few procedural hurdles for interstate data transfers. These objectives require a major reconfiguration of the way in which states currently engage with each other in cyberspace, and with private actors both domestically and internationally.\nTo be sure, Russian and Chinese objectives for cyberspace governance differ in important respects. As Flonk notes, Russia relies more on policy-oriented measures to regulate internet infrastructure, users and networks than China, where technical infrastructure such as the Great Chinese Firewall allows for a high degree of centralisation over content control and platforms governance (Flonk Citation 2021). Secondly, with significantly higher economic stakes in cyberspace, China's geopolitical outlook differs somewhat from Russia's. China's cyber diplomacy and proposals are driven by a desire to support Chinese technology companies while seeking a significant degree of state control over ICT activities at home and abroad. Russia, on the other hand, does not have a significant domestic technology industry and is therefore arguably less concerned about the geoeconomic consequences of its cyber diplomacy (Broeders, Adamson, and Creemers Citation 2019). Finally, China is more selective than Russia in the execution of cyber operations. While Moscow undertakes a broad range of disruptive and\ndestructive cyber operations, including those aimed at systemic political destabilisation, Beijing has restricted itself to undertaking operations that incrementally advance its economic or security objectives. The difference could be attributed to the blowback that Chinese industry and states agencies would face as good-faith participants and key influencers of standards development (Russel and Berger Citation 2021) and digital markets were they to undertake cyber operations that cause widespread instability or degrade the availability of global internet services.\nThese differences notwithstanding, scholars have long highlighted the strong convergence of views between Russia and China in their ideological opposition to the liberal international order and to its application to cyberspace. This ‘liberal cyber order’ is marked not only by substantive norms that govern state behaviour in cyberspace but also by who sets those norms (Rovner Citation 2023). Open data flows, multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms and deference to the exercise of civil, political and economic liberties online constitute the defining characteristics of the liberal cyber order, whose influence on the internet is historical and still discernible (Deibert and Crete-Nishihata Citation 2012; Farrell and Newman Citation 2021; Hollis and Raustiala Citation 2022). In geopolitical terms, this order privileges liberal democracies and their constituents – in particular the United States and its trans-Atlantic allies who have helped incubate the growth of the internet since its early years – as rule-shapers (Farrell and Newman Citation 2021, Citation 2024). China and Russia are united in their goal to ‘reform the liberal cyber order’ (Wu Citation 2021), which includes upending liberal norms (Flonk Citation 2021) as well as the institutional governance mechanisms that are its mainstay (Raymond and Sherman Citation 2024). China and Russia are not the only actors who seek a ‘post-liberal cyberspace’ (Barrinha and Renard Citation 2020), but they are certainly its most powerful proponents, and frequent fellow travellers in diplomatic forums.\nThis article highlights Russian and Chinese efforts to orchestrate such a systemic reform or reconfiguration of the liberal cyber order through the proposed cybercrime convention currently negotiated by an Ad Hoc Committee (AHC) of the United Nations. While the AHC was established to develop a binding international instrument for states to tackle cybercrime – in official terms, counter the ‘use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) for criminal purposes’ – we show that Russia and China have sought for it to regulate activities that go well beyond the treaty’s intended scope. Their proposals, as this article empirically demonstrates, not only address cybercrime, but also implicate international cybersecurity governance and cross-border data access.\nChinese and Russian proposals at the AHC push for states to have greater control over digital infrastructure and activities. As this article's review of the literature highlights, this is consistent with longstanding Chinese and Russian views on cyberspace governance. Nonetheless, the AHC negotiations also demonstrate that their championing of 'cyber sovereignty' (Creemers Citation 2020; Stadnik Citation 2021; Thumfart Citation 2021; Zeng, Stevens, and Chen Citation 2017) is oriented towards specific objectives that in turn reveal China and Russia's aspirations towards\nsystemic changes in cyberspace governance. Their proposals empower the territorial state to regulate certain cyber operations of geopolitical concern to China and Russia. In the guise of addressing cybercrime, they also allow states to shape policies and standards on the storage and security of data, to exert control over digital activities abroad that bear on territorial concerns, and to fashion the governance of cross-border data flows as an exclusively intergovernmental prerogative with few procedural or human rights safeguards. Taken together, these proposals undermine key tenets of the liberal cyber order, that, through open networks and digital markets, have conferred geopolitical and geoeconomic advantages to liberal democracies and transnational actors based largely in Western states. Indeed, we present these findings as helping to advance a theoretical frontier in the literature on Chinese and Russian approaches to cyberspace governance. Whereas extant analyses (see Section 2) have shone a spotlight on the domestic and global impact of China and Russia's sovereignty-centric proposals, newer scholarship has begun to examine the order-level consequences of such proposals. China and Russia, these scholars note, foreground the territorial state in cyberspace for explicitly systemic objectives (Wu Citation 2021) and have attempted 'hegemonic socialisation', i.e. persuading states who are likely to agree to order-level changes (Hulvey Citation 2021, Citation 2022). Meanwhile, the order-level impact of their proposals has been clearly acknowledged and addressed as such by states like Brazil and India (Basu Citation 2024; Paulus Citation 2024), whose support is crucial for any major change to the liberal cyber order.\nAnalysing cybercrime proposals by Russia and China contextually and holistically is also important because their presentation before the AHC itself cannot be considered coincidental or opportunistic. The AHC negotiations are expressly oriented towards a treaty, in contrast to the non-binding, voluntary 'norms' on responsible behaviour that have hitherto guided interstate engagement in this domain. Moscow and Beijing have long sought to set multilateral rules not only for international cybersecurity (Levinson Citation 2021) but also for internet governance, mainly via the ITU (Radu and Gregorio Citation 2023). Those efforts have thus far not succeeded (Grigsby Citation 2017). Attempts by both states to promote technical standards that allow for greater state control over the governance of critical internet resources have not yet gained currency in multi-stakeholder forums that set standards for the internet (Hogeveen Citation 2022). Given the backdrop of 'pervasive informality' (Sukumar, Broeders, and Kello Citation 2024) in intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder models of cyberspace governance, the AHC provides a rare avenue for Russia and China to shoehorn their proposals into an instrument that binds the conduct of states.\nAt the time of writing, a draft convention text has been agreed upon by all participating states at the AHC. The final convention is expected to be adopted at a formal General Assembly vote later in 2024 (UNODC Citation 2024). As our empirical findings reveal, several proposals by Russia and China were rejected in earlier versions of the AHC draft text, while some others were reintroduced by either state in later stages of negotiation. Even if those proposals fail to gain\nacceptance, their tabling, and in some cases, persistent diplomatic efforts to push them through, indicate the importance both states attach to them, and their contribution to systemic reordering in cyberspace.\nSection 2 reviews the literature on Chinese and Russian approaches to cyberspace governance, framed against the backdrop of their broader challenge to the liberal international order. This section highlights why it is important to study their AHC proposals within this broader context, and why Russia and China have specifically sought the AHC to float those proposals. Section 3 offers a background to the cybercrime negotiations and explains how the article collected and reviewed data on Chinese and Russian AHC proposals. Section 4 forms the empirical core of this paper. It highlights various AHC proposals made by both states, dividing them into two broad categories that reflect the essence of their challenge to the liberal cyber order: one, proposals to constrain the actions of strategic Western adversaries who benefit from open digital networks, and two, proposals to enhance territorial and extraterritorial control over private actors.\n## 2. China and Russia’s challenge to the liberal cyber order\nInternational order refers to the ‘explicit principles, rules, and institutions’ that manage and reflect ‘core relationships’ and ‘settled expectations’ between states (Ikenberry Citation 2001). The liberal international order is broadly premised on three elements: freer trade and security cooperation that is based on predictable and recognised rules, cooperation through multilateral institutions that is increasingly shifting to informal mechanisms, and the progressive growth of liberal democratic values and institutional arrangements across societies (Acharya Citation 2017; Ikenberry Citation 2010). Applying the liberal domestic values of ‘predictability, access, and representation’ to international politics (Deudney and Ikenberry Citation 1999), the LIO allows private actors – especially with transnational interests such as corporations and NGOs – to engage and seek direct representation in rules, norms or institutions (Handreider Citation 1978; Moravcsik Citation 2003; Scherer et al. Citation 2006).\nIn recent years, international relations scholarship has extensively debated the challenge posed by ‘revisionist’ powers like Russia and China to the LIO across regimes such as international security, trade and climate (Johnston Citation 2019; Lake, Martin, and Risse Citation 2021; Weiss and Wallace Citation 2021; Zürn Citation 2018). The nature of Chinese and Russian challenges to the LIO differ substantially. China, according to Goddard (Citation 2018), is a ‘bridging revisionist’ that is likely to use the existing international economic and political order to foment ‘rule-based revolution’, i.e. to transform existing rules over time to those more disposed to its interests. If its geoeconomic diplomacy in particular is any indication, China does not seek an overhaul of the LIO, but ‘prefers a more conservative version that emphasises Westphalian norms of sovereignty and non-interference’ (Weiss and Wallace Citation 2021). Russia, with fewer economic stakes in the LIO, has been more inclined to test its limits through ‘violent\naction' (Goddard Citation 2018) in contravention of basic tenets of the UN Charter and modern international relations. The outcomes of their challenges to the LIO depend in large measure on the approaches of emerging powers – with some of whom the liberal order still resonates ideologically or economically, despite their differences with the hegemon, the United States (Efstathopoulos Citation 2021). In this regard, Russia and China's joint emphasis on ‘hollowing out’ the LIO into its constitutive sovereignty elements (Johnston Citation 2019) – the sovereign equality of states, treaty-based agreements in lieu of informal agreements, consent-based dispute settlement mechanisms – may appeal to a broader audience, including emerging powers (Dugard Citation 2023).\nThe challenge posed by Russia and China to the LIO presents a necessary context to the understanding of ‘cyber ordering’ or the organisation of relations between states in cyberspace (Kello Citation 2017). As Barrinha and Renard note, cyberspace was itself the creation of the liberal order – characterised by open networks as well as private and decentralised governance (Barrinha and Renard Citation 2020). As is now widely acknowledged, various aspects of the cyber order have faced contestation from state and non-state actors in recent decades, resulting in a ‘retreat of liberal values’ (Barrinha and Renard Citation 2020; Deibert and Rohozinski Citation 2011; Mueller Citation 2017). As powerful nation states, China and Russia present the most potent challenge to the order. The remainder of this section reviews extant scholarship that analyses the Chinese and Russian challenge to the liberal cyber order, with a particular focus on cybersecurity governance. Then it highlights why studying proposals at the AHC negotiations offer a clearer picture of the alternative framework of rules that Russia and China want in cyberspace.\n## 2.1. Russian and Chinese approaches to global cybersecurity governance\nWe identify three strands of scholarship examining China and Russia’s approach to cybersecurity governance. The first strand includes conceptual and empirical assessments of the notion of cyber sovereignty, deployed discursively by both countries in domestic and international settings. This body of scholarship offers important insights into the evolution of domestic policy discourse and legislation by China and Russia to attain ‘cyber sovereignty’ and ‘information security’ respectively, two related concepts that have been at the crux of both countries’ approaches to the governance of cyberspace.\nChina’s evocation of ‘cyber sovereignty’ as a policy goal can be traced back to the 2010 White Paper on the internet in China published by the state council, the country’s apex administrative body (Information Office of the State Council Citation 2010). The concept has since made an appearance in speeches by China’s political leadership as well as its international cyberspace strategy (People’s Republic of China Citation 2017). Tracing its discursive evolution over the years, scholars have distilled ‘cyber sovereignty’ into two main components (Creemers Citation 2020; Fung Citation 2022). The first constitutive element is the core role of the state in\n'information management' (Fung Citation 2022), mainly by asserting territorial control over both domestic and foreign non-state actors. Such control may be exerted through technical measures or regulations around online activities within its jurisdiction (Deibert Citation 2015; Qiao-Franco Citation 2024). Control over the information environment is also exerted by facilitating a shift in global internet governance away from multi-stakeholder processes to articulate policy or technical standards towards intergovernmental processes under the auspices of the UN (Creemers Citation 2020; Fung Citation 2022).\nThe second constitutive element of cyber sovereignty is the equality of states in cyberspace (Zeng, Stevens, and Chen Citation 2017) which China has framed primarily in terms of the right to non-interference in a state's internal affairs. On the other hand, Russia's policy discourse on 'information security' has a longer lineage, but is essentially aligned with many of the aforesaid goals of China. First articulated in the 2000 Doctrine on Information Security, this concept is presented as a 'triad' of state, society and individual interests, whose protection from internal and external threats is ultimately the remit of the government (Stadnik Citation 2021). Over time, Russian controls over digital networks have mimicked Chinese measures (Weber Citation 2017). Such measures in Russia include online content filtering, mandatory data localisation, protection of critical information infrastructure and the 2019 Law on the Russian segment of the internet that aims to ward off external threats through centralised internet traffic routing and a national domain name system (Hakala and Melnchyuk Citation 2021; Stadnik Citation 2021). Russia has also sought the development of a legally-binding instrument for cyberspace, and to restrain states from weaponizing 'information to undermine the political, economic and social system' of others (Korzak Citation 2021).\nChina and Russia's pursuit of cyber sovereignty and information security is largely animated by the survival of its political institutions and the quest for social stability. However, there is also an important global dimension to these concepts, which the second strand of scholarship unpacks (Barrinha and Turner Citation 2024; Flonk, Jachtenfuchs, and Obendiek Citation 2020; Gao Citation 2022; Jiang Citation 2010; Nocetti Citation 2015). Analyses of Chinese and Russian proposals made at international forums have highlighted their substantive impact on users, businesses and NGOs as well as inter-state relations. Beijing and Moscow have emerged as entrepreneurs of 'illiberal norms' (Flonk Citation 2021), relating mainly to the control of online content and the governance of digital platforms, in venues such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), BRICS and the UN. Their proposals also contribute to the creation of 'sovereignty spheres', where states articulate policy and set standards on online content and internet governance, often superseding global, multi-stakeholder processes (Flonk, Jachtenfuchs, and Obendiek Citation 2020). Why would other states that have benefited from global standards opt into such sovereignty enclaves? Simmons and Hulvey note that states are 'anxious [of being] overwhelmed by global forces', among which the internet figures prominently (Simmons and Hulvey Citation 2022). Facing a 'sovereign identity crisis' in the age of the internet, they\nargue, states develop ‘border orientation preferences’ to ensure digital policies mirror the governance of territorial boundaries (Simmons and Hulvey Citation 2022). In this way, they try to ensure state-society relations are not destabilised by globalisation or open information flows.\nFinally, a third strand of scholarship examines how China and Russia engage tactically with norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace (Creemers Citation 2021; Fung Citation 2022; Raymond and Sherman Citation 2024). This literature has contributed significantly to the study of ‘cyber diplomacy’ by major powers and non-state actors. It focuses especially on the diplomatic rhetoric and narratives (Barrinha and Turner Citation 2024; Hansel Citation 2023) deployed by Moscow and Beijing to bolster support for their proposals (Fung Citation 2022), as well as their gaming of multilateral negotiation procedures – supporting consensus-based agreements, limiting private participation, ‘stack[ing] the deck’ with illiberal initiatives (Raymond and Sherman Citation 2024) – for the same purpose.\nTo summarise, China and Russia’s engagement with cybersecurity governance is characterised in the literature as driven mainly by the pursuit of cyber sovereignty, i.e. the enhancement of the state’s capacity to govern territorial networks and digital assets. The most conspicuous tool deployed in the pursuit of cyber sovereignty is online content control. Both states have engaged in diplomatic efforts to export their model of cyber sovereignty, especially to developing countries. The emergence of ‘sovereignty spheres’ akin to China and Russia, scholars point out, is likely to cause the ‘fragmentation’ of the liberal cyber order (Flonk, Jachtenfuchs, and Obendiek Citation 2020). Fragmentation, as per existing literature, could refer either to the fragmentation of regulatory regimes across jurisdictions, including liberal economies (Bradford Citation 2023), or to the technical splintering of the internet into non-interoperable, territorial networks (Drake, Cerf, and Kleinwachter Citation 2016). Pertinently, Mueller cautions against exaggerating the prospect of the technical fragmentation of the internet (Mueller Citation 2017, 17, 18). Fragmentation, he notes, is possible only if a critical mass of internet-users defect from the global internet, establishing technical incompatibilities that could sustain multiple ‘internets’ for a significant period of time. The economic and security costs of such defections may not outweigh the network benefits (Mueller Citation 2017; Polatin-Reuben and Wright Citation 2014). That said, Chinese industry players like Huawei have presented proposals on technical standards on ‘decentralised internet infrastructure’ at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). These proposals have been socialised by Chinese actors as ‘New IP’ technologies, which aim to ‘[reinvent] the internet's core architecture,’ (Hoffmann, Lazanski, and Taylor Citation 2020) and potentially create ‘non-interoperable networks’ across the globe (Sharp Citation 2020). The main challenge to the liberal cyber order consequently lies not only in a possible technical fragmentation of the internet but in ongoing attempts to subject its governance, domestically and internationally, to the territorial state.\n## 2.2. Significance of the Ad Hoc Committee on cybercrime\nThe enhanced cyber sovereignty of states, especially developing countries, allow them to resist ‘US [economic and political] hegemony in cyberspace’ (Gao Citation 2022). As challengers to the liberal cyber order, this is admittedly an important goal for China and Russia. Nevertheless, as major global players themselves, both states seek rules in a sovereignty-centric cyber order that specifically benefit them, drawing in no small part on their own traditional strengths and preferences in dealing exclusively with governments abroad. The following paragraphs highlight what those goals might be, why it has been challenging for China and Russia to achieve them, and how the AHC acquires salience in this context.\nAs a systemic objective, China and Russia seek to constrain certain inherent advantages that Western economies enjoy in the liberal cyber order. An open and free internet – a core tenet of the liberal order – not only has normative appeal but also confers instrumental geopolitical advantages to Western liberal states (Lahmann Citation 2021), to which both states are especially sensitive (Lokot and Wijermars Citation 2023). ‘Internet freedom’, which has been a key US foreign policy goal, is also an enabler of market access for multinational corporations – many of them based in the US – to gain from digital economies around the world (DeNardis and Hackl Citation 2015; Farrell Citation 2006; Farrell and Newman Citation 2021). It is a tool for soft power promotion in cyberspace, facilitating the import of Western cultural, ideological and intellectual motifs and themes by developing states (Rothkopf Citation 1997). An open internet is also beneficial to covert and overt military, intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the West that enjoy ‘home-field advantage’ (Buchanan Citation 2022) in a domain largely developed and innovated upon in liberal economies. Strategic adversaries such as China and Russia want to constrain the capabilities of the United States and like-minded countries to gather intelligence and ‘persistently engage’ (Goldsmith Citation 2022; US Cyber Command Citation 2022) digital networks to surveil and mount offensive cyber operations.\nAchieving this broader goal through the reform of existing multilateral institutions has proved challenging for Russia and China. Firstly, new rules that enhance the sovereign capacities of states are likely to be incompatible with rules incubated by existing liberal regimes, in which both Russia and China are willing participants. Any attempt to coerce other states into their preferred regimes will invite retaliation or be simply ignored for other, preferential regimes (Cha Citation 2023). Even if China or Russia were to set new rules, their challenge would be to draw away middle powers or developing countries, whose economic or security dependencies with advanced liberal economies may compel them to stick with existing regimes. The ‘counterhegemonic coalitions’ (Schweller and Pu Citation 2011) that both states have sought to incubate have had little success drawing in countries that were not already in their geopolitical orbit. Initiatives such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s Code of Conduct on Information Security or the China-promoted Global Initiative on Data Security seem unlikely to register acknowledgment\namong broader multilateral initiatives (Kynge Citation 2023). In China's case particularly, it has struggled also to shore up support for 'counter-institutionalization' in global economic governance, through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) that do not conflict with the Bretton Woods institutions but attempt to 'decrease [their] relevance' (Zürn Citation 2018). In the domain of international security, prospects for counter-institutionalization are likely to be even harder (Zürn Citation 2018).\nFurthermore, the world is witnessing a discernible shift towards informal global governance (Snidal Citation 2021; Westerwinter, Abbott, and Biersteker Citation 2021), undermining efforts by Russia and China to create a new international order through binding rules. Empirically documented by scholars of international law and international relations, this phenomenon has catalysed the proliferation of informal alliances, ad hoc coalitions and task forces in economic and security domains (Bradley, Goldsmith, and Hathaway Citation 2023; Reykers et al. Citation 2023). This shift has arguably been precipitated by the US's turn towards non-binding agreements, largely for reasons of domestic politics, such as difficulties in getting Senate ratification of treaties or the lack of interest in treaty-based cooperation from populist elites (Copelovitch and Pevehouse Citation 2019). The relative decline in traditional multilateral governance deprives China and Russia, among others, of opportunities to supplant existing rules and formal regimes. The cybersecurity regime is a prime example of this phenomenon, being characterised by 'pervasive informality' (Sukumar, Broeders, and Kello Citation 2024). At the UN, for instance, Russia has for more than two decades sought an international treaty on cybersecurity, only to have its proposals rebuffed by Western countries (Farrell and Newman Citation 2021). Neither the UN GGE nor the OEWG, the two main multilateral venues for discussions on international cybersecurity, has the power to bind states with its recommendations, and both have articulated in their stead voluntary norms suggesting the contours of 'responsible state behaviour' for the domain (Kavanagh Citation 2017). Informal global governance, including in cyberspace, has paved the way for private entities to forge multi-stakeholder partnerships in various governance domains (Johnstone, Sukumar, and Trachtman Citation 2023). In comparison to treaty negotiations, which traditionally offer limited roles for NGOs and private actors to offer substantive inputs, informal channels tend to be more open and inclusive.\nThe AHC negotiations arguably address both concerns for Russia and China, and explain the scope of their proposals. Although there exists an international cybercrime instrument – the Budapest Convention – it is not signed by either state, nor for that matter by the overwhelming majority of developing countries in Asia and Africa. There is little need to develop a ‘counter-institutional’ coalition against the Budapest Convention, when most major non-signatories have expressed their reservations about the instrument. The AHC, on the other hand, comprises all UN member states, making it easier for Russia and China to build coalitions and attract countries into their orbit on their specific proposals. To be sure, both still need to engage in diplomacy to\nevangelise their proposals and appear to acknowledge this reality (Barrinha and Turner Citation 2024; Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024). As Barrinha and Turner (Citation 2024) note, Russia even took a more accommodative stand towards non-state actor participation in the cybercrime discussions in order to shore up international support.\nSecondly, the AHC discussions were very clearly geared towards a cybercrime treaty which would create binding rules. This treaty bucks the trend of informal agreements in this domain. Shoehoring proposals on cybersecurity into the cybercrime convention allowed China and Russia to address topics that either are off the table at the UN GGE or OEWG, such as cyber-enabled espionage, or do not limit the use of offensive cyber weapons by (Western) states. Consequently, their AHC proposals reflected the regulation of a whole gamut of issues that have systemic, 'order'-level effects on cyberspace. Prior to highlighting those proposals in finer detail, a brief background on the negotiations themselves is necessary.\n# 3. Cybercrime negotiations at the United Nations\nThe 'Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) for Criminal Purposes' negotiated by an intergovernmental Ad Hoc Committee will be the first binding UN instrument on any issue pertaining to the governance of cyberspace. The AHC was established by the UN General Assembly in 2019. Like the Budapest Convention developed by the Council of Europe – in some respects the precursor not only to this instrument but also to several regional agreements on cybercrime (Shires Citation 2024) – the objective of the AHC is to develop global benchmarks on identifying cybercrime and enabling international cooperation to address it.\nThe political backdrop to the AHC negotiations is important. Neither Russia nor China are signatories to the Budapest Convention. China has stayed away from the Budapest Convention for two reasons: firstly, signing the CoE Convention would be contrary to its longstanding position that global governance, including of cyberspace, should be under the aegis of the UN; secondly, China has also argued that it was not consulted when the Budapest Convention was being drafted (Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024). Russia, until its expulsion in 2022 from the body, remained the only Council of Europe member not to have signed the Budapest Convention. Moscow has offered three reasons for its decision: the low number of offences addressed by the Budapest Convention; the lack of official statistics regarding its implementation; and the Convention's allowing states to access data located in another state without the latter's authorisation, thereby violating its sovereignty (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Citation 2021).\nRussia has instead been a longstanding champion for a cybercrime treaty negotiated under the auspices of the UN (Gullo and Rodriguez Citation 2023). Cybercrime discussions at the UN\nwere previously guided through an open-ended Intergovernmental Expert Group to Conduct a Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime (United Nations General Assembly Citation 2011). The UN General Assembly resolution of December 2019 that established the AHC was a culmination of an effort by Russia to lay the diplomatic and procedural groundwork for a successful vote (Lederer Citation 2019; Rowe Citation 2020). In 2018, for example, Russia managed to push through a resolution requiring that the Secretary General collate country perspectives on cybercrime (United Nations General Assembly Citation 2018). Importantly, this resolution was titled 'Countering the use of information and communications technologies for criminal purposes', rather than simply a 'convention on cybercrime'. The 2018 resolution marked a clear and important departure from the way 'cybercrime' had been used in international discussions, especially around the Budapest Convention and also in Expert Group discussions (Hakmeh and Tropina Citation 2021). As the next section highlights, this shift is significant because it correlates to Russia and China seeking an expansive scope for the AHC convention by bringing a broad range of criminal activities within its ambit (Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024).\nWhile Europe, the United States and other like-minded states initially opposed the establishment of the AHC and did not support the Russian proposal, they have since participated actively in various negotiation sessions and intersessional consultations (Lewis and Painter Citation 2023). The AHC negotiations commenced in 2022 with plans originally for at least six negotiating sessions. At the time of writing, all planned negotiating sessions have been completed. No consensus outcome was attained at the originally stipulated concluding session in January 2024 and negotiators requested more time to complete deliberations. Consequently, a final session was scheduled for July-August 2024, during which a draft convention text was agreed upon by all participating countries. A General Assembly vote is expected in December 2024 to formally adopt the treaty (Digi Watch Citation 2024). Civil society groups and human rights campaigns have criticised the final text of the treaty due to insufficient human rights safeguards; its overly broad scope and presentation alongside a General Assembly resolution that could enable the reintroduction of cyber-enabled crimes; threats to security researchers; cementing expansive surveillance powers; enabling extensive data sharing without compatible human rights standards and safeguards and a lack of provisions on government accountability (Article 19 Citation 2024; Rodriquez Citation 2024; Tropina Citation 2024).\nThe Ad Hoc Committee was made up of the representatives of all UN member states and allowed the participation of non-voting private stakeholders, including civil society organisations and technology companies. Footnote 2 The negotiations were divided into eight broad thematic clusters, which ended up as the various operating sections of the final text of the draft convention. These included general provisions, relating to: criminalisation; jurisdiction; procedural measures of cooperation, especially among law enforcement agencies; general measures of international cooperation; preventive measures; and proposals on technical assistance and information exchange as well as mechanisms of implementation.\nAt the first three sessions, states contributed various draft provisions that could be integrated into each cluster. In April and September 2023, states held discussions on a Consolidated Negotiating Document (CND) that was prepared by the Chair.\nWhile Russia and China have been active in all sessions, the former was more active than the latter. At the first AHC session in early 2022, Russia even suggested that the AHC adopt the complete text of a draft convention it first published in 2021. At the second and third sessions, Russia and China made joint proposals, especially on procedural cooperation, which are elaborated upon in the next section. To be sure, while Russia and China have led efforts on proposals challenging the liberal cyber order at the AHC, other countries including Pakistan and Iran have also been vocal about specific concerns, such as removing human rights safeguards within the Convention (Bannelier Citation 2023). While a detailed examination of these efforts is outside the scope of this paper, it is pertinent to note that Russia and China are not working in isolation but often collaborating with a small coalition of states to effect their proposals.\n## 3.1. Data collection and analysis\nThis article's analysis of Russian and Chinese proposals at the AHC is based primarily on a review of six documents containing proposals advanced by participating states prior to each negotiating session at the AHC. The first two documents pertain to proposals advanced separately by Russia (Russia Draft Citation 2021) and China (China Suggestion Citation 2022) at the first AHC negotiating session in February 2022. The subsequent two documents analysed were jointly published by Russia, China and several developing countries in June 2022 (Russia Joint Proposal June Citation 2022) as well as in September 2022. Finally, we reviewed two versions of the Consolidated Negotiating Document (CND) – tabled in April 2023 (Ad Hoc Committee April Citation 2023) and September 2023 Footnote 3 before the AHC – that contain red line-edits to the draft convention made by all negotiating parties. The CND/DTC was tabled by the Chair of the AHC and did not indicate in any way whether red-line edits (or even the text in black letters) were likely to find place in the final draft of the convention. States had the option to reintroduce proposals and object to existing proposals until the final stage of negotiations. Red-line edits made by states or coalitions of states are particularly valuable for our analysis as looking at them helps in attributing specific proposals to states and tracking their evolution. The Chair of the AHC additionally convened informal consultations, closed working groups on certain articles/ clusters of articles and multi-stakeholder consultations. However, as details of these meetings are not on public record, they are not included in our analysis.\nIn addition to proposals tabled at all six negotiation sessions, we also reviewed publicly accessible oral statements made by Russia, China, the United States, the EU and other like-minded countries accessed through the United Nations Web Television (UN WebTV) portal. In all, we reviewed documentary and media sources dating from February 2022 to September 2023.\nFootnote 4 To triangulate our analysis, we consulted secondary literature including media coverage of the negotiations and analyses from blogs and podcasts authored by diplomats, legal practitioners and scholars.\n# 4. Unpacking Chinese and Russian proposals at the AHC\nThis section highlights two sets of Chinese and Russian proposals at the AHC that, by enhancing the territorial capacity of states, attempt to limit strategic operations undertaken by their Western adversaries as well as the ability of influential non-state actors to set global technical standards or advance norms on cybersecurity and human rights. The first set of proposals seek the criminalisation of certain offensive cyber operations against critical information infrastructure (CII) and for the purpose of conducting espionage. Russia and China's goal here is to ensure that the openness of global digital networks do not allow adversaries the operational ability and freedom to execute such operations. A second category of proposals facilitate greater territorial and extra-territorial control of states over data, users and digital infrastructure. They do so not just through an expansive approach to defining crimes in cyberspace, but also through proposals to expand the jurisdiction of states over users and data abroad that are implicated in the commission of a crime in their own territories. These proposals on extra-territorial jurisdiction are complemented by those that relax procedural and human rights safeguards on the cross-border sharing of data between law enforcement agencies.\nTaken in toto, these proposals offer an alternative framework of rules that blunt key attributes of the liberal cyber order highlighted in Section II and consequently limit the inherent advantages enjoyed by Western states and transnational private actors in this order.\nhighlights both sets of proposals, along with the specific provisions or changes Russia and China have sought at various stages of the AHC negotiations.\n# Table 1. Summary of relevant proposals advanced by Russia and China at the AHC.\n# 4.1. Constraining strategic adversaries in cyberspace\nChina and Russia have called on states at the AHC to criminalise cyber operations targeting critical infrastructure as well as cyber-enabled espionage. To be sure, Russia and China have arguably engaged in cyber operations that would fall foul of the same provisions they seek in this regard. Their own acts of commission have not deterred their AHC diplomacy arguably for two reasons. The first explanation is that Russia and China perceive for themselves an exceptional status in an alternative cyber order, in much the same way they routinely accuse the United States and its allies of 'hypocritical' actions that contravene the liberal order (Cai Citation 2019, 160).\nHere, the distinction between the approaches of Russia and China is important. Russia has long sought binding rules against the targeting of critical infrastructure, while its conduct, both through operations undertaken by state agencies and via state-supported private groups, has been in flagrant contradiction to those proposals (Korzak Citation 2021). Moscow, which is more 'confrontational and disruptive' (Broeders, Adamson, and Creemers Citation 2019) towards the liberal cyber order, is apparently comfortable with its simultaneous championing and violation of cybersecurity rules. China, on the other hand, has been less forthcoming with specific proposals for cyberspace and tends more to point out the 'double standards' (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China Citation 2023) of the US, particularly in relation to surveillance and espionage. This distinction, as the following paragraphs show, is reflected in the two countries' degree of willingness to push their proposals at the AHC in the face of opposition – Russia more, China less so. A second, issue-specific explanation is that Russia and China have both turned increasingly towards private actors to undertake disruptive or data-gathering operations (Lonergan Citation 2022; Maurer Citation 2017). In contrast to Western liberal economies, which rely on cyber commands and intelligence agencies that are operationally or institutionally accountable to domestic oversight mechanisms, Russia and China's cyber statecraft is characterised by their reliance on proxies (Giles Citation 2023; Hmaidi Citation 2023; Sherman Citation 2022). Unsurprisingly, their AHC proposals criminalise only the conduct of states, allowing both states to claim plausible deniability for proxy actions and exploit the challenges of legally attributing proxy cyber operations to governments. Chinese and Russian proposals at the AHC specifically take aim against US policies such as 'persistent engagement' and 'defend forward', which seek to disrupt 'malicious cyber activity at its source' through the 'proactive' monitoring of foreign networks by US government agencies (Fischerkeller and Harknett Citation 2019; US Cyber Command Citation 2022).\n## 4.2. Critical infrastructure and cyber operations\nThe protection of CI has been discussed at the UN GGE and OEWG for nearly a decade. In 2015, the UN GGE articulated a norm calling on states to 'not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity' that 'intentionally damaged critical infrastructure or otherwise [impaired]' its use (Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, Citation 2015). Since its publication, several multi-stakeholder and intergovernmental bodies have articulated their own version of the norm, specifying either guidelines around state behaviour with respect to CI or identifying certain sectors as 'critical' and therefore deserving of protection (Kouloufakos Citation 2023). Turning the attention of the UN GGE towards the protection of CI has been a longstanding goal of all major actors involved in the process, but in Russia's case, its proposals should also be viewed in the broader geopolitical context of its diplomacy towards a cybersecurity treaty at the UN (Lilly and Cheravitch Citation 2020).\nMoscow's pursuit of a UN cybersecurity treaty was itself an attempt to constrain the development and use by the US and its allies of cyber offensive capabilities and generally limit the (then) advantages that the latter had in this domain (Croft Citation 2012 ; Demidov and Chernenko Citation 2015 ). The GGE format of discussions was the result of a US-Russia compromise to develop a 'framework of responsible state behaviour' through voluntary guidelines in lieu of a new treaty. The 2015 UN GGE's norm on the protection of CI, however, limited only those actions that would violate a state's obligations under existing international law. In other words, the norm concerned itself exclusively with cyber operations that either qualified as a 'use of force' or otherwise resulted in a major loss of functionality or physical effects (Haataja Citation 2023 ). Intelligence or espionage operations, including those with the intent of embedding themselves within critical infrastructure for the purposes of deploying countermeasures or 'active cyber defence' measures (Broeders Citation 2021 ) would be potentially excluded. The sixth UN GGE in 2021 affirmed this view (Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, Citation 2021 ).\nWith the GGE process not delivering the outcome it hoped for, Russia has since turned its attention towards the AHC. In 2022, the lead Russian negotiator to the UN GGE suggested that 'cybercrime is frequently used to disguise attacks against critical infrastructure [and] undermine [the] political and economic situation of governments' (Ministry of Foreign Affairs Citation 2022). Moscow has sought to criminalise 'unlawful interference' with critical infrastructure and critical information infrastructure (CII) since the first session of AHC negotiations, notwithstanding initial opposition from the US and like-minded countries in the European Union (Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes Citation 2023; \"EU Statement - UN Ad-Hoc Committee for a UN Convention on Cybercrime: Objectives and Scope of the Convention and EEAS.\" Citation 2022). Specifically, the Russian proposal suggests that parties should adopt 'legislative and other measures as are necessary under domestic law' to criminalise the creation of software or other digital information that can interfere with CII to destroy, impede or even copy information contained therein (Russia First Draft Article Citation 10 bis Citation 2021) [emphasis added]. The proposal makes clear that surveillance and intelligence-gathering operations would be covered under its remit. Further, the provision also criminalises non-compliance by private actors with government-issued guidelines related to securing CII if such non-compliance results in an attack or damage to information systems. The effect of this proposal is that multinational companies who supply or operate industrial control systems could also be implicated by domestic penal provisions.\nIn the UNGA First Committee, China too has called on states to refrain from targeting the 'critical infrastructures of other states' (People's Republic of China Citation 2017). Further, China has passed domestic legislation protecting CII, imposing duties and responsibilities on operators (Data Security Law of the People's Republic of China Citation 2021). China's first\nsubmission at the AHC sought to criminalise the ‘intrusion and destruction of ICTs facilities, systems, data or CII’. The Chinese proposal seeks to criminalise not only illegal ‘access’ and ‘interference’ with computer data and ‘information systems’ but also the lesser ‘infringement of critical information infrastructure’ (China Suggestion, Article Citation 3 ( Citation 1 ) Citation 2021 ). The protection of CII is also flagged by several joint Russian and Chinese proposals on international cooperation in the AHC. One such proposal seeks an ‘equal right’ to states for ‘the protection of its information resources and critical information infrastructures from misuse and unauthorised interference’ (Russia Joint Proposal June Citation 2022 , Art. 46 (5)). As the above statements indicate, China and Russia’s emphasis at the AHC is on CII, and not CI per se . While most countries share common perceptions of what constitutes CII (ITU-World Bank Citation 2021 ; Cybersecurity Authority of Singapore Citation 2018 ; Russia First Draft Citation 2021 ), it is still important to distinguish it from critical infrastructure. CII refers to information or communication systems or any other network resources that are by themselves required for discharging ‘vital’ services within a nation or essential to the uninterrupted functioning of critical infrastructure such as industrial control systems. Broad international convergence on many definitional aspects of CII notwithstanding, China’s position in particular – underpinned by its domestic law – is notable in the present context. China’s CII Security Protection Regulations, which took effect in 2021, defines CII to include systems whose ‘data leakage’ may ‘gravely harm’, inter alia , the ‘public interest’ (Data Security Law of the People’s Republic of China Citation 2021 ). In contrast, the EU’s focus, for example, is on the destruction or disruption of such infrastructure. Consistent with Russian proposals (Russia First Draft Citation 2021 , Article 11), and reading China’s AHC proposals alongside its domestic regulation (China’s Suggestion Citation 2021 , Article 3(2)), it would appear that Beijing has pursued a catch-all approach to CII as well as actions targeting such infrastructure that would be proscribed (including surveillance and espionage).\nWhile the Russian proposal on CII was removed in the Draft Text of the Convention (DTC) tabled by the AHC Chair before the Sixth Negotiating Session in September 2023, Moscow proposed its reintroduction into the negotiating process in the final session (Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes Citation 2023 , Article 10 bis). Notably, China did not support Russia's proposal to reintroduce criminal provisions on CII. US agencies assess that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been targeting and compromising US critical infrastructure potentially to leverage such access during conflict (United States Department of Defense Citation 2023 ; Washington Post Citation 2023 ). If accurate, these assessments would partly explain China's reluctance to push harder for criminal penalties against compromising CII through a cybercrime treaty. There is also the important consideration, noted at the beginning of this article, of China's global economic interests in cyberspace which outstrip those of Russia. China arguably would consider itself better off with some cybercrime treaty than none at all, which Russia's maximalist bargaining threatened to do at various stages of the AHC.\n## 4.3. Cyber-enabled espionage\nA related issue on which China and Russia have both floated AHC proposals is espionage. The issue of cyber-enabled espionage has been the proverbial ‘elephant in the room’ as far as international cybersecurity discussions are concerned (Broeders Citation 2024). Save for the US—China cybersecurity agreement that proscribed espionage for economic purposes (Yoo Citation 2015), there are no major international agreements that address the issue, either in terms of legal provisions or normative guardrails. On the other hand, China and Russia have sought to use the AHC negotiations on cybercrime to address cross-border espionage. To be sure, the Budapest Convention calls on states to criminalise electronic ‘interception without right’ that is committed ‘intentionally’. States could also require commission with ‘dishonest intent’ (Budapest Convention Citation 2001, Article 3) for criminality. However, as scholars have noted, the Budapest Convention only addresses the criminality of individual actions, and therefore is limited in addressing state espionage (Crootof Citation 2019; Rowe Citation 2020).\nIn contrast, China proposed at the AHC negotiations to hold states accountable for the interception of data (China Suggestion, Article Citation 4 (Citation 1) Citation 2022). The proposal read:\nStates shall not directly collect the data stored in foreign states from enterprises or individuals by technical means bypassing network security protection measures if such measures are against the laws of that foreign state.\nThe proposal not only highlighted a restriction on state activity, but also specifically emphasised the need to shield ‘enterprises and individuals’ from espionage activities. The Budapest Convention, in comparison, only refers to interception ‘to and from’ computer systems. While cyber operations that ‘bypass network security protection measures’ could refer to both disruptive operations as well as cyber-enabled espionage, China’s proposal should be read in the context of its domestic measures aimed at countering espionage. In 2023, China revised its counter-espionage law to include expansively the protection of ‘documents, data, materials and items related to national security and interests’ (Zhang Citation 2023). The revision specifically emphasised cyber operations, whether destructive or intelligence-gathering in nature, that targeted critical information infrastructure and ‘confidential-related units’ within state organs in China. The objective of the revised law is ostensibly to discourage multinational corporations and their employees from collaborating with foreign spy agencies (Marsh and Waldersee Citation 2023; Reuters Citation 2023) and has even resulted in the detention of a foreign national accused of spying (Global Times Citation 2023a; Global Times Citation 2023b). The geopolitical context is especially significant: in light of Chinese attempts to isolate itself from much of the world in the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, Western intelligence agencies have publicly emphasised the need to build ‘strong human intelligence capability’ in the country (Barnes and Wong Citation 2023; CGTN Citation 2023). Through its AHC proposal,\nChina sought not only to secure an international commitment that mirrored its domestic law but ultimately to provide it the legal imprimatur to thwart and deter US and Western intelligence operations that undermine its geopolitical or geoeconomic interests (Azcarate Citation 2023). Meanwhile, Beijing itself has reportedly leaned on proxy actors who make use of increasingly sophisticated methods for cyber espionage, that gives it greater room for deniability. Take for instance, the use by Chinese actors of disaggregate, compromised nodes such as private servers and IoT devices that make attribution to a single group or entity challenging (Raggi Citation 2024).\nRussia's original proposal tabled at the first AHC session similarly sought to criminalise the use of 'technical means to intercept traffic data and data processed by means of ICT that are not intended for public use' (Russia First Draft Citation 2021, Article 7). This is similar to the formulation in the Budapest Convention, although it is slightly modified to stipulate that interception carried out without 'appropriate authorisation' or in 'violation of established rules' should be unlawful. The Budapest Convention's formulation on interception, as noted previously, is more permissive towards espionage and only proscribes those operations conducted 'without right' by another state. Russia's standard is narrower, and allows for states to determine by domestic regulation what constitutes 'inappropriate' interception.\n## 4.4. Enhancing sovereign capacity against domestic and extraterritorial threats\nA second set of AHC proposals by Russia and China seeks to enhance the ability of governments to 'detect, suppress, investigate and prosecute' criminal activities – designated so by domestic law – within their own territories but also abroad (DTC September 2023, Article 1(1); Russia First Draft Citation 2021, Article 31). The latter objective has been sought through procedural measures that ease access to electronic evidence located in other countries and the dilution of human rights safeguards, especially in relation to the handling of data transferred between states. In promoting these proposals, China and Russia's overarching goal is arguably to limit the power of multinational technology companies as well as civil society organisations and coalitions, which are mainly based in, or draw their market strength or legitimacy from, advanced liberal economies. As highlighted previously, the effect of these proposals would be to limit the technical standard or policy-setting capacity of influential private actors on data governance and security, such as encryption and data storage. Admittedly, these proposals would also limit the ability of Chinese and Russian companies to set standards and shape policy. This outcome is in line with the heightened degrees of control, both from a policy and corporate governance perspective, that both states have exerted over their major technology players in recent years (Zhang Citation 2024).\nWe study six sets of proposals within this broader category (see) that advance this objective.\n## 4.5. Addressing ‘cyber-enabled’ crimes\nThe first category of proposals pertains to the types of crimes that can be prosecuted through the AHC convention. Both states have sought the criminalisation of ‘cyber-enabled’ crimes, i.e. crimes that have an ICT component relevant to their commission, as opposed to ‘cyber-dependent’ crimes, which fit more the traditional ‘CIA’ crimes – targeted by the Budapest Convention – that affect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of systems (Wilkinson Citation 2023). Many of these cyber-enabled crimes relate to the publication of online content, which is tightly regulated in authoritarian states. The AHC’s title itself – a committee to elaborate a treaty on ‘the use of ICTs for criminal purposes’ – was the effort of Russian resolutions at the UN General Assembly (Wilkinson Citation 2023). Non-government organizations (NGOs) and civil society organisations have not only decried the inclusion of content-related crimes as posing a ‘heightened risk’ (Privacy International and Electronic Frontier Foundation Citation 2022) to the exercise of human rights but also as impeding the work of journalists or whistle-blowers (Electronic Frontier Foundation Citation 2022). Russia and China have sought also to criminalise, respectively, ‘digital data to mislead the user’ and the ‘dissemination of false information’ (Martin Citation 2023), although these proposals have generated concern among industry and civil society (Bannelier Citation 2023). Neither formulation appears to have made it to the final rounds of negotiations. Russia, along with a number of developing countries, also proposed an all-encompassing clause to ensure the cybercrime treaty did not ‘preclude a State Party from establishing as an offence any other unlawful act committed intentionally with the use of information and communication technologies that causes significant damage’, which remains a legally ambiguous threshold (DTC September 2023, Art. 15 undecies). Targeting a broad range of ‘cyber-enabled crimes’ mirrors domestic criminal law provisions in both China and Russia and has been viewed by some experts as a means of legitimising and exporting their domestic governance models (Iyengar, Gamer and Rathi Citation 2023). Instrumentally, China’s focus has been on crimes faced by its own law enforcement agencies (Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024). Wider criminal provisions in domestic law and international treaty law boost state authority to assert control over individuals and companies that use cyberspace.\n## 4.6. Provisions on mutual legal assistance, human rights, jurisdiction and non-state actors\nBeyond seeking an expansive scope for the cybercrime treaty, we identify five areas where China and Russia have pushed for greater power for states to regulate digital activities at home and abroad. First, Russia has sought through the AHC convention to limit exemptions and safeguards against mutual legal assistance (MLA) requests by a state. These include rejecting clauses that allow states to refuse MLA requests for the prosecution of political offences (DTC September 2023, Art. 40 Clause 21 (c) bis) or those motivated by a ‘person's sex, race, language, religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinions’ (DTC September 2023, Art. 40 Clause 21 (c) ter).\nSecond, both China and Russia have advocated procedural reforms to domestic criminal law that would enable the easier prosecution of crimes committed through the use of ICTs. Russia has sought to ‘ensure that electronic evidence derived or extracted from [any ICT] shall have the probative value in criminal procedure’ (DTC September 2023, Article 30 bis). China and Russia have suggested that states should establish ‘relevant legal procedures and technical standards for the collection, retention and provision of electronic evidence to ensure the authenticity, integrity and legality of electronic evidence’ (DTC September 2023, Article 30 ter).\nThird, these states have, along with others, sought to limit human rights safeguards against the prosecution of cybercrime. Russia has objected to several proposals that introduce human rights safeguards against criminal prosecution, including in the case of ‘persons and groups in vulnerable situations’ (DTC September 2023, Article 5(2)). Moscow has also rejected a proposal to include the effective protection of human rights as a key element of cross-border technical assistance and capacity-building (DTC September 2023, Article 54). While China has not backed Russia on the proposal to remove human rights safeguards altogether, it has resisted attempts to introduce oversight mechanisms or limitations in the way governments can process and retain personal data transferred between states under the AHC convention (DTC September 2023, Article 36 sub-clause 2). Russia has also sought the use of the term ‘unlawful’ across the Consolidated Negotiation Text of the AHC draft to refer to specific acts that invite criminal prosecution. In contrast, the US, EU and like-minded countries prefer the phrase ‘without right’, which is more commonly used in the Budapest Convention. This distinction is important: ‘unlawful’ actions would be determined solely on the basis of domestic legislation, whereas the more permissive formulation ‘without right’ acknowledges the universal legitimacy of certain actions, such as accessing a free and open public computer system, instituting ‘protection activities’ (such as stronger encryption or cybersecurity safeguards) with the permission of those involved in transmitting data, or those actions taken in the pursuit of human rights such as privacy or free expression (Budapest Convention Citation 2001).\nFourth, Russia and China’s efforts to regulate extraterritorial activity go beyond proposals for expansive MLA. Notably, Russia has sought to extend states’ jurisdiction to cases in which ‘the offence is committed wholly or partly outside [their territory] but its effect in the territory [would] constitute an offence or result in the commission of an offense’ (DTC September 2023, Art. 22 sub-clause 2 c bis). Similarly, Russia has sought automatic jurisdiction for states if the ‘offence is committed against the State Party’ (DTC September 2023, Article 22 sub-clause 2 d). China has qualified its support to Russia’s invocation of the ‘effects doctrine’ Footnote ⁵ (Estey Citation 1997). Jurisdiction, in China’s view, should be based on a ‘true and sufficient’ link with criminal activities, giving priority to the place where the consequence of criminal activity occurs, where it is committed and the location of the perpetrator (China Suggestion Citation 3 (Citation 7) Citation 2022).\nFinally, both states have sought explicit control over internet service providers by national agencies. Such proposals have been an integral part of all Russian and Chinese drafts and contributions made to the AHC over six negotiating sessions. In its first draft proposal submitted to the AHC, Russia included two articles that specifically address the role of the private sector and ISPs, and also sought a code of conduct for their governance (Russian Federation Citation 2021, Article 43). China's proposals, while not as extensive, require companies and service providers to 'take technical measures and other necessary measures to effectively respond to criminal activities' (China's Suggestion Citation 2022, Article 3 (6)). Notably, both states have sought the criminalisation of the 'unlawful provision of service', understood as the providing of essentially any digitally-enabled service with 'the intent that the service or technical support be used for the commission of any of the offences' (DTC September 2023, Article 10 ter). Presumably, the service provider's 'intent' in this case would be discerned by states themselves, which enables the prosecution of any service provider that does not restrict internet services to communities or geographic areas proscribed by the state. Given the broad scope of offences that Russia and China, along with other authoritarian regimes, want to criminalise, this proposal could severely restrict the scope of operation of Virtual Private Networks or even secure messaging platforms that are set up with the intention of enabling secure and private communication away from the gaze of the state. These proposals are notable and offer important context to what China sees as the role of ISPs in 'decentralised internet infrastructure' models that it has floated at standards bodies.\nRussia's push for greater control over extraterritorial activity also throws into relief its original justification for not signing the Budapest Convention. Moscow has long expressed concerns over Article 32 of the Budapest Convention because it enables cross-border law enforcement access to territorial data without authorisation from the respective State Party. At the AHC negotiations, Russia has proposed that all cooperation under the cybercrime convention happens exclusively with the authorisation of State Parties. The cumulative effect of Russia's proposals would be that states become the sole arbiters of cross-border data access, but also have few procedural safeguards or human rights restrictions to refuse sharing data with other governments.\n# 5. Cybercrime negotiations and the future of the liberal cyber order\nRussia and China's proposals at the AHC reflect their efforts to shape systemically the governance of cyberspace, away from its liberal underpinnings. They attempt to reconfigure the norms and rules governing international relations in cyberspace by casting the territorial state as its main actor. Much like Western states have benefitted from a liberal order rooted in the dilution of the territorial state and the delegation of key cyberspace governance functions to private actors\n(Farrell and Newman Citation 2021), Russia and China seek geopolitical advantages from the alternative order they propose.\nDraft measures on the protection of CII and the criminalisation of cyber-enabled espionage constrain the freedom that Western intelligence agencies and commands enjoy in cyberspace for information-gathering and disruptive operations. On the other hand, stronger control over online content and the activities of digital services providers as well as weaker procedural and substantive safeguards on cross-border data-sharing between governments ensure that states can regulate private actors at home and also exert control over the data of users and entities held abroad (Harvey and Moore Citation 2022). The goal of these proposals is to limit the autonomy and influence of (mostly) Western technology companies in determining data flows and cybersecurity outcomes through their in-house policies and technical standards (Klonick Citation 2017).\nRussia and China's pursuit of an alternative cyber order is backed by several statements on issues discussed in the paper. While a detailed examination of these statements and strategies is outside the scope of this paper, we highlight a few notable examples. Beijing's repeated references to the US's 'empire of hacking' (Reuters Citation 2023) and Moscow's claims of US targeting critical infrastructure for subversive 'political and economic' operations suggest that their proposals at the AHC are motivated by overarching geopolitical motives, rather than by narrow domestic ones (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Citation 2022). Further, both countries have tried to use the platform of the AHC to promote their model among developing countries through language referencing the need for a systemic shift in cyberspace governance. China has declared that the AHC treaty should 'adjust [to] and create new contours for ensuring the security of states' (China Intervention Sixth Session Morning, UN Web TV 2023, 01:01:00 to 01:07:00). This messaging has been emphasised repeatedly by the Russian delegation as well. An article written by the Deputy Head of the Russian delegation amidst the AHC negotiations argued that the 'prospects for the global digitalisation process as a whole, the effectiveness and dynamics which depend on ensuring security, are in question' (Chernukhin Citation 2023).\nIndeed, Russia and China's diplomatic strategies at the AHC appear to exploit the Global South's 'discontent' against the LIO (Endaylalu Citation 2022). Both states have argued that debates on human rights are manufactured by states (liberal economies) who seek to 'retain their dominant position in the information sphere' at the cost of 'practical cooperation' on cybercrime (Russian Federation Citation 2022). In other words, the messaging here is not that human rights are bad, but that developing nations have more urgent priorities which are not highlighted in the current order. Relatedly, both states have also underlined the need for new rules to prosecute cybercrime, appealing to the deeply felt sentiment among African and Asian countries to be norm-makers and not norm-takers (Acharya Citation 2011). China's opening intervention at AHC negotiations stressed that including 'cyber-enabled crimes' in the cybercrime treaty is a way of ensuring that international law kept 'pace with the trends' (China, Intervention Sixth Session Morning, UN\nWeb TV 2023, 01:01:00 to 01:07:00). Russia has emphasised the fact that many countries stayed away from the Budapest Convention because they were not involved in its creation (Seger Citation 2016), denouncing the instrument as having failed to win the 'minds and hearts' of the developing world (Chernukhin Citation 2023).\nAs illustrates, Russia and China's own cyber diplomacy at the AHC has received steady support from some of its allies, but many developing countries and emerging powers (Chivvis and Geaghan-Breiner Citation 2024) have largely remained silent in response.\n# Table 2. States' responses to China and Russia's proposals at September 2023 negotiations.\nThe Draft Text of Convention (DTC) circulated by the AHC's chair in September 2023 omitted several proposals from China and Russia, especially on the scope and coverage of 'cyber-enabled crimes' as well as protection of CII. However, Russia attempted to reinsert all those proposals back into the DTC as red-line edits. China, as has illustrated, appears to have been less persistent in terms of reintroducing its original proposals. China's more moderate approach, as indicated in the first half of this paper, arguably reflects its heightened economic stake in cyberspace, compared to Russia's all-or-nothing strategy. Further, Russia's approach to the AHC negotiations reflects its strategy in the UN GGE and UN OEWG, where it scoped out similarly maximalist positions before engaging in last-minute, backroom deals to secure consensus within both groups. Chinese cyber diplomacy generally tends to avoid such grand bargains, and in the AHC appears to have prioritised some of its proposals over others.\nRegardless of their outcomes, it is clear from Russia and China's proposals that both states view the proposed AHC convention on cybercrime as an opportunity to chart new rules for the road for cyberspace. In a domain characterised mainly by informal norms of responsible behaviour and technical standards – a consequence of the liberal ordering of cyberspace – both states have arguably found it difficult to challenge the economic and normative clout of major private actors and to constrain the strategic advantages of powerful Western adversaries. They have sought consequently to use the prospective AHC treaty to usher in a cyber order that lends primacy to the territorial state – not only to govern domestic digital activity but also to shape international data flows and the use of offensive cyber capabilities.\n# Acknowledgement\nThe authors thank Isabella Wilkinson for comments on a previous draft of this article.\n# Disclosure statement\nThe authors report that there are no competing interests to declare."

      "flat_text": "# ABSTRACT\nCyberspace is still characterised by features that draw from the liberal international order into which it was born: namely, open data flows and multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms that allow private actors to shape global technical or normative standards. The application of this 'liberal cyber order' has been resisted by Russia and China who seek a greater role for the territorial state in cyberspace governance. They have long sought new, binding rules to this effect with little success. The UN cybercrime convention bucks the trend of informal, non-binding agreements in this domain. Through an empirical analysis of proposals advanced by Russia and China during negotiations toward the cybercrime convention, this article demonstrates how they have sought to use it to develop rules that blunt the advantages enjoyed by Western liberal economies and major transnational actors in the current order. Going beyond the regulation of cybercrime, Russian and Chinese proposals empower states to thwart disruptive and intelligence-gathering cyber operations that may be conducted globally by Western adversaries. Additionally, they enhance the state's regulatory capacity over private actors at home and abroad, limiting the ability of businesses or NGOs to shape cybersecurity and human rights standards around the transfer, retention and access of data.\n# KEYWORDS:\n- Cybercrime treaty\n- cyber sovereignty\n- liberal international order\n- cybersecurity governance\n# 1. Introduction\nWhat kind of global governance regime do China and Russia seek for cyberspace? As authoritarian states with strong restrictions on the online activities of individuals, businesses and NGOs, do they simply seek greater autonomy to regulate digital technologies in their territory without foreign intervention? China and Russia have been robustly engaged, for over two decades, in discussions on internet governance at the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) (Murgia and Gross Citation 2020; Yoo Citation 2023), regional cooperative institutions and multi-stakeholder entities such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) (Kennedy Citation 2013; Negro Citation 2020; Yan Citation 2015). Chinese and Russian proposals advanced at these forums have the effect of increasing states' capacity to manage the territorial conduct of private actors.\nThe proposals advanced by both states at international forums also signal their geopolitical interests in cyberspace. Discussions on international cybersecurity in the UN General Assembly's First Committee, where Russia and China have competed with the 'like-minded' Footnote 1 countries led by the United States and European Union on specific proposals, throw into relief those interests (Basu, Poetranto, and Lau Citation 2021; Tiirmaa-Klaar Citation 2021). Through their First Committee proposals, Russia and China have sought to limit the ability of Western adversaries to engage in offensive cyber operations against their digital assets and infrastructure, and simultaneously to legitimize their own strategies and practices (for example, their increasing use of proxies or 'cyber mercenaries') (Maurer Citation 2017; Sukumar Citation 2017).\nBy dint of institutional design and the fragmented nature of the cyber 'regime complex' (Nye Citation 2014), discussions on internet governance, cybercrime and norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace have hitherto taken place across a number of international forums. This fragmentation has occluded from analysis a complete picture of the systemic changes that Russia and China pursue for the governance of cyberspace. Given that they are major cyber powers, it is important to understand whether and why both states seek to influence how other states govern territorial networks to advance their own broader geopolitical and geoeconomic ambitions for the domain. For instance, China and Russia would want for other states to have greater agency over domestic networks, whether for the purpose of requesting them to thwart Western cyber operations, curtail the growing influence of Western technology companies whom they see as proxies of the US or its allies, or clamp down on foreign voices and institutions critical of them. Conversely, implementing tougher restrictions on online activity at home may often require China and Russia to seek data from abroad for investigative and prosecutorial purposes. For such data requests to succeed, states must not only be aligned on what counts as criminal activity in cyberspace, there should also be few procedural hurdles for interstate data transfers. These objectives require a major reconfiguration of the way in which states currently engage with each other in cyberspace, and with private actors both domestically and internationally.\nTo be sure, Russian and Chinese objectives for cyberspace governance differ in important respects. As Flonk notes, Russia relies more on policy-oriented measures to regulate internet infrastructure, users and networks than China, where technical infrastructure such as the Great Chinese Firewall allows for a high degree of centralisation over content control and platforms governance (Flonk Citation 2021). Secondly, with significantly higher economic stakes in cyberspace, China's geopolitical outlook differs somewhat from Russia's. China's cyber diplomacy and proposals are driven by a desire to support Chinese technology companies while seeking a significant degree of state control over ICT activities at home and abroad. Russia, on the other hand, does not have a significant domestic technology industry and is therefore arguably less concerned about the geoeconomic consequences of its cyber diplomacy (Broeders, Adamson, and Creemers Citation 2019). Finally, China is more selective than Russia in the execution of cyber operations. While Moscow undertakes a broad range of disruptive and\ndestructive cyber operations, including those aimed at systemic political destabilisation, Beijing has restricted itself to undertaking operations that incrementally advance its economic or security objectives. The difference could be attributed to the blowback that Chinese industry and states agencies would face as good-faith participants and key influencers of standards development (Russel and Berger Citation 2021) and digital markets were they to undertake cyber operations that cause widespread instability or degrade the availability of global internet services.\nThese differences notwithstanding, scholars have long highlighted the strong convergence of views between Russia and China in their ideological opposition to the liberal international order and to its application to cyberspace. This ‘liberal cyber order’ is marked not only by substantive norms that govern state behaviour in cyberspace but also by who sets those norms (Rovner Citation 2023). Open data flows, multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms and deference to the exercise of civil, political and economic liberties online constitute the defining characteristics of the liberal cyber order, whose influence on the internet is historical and still discernible (Deibert and Crete-Nishihata Citation 2012; Farrell and Newman Citation 2021; Hollis and Raustiala Citation 2022). In geopolitical terms, this order privileges liberal democracies and their constituents – in particular the United States and its trans-Atlantic allies who have helped incubate the growth of the internet since its early years – as rule-shapers (Farrell and Newman Citation 2021, Citation 2024). China and Russia are united in their goal to ‘reform the liberal cyber order’ (Wu Citation 2021), which includes upending liberal norms (Flonk Citation 2021) as well as the institutional governance mechanisms that are its mainstay (Raymond and Sherman Citation 2024). China and Russia are not the only actors who seek a ‘post-liberal cyberspace’ (Barrinha and Renard Citation 2020), but they are certainly its most powerful proponents, and frequent fellow travellers in diplomatic forums.\nThis article highlights Russian and Chinese efforts to orchestrate such a systemic reform or reconfiguration of the liberal cyber order through the proposed cybercrime convention currently negotiated by an Ad Hoc Committee (AHC) of the United Nations. While the AHC was established to develop a binding international instrument for states to tackle cybercrime – in official terms, counter the ‘use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) for criminal purposes’ – we show that Russia and China have sought for it to regulate activities that go well beyond the treaty’s intended scope. Their proposals, as this article empirically demonstrates, not only address cybercrime, but also implicate international cybersecurity governance and cross-border data access.\nChinese and Russian proposals at the AHC push for states to have greater control over digital infrastructure and activities. As this article's review of the literature highlights, this is consistent with longstanding Chinese and Russian views on cyberspace governance. Nonetheless, the AHC negotiations also demonstrate that their championing of 'cyber sovereignty' (Creemers Citation 2020; Stadnik Citation 2021; Thumfart Citation 2021; Zeng, Stevens, and Chen Citation 2017) is oriented towards specific objectives that in turn reveal China and Russia's aspirations towards\nsystemic changes in cyberspace governance. Their proposals empower the territorial state to regulate certain cyber operations of geopolitical concern to China and Russia. In the guise of addressing cybercrime, they also allow states to shape policies and standards on the storage and security of data, to exert control over digital activities abroad that bear on territorial concerns, and to fashion the governance of cross-border data flows as an exclusively intergovernmental prerogative with few procedural or human rights safeguards. Taken together, these proposals undermine key tenets of the liberal cyber order, that, through open networks and digital markets, have conferred geopolitical and geoeconomic advantages to liberal democracies and transnational actors based largely in Western states. Indeed, we present these findings as helping to advance a theoretical frontier in the literature on Chinese and Russian approaches to cyberspace governance. Whereas extant analyses (see Section 2) have shone a spotlight on the domestic and global impact of China and Russia's sovereignty-centric proposals, newer scholarship has begun to examine the order-level consequences of such proposals. China and Russia, these scholars note, foreground the territorial state in cyberspace for explicitly systemic objectives (Wu Citation 2021) and have attempted 'hegemonic socialisation', i.e. persuading states who are likely to agree to order-level changes (Hulvey Citation 2021, Citation 2022). Meanwhile, the order-level impact of their proposals has been clearly acknowledged and addressed as such by states like Brazil and India (Basu Citation 2024; Paulus Citation 2024), whose support is crucial for any major change to the liberal cyber order.\nAnalysing cybercrime proposals by Russia and China contextually and holistically is also important because their presentation before the AHC itself cannot be considered coincidental or opportunistic. The AHC negotiations are expressly oriented towards a treaty, in contrast to the non-binding, voluntary 'norms' on responsible behaviour that have hitherto guided interstate engagement in this domain. Moscow and Beijing have long sought to set multilateral rules not only for international cybersecurity (Levinson Citation 2021) but also for internet governance, mainly via the ITU (Radu and Gregorio Citation 2023). Those efforts have thus far not succeeded (Grigsby Citation 2017). Attempts by both states to promote technical standards that allow for greater state control over the governance of critical internet resources have not yet gained currency in multi-stakeholder forums that set standards for the internet (Hogeveen Citation 2022). Given the backdrop of 'pervasive informality' (Sukumar, Broeders, and Kello Citation 2024) in intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder models of cyberspace governance, the AHC provides a rare avenue for Russia and China to shoehorn their proposals into an instrument that binds the conduct of states.\nAt the time of writing, a draft convention text has been agreed upon by all participating states at the AHC. The final convention is expected to be adopted at a formal General Assembly vote later in 2024 (UNODC Citation 2024). As our empirical findings reveal, several proposals by Russia and China were rejected in earlier versions of the AHC draft text, while some others were reintroduced by either state in later stages of negotiation. Even if those proposals fail to gain\nacceptance, their tabling, and in some cases, persistent diplomatic efforts to push them through, indicate the importance both states attach to them, and their contribution to systemic reordering in cyberspace.\nSection 2 reviews the literature on Chinese and Russian approaches to cyberspace governance, framed against the backdrop of their broader challenge to the liberal international order. This section highlights why it is important to study their AHC proposals within this broader context, and why Russia and China have specifically sought the AHC to float those proposals. Section 3 offers a background to the cybercrime negotiations and explains how the article collected and reviewed data on Chinese and Russian AHC proposals. Section 4 forms the empirical core of this paper. It highlights various AHC proposals made by both states, dividing them into two broad categories that reflect the essence of their challenge to the liberal cyber order: one, proposals to constrain the actions of strategic Western adversaries who benefit from open digital networks, and two, proposals to enhance territorial and extraterritorial control over private actors.\n## 2. China and Russia’s challenge to the liberal cyber order\nInternational order refers to the ‘explicit principles, rules, and institutions’ that manage and reflect ‘core relationships’ and ‘settled expectations’ between states (Ikenberry Citation 2001). The liberal international order is broadly premised on three elements: freer trade and security cooperation that is based on predictable and recognised rules, cooperation through multilateral institutions that is increasingly shifting to informal mechanisms, and the progressive growth of liberal democratic values and institutional arrangements across societies (Acharya Citation 2017; Ikenberry Citation 2010). Applying the liberal domestic values of ‘predictability, access, and representation’ to international politics (Deudney and Ikenberry Citation 1999), the LIO allows private actors – especially with transnational interests such as corporations and NGOs – to engage and seek direct representation in rules, norms or institutions (Handreider Citation 1978; Moravcsik Citation 2003; Scherer et al. Citation 2006).\nIn recent years, international relations scholarship has extensively debated the challenge posed by ‘revisionist’ powers like Russia and China to the LIO across regimes such as international security, trade and climate (Johnston Citation 2019; Lake, Martin, and Risse Citation 2021; Weiss and Wallace Citation 2021; Zürn Citation 2018). The nature of Chinese and Russian challenges to the LIO differ substantially. China, according to Goddard (Citation 2018), is a ‘bridging revisionist’ that is likely to use the existing international economic and political order to foment ‘rule-based revolution’, i.e. to transform existing rules over time to those more disposed to its interests. If its geoeconomic diplomacy in particular is any indication, China does not seek an overhaul of the LIO, but ‘prefers a more conservative version that emphasises Westphalian norms of sovereignty and non-interference’ (Weiss and Wallace Citation 2021). Russia, with fewer economic stakes in the LIO, has been more inclined to test its limits through ‘violent\naction' (Goddard Citation 2018) in contravention of basic tenets of the UN Charter and modern international relations. The outcomes of their challenges to the LIO depend in large measure on the approaches of emerging powers – with some of whom the liberal order still resonates ideologically or economically, despite their differences with the hegemon, the United States (Efstathopoulos Citation 2021). In this regard, Russia and China's joint emphasis on ‘hollowing out’ the LIO into its constitutive sovereignty elements (Johnston Citation 2019) – the sovereign equality of states, treaty-based agreements in lieu of informal agreements, consent-based dispute settlement mechanisms – may appeal to a broader audience, including emerging powers (Dugard Citation 2023).\nThe challenge posed by Russia and China to the LIO presents a necessary context to the understanding of ‘cyber ordering’ or the organisation of relations between states in cyberspace (Kello Citation 2017). As Barrinha and Renard note, cyberspace was itself the creation of the liberal order – characterised by open networks as well as private and decentralised governance (Barrinha and Renard Citation 2020). As is now widely acknowledged, various aspects of the cyber order have faced contestation from state and non-state actors in recent decades, resulting in a ‘retreat of liberal values’ (Barrinha and Renard Citation 2020; Deibert and Rohozinski Citation 2011; Mueller Citation 2017). As powerful nation states, China and Russia present the most potent challenge to the order. The remainder of this section reviews extant scholarship that analyses the Chinese and Russian challenge to the liberal cyber order, with a particular focus on cybersecurity governance. Then it highlights why studying proposals at the AHC negotiations offer a clearer picture of the alternative framework of rules that Russia and China want in cyberspace.\n## 2.1. Russian and Chinese approaches to global cybersecurity governance\nWe identify three strands of scholarship examining China and Russia’s approach to cybersecurity governance. The first strand includes conceptual and empirical assessments of the notion of cyber sovereignty, deployed discursively by both countries in domestic and international settings. This body of scholarship offers important insights into the evolution of domestic policy discourse and legislation by China and Russia to attain ‘cyber sovereignty’ and ‘information security’ respectively, two related concepts that have been at the crux of both countries’ approaches to the governance of cyberspace.\nChina’s evocation of ‘cyber sovereignty’ as a policy goal can be traced back to the 2010 White Paper on the internet in China published by the state council, the country’s apex administrative body (Information Office of the State Council Citation 2010). The concept has since made an appearance in speeches by China’s political leadership as well as its international cyberspace strategy (People’s Republic of China Citation 2017). Tracing its discursive evolution over the years, scholars have distilled ‘cyber sovereignty’ into two main components (Creemers Citation 2020; Fung Citation 2022). The first constitutive element is the core role of the state in\n'information management' (Fung Citation 2022), mainly by asserting territorial control over both domestic and foreign non-state actors. Such control may be exerted through technical measures or regulations around online activities within its jurisdiction (Deibert Citation 2015; Qiao-Franco Citation 2024). Control over the information environment is also exerted by facilitating a shift in global internet governance away from multi-stakeholder processes to articulate policy or technical standards towards intergovernmental processes under the auspices of the UN (Creemers Citation 2020; Fung Citation 2022).\nThe second constitutive element of cyber sovereignty is the equality of states in cyberspace (Zeng, Stevens, and Chen Citation 2017) which China has framed primarily in terms of the right to non-interference in a state's internal affairs. On the other hand, Russia's policy discourse on 'information security' has a longer lineage, but is essentially aligned with many of the aforesaid goals of China. First articulated in the 2000 Doctrine on Information Security, this concept is presented as a 'triad' of state, society and individual interests, whose protection from internal and external threats is ultimately the remit of the government (Stadnik Citation 2021). Over time, Russian controls over digital networks have mimicked Chinese measures (Weber Citation 2017). Such measures in Russia include online content filtering, mandatory data localisation, protection of critical information infrastructure and the 2019 Law on the Russian segment of the internet that aims to ward off external threats through centralised internet traffic routing and a national domain name system (Hakala and Melnchyuk Citation 2021; Stadnik Citation 2021). Russia has also sought the development of a legally-binding instrument for cyberspace, and to restrain states from weaponizing 'information to undermine the political, economic and social system' of others (Korzak Citation 2021).\nChina and Russia's pursuit of cyber sovereignty and information security is largely animated by the survival of its political institutions and the quest for social stability. However, there is also an important global dimension to these concepts, which the second strand of scholarship unpacks (Barrinha and Turner Citation 2024; Flonk, Jachtenfuchs, and Obendiek Citation 2020; Gao Citation 2022; Jiang Citation 2010; Nocetti Citation 2015). Analyses of Chinese and Russian proposals made at international forums have highlighted their substantive impact on users, businesses and NGOs as well as inter-state relations. Beijing and Moscow have emerged as entrepreneurs of 'illiberal norms' (Flonk Citation 2021), relating mainly to the control of online content and the governance of digital platforms, in venues such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), BRICS and the UN. Their proposals also contribute to the creation of 'sovereignty spheres', where states articulate policy and set standards on online content and internet governance, often superseding global, multi-stakeholder processes (Flonk, Jachtenfuchs, and Obendiek Citation 2020). Why would other states that have benefited from global standards opt into such sovereignty enclaves? Simmons and Hulvey note that states are 'anxious [of being] overwhelmed by global forces', among which the internet figures prominently (Simmons and Hulvey Citation 2022). Facing a 'sovereign identity crisis' in the age of the internet, they\nargue, states develop ‘border orientation preferences’ to ensure digital policies mirror the governance of territorial boundaries (Simmons and Hulvey Citation 2022). In this way, they try to ensure state-society relations are not destabilised by globalisation or open information flows.\nFinally, a third strand of scholarship examines how China and Russia engage tactically with norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace (Creemers Citation 2021; Fung Citation 2022; Raymond and Sherman Citation 2024). This literature has contributed significantly to the study of ‘cyber diplomacy’ by major powers and non-state actors. It focuses especially on the diplomatic rhetoric and narratives (Barrinha and Turner Citation 2024; Hansel Citation 2023) deployed by Moscow and Beijing to bolster support for their proposals (Fung Citation 2022), as well as their gaming of multilateral negotiation procedures – supporting consensus-based agreements, limiting private participation, ‘stack[ing] the deck’ with illiberal initiatives (Raymond and Sherman Citation 2024) – for the same purpose.\nTo summarise, China and Russia’s engagement with cybersecurity governance is characterised in the literature as driven mainly by the pursuit of cyber sovereignty, i.e. the enhancement of the state’s capacity to govern territorial networks and digital assets. The most conspicuous tool deployed in the pursuit of cyber sovereignty is online content control. Both states have engaged in diplomatic efforts to export their model of cyber sovereignty, especially to developing countries. The emergence of ‘sovereignty spheres’ akin to China and Russia, scholars point out, is likely to cause the ‘fragmentation’ of the liberal cyber order (Flonk, Jachtenfuchs, and Obendiek Citation 2020). Fragmentation, as per existing literature, could refer either to the fragmentation of regulatory regimes across jurisdictions, including liberal economies (Bradford Citation 2023), or to the technical splintering of the internet into non-interoperable, territorial networks (Drake, Cerf, and Kleinwachter Citation 2016). Pertinently, Mueller cautions against exaggerating the prospect of the technical fragmentation of the internet (Mueller Citation 2017, 17, 18). Fragmentation, he notes, is possible only if a critical mass of internet-users defect from the global internet, establishing technical incompatibilities that could sustain multiple ‘internets’ for a significant period of time. The economic and security costs of such defections may not outweigh the network benefits (Mueller Citation 2017; Polatin-Reuben and Wright Citation 2014). That said, Chinese industry players like Huawei have presented proposals on technical standards on ‘decentralised internet infrastructure’ at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). These proposals have been socialised by Chinese actors as ‘New IP’ technologies, which aim to ‘[reinvent] the internet's core architecture,’ (Hoffmann, Lazanski, and Taylor Citation 2020) and potentially create ‘non-interoperable networks’ across the globe (Sharp Citation 2020). The main challenge to the liberal cyber order consequently lies not only in a possible technical fragmentation of the internet but in ongoing attempts to subject its governance, domestically and internationally, to the territorial state.\n## 2.2. Significance of the Ad Hoc Committee on cybercrime\nThe enhanced cyber sovereignty of states, especially developing countries, allow them to resist ‘US [economic and political] hegemony in cyberspace’ (Gao Citation 2022). As challengers to the liberal cyber order, this is admittedly an important goal for China and Russia. Nevertheless, as major global players themselves, both states seek rules in a sovereignty-centric cyber order that specifically benefit them, drawing in no small part on their own traditional strengths and preferences in dealing exclusively with governments abroad. The following paragraphs highlight what those goals might be, why it has been challenging for China and Russia to achieve them, and how the AHC acquires salience in this context.\nAs a systemic objective, China and Russia seek to constrain certain inherent advantages that Western economies enjoy in the liberal cyber order. An open and free internet – a core tenet of the liberal order – not only has normative appeal but also confers instrumental geopolitical advantages to Western liberal states (Lahmann Citation 2021), to which both states are especially sensitive (Lokot and Wijermars Citation 2023). ‘Internet freedom’, which has been a key US foreign policy goal, is also an enabler of market access for multinational corporations – many of them based in the US – to gain from digital economies around the world (DeNardis and Hackl Citation 2015; Farrell Citation 2006; Farrell and Newman Citation 2021). It is a tool for soft power promotion in cyberspace, facilitating the import of Western cultural, ideological and intellectual motifs and themes by developing states (Rothkopf Citation 1997). An open internet is also beneficial to covert and overt military, intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the West that enjoy ‘home-field advantage’ (Buchanan Citation 2022) in a domain largely developed and innovated upon in liberal economies. Strategic adversaries such as China and Russia want to constrain the capabilities of the United States and like-minded countries to gather intelligence and ‘persistently engage’ (Goldsmith Citation 2022; US Cyber Command Citation 2022) digital networks to surveil and mount offensive cyber operations.\nAchieving this broader goal through the reform of existing multilateral institutions has proved challenging for Russia and China. Firstly, new rules that enhance the sovereign capacities of states are likely to be incompatible with rules incubated by existing liberal regimes, in which both Russia and China are willing participants. Any attempt to coerce other states into their preferred regimes will invite retaliation or be simply ignored for other, preferential regimes (Cha Citation 2023). Even if China or Russia were to set new rules, their challenge would be to draw away middle powers or developing countries, whose economic or security dependencies with advanced liberal economies may compel them to stick with existing regimes. The ‘counterhegemonic coalitions’ (Schweller and Pu Citation 2011) that both states have sought to incubate have had little success drawing in countries that were not already in their geopolitical orbit. Initiatives such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s Code of Conduct on Information Security or the China-promoted Global Initiative on Data Security seem unlikely to register acknowledgment\namong broader multilateral initiatives (Kynge Citation 2023). In China's case particularly, it has struggled also to shore up support for 'counter-institutionalization' in global economic governance, through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) that do not conflict with the Bretton Woods institutions but attempt to 'decrease [their] relevance' (Zürn Citation 2018). In the domain of international security, prospects for counter-institutionalization are likely to be even harder (Zürn Citation 2018).\nFurthermore, the world is witnessing a discernible shift towards informal global governance (Snidal Citation 2021; Westerwinter, Abbott, and Biersteker Citation 2021), undermining efforts by Russia and China to create a new international order through binding rules. Empirically documented by scholars of international law and international relations, this phenomenon has catalysed the proliferation of informal alliances, ad hoc coalitions and task forces in economic and security domains (Bradley, Goldsmith, and Hathaway Citation 2023; Reykers et al. Citation 2023). This shift has arguably been precipitated by the US's turn towards non-binding agreements, largely for reasons of domestic politics, such as difficulties in getting Senate ratification of treaties or the lack of interest in treaty-based cooperation from populist elites (Copelovitch and Pevehouse Citation 2019). The relative decline in traditional multilateral governance deprives China and Russia, among others, of opportunities to supplant existing rules and formal regimes. The cybersecurity regime is a prime example of this phenomenon, being characterised by 'pervasive informality' (Sukumar, Broeders, and Kello Citation 2024). At the UN, for instance, Russia has for more than two decades sought an international treaty on cybersecurity, only to have its proposals rebuffed by Western countries (Farrell and Newman Citation 2021). Neither the UN GGE nor the OEWG, the two main multilateral venues for discussions on international cybersecurity, has the power to bind states with its recommendations, and both have articulated in their stead voluntary norms suggesting the contours of 'responsible state behaviour' for the domain (Kavanagh Citation 2017). Informal global governance, including in cyberspace, has paved the way for private entities to forge multi-stakeholder partnerships in various governance domains (Johnstone, Sukumar, and Trachtman Citation 2023). In comparison to treaty negotiations, which traditionally offer limited roles for NGOs and private actors to offer substantive inputs, informal channels tend to be more open and inclusive.\nThe AHC negotiations arguably address both concerns for Russia and China, and explain the scope of their proposals. Although there exists an international cybercrime instrument – the Budapest Convention – it is not signed by either state, nor for that matter by the overwhelming majority of developing countries in Asia and Africa. There is little need to develop a ‘counter-institutional’ coalition against the Budapest Convention, when most major non-signatories have expressed their reservations about the instrument. The AHC, on the other hand, comprises all UN member states, making it easier for Russia and China to build coalitions and attract countries into their orbit on their specific proposals. To be sure, both still need to engage in diplomacy to\nevangelise their proposals and appear to acknowledge this reality (Barrinha and Turner Citation 2024; Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024). As Barrinha and Turner (Citation 2024) note, Russia even took a more accommodative stand towards non-state actor participation in the cybercrime discussions in order to shore up international support.\nSecondly, the AHC discussions were very clearly geared towards a cybercrime treaty which would create binding rules. This treaty bucks the trend of informal agreements in this domain. Shoehoring proposals on cybersecurity into the cybercrime convention allowed China and Russia to address topics that either are off the table at the UN GGE or OEWG, such as cyber-enabled espionage, or do not limit the use of offensive cyber weapons by (Western) states. Consequently, their AHC proposals reflected the regulation of a whole gamut of issues that have systemic, 'order'-level effects on cyberspace. Prior to highlighting those proposals in finer detail, a brief background on the negotiations themselves is necessary.\n# 3. Cybercrime negotiations at the United Nations\nThe 'Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) for Criminal Purposes' negotiated by an intergovernmental Ad Hoc Committee will be the first binding UN instrument on any issue pertaining to the governance of cyberspace. The AHC was established by the UN General Assembly in 2019. Like the Budapest Convention developed by the Council of Europe – in some respects the precursor not only to this instrument but also to several regional agreements on cybercrime (Shires Citation 2024) – the objective of the AHC is to develop global benchmarks on identifying cybercrime and enabling international cooperation to address it.\nThe political backdrop to the AHC negotiations is important. Neither Russia nor China are signatories to the Budapest Convention. China has stayed away from the Budapest Convention for two reasons: firstly, signing the CoE Convention would be contrary to its longstanding position that global governance, including of cyberspace, should be under the aegis of the UN; secondly, China has also argued that it was not consulted when the Budapest Convention was being drafted (Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024). Russia, until its expulsion in 2022 from the body, remained the only Council of Europe member not to have signed the Budapest Convention. Moscow has offered three reasons for its decision: the low number of offences addressed by the Budapest Convention; the lack of official statistics regarding its implementation; and the Convention's allowing states to access data located in another state without the latter's authorisation, thereby violating its sovereignty (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Citation 2021).\nRussia has instead been a longstanding champion for a cybercrime treaty negotiated under the auspices of the UN (Gullo and Rodriguez Citation 2023). Cybercrime discussions at the UN\nwere previously guided through an open-ended Intergovernmental Expert Group to Conduct a Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime (United Nations General Assembly Citation 2011). The UN General Assembly resolution of December 2019 that established the AHC was a culmination of an effort by Russia to lay the diplomatic and procedural groundwork for a successful vote (Lederer Citation 2019; Rowe Citation 2020). In 2018, for example, Russia managed to push through a resolution requiring that the Secretary General collate country perspectives on cybercrime (United Nations General Assembly Citation 2018). Importantly, this resolution was titled 'Countering the use of information and communications technologies for criminal purposes', rather than simply a 'convention on cybercrime'. The 2018 resolution marked a clear and important departure from the way 'cybercrime' had been used in international discussions, especially around the Budapest Convention and also in Expert Group discussions (Hakmeh and Tropina Citation 2021). As the next section highlights, this shift is significant because it correlates to Russia and China seeking an expansive scope for the AHC convention by bringing a broad range of criminal activities within its ambit (Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024).\nWhile Europe, the United States and other like-minded states initially opposed the establishment of the AHC and did not support the Russian proposal, they have since participated actively in various negotiation sessions and intersessional consultations (Lewis and Painter Citation 2023). The AHC negotiations commenced in 2022 with plans originally for at least six negotiating sessions. At the time of writing, all planned negotiating sessions have been completed. No consensus outcome was attained at the originally stipulated concluding session in January 2024 and negotiators requested more time to complete deliberations. Consequently, a final session was scheduled for July-August 2024, during which a draft convention text was agreed upon by all participating countries. A General Assembly vote is expected in December 2024 to formally adopt the treaty (Digi Watch Citation 2024). Civil society groups and human rights campaigns have criticised the final text of the treaty due to insufficient human rights safeguards; its overly broad scope and presentation alongside a General Assembly resolution that could enable the reintroduction of cyber-enabled crimes; threats to security researchers; cementing expansive surveillance powers; enabling extensive data sharing without compatible human rights standards and safeguards and a lack of provisions on government accountability (Article 19 Citation 2024; Rodriquez Citation 2024; Tropina Citation 2024).\nThe Ad Hoc Committee was made up of the representatives of all UN member states and allowed the participation of non-voting private stakeholders, including civil society organisations and technology companies. Footnote 2 The negotiations were divided into eight broad thematic clusters, which ended up as the various operating sections of the final text of the draft convention. These included general provisions, relating to: criminalisation; jurisdiction; procedural measures of cooperation, especially among law enforcement agencies; general measures of international cooperation; preventive measures; and proposals on technical assistance and information exchange as well as mechanisms of implementation.\nAt the first three sessions, states contributed various draft provisions that could be integrated into each cluster. In April and September 2023, states held discussions on a Consolidated Negotiating Document (CND) that was prepared by the Chair.\nWhile Russia and China have been active in all sessions, the former was more active than the latter. At the first AHC session in early 2022, Russia even suggested that the AHC adopt the complete text of a draft convention it first published in 2021. At the second and third sessions, Russia and China made joint proposals, especially on procedural cooperation, which are elaborated upon in the next section. To be sure, while Russia and China have led efforts on proposals challenging the liberal cyber order at the AHC, other countries including Pakistan and Iran have also been vocal about specific concerns, such as removing human rights safeguards within the Convention (Bannelier Citation 2023). While a detailed examination of these efforts is outside the scope of this paper, it is pertinent to note that Russia and China are not working in isolation but often collaborating with a small coalition of states to effect their proposals.\n## 3.1. Data collection and analysis\nThis article's analysis of Russian and Chinese proposals at the AHC is based primarily on a review of six documents containing proposals advanced by participating states prior to each negotiating session at the AHC. The first two documents pertain to proposals advanced separately by Russia (Russia Draft Citation 2021) and China (China Suggestion Citation 2022) at the first AHC negotiating session in February 2022. The subsequent two documents analysed were jointly published by Russia, China and several developing countries in June 2022 (Russia Joint Proposal June Citation 2022) as well as in September 2022. Finally, we reviewed two versions of the Consolidated Negotiating Document (CND) – tabled in April 2023 (Ad Hoc Committee April Citation 2023) and September 2023 Footnote 3 before the AHC – that contain red line-edits to the draft convention made by all negotiating parties. The CND/DTC was tabled by the Chair of the AHC and did not indicate in any way whether red-line edits (or even the text in black letters) were likely to find place in the final draft of the convention. States had the option to reintroduce proposals and object to existing proposals until the final stage of negotiations. Red-line edits made by states or coalitions of states are particularly valuable for our analysis as looking at them helps in attributing specific proposals to states and tracking their evolution. The Chair of the AHC additionally convened informal consultations, closed working groups on certain articles/ clusters of articles and multi-stakeholder consultations. However, as details of these meetings are not on public record, they are not included in our analysis.\nIn addition to proposals tabled at all six negotiation sessions, we also reviewed publicly accessible oral statements made by Russia, China, the United States, the EU and other like-minded countries accessed through the United Nations Web Television (UN WebTV) portal. In all, we reviewed documentary and media sources dating from February 2022 to September 2023.\nFootnote 4 To triangulate our analysis, we consulted secondary literature including media coverage of the negotiations and analyses from blogs and podcasts authored by diplomats, legal practitioners and scholars.\n# 4. Unpacking Chinese and Russian proposals at the AHC\nThis section highlights two sets of Chinese and Russian proposals at the AHC that, by enhancing the territorial capacity of states, attempt to limit strategic operations undertaken by their Western adversaries as well as the ability of influential non-state actors to set global technical standards or advance norms on cybersecurity and human rights. The first set of proposals seek the criminalisation of certain offensive cyber operations against critical information infrastructure (CII) and for the purpose of conducting espionage. Russia and China's goal here is to ensure that the openness of global digital networks do not allow adversaries the operational ability and freedom to execute such operations. A second category of proposals facilitate greater territorial and extra-territorial control of states over data, users and digital infrastructure. They do so not just through an expansive approach to defining crimes in cyberspace, but also through proposals to expand the jurisdiction of states over users and data abroad that are implicated in the commission of a crime in their own territories. These proposals on extra-territorial jurisdiction are complemented by those that relax procedural and human rights safeguards on the cross-border sharing of data between law enforcement agencies.\nTaken in toto, these proposals offer an alternative framework of rules that blunt key attributes of the liberal cyber order highlighted in Section II and consequently limit the inherent advantages enjoyed by Western states and transnational private actors in this order.\nhighlights both sets of proposals, along with the specific provisions or changes Russia and China have sought at various stages of the AHC negotiations.\n# Table 1. Summary of relevant proposals advanced by Russia and China at the AHC.\n# 4.1. Constraining strategic adversaries in cyberspace\nChina and Russia have called on states at the AHC to criminalise cyber operations targeting critical infrastructure as well as cyber-enabled espionage. To be sure, Russia and China have arguably engaged in cyber operations that would fall foul of the same provisions they seek in this regard. Their own acts of commission have not deterred their AHC diplomacy arguably for two reasons. The first explanation is that Russia and China perceive for themselves an exceptional status in an alternative cyber order, in much the same way they routinely accuse the United States and its allies of 'hypocritical' actions that contravene the liberal order (Cai Citation 2019, 160).\nHere, the distinction between the approaches of Russia and China is important. Russia has long sought binding rules against the targeting of critical infrastructure, while its conduct, both through operations undertaken by state agencies and via state-supported private groups, has been in flagrant contradiction to those proposals (Korzak Citation 2021). Moscow, which is more 'confrontational and disruptive' (Broeders, Adamson, and Creemers Citation 2019) towards the liberal cyber order, is apparently comfortable with its simultaneous championing and violation of cybersecurity rules. China, on the other hand, has been less forthcoming with specific proposals for cyberspace and tends more to point out the 'double standards' (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China Citation 2023) of the US, particularly in relation to surveillance and espionage. This distinction, as the following paragraphs show, is reflected in the two countries' degree of willingness to push their proposals at the AHC in the face of opposition – Russia more, China less so. A second, issue-specific explanation is that Russia and China have both turned increasingly towards private actors to undertake disruptive or data-gathering operations (Lonergan Citation 2022; Maurer Citation 2017). In contrast to Western liberal economies, which rely on cyber commands and intelligence agencies that are operationally or institutionally accountable to domestic oversight mechanisms, Russia and China's cyber statecraft is characterised by their reliance on proxies (Giles Citation 2023; Hmaidi Citation 2023; Sherman Citation 2022). Unsurprisingly, their AHC proposals criminalise only the conduct of states, allowing both states to claim plausible deniability for proxy actions and exploit the challenges of legally attributing proxy cyber operations to governments. Chinese and Russian proposals at the AHC specifically take aim against US policies such as 'persistent engagement' and 'defend forward', which seek to disrupt 'malicious cyber activity at its source' through the 'proactive' monitoring of foreign networks by US government agencies (Fischerkeller and Harknett Citation 2019; US Cyber Command Citation 2022).\n## 4.2. Critical infrastructure and cyber operations\nThe protection of CI has been discussed at the UN GGE and OEWG for nearly a decade. In 2015, the UN GGE articulated a norm calling on states to 'not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity' that 'intentionally damaged critical infrastructure or otherwise [impaired]' its use (Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, Citation 2015). Since its publication, several multi-stakeholder and intergovernmental bodies have articulated their own version of the norm, specifying either guidelines around state behaviour with respect to CI or identifying certain sectors as 'critical' and therefore deserving of protection (Kouloufakos Citation 2023). Turning the attention of the UN GGE towards the protection of CI has been a longstanding goal of all major actors involved in the process, but in Russia's case, its proposals should also be viewed in the broader geopolitical context of its diplomacy towards a cybersecurity treaty at the UN (Lilly and Cheravitch Citation 2020).\nMoscow's pursuit of a UN cybersecurity treaty was itself an attempt to constrain the development and use by the US and its allies of cyber offensive capabilities and generally limit the (then) advantages that the latter had in this domain (Croft Citation 2012 ; Demidov and Chernenko Citation 2015 ). The GGE format of discussions was the result of a US-Russia compromise to develop a 'framework of responsible state behaviour' through voluntary guidelines in lieu of a new treaty. The 2015 UN GGE's norm on the protection of CI, however, limited only those actions that would violate a state's obligations under existing international law. In other words, the norm concerned itself exclusively with cyber operations that either qualified as a 'use of force' or otherwise resulted in a major loss of functionality or physical effects (Haataja Citation 2023 ). Intelligence or espionage operations, including those with the intent of embedding themselves within critical infrastructure for the purposes of deploying countermeasures or 'active cyber defence' measures (Broeders Citation 2021 ) would be potentially excluded. The sixth UN GGE in 2021 affirmed this view (Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, Citation 2021 ).\nWith the GGE process not delivering the outcome it hoped for, Russia has since turned its attention towards the AHC. In 2022, the lead Russian negotiator to the UN GGE suggested that 'cybercrime is frequently used to disguise attacks against critical infrastructure [and] undermine [the] political and economic situation of governments' (Ministry of Foreign Affairs Citation 2022). Moscow has sought to criminalise 'unlawful interference' with critical infrastructure and critical information infrastructure (CII) since the first session of AHC negotiations, notwithstanding initial opposition from the US and like-minded countries in the European Union (Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes Citation 2023; \"EU Statement - UN Ad-Hoc Committee for a UN Convention on Cybercrime: Objectives and Scope of the Convention and EEAS.\" Citation 2022). Specifically, the Russian proposal suggests that parties should adopt 'legislative and other measures as are necessary under domestic law' to criminalise the creation of software or other digital information that can interfere with CII to destroy, impede or even copy information contained therein (Russia First Draft Article Citation 10 bis Citation 2021) [emphasis added]. The proposal makes clear that surveillance and intelligence-gathering operations would be covered under its remit. Further, the provision also criminalises non-compliance by private actors with government-issued guidelines related to securing CII if such non-compliance results in an attack or damage to information systems. The effect of this proposal is that multinational companies who supply or operate industrial control systems could also be implicated by domestic penal provisions.\nIn the UNGA First Committee, China too has called on states to refrain from targeting the 'critical infrastructures of other states' (People's Republic of China Citation 2017). Further, China has passed domestic legislation protecting CII, imposing duties and responsibilities on operators (Data Security Law of the People's Republic of China Citation 2021). China's first\nsubmission at the AHC sought to criminalise the ‘intrusion and destruction of ICTs facilities, systems, data or CII’. The Chinese proposal seeks to criminalise not only illegal ‘access’ and ‘interference’ with computer data and ‘information systems’ but also the lesser ‘infringement of critical information infrastructure’ (China Suggestion, Article Citation 3 ( Citation 1 ) Citation 2021 ). The protection of CII is also flagged by several joint Russian and Chinese proposals on international cooperation in the AHC. One such proposal seeks an ‘equal right’ to states for ‘the protection of its information resources and critical information infrastructures from misuse and unauthorised interference’ (Russia Joint Proposal June Citation 2022 , Art. 46 (5)). As the above statements indicate, China and Russia’s emphasis at the AHC is on CII, and not CI per se . While most countries share common perceptions of what constitutes CII (ITU-World Bank Citation 2021 ; Cybersecurity Authority of Singapore Citation 2018 ; Russia First Draft Citation 2021 ), it is still important to distinguish it from critical infrastructure. CII refers to information or communication systems or any other network resources that are by themselves required for discharging ‘vital’ services within a nation or essential to the uninterrupted functioning of critical infrastructure such as industrial control systems. Broad international convergence on many definitional aspects of CII notwithstanding, China’s position in particular – underpinned by its domestic law – is notable in the present context. China’s CII Security Protection Regulations, which took effect in 2021, defines CII to include systems whose ‘data leakage’ may ‘gravely harm’, inter alia , the ‘public interest’ (Data Security Law of the People’s Republic of China Citation 2021 ). In contrast, the EU’s focus, for example, is on the destruction or disruption of such infrastructure. Consistent with Russian proposals (Russia First Draft Citation 2021 , Article 11), and reading China’s AHC proposals alongside its domestic regulation (China’s Suggestion Citation 2021 , Article 3(2)), it would appear that Beijing has pursued a catch-all approach to CII as well as actions targeting such infrastructure that would be proscribed (including surveillance and espionage).\nWhile the Russian proposal on CII was removed in the Draft Text of the Convention (DTC) tabled by the AHC Chair before the Sixth Negotiating Session in September 2023, Moscow proposed its reintroduction into the negotiating process in the final session (Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes Citation 2023 , Article 10 bis). Notably, China did not support Russia's proposal to reintroduce criminal provisions on CII. US agencies assess that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been targeting and compromising US critical infrastructure potentially to leverage such access during conflict (United States Department of Defense Citation 2023 ; Washington Post Citation 2023 ). If accurate, these assessments would partly explain China's reluctance to push harder for criminal penalties against compromising CII through a cybercrime treaty. There is also the important consideration, noted at the beginning of this article, of China's global economic interests in cyberspace which outstrip those of Russia. China arguably would consider itself better off with some cybercrime treaty than none at all, which Russia's maximalist bargaining threatened to do at various stages of the AHC.\n## 4.3. Cyber-enabled espionage\nA related issue on which China and Russia have both floated AHC proposals is espionage. The issue of cyber-enabled espionage has been the proverbial ‘elephant in the room’ as far as international cybersecurity discussions are concerned (Broeders Citation 2024). Save for the US—China cybersecurity agreement that proscribed espionage for economic purposes (Yoo Citation 2015), there are no major international agreements that address the issue, either in terms of legal provisions or normative guardrails. On the other hand, China and Russia have sought to use the AHC negotiations on cybercrime to address cross-border espionage. To be sure, the Budapest Convention calls on states to criminalise electronic ‘interception without right’ that is committed ‘intentionally’. States could also require commission with ‘dishonest intent’ (Budapest Convention Citation 2001, Article 3) for criminality. However, as scholars have noted, the Budapest Convention only addresses the criminality of individual actions, and therefore is limited in addressing state espionage (Crootof Citation 2019; Rowe Citation 2020).\nIn contrast, China proposed at the AHC negotiations to hold states accountable for the interception of data (China Suggestion, Article Citation 4 (Citation 1) Citation 2022). The proposal read:\nStates shall not directly collect the data stored in foreign states from enterprises or individuals by technical means bypassing network security protection measures if such measures are against the laws of that foreign state.\nThe proposal not only highlighted a restriction on state activity, but also specifically emphasised the need to shield ‘enterprises and individuals’ from espionage activities. The Budapest Convention, in comparison, only refers to interception ‘to and from’ computer systems. While cyber operations that ‘bypass network security protection measures’ could refer to both disruptive operations as well as cyber-enabled espionage, China’s proposal should be read in the context of its domestic measures aimed at countering espionage. In 2023, China revised its counter-espionage law to include expansively the protection of ‘documents, data, materials and items related to national security and interests’ (Zhang Citation 2023). The revision specifically emphasised cyber operations, whether destructive or intelligence-gathering in nature, that targeted critical information infrastructure and ‘confidential-related units’ within state organs in China. The objective of the revised law is ostensibly to discourage multinational corporations and their employees from collaborating with foreign spy agencies (Marsh and Waldersee Citation 2023; Reuters Citation 2023) and has even resulted in the detention of a foreign national accused of spying (Global Times Citation 2023a; Global Times Citation 2023b). The geopolitical context is especially significant: in light of Chinese attempts to isolate itself from much of the world in the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, Western intelligence agencies have publicly emphasised the need to build ‘strong human intelligence capability’ in the country (Barnes and Wong Citation 2023; CGTN Citation 2023). Through its AHC proposal,\nChina sought not only to secure an international commitment that mirrored its domestic law but ultimately to provide it the legal imprimatur to thwart and deter US and Western intelligence operations that undermine its geopolitical or geoeconomic interests (Azcarate Citation 2023). Meanwhile, Beijing itself has reportedly leaned on proxy actors who make use of increasingly sophisticated methods for cyber espionage, that gives it greater room for deniability. Take for instance, the use by Chinese actors of disaggregate, compromised nodes such as private servers and IoT devices that make attribution to a single group or entity challenging (Raggi Citation 2024).\nRussia's original proposal tabled at the first AHC session similarly sought to criminalise the use of 'technical means to intercept traffic data and data processed by means of ICT that are not intended for public use' (Russia First Draft Citation 2021, Article 7). This is similar to the formulation in the Budapest Convention, although it is slightly modified to stipulate that interception carried out without 'appropriate authorisation' or in 'violation of established rules' should be unlawful. The Budapest Convention's formulation on interception, as noted previously, is more permissive towards espionage and only proscribes those operations conducted 'without right' by another state. Russia's standard is narrower, and allows for states to determine by domestic regulation what constitutes 'inappropriate' interception.\n## 4.4. Enhancing sovereign capacity against domestic and extraterritorial threats\nA second set of AHC proposals by Russia and China seeks to enhance the ability of governments to 'detect, suppress, investigate and prosecute' criminal activities – designated so by domestic law – within their own territories but also abroad (DTC September 2023, Article 1(1); Russia First Draft Citation 2021, Article 31). The latter objective has been sought through procedural measures that ease access to electronic evidence located in other countries and the dilution of human rights safeguards, especially in relation to the handling of data transferred between states. In promoting these proposals, China and Russia's overarching goal is arguably to limit the power of multinational technology companies as well as civil society organisations and coalitions, which are mainly based in, or draw their market strength or legitimacy from, advanced liberal economies. As highlighted previously, the effect of these proposals would be to limit the technical standard or policy-setting capacity of influential private actors on data governance and security, such as encryption and data storage. Admittedly, these proposals would also limit the ability of Chinese and Russian companies to set standards and shape policy. This outcome is in line with the heightened degrees of control, both from a policy and corporate governance perspective, that both states have exerted over their major technology players in recent years (Zhang Citation 2024).\nWe study six sets of proposals within this broader category (see) that advance this objective.\n## 4.5. Addressing ‘cyber-enabled’ crimes\nThe first category of proposals pertains to the types of crimes that can be prosecuted through the AHC convention. Both states have sought the criminalisation of ‘cyber-enabled’ crimes, i.e. crimes that have an ICT component relevant to their commission, as opposed to ‘cyber-dependent’ crimes, which fit more the traditional ‘CIA’ crimes – targeted by the Budapest Convention – that affect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of systems (Wilkinson Citation 2023). Many of these cyber-enabled crimes relate to the publication of online content, which is tightly regulated in authoritarian states. The AHC’s title itself – a committee to elaborate a treaty on ‘the use of ICTs for criminal purposes’ – was the effort of Russian resolutions at the UN General Assembly (Wilkinson Citation 2023). Non-government organizations (NGOs) and civil society organisations have not only decried the inclusion of content-related crimes as posing a ‘heightened risk’ (Privacy International and Electronic Frontier Foundation Citation 2022) to the exercise of human rights but also as impeding the work of journalists or whistle-blowers (Electronic Frontier Foundation Citation 2022). Russia and China have sought also to criminalise, respectively, ‘digital data to mislead the user’ and the ‘dissemination of false information’ (Martin Citation 2023), although these proposals have generated concern among industry and civil society (Bannelier Citation 2023). Neither formulation appears to have made it to the final rounds of negotiations. Russia, along with a number of developing countries, also proposed an all-encompassing clause to ensure the cybercrime treaty did not ‘preclude a State Party from establishing as an offence any other unlawful act committed intentionally with the use of information and communication technologies that causes significant damage’, which remains a legally ambiguous threshold (DTC September 2023, Art. 15 undecies). Targeting a broad range of ‘cyber-enabled crimes’ mirrors domestic criminal law provisions in both China and Russia and has been viewed by some experts as a means of legitimising and exporting their domestic governance models (Iyengar, Gamer and Rathi Citation 2023). Instrumentally, China’s focus has been on crimes faced by its own law enforcement agencies (Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024). Wider criminal provisions in domestic law and international treaty law boost state authority to assert control over individuals and companies that use cyberspace.\n## 4.6. Provisions on mutual legal assistance, human rights, jurisdiction and non-state actors\nBeyond seeking an expansive scope for the cybercrime treaty, we identify five areas where China and Russia have pushed for greater power for states to regulate digital activities at home and abroad. First, Russia has sought through the AHC convention to limit exemptions and safeguards against mutual legal assistance (MLA) requests by a state. These include rejecting clauses that allow states to refuse MLA requests for the prosecution of political offences (DTC September 2023, Art. 40 Clause 21 (c) bis) or those motivated by a ‘person's sex, race, language, religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinions’ (DTC September 2023, Art. 40 Clause 21 (c) ter).\nSecond, both China and Russia have advocated procedural reforms to domestic criminal law that would enable the easier prosecution of crimes committed through the use of ICTs. Russia has sought to ‘ensure that electronic evidence derived or extracted from [any ICT] shall have the probative value in criminal procedure’ (DTC September 2023, Article 30 bis). China and Russia have suggested that states should establish ‘relevant legal procedures and technical standards for the collection, retention and provision of electronic evidence to ensure the authenticity, integrity and legality of electronic evidence’ (DTC September 2023, Article 30 ter).\nThird, these states have, along with others, sought to limit human rights safeguards against the prosecution of cybercrime. Russia has objected to several proposals that introduce human rights safeguards against criminal prosecution, including in the case of ‘persons and groups in vulnerable situations’ (DTC September 2023, Article 5(2)). Moscow has also rejected a proposal to include the effective protection of human rights as a key element of cross-border technical assistance and capacity-building (DTC September 2023, Article 54). While China has not backed Russia on the proposal to remove human rights safeguards altogether, it has resisted attempts to introduce oversight mechanisms or limitations in the way governments can process and retain personal data transferred between states under the AHC convention (DTC September 2023, Article 36 sub-clause 2). Russia has also sought the use of the term ‘unlawful’ across the Consolidated Negotiation Text of the AHC draft to refer to specific acts that invite criminal prosecution. In contrast, the US, EU and like-minded countries prefer the phrase ‘without right’, which is more commonly used in the Budapest Convention. This distinction is important: ‘unlawful’ actions would be determined solely on the basis of domestic legislation, whereas the more permissive formulation ‘without right’ acknowledges the universal legitimacy of certain actions, such as accessing a free and open public computer system, instituting ‘protection activities’ (such as stronger encryption or cybersecurity safeguards) with the permission of those involved in transmitting data, or those actions taken in the pursuit of human rights such as privacy or free expression (Budapest Convention Citation 2001).\nFourth, Russia and China’s efforts to regulate extraterritorial activity go beyond proposals for expansive MLA. Notably, Russia has sought to extend states’ jurisdiction to cases in which ‘the offence is committed wholly or partly outside [their territory] but its effect in the territory [would] constitute an offence or result in the commission of an offense’ (DTC September 2023, Art. 22 sub-clause 2 c bis). Similarly, Russia has sought automatic jurisdiction for states if the ‘offence is committed against the State Party’ (DTC September 2023, Article 22 sub-clause 2 d). China has qualified its support to Russia’s invocation of the ‘effects doctrine’ Footnote ⁵ (Estey Citation 1997). Jurisdiction, in China’s view, should be based on a ‘true and sufficient’ link with criminal activities, giving priority to the place where the consequence of criminal activity occurs, where it is committed and the location of the perpetrator (China Suggestion Citation 3 (Citation 7) Citation 2022).\nFinally, both states have sought explicit control over internet service providers by national agencies. Such proposals have been an integral part of all Russian and Chinese drafts and contributions made to the AHC over six negotiating sessions. In its first draft proposal submitted to the AHC, Russia included two articles that specifically address the role of the private sector and ISPs, and also sought a code of conduct for their governance (Russian Federation Citation 2021, Article 43). China's proposals, while not as extensive, require companies and service providers to 'take technical measures and other necessary measures to effectively respond to criminal activities' (China's Suggestion Citation 2022, Article 3 (6)). Notably, both states have sought the criminalisation of the 'unlawful provision of service', understood as the providing of essentially any digitally-enabled service with 'the intent that the service or technical support be used for the commission of any of the offences' (DTC September 2023, Article 10 ter). Presumably, the service provider's 'intent' in this case would be discerned by states themselves, which enables the prosecution of any service provider that does not restrict internet services to communities or geographic areas proscribed by the state. Given the broad scope of offences that Russia and China, along with other authoritarian regimes, want to criminalise, this proposal could severely restrict the scope of operation of Virtual Private Networks or even secure messaging platforms that are set up with the intention of enabling secure and private communication away from the gaze of the state. These proposals are notable and offer important context to what China sees as the role of ISPs in 'decentralised internet infrastructure' models that it has floated at standards bodies.\nRussia's push for greater control over extraterritorial activity also throws into relief its original justification for not signing the Budapest Convention. Moscow has long expressed concerns over Article 32 of the Budapest Convention because it enables cross-border law enforcement access to territorial data without authorisation from the respective State Party. At the AHC negotiations, Russia has proposed that all cooperation under the cybercrime convention happens exclusively with the authorisation of State Parties. The cumulative effect of Russia's proposals would be that states become the sole arbiters of cross-border data access, but also have few procedural safeguards or human rights restrictions to refuse sharing data with other governments.\n# 5. Cybercrime negotiations and the future of the liberal cyber order\nRussia and China's proposals at the AHC reflect their efforts to shape systemically the governance of cyberspace, away from its liberal underpinnings. They attempt to reconfigure the norms and rules governing international relations in cyberspace by casting the territorial state as its main actor. Much like Western states have benefitted from a liberal order rooted in the dilution of the territorial state and the delegation of key cyberspace governance functions to private actors\n(Farrell and Newman Citation 2021), Russia and China seek geopolitical advantages from the alternative order they propose.\nDraft measures on the protection of CII and the criminalisation of cyber-enabled espionage constrain the freedom that Western intelligence agencies and commands enjoy in cyberspace for information-gathering and disruptive operations. On the other hand, stronger control over online content and the activities of digital services providers as well as weaker procedural and substantive safeguards on cross-border data-sharing between governments ensure that states can regulate private actors at home and also exert control over the data of users and entities held abroad (Harvey and Moore Citation 2022). The goal of these proposals is to limit the autonomy and influence of (mostly) Western technology companies in determining data flows and cybersecurity outcomes through their in-house policies and technical standards (Klonick Citation 2017).\nRussia and China's pursuit of an alternative cyber order is backed by several statements on issues discussed in the paper. While a detailed examination of these statements and strategies is outside the scope of this paper, we highlight a few notable examples. Beijing's repeated references to the US's 'empire of hacking' (Reuters Citation 2023) and Moscow's claims of US targeting critical infrastructure for subversive 'political and economic' operations suggest that their proposals at the AHC are motivated by overarching geopolitical motives, rather than by narrow domestic ones (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Citation 2022). Further, both countries have tried to use the platform of the AHC to promote their model among developing countries through language referencing the need for a systemic shift in cyberspace governance. China has declared that the AHC treaty should 'adjust [to] and create new contours for ensuring the security of states' (China Intervention Sixth Session Morning, UN Web TV 2023, 01:01:00 to 01:07:00). This messaging has been emphasised repeatedly by the Russian delegation as well. An article written by the Deputy Head of the Russian delegation amidst the AHC negotiations argued that the 'prospects for the global digitalisation process as a whole, the effectiveness and dynamics which depend on ensuring security, are in question' (Chernukhin Citation 2023).\nIndeed, Russia and China's diplomatic strategies at the AHC appear to exploit the Global South's 'discontent' against the LIO (Endaylalu Citation 2022). Both states have argued that debates on human rights are manufactured by states (liberal economies) who seek to 'retain their dominant position in the information sphere' at the cost of 'practical cooperation' on cybercrime (Russian Federation Citation 2022). In other words, the messaging here is not that human rights are bad, but that developing nations have more urgent priorities which are not highlighted in the current order. Relatedly, both states have also underlined the need for new rules to prosecute cybercrime, appealing to the deeply felt sentiment among African and Asian countries to be norm-makers and not norm-takers (Acharya Citation 2011). China's opening intervention at AHC negotiations stressed that including 'cyber-enabled crimes' in the cybercrime treaty is a way of ensuring that international law kept 'pace with the trends' (China, Intervention Sixth Session Morning, UN\nWeb TV 2023, 01:01:00 to 01:07:00). Russia has emphasised the fact that many countries stayed away from the Budapest Convention because they were not involved in its creation (Seger Citation 2016), denouncing the instrument as having failed to win the 'minds and hearts' of the developing world (Chernukhin Citation 2023).\nAs illustrates, Russia and China's own cyber diplomacy at the AHC has received steady support from some of its allies, but many developing countries and emerging powers (Chivvis and Geaghan-Breiner Citation 2024) have largely remained silent in response.\n# Table 2. States' responses to China and Russia's proposals at September 2023 negotiations.\nThe Draft Text of Convention (DTC) circulated by the AHC's chair in September 2023 omitted several proposals from China and Russia, especially on the scope and coverage of 'cyber-enabled crimes' as well as protection of CII. However, Russia attempted to reinsert all those proposals back into the DTC as red-line edits. China, as has illustrated, appears to have been less persistent in terms of reintroducing its original proposals. China's more moderate approach, as indicated in the first half of this paper, arguably reflects its heightened economic stake in cyberspace, compared to Russia's all-or-nothing strategy. Further, Russia's approach to the AHC negotiations reflects its strategy in the UN GGE and UN OEWG, where it scoped out similarly maximalist positions before engaging in last-minute, backroom deals to secure consensus within both groups. Chinese cyber diplomacy generally tends to avoid such grand bargains, and in the AHC appears to have prioritised some of its proposals over others.\nRegardless of their outcomes, it is clear from Russia and China's proposals that both states view the proposed AHC convention on cybercrime as an opportunity to chart new rules for the road for cyberspace. In a domain characterised mainly by informal norms of responsible behaviour and technical standards – a consequence of the liberal ordering of cyberspace – both states have arguably found it difficult to challenge the economic and normative clout of major private actors and to constrain the strategic advantages of powerful Western adversaries. They have sought consequently to use the prospective AHC treaty to usher in a cyber order that lends primacy to the territorial state – not only to govern domestic digital activity but also to shape international data flows and the use of offensive cyber capabilities.\n# Acknowledgement\nThe authors thank Isabella Wilkinson for comments on a previous draft of this article.\n# Disclosure statement\nThe authors report that there are no competing interests to declare."

The application of this 'liberal cyber order' has been resisted by Russia and China who seek a greater role for the territorial state in cyberspace governance. They have long sought new, binding rules to this effect with little success. The UN cybercrime convention bucks the trend of informal, non-binding agreements in this domain. Through an empirical analysis of proposals advanced by Russia and China during negotiations toward the cybercrime convention, this article demonstrates how they have sought to use it to develop rules that blunt the advantages enjoyed by Western liberal economies and major transnational actors in the current order. Going beyond the regulation of cybercrime, Russian and Chinese proposals empower states to thwart disruptive and intelligence-gathering cyber operations that may be conducted globally by Western adversaries. Additionally, they enhance the state's regulatory capacity over private actors at home and abroad, limiting the ability of businesses or NGOs to shape cybersecurity and human rights standards around the transfer, retention and access of data.\n# KEYWORDS:\n- Cybercrime treaty\n- cyber sovereignty\n- liberal international order\n- cybersecurity governance\n# 1. Introduction\nWhat kind of global governance regime do China and Russia seek for cyberspace? As authoritarian states with strong restrictions on the online activities of individuals, businesses and NGOs, do they simply seek greater autonomy to regulate digital technologies in their territory without foreign intervention? China and Russia have been robustly engaged, for over two decades, in discussions on internet governance at the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) (Murgia and Gross Citation 2020; Yoo Citation 2023), regional cooperative institutions and multi-stakeholder entities such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) (Kennedy Citation 2013; Negro Citation 2020; Yan Citation 2015). Chinese and Russian proposals advanced at these forums have the effect of increasing states' capacity to manage the territorial conduct of private actors.\nThe proposals advanced by both states at international forums also signal their geopolitical interests in cyberspace. Discussions on international cybersecurity in the UN General Assembly's First Committee, where Russia and China have competed with the 'like-minded' Footnote 1 countries led by the United States and European Union on specific proposals, throw into relief those interests (Basu, Poetranto, and Lau Citation 2021; Tiirmaa-Klaar Citation 2021). Through their First Committee proposals, Russia and China have sought to limit the ability of Western adversaries to engage in offensive cyber operations against their digital assets and infrastructure, and simultaneously to legitimize their own strategies and practices (for example, their increasing use of proxies or 'cyber mercenaries') (Maurer Citation 2017; Sukumar Citation 2017).\nBy dint of institutional design and the fragmented nature of the cyber 'regime complex' (Nye Citation 2014), discussions on internet governance, cybercrime and norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace have hitherto taken place across a number of international forums. This fragmentation has occluded from analysis a complete picture of the systemic changes that Russia and China pursue for the governance of cyberspace. Given that they are major cyber powers, it is important to understand whether and why both states seek to influence how other states govern territorial networks to advance their own broader geopolitical and geoeconomic ambitions for the domain. For instance, China and Russia would want for other states to have greater agency over domestic networks, whether for the purpose of requesting them to thwart Western cyber operations, curtail the growing influence of Western technology companies whom they see as proxies of the US or its allies, or clamp down on foreign voices and institutions critical of them. Conversely, implementing tougher restrictions on online activity at home may often require China and Russia to seek data from abroad for investigative and prosecutorial purposes. For such data requests to succeed, states must not only be aligned on what counts as criminal activity in cyberspace, there should also be few procedural hurdles for interstate data transfers. These objectives require a major reconfiguration of the way in which states currently engage with each other in cyberspace, and with private actors both domestically and internationally.\nTo be sure, Russian and Chinese objectives for cyberspace governance differ in important respects. As Flonk notes, Russia relies more on policy-oriented measures to regulate internet infrastructure, users and networks than China, where technical infrastructure such as the Great Chinese Firewall allows for a high degree of centralisation over content control and platforms governance (Flonk Citation 2021). Secondly, with significantly higher economic stakes in cyberspace, China's geopolitical outlook differs somewhat from Russia's. China's cyber diplomacy and proposals are driven by a desire to support Chinese technology companies while seeking a significant degree of state control over ICT activities at home and abroad. Russia, on the other hand, does not have a significant domestic technology industry and is therefore arguably less concerned about the geoeconomic consequences of its cyber diplomacy (Broeders, Adamson, and Creemers Citation 2019). Finally, China is more selective than Russia in the execution of cyber operations. While Moscow undertakes a broad range of disruptive and\ndestructive cyber operations, including those aimed at systemic political destabilisation, Beijing has restricted itself to undertaking operations that incrementally advance its economic or security objectives. The difference could be attributed to the blowback that Chinese industry and states agencies would face as good-faith participants and key influencers of standards development (Russel and Berger Citation 2021) and digital markets were they to undertake cyber operations that cause widespread instability or degrade the availability of global internet services.\nThese differences notwithstanding, scholars have long highlighted the strong convergence of views between Russia and China in their ideological opposition to the liberal international order and to its application to cyberspace. This ‘liberal cyber order’ is marked not only by substantive norms that govern state behaviour in cyberspace but also by who sets those norms (Rovner Citation 2023). Open data flows, multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms and deference to the exercise of civil, political and economic liberties online constitute the defining characteristics of the liberal cyber order, whose influence on the internet is historical and still discernible (Deibert and Crete-Nishihata Citation 2012; Farrell and Newman Citation 2021; Hollis and Raustiala Citation 2022). In geopolitical terms, this order privileges liberal democracies and their constituents – in particular the United States and its trans-Atlantic allies who have helped incubate the growth of the internet since its early years – as rule-shapers (Farrell and Newman Citation 2021, Citation 2024). China and Russia are united in their goal to ‘reform the liberal cyber order’ (Wu Citation 2021), which includes upending liberal norms (Flonk Citation 2021) as well as the institutional governance mechanisms that are its mainstay (Raymond and Sherman Citation 2024). China and Russia are not the only actors who seek a ‘post-liberal cyberspace’ (Barrinha and Renard Citation 2020), but they are certainly its most powerful proponents, and frequent fellow travellers in diplomatic forums.\nThis article highlights Russian and Chinese efforts to orchestrate such a systemic reform or reconfiguration of the liberal cyber order through the proposed cybercrime convention currently negotiated by an Ad Hoc Committee (AHC) of the United Nations. While the AHC was established to develop a binding international instrument for states to tackle cybercrime – in official terms, counter the ‘use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) for criminal purposes’ – we show that Russia and China have sought for it to regulate activities that go well beyond the treaty’s intended scope. Their proposals, as this article empirically demonstrates, not only address cybercrime, but also implicate international cybersecurity governance and cross-border data access.\nChinese and Russian proposals at the AHC push for states to have greater control over digital infrastructure and activities. As this article's review of the literature highlights, this is consistent with longstanding Chinese and Russian views on cyberspace governance. Nonetheless, the AHC negotiations also demonstrate that their championing of 'cyber sovereignty' (Creemers Citation 2020; Stadnik Citation 2021; Thumfart Citation 2021; Zeng, Stevens, and Chen Citation 2017) is oriented towards specific objectives that in turn reveal China and Russia's aspirations towards\nsystemic changes in cyberspace governance. Their proposals empower the territorial state to regulate certain cyber operations of geopolitical concern to China and Russia. In the guise of addressing cybercrime, they also allow states to shape policies and standards on the storage and security of data, to exert control over digital activities abroad that bear on territorial concerns, and to fashion the governance of cross-border data flows as an exclusively intergovernmental prerogative with few procedural or human rights safeguards. Taken together, these proposals undermine key tenets of the liberal cyber order, that, through open networks and digital markets, have conferred geopolitical and geoeconomic advantages to liberal democracies and transnational actors based largely in Western states. Indeed, we present these findings as helping to advance a theoretical frontier in the literature on Chinese and Russian approaches to cyberspace governance. Whereas extant analyses (see Section 2) have shone a spotlight on the domestic and global impact of China and Russia's sovereignty-centric proposals, newer scholarship has begun to examine the order-level consequences of such proposals. China and Russia, these scholars note, foreground the territorial state in cyberspace for explicitly systemic objectives (Wu Citation 2021) and have attempted 'hegemonic socialisation', i.e. persuading states who are likely to agree to order-level changes (Hulvey Citation 2021, Citation 2022). Meanwhile, the order-level impact of their proposals has been clearly acknowledged and addressed as such by states like Brazil and India (Basu Citation 2024; Paulus Citation 2024), whose support is crucial for any major change to the liberal cyber order.\nAnalysing cybercrime proposals by Russia and China contextually and holistically is also important because their presentation before the AHC itself cannot be considered coincidental or opportunistic. The AHC negotiations are expressly oriented towards a treaty, in contrast to the non-binding, voluntary 'norms' on responsible behaviour that have hitherto guided interstate engagement in this domain. Moscow and Beijing have long sought to set multilateral rules not only for international cybersecurity (Levinson Citation 2021) but also for internet governance, mainly via the ITU (Radu and Gregorio Citation 2023). Those efforts have thus far not succeeded (Grigsby Citation 2017). Attempts by both states to promote technical standards that allow for greater state control over the governance of critical internet resources have not yet gained currency in multi-stakeholder forums that set standards for the internet (Hogeveen Citation 2022). Given the backdrop of 'pervasive informality' (Sukumar, Broeders, and Kello Citation 2024) in intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder models of cyberspace governance, the AHC provides a rare avenue for Russia and China to shoehorn their proposals into an instrument that binds the conduct of states.\nAt the time of writing, a draft convention text has been agreed upon by all participating states at the AHC. The final convention is expected to be adopted at a formal General Assembly vote later in 2024 (UNODC Citation 2024). As our empirical findings reveal, several proposals by Russia and China were rejected in earlier versions of the AHC draft text, while some others were reintroduced by either state in later stages of negotiation. Even if those proposals fail to gain\nacceptance, their tabling, and in some cases, persistent diplomatic efforts to push them through, indicate the importance both states attach to them, and their contribution to systemic reordering in cyberspace.\nSection 2 reviews the literature on Chinese and Russian approaches to cyberspace governance, framed against the backdrop of their broader challenge to the liberal international order. This section highlights why it is important to study their AHC proposals within this broader context, and why Russia and China have specifically sought the AHC to float those proposals. Section 3 offers a background to the cybercrime negotiations and explains how the article collected and reviewed data on Chinese and Russian AHC proposals. Section 4 forms the empirical core of this paper. It highlights various AHC proposals made by both states, dividing them into two broad categories that reflect the essence of their challenge to the liberal cyber order: one, proposals to constrain the actions of strategic Western adversaries who benefit from open digital networks, and two, proposals to enhance territorial and extraterritorial control over private actors.\n## 2. China and Russia’s challenge to the liberal cyber order\nInternational order refers to the ‘explicit principles, rules, and institutions’ that manage and reflect ‘core relationships’ and ‘settled expectations’ between states (Ikenberry Citation 2001). The liberal international order is broadly premised on three elements: freer trade and security cooperation that is based on predictable and recognised rules, cooperation through multilateral institutions that is increasingly shifting to informal mechanisms, and the progressive growth of liberal democratic values and institutional arrangements across societies (Acharya Citation 2017; Ikenberry Citation 2010). Applying the liberal domestic values of ‘predictability, access, and representation’ to international politics (Deudney and Ikenberry Citation 1999), the LIO allows private actors – especially with transnational interests such as corporations and NGOs – to engage and seek direct representation in rules, norms or institutions (Handreider Citation 1978; Moravcsik Citation 2003; Scherer et al. Citation 2006).\nIn recent years, international relations scholarship has extensively debated the challenge posed by ‘revisionist’ powers like Russia and China to the LIO across regimes such as international security, trade and climate (Johnston Citation 2019; Lake, Martin, and Risse Citation 2021; Weiss and Wallace Citation 2021; Zürn Citation 2018). The nature of Chinese and Russian challenges to the LIO differ substantially. China, according to Goddard , is a ‘bridging revisionist’ that is likely to use the existing international economic and political order to foment ‘rule-based revolution’, i.e. to transform existing rules over time to those more disposed to its interests. If its geoeconomic diplomacy in particular is any indication, China does not seek an overhaul of the LIO, but ‘prefers a more conservative version that emphasises Westphalian norms of sovereignty and non-interference’ (Weiss and Wallace Citation 2021). Russia, with fewer economic stakes in the LIO, has been more inclined to test its limits through ‘violent\naction' (Goddard Citation 2018) in contravention of basic tenets of the UN Charter and modern international relations. The outcomes of their challenges to the LIO depend in large measure on the approaches of emerging powers – with some of whom the liberal order still resonates ideologically or economically, despite their differences with the hegemon, the United States (Efstathopoulos Citation 2021). In this regard, Russia and China's joint emphasis on ‘hollowing out’ the LIO into its constitutive sovereignty elements (Johnston Citation 2019) – the sovereign equality of states, treaty-based agreements in lieu of informal agreements, consent-based dispute settlement mechanisms – may appeal to a broader audience, including emerging powers (Dugard Citation 2023).\nThe challenge posed by Russia and China to the LIO presents a necessary context to the understanding of ‘cyber ordering’ or the organisation of relations between states in cyberspace (Kello Citation 2017). As Barrinha and Renard note, cyberspace was itself the creation of the liberal order – characterised by open networks as well as private and decentralised governance (Barrinha and Renard Citation 2020). As is now widely acknowledged, various aspects of the cyber order have faced contestation from state and non-state actors in recent decades, resulting in a ‘retreat of liberal values’ (Barrinha and Renard Citation 2020; Deibert and Rohozinski Citation 2011; Mueller Citation 2017). As powerful nation states, China and Russia present the most potent challenge to the order. The remainder of this section reviews extant scholarship that analyses the Chinese and Russian challenge to the liberal cyber order, with a particular focus on cybersecurity governance. Then it highlights why studying proposals at the AHC negotiations offer a clearer picture of the alternative framework of rules that Russia and China want in cyberspace.\n## 2.1. Russian and Chinese approaches to global cybersecurity governance\nWe identify three strands of scholarship examining China and Russia’s approach to cybersecurity governance. The first strand includes conceptual and empirical assessments of the notion of cyber sovereignty, deployed discursively by both countries in domestic and international settings. This body of scholarship offers important insights into the evolution of domestic policy discourse and legislation by China and Russia to attain ‘cyber sovereignty’ and ‘information security’ respectively, two related concepts that have been at the crux of both countries’ approaches to the governance of cyberspace.\nChina’s evocation of ‘cyber sovereignty’ as a policy goal can be traced back to the 2010 White Paper on the internet in China published by the state council, the country’s apex administrative body (Information Office of the State Council Citation 2010). The concept has since made an appearance in speeches by China’s political leadership as well as its international cyberspace strategy (People’s Republic of China Citation 2017). Tracing its discursive evolution over the years, scholars have distilled ‘cyber sovereignty’ into two main components (Creemers Citation 2020; Fung Citation 2022). The first constitutive element is the core role of the state in\n'information management' (Fung Citation 2022), mainly by asserting territorial control over both domestic and foreign non-state actors. Such control may be exerted through technical measures or regulations around online activities within its jurisdiction (Deibert Citation 2015; Qiao-Franco Citation 2024). Control over the information environment is also exerted by facilitating a shift in global internet governance away from multi-stakeholder processes to articulate policy or technical standards towards intergovernmental processes under the auspices of the UN (Creemers Citation 2020; Fung Citation 2022).\nThe second constitutive element of cyber sovereignty is the equality of states in cyberspace (Zeng, Stevens, and Chen Citation 2017) which China has framed primarily in terms of the right to non-interference in a state's internal affairs. On the other hand, Russia's policy discourse on 'information security' has a longer lineage, but is essentially aligned with many of the aforesaid goals of China. First articulated in the 2000 Doctrine on Information Security, this concept is presented as a 'triad' of state, society and individual interests, whose protection from internal and external threats is ultimately the remit of the government (Stadnik Citation 2021). Over time, Russian controls over digital networks have mimicked Chinese measures (Weber Citation 2017). Such measures in Russia include online content filtering, mandatory data localisation, protection of critical information infrastructure and the 2019 Law on the Russian segment of the internet that aims to ward off external threats through centralised internet traffic routing and a national domain name system (Hakala and Melnchyuk Citation 2021; Stadnik Citation 2021). Russia has also sought the development of a legally-binding instrument for cyberspace, and to restrain states from weaponizing 'information to undermine the political, economic and social system' of others (Korzak Citation 2021).\nChina and Russia's pursuit of cyber sovereignty and information security is largely animated by the survival of its political institutions and the quest for social stability. However, there is also an important global dimension to these concepts, which the second strand of scholarship unpacks (Barrinha and Turner Citation 2024; Flonk, Jachtenfuchs, and Obendiek Citation 2020; Gao Citation 2022; Jiang Citation 2010; Nocetti Citation 2015). Analyses of Chinese and Russian proposals made at international forums have highlighted their substantive impact on users, businesses and NGOs as well as inter-state relations. Beijing and Moscow have emerged as entrepreneurs of 'illiberal norms' (Flonk Citation 2021), relating mainly to the control of online content and the governance of digital platforms, in venues such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), BRICS and the UN. Their proposals also contribute to the creation of 'sovereignty spheres', where states articulate policy and set standards on online content and internet governance, often superseding global, multi-stakeholder processes (Flonk, Jachtenfuchs, and Obendiek Citation 2020). Why would other states that have benefited from global standards opt into such sovereignty enclaves? Simmons and Hulvey note that states are 'anxious [of being] overwhelmed by global forces', among which the internet figures prominently (Simmons and Hulvey Citation 2022). Facing a 'sovereign identity crisis' in the age of the internet, they\nargue, states develop ‘border orientation preferences’ to ensure digital policies mirror the governance of territorial boundaries (Simmons and Hulvey Citation 2022). In this way, they try to ensure state-society relations are not destabilised by globalisation or open information flows.\nFinally, a third strand of scholarship examines how China and Russia engage tactically with norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace (Creemers Citation 2021; Fung Citation 2022; Raymond and Sherman Citation 2024). This literature has contributed significantly to the study of ‘cyber diplomacy’ by major powers and non-state actors. It focuses especially on the diplomatic rhetoric and narratives (Barrinha and Turner Citation 2024; Hansel Citation 2023) deployed by Moscow and Beijing to bolster support for their proposals (Fung Citation 2022), as well as their gaming of multilateral negotiation procedures – supporting consensus-based agreements, limiting private participation, ‘stack[ing] the deck’ with illiberal initiatives (Raymond and Sherman Citation 2024) – for the same purpose.\nTo summarise, China and Russia’s engagement with cybersecurity governance is characterised in the literature as driven mainly by the pursuit of cyber sovereignty, i.e. the enhancement of the state’s capacity to govern territorial networks and digital assets. The most conspicuous tool deployed in the pursuit of cyber sovereignty is online content control. Both states have engaged in diplomatic efforts to export their model of cyber sovereignty, especially to developing countries. The emergence of ‘sovereignty spheres’ akin to China and Russia, scholars point out, is likely to cause the ‘fragmentation’ of the liberal cyber order (Flonk, Jachtenfuchs, and Obendiek Citation 2020). Fragmentation, as per existing literature, could refer either to the fragmentation of regulatory regimes across jurisdictions, including liberal economies (Bradford Citation 2023), or to the technical splintering of the internet into non-interoperable, territorial networks (Drake, Cerf, and Kleinwachter Citation 2016). Pertinently, Mueller cautions against exaggerating the prospect of the technical fragmentation of the internet (Mueller Citation 2017, 17, 18). Fragmentation, he notes, is possible only if a critical mass of internet-users defect from the global internet, establishing technical incompatibilities that could sustain multiple ‘internets’ for a significant period of time. The economic and security costs of such defections may not outweigh the network benefits (Mueller Citation 2017; Polatin-Reuben and Wright Citation 2014). That said, Chinese industry players like Huawei have presented proposals on technical standards on ‘decentralised internet infrastructure’ at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). These proposals have been socialised by Chinese actors as ‘New IP’ technologies, which aim to ‘[reinvent] the internet's core architecture,’ (Hoffmann, Lazanski, and Taylor Citation 2020) and potentially create ‘non-interoperable networks’ across the globe (Sharp Citation 2020). The main challenge to the liberal cyber order consequently lies not only in a possible technical fragmentation of the internet but in ongoing attempts to subject its governance, domestically and internationally, to the territorial state.\n## 2.2. Significance of the Ad Hoc Committee on cybercrime\nThe enhanced cyber sovereignty of states, especially developing countries, allow them to resist ‘US [economic and political] hegemony in cyberspace’ (Gao Citation 2022). As challengers to the liberal cyber order, this is admittedly an important goal for China and Russia. Nevertheless, as major global players themselves, both states seek rules in a sovereignty-centric cyber order that specifically benefit them, drawing in no small part on their own traditional strengths and preferences in dealing exclusively with governments abroad. The following paragraphs highlight what those goals might be, why it has been challenging for China and Russia to achieve them, and how the AHC acquires salience in this context.\nAs a systemic objective, China and Russia seek to constrain certain inherent advantages that Western economies enjoy in the liberal cyber order. An open and free internet – a core tenet of the liberal order – not only has normative appeal but also confers instrumental geopolitical advantages to Western liberal states (Lahmann Citation 2021), to which both states are especially sensitive (Lokot and Wijermars Citation 2023). ‘Internet freedom’, which has been a key US foreign policy goal, is also an enabler of market access for multinational corporations – many of them based in the US – to gain from digital economies around the world (DeNardis and Hackl Citation 2015; Farrell Citation 2006; Farrell and Newman Citation 2021). It is a tool for soft power promotion in cyberspace, facilitating the import of Western cultural, ideological and intellectual motifs and themes by developing states (Rothkopf Citation 1997). An open internet is also beneficial to covert and overt military, intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the West that enjoy ‘home-field advantage’ (Buchanan Citation 2022) in a domain largely developed and innovated upon in liberal economies. Strategic adversaries such as China and Russia want to constrain the capabilities of the United States and like-minded countries to gather intelligence and ‘persistently engage’ (Goldsmith Citation 2022; US Cyber Command Citation 2022) digital networks to surveil and mount offensive cyber operations.\nAchieving this broader goal through the reform of existing multilateral institutions has proved challenging for Russia and China. Firstly, new rules that enhance the sovereign capacities of states are likely to be incompatible with rules incubated by existing liberal regimes, in which both Russia and China are willing participants. Any attempt to coerce other states into their preferred regimes will invite retaliation or be simply ignored for other, preferential regimes (Cha Citation 2023). Even if China or Russia were to set new rules, their challenge would be to draw away middle powers or developing countries, whose economic or security dependencies with advanced liberal economies may compel them to stick with existing regimes. The ‘counterhegemonic coalitions’ (Schweller and Pu Citation 2011) that both states have sought to incubate have had little success drawing in countries that were not already in their geopolitical orbit. Initiatives such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s Code of Conduct on Information Security or the China-promoted Global Initiative on Data Security seem unlikely to register acknowledgment\namong broader multilateral initiatives (Kynge Citation 2023). In China's case particularly, it has struggled also to shore up support for 'counter-institutionalization' in global economic governance, through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) that do not conflict with the Bretton Woods institutions but attempt to 'decrease [their] relevance' (Zürn Citation 2018). In the domain of international security, prospects for counter-institutionalization are likely to be even harder (Zürn Citation 2018).\nFurthermore, the world is witnessing a discernible shift towards informal global governance (Snidal Citation 2021; Westerwinter, Abbott, and Biersteker Citation 2021), undermining efforts by Russia and China to create a new international order through binding rules. Empirically documented by scholars of international law and international relations, this phenomenon has catalysed the proliferation of informal alliances, ad hoc coalitions and task forces in economic and security domains (Bradley, Goldsmith, and Hathaway Citation 2023; Reykers et al. Citation 2023). This shift has arguably been precipitated by the US's turn towards non-binding agreements, largely for reasons of domestic politics, such as difficulties in getting Senate ratification of treaties or the lack of interest in treaty-based cooperation from populist elites (Copelovitch and Pevehouse Citation 2019). The relative decline in traditional multilateral governance deprives China and Russia, among others, of opportunities to supplant existing rules and formal regimes. The cybersecurity regime is a prime example of this phenomenon, being characterised by 'pervasive informality' (Sukumar, Broeders, and Kello Citation 2024). At the UN, for instance, Russia has for more than two decades sought an international treaty on cybersecurity, only to have its proposals rebuffed by Western countries (Farrell and Newman Citation 2021). Neither the UN GGE nor the OEWG, the two main multilateral venues for discussions on international cybersecurity, has the power to bind states with its recommendations, and both have articulated in their stead voluntary norms suggesting the contours of 'responsible state behaviour' for the domain (Kavanagh Citation 2017). Informal global governance, including in cyberspace, has paved the way for private entities to forge multi-stakeholder partnerships in various governance domains (Johnstone, Sukumar, and Trachtman Citation 2023). In comparison to treaty negotiations, which traditionally offer limited roles for NGOs and private actors to offer substantive inputs, informal channels tend to be more open and inclusive.\nThe AHC negotiations arguably address both concerns for Russia and China, and explain the scope of their proposals. Although there exists an international cybercrime instrument – the Budapest Convention – it is not signed by either state, nor for that matter by the overwhelming majority of developing countries in Asia and Africa. There is little need to develop a ‘counter-institutional’ coalition against the Budapest Convention, when most major non-signatories have expressed their reservations about the instrument. The AHC, on the other hand, comprises all UN member states, making it easier for Russia and China to build coalitions and attract countries into their orbit on their specific proposals. To be sure, both still need to engage in diplomacy to\nevangelise their proposals and appear to acknowledge this reality (Barrinha and Turner Citation 2024; Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024). As Barrinha and Turner  note, Russia even took a more accommodative stand towards non-state actor participation in the cybercrime discussions in order to shore up international support.\nSecondly, the AHC discussions were very clearly geared towards a cybercrime treaty which would create binding rules. This treaty bucks the trend of informal agreements in this domain. Shoehoring proposals on cybersecurity into the cybercrime convention allowed China and Russia to address topics that either are off the table at the UN GGE or OEWG, such as cyber-enabled espionage, or do not limit the use of offensive cyber weapons by (Western) states. Consequently, their AHC proposals reflected the regulation of a whole gamut of issues that have systemic, 'order'-level effects on cyberspace. Prior to highlighting those proposals in finer detail, a brief background on the negotiations themselves is necessary.\n# 3. Cybercrime negotiations at the United Nations\nThe 'Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) for Criminal Purposes' negotiated by an intergovernmental Ad Hoc Committee will be the first binding UN instrument on any issue pertaining to the governance of cyberspace. The AHC was established by the UN General Assembly in 2019. Like the Budapest Convention developed by the Council of Europe – in some respects the precursor not only to this instrument but also to several regional agreements on cybercrime (Shires Citation 2024) – the objective of the AHC is to develop global benchmarks on identifying cybercrime and enabling international cooperation to address it.\nThe political backdrop to the AHC negotiations is important. Neither Russia nor China are signatories to the Budapest Convention. China has stayed away from the Budapest Convention for two reasons: firstly, signing the CoE Convention would be contrary to its longstanding position that global governance, including of cyberspace, should be under the aegis of the UN; secondly, China has also argued that it was not consulted when the Budapest Convention was being drafted (Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024). Russia, until its expulsion in 2022 from the body, remained the only Council of Europe member not to have signed the Budapest Convention. Moscow has offered three reasons for its decision: the low number of offences addressed by the Budapest Convention; the lack of official statistics regarding its implementation; and the Convention's allowing states to access data located in another state without the latter's authorisation, thereby violating its sovereignty (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Citation 2021).\nRussia has instead been a longstanding champion for a cybercrime treaty negotiated under the auspices of the UN (Gullo and Rodriguez Citation 2023). Cybercrime discussions at the UN\nwere previously guided through an open-ended Intergovernmental Expert Group to Conduct a Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime (United Nations General Assembly Citation 2011). The UN General Assembly resolution of December 2019 that established the AHC was a culmination of an effort by Russia to lay the diplomatic and procedural groundwork for a successful vote (Lederer Citation 2019; Rowe Citation 2020). In 2018, for example, Russia managed to push through a resolution requiring that the Secretary General collate country perspectives on cybercrime (United Nations General Assembly Citation 2018). Importantly, this resolution was titled 'Countering the use of information and communications technologies for criminal purposes', rather than simply a 'convention on cybercrime'. The 2018 resolution marked a clear and important departure from the way 'cybercrime' had been used in international discussions, especially around the Budapest Convention and also in Expert Group discussions (Hakmeh and Tropina Citation 2021). As the next section highlights, this shift is significant because it correlates to Russia and China seeking an expansive scope for the AHC convention by bringing a broad range of criminal activities within its ambit (Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024).\nWhile Europe, the United States and other like-minded states initially opposed the establishment of the AHC and did not support the Russian proposal, they have since participated actively in various negotiation sessions and intersessional consultations (Lewis and Painter Citation 2023). The AHC negotiations commenced in 2022 with plans originally for at least six negotiating sessions. At the time of writing, all planned negotiating sessions have been completed. No consensus outcome was attained at the originally stipulated concluding session in January 2024 and negotiators requested more time to complete deliberations. Consequently, a final session was scheduled for July-August 2024, during which a draft convention text was agreed upon by all participating countries. A General Assembly vote is expected in December 2024 to formally adopt the treaty (Digi Watch Citation 2024). Civil society groups and human rights campaigns have criticised the final text of the treaty due to insufficient human rights safeguards; its overly broad scope and presentation alongside a General Assembly resolution that could enable the reintroduction of cyber-enabled crimes; threats to security researchers; cementing expansive surveillance powers; enabling extensive data sharing without compatible human rights standards and safeguards and a lack of provisions on government accountability (Article 19 Citation 2024; Rodriquez Citation 2024; Tropina Citation 2024).\nThe Ad Hoc Committee was made up of the representatives of all UN member states and allowed the participation of non-voting private stakeholders, including civil society organisations and technology companies. Footnote 2 The negotiations were divided into eight broad thematic clusters, which ended up as the various operating sections of the final text of the draft convention. These included general provisions, relating to: criminalisation; jurisdiction; procedural measures of cooperation, especially among law enforcement agencies; general measures of international cooperation; preventive measures; and proposals on technical assistance and information exchange as well as mechanisms of implementation.\nAt the first three sessions, states contributed various draft provisions that could be integrated into each cluster. In April and September 2023, states held discussions on a Consolidated Negotiating Document (CND) that was prepared by the Chair.\nWhile Russia and China have been active in all sessions, the former was more active than the latter. At the first AHC session in early 2022, Russia even suggested that the AHC adopt the complete text of a draft convention it first published in 2021. At the second and third sessions, Russia and China made joint proposals, especially on procedural cooperation, which are elaborated upon in the next section. To be sure, while Russia and China have led efforts on proposals challenging the liberal cyber order at the AHC, other countries including Pakistan and Iran have also been vocal about specific concerns, such as removing human rights safeguards within the Convention (Bannelier Citation 2023). While a detailed examination of these efforts is outside the scope of this paper, it is pertinent to note that Russia and China are not working in isolation but often collaborating with a small coalition of states to effect their proposals.\n## 3.1. Data collection and analysis\nThis article's analysis of Russian and Chinese proposals at the AHC is based primarily on a review of six documents containing proposals advanced by participating states prior to each negotiating session at the AHC. The first two documents pertain to proposals advanced separately by Russia (Russia Draft Citation 2021) and China (China Suggestion Citation 2022) at the first AHC negotiating session in February 2022. The subsequent two documents analysed were jointly published by Russia, China and several developing countries in June 2022 (Russia Joint Proposal June Citation 2022) as well as in September 2022. Finally, we reviewed two versions of the Consolidated Negotiating Document (CND) – tabled in April 2023 (Ad Hoc Committee April Citation 2023) and September 2023 Footnote 3 before the AHC – that contain red line-edits to the draft convention made by all negotiating parties. The CND/DTC was tabled by the Chair of the AHC and did not indicate in any way whether red-line edits (or even the text in black letters) were likely to find place in the final draft of the convention. States had the option to reintroduce proposals and object to existing proposals until the final stage of negotiations. Red-line edits made by states or coalitions of states are particularly valuable for our analysis as looking at them helps in attributing specific proposals to states and tracking their evolution. The Chair of the AHC additionally convened informal consultations, closed working groups on certain articles/ clusters of articles and multi-stakeholder consultations. However, as details of these meetings are not on public record, they are not included in our analysis.\nIn addition to proposals tabled at all six negotiation sessions, we also reviewed publicly accessible oral statements made by Russia, China, the United States, the EU and other like-minded countries accessed through the United Nations Web Television (UN WebTV) portal. In all, we reviewed documentary and media sources dating from February 2022 to September 2023.\nFootnote 4 To triangulate our analysis, we consulted secondary literature including media coverage of the negotiations and analyses from blogs and podcasts authored by diplomats, legal practitioners and scholars.\n# 4. Unpacking Chinese and Russian proposals at the AHC\nThis section highlights two sets of Chinese and Russian proposals at the AHC that, by enhancing the territorial capacity of states, attempt to limit strategic operations undertaken by their Western adversaries as well as the ability of influential non-state actors to set global technical standards or advance norms on cybersecurity and human rights. The first set of proposals seek the criminalisation of certain offensive cyber operations against critical information infrastructure (CII) and for the purpose of conducting espionage. Russia and China's goal here is to ensure that the openness of global digital networks do not allow adversaries the operational ability and freedom to execute such operations. A second category of proposals facilitate greater territorial and extra-territorial control of states over data, users and digital infrastructure. They do so not just through an expansive approach to defining crimes in cyberspace, but also through proposals to expand the jurisdiction of states over users and data abroad that are implicated in the commission of a crime in their own territories. These proposals on extra-territorial jurisdiction are complemented by those that relax procedural and human rights safeguards on the cross-border sharing of data between law enforcement agencies.\nTaken in toto, these proposals offer an alternative framework of rules that blunt key attributes of the liberal cyber order highlighted in Section II and consequently limit the inherent advantages enjoyed by Western states and transnational private actors in this order.\nhighlights both sets of proposals, along with the specific provisions or changes Russia and China have sought at various stages of the AHC negotiations.\n# Table 1. Summary of relevant proposals advanced by Russia and China at the AHC.\n# 4.1. Constraining strategic adversaries in cyberspace\nChina and Russia have called on states at the AHC to criminalise cyber operations targeting critical infrastructure as well as cyber-enabled espionage. To be sure, Russia and China have arguably engaged in cyber operations that would fall foul of the same provisions they seek in this regard. Their own acts of commission have not deterred their AHC diplomacy arguably for two reasons. The first explanation is that Russia and China perceive for themselves an exceptional status in an alternative cyber order, in much the same way they routinely accuse the United States and its allies of 'hypocritical' actions that contravene the liberal order (Cai Citation 2019, 160).\nHere, the distinction between the approaches of Russia and China is important. Russia has long sought binding rules against the targeting of critical infrastructure, while its conduct, both through operations undertaken by state agencies and via state-supported private groups, has been in flagrant contradiction to those proposals (Korzak Citation 2021). Moscow, which is more 'confrontational and disruptive' (Broeders, Adamson, and Creemers Citation 2019) towards the liberal cyber order, is apparently comfortable with its simultaneous championing and violation of cybersecurity rules. China, on the other hand, has been less forthcoming with specific proposals for cyberspace and tends more to point out the 'double standards' (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China Citation 2023) of the US, particularly in relation to surveillance and espionage. This distinction, as the following paragraphs show, is reflected in the two countries' degree of willingness to push their proposals at the AHC in the face of opposition – Russia more, China less so. A second, issue-specific explanation is that Russia and China have both turned increasingly towards private actors to undertake disruptive or data-gathering operations (Lonergan Citation 2022; Maurer Citation 2017). In contrast to Western liberal economies, which rely on cyber commands and intelligence agencies that are operationally or institutionally accountable to domestic oversight mechanisms, Russia and China's cyber statecraft is characterised by their reliance on proxies (Giles Citation 2023; Hmaidi Citation 2023; Sherman Citation 2022). Unsurprisingly, their AHC proposals criminalise only the conduct of states, allowing both states to claim plausible deniability for proxy actions and exploit the challenges of legally attributing proxy cyber operations to governments. Chinese and Russian proposals at the AHC specifically take aim against US policies such as 'persistent engagement' and 'defend forward', which seek to disrupt 'malicious cyber activity at its source' through the 'proactive' monitoring of foreign networks by US government agencies (Fischerkeller and Harknett Citation 2019; US Cyber Command Citation 2022).\n## 4.2. Critical infrastructure and cyber operations\nThe protection of CI has been discussed at the UN GGE and OEWG for nearly a decade. In 2015, the UN GGE articulated a norm calling on states to 'not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity' that 'intentionally damaged critical infrastructure or otherwise [impaired]' its use (Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, Citation 2015). Since its publication, several multi-stakeholder and intergovernmental bodies have articulated their own version of the norm, specifying either guidelines around state behaviour with respect to CI or identifying certain sectors as 'critical' and therefore deserving of protection (Kouloufakos Citation 2023). Turning the attention of the UN GGE towards the protection of CI has been a longstanding goal of all major actors involved in the process, but in Russia's case, its proposals should also be viewed in the broader geopolitical context of its diplomacy towards a cybersecurity treaty at the UN (Lilly and Cheravitch Citation 2020).\nMoscow's pursuit of a UN cybersecurity treaty was itself an attempt to constrain the development and use by the US and its allies of cyber offensive capabilities and generally limit the (then) advantages that the latter had in this domain (Croft Citation 2012 ; Demidov and Chernenko Citation 2015 ). The GGE format of discussions was the result of a US-Russia compromise to develop a 'framework of responsible state behaviour' through voluntary guidelines in lieu of a new treaty. The 2015 UN GGE's norm on the protection of CI, however, limited only those actions that would violate a state's obligations under existing international law. In other words, the norm concerned itself exclusively with cyber operations that either qualified as a 'use of force' or otherwise resulted in a major loss of functionality or physical effects (Haataja Citation 2023 ). Intelligence or espionage operations, including those with the intent of embedding themselves within critical infrastructure for the purposes of deploying countermeasures or 'active cyber defence' measures (Broeders Citation 2021 ) would be potentially excluded. The sixth UN GGE in 2021 affirmed this view (Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, Citation 2021 ).\nWith the GGE process not delivering the outcome it hoped for, Russia has since turned its attention towards the AHC. In 2022, the lead Russian negotiator to the UN GGE suggested that 'cybercrime is frequently used to disguise attacks against critical infrastructure [and] undermine [the] political and economic situation of governments' (Ministry of Foreign Affairs Citation 2022). Moscow has sought to criminalise 'unlawful interference' with critical infrastructure and critical information infrastructure (CII) since the first session of AHC negotiations, notwithstanding initial opposition from the US and like-minded countries in the European Union (Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes Citation 2023; \"EU Statement - UN Ad-Hoc Committee for a UN Convention on Cybercrime: Objectives and Scope of the Convention and EEAS.\" Citation 2022). Specifically, the Russian proposal suggests that parties should adopt 'legislative and other measures as are necessary under domestic law' to criminalise the creation of software or other digital information that can interfere with CII to destroy, impede or even copy information contained therein (Russia First Draft Article Citation 10 bis Citation 2021) [emphasis added]. The proposal makes clear that surveillance and intelligence-gathering operations would be covered under its remit. Further, the provision also criminalises non-compliance by private actors with government-issued guidelines related to securing CII if such non-compliance results in an attack or damage to information systems. The effect of this proposal is that multinational companies who supply or operate industrial control systems could also be implicated by domestic penal provisions.\nIn the UNGA First Committee, China too has called on states to refrain from targeting the 'critical infrastructures of other states' (People's Republic of China Citation 2017). Further, China has passed domestic legislation protecting CII, imposing duties and responsibilities on operators (Data Security Law of the People's Republic of China Citation 2021). China's first\nsubmission at the AHC sought to criminalise the ‘intrusion and destruction of ICTs facilities, systems, data or CII’. The Chinese proposal seeks to criminalise not only illegal ‘access’ and ‘interference’ with computer data and ‘information systems’ but also the lesser ‘infringement of critical information infrastructure’ (China Suggestion, Article Citation 3 ( Citation 1 ) Citation 2021 ). The protection of CII is also flagged by several joint Russian and Chinese proposals on international cooperation in the AHC. One such proposal seeks an ‘equal right’ to states for ‘the protection of its information resources and critical information infrastructures from misuse and unauthorised interference’ (Russia Joint Proposal June Citation 2022 , Art. 46 (5)). As the above statements indicate, China and Russia’s emphasis at the AHC is on CII, and not CI per se . While most countries share common perceptions of what constitutes CII (ITU-World Bank Citation 2021 ; Cybersecurity Authority of Singapore Citation 2018 ; Russia First Draft Citation 2021 ), it is still important to distinguish it from critical infrastructure. CII refers to information or communication systems or any other network resources that are by themselves required for discharging ‘vital’ services within a nation or essential to the uninterrupted functioning of critical infrastructure such as industrial control systems. Broad international convergence on many definitional aspects of CII notwithstanding, China’s position in particular – underpinned by its domestic law – is notable in the present context. China’s CII Security Protection Regulations, which took effect in 2021, defines CII to include systems whose ‘data leakage’ may ‘gravely harm’, inter alia , the ‘public interest’ (Data Security Law of the People’s Republic of China Citation 2021 ). In contrast, the EU’s focus, for example, is on the destruction or disruption of such infrastructure. Consistent with Russian proposals (Russia First Draft Citation 2021 , Article 11), and reading China’s AHC proposals alongside its domestic regulation (China’s Suggestion Citation 2021 , Article 3(2)), it would appear that Beijing has pursued a catch-all approach to CII as well as actions targeting such infrastructure that would be proscribed (including surveillance and espionage).\nWhile the Russian proposal on CII was removed in the Draft Text of the Convention (DTC) tabled by the AHC Chair before the Sixth Negotiating Session in September 2023, Moscow proposed its reintroduction into the negotiating process in the final session (Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes Citation 2023 , Article 10 bis). Notably, China did not support Russia's proposal to reintroduce criminal provisions on CII. US agencies assess that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been targeting and compromising US critical infrastructure potentially to leverage such access during conflict (United States Department of Defense Citation 2023 ; Washington Post Citation 2023 ). If accurate, these assessments would partly explain China's reluctance to push harder for criminal penalties against compromising CII through a cybercrime treaty. There is also the important consideration, noted at the beginning of this article, of China's global economic interests in cyberspace which outstrip those of Russia. China arguably would consider itself better off with some cybercrime treaty than none at all, which Russia's maximalist bargaining threatened to do at various stages of the AHC.\n## 4.3. Cyber-enabled espionage\nA related issue on which China and Russia have both floated AHC proposals is espionage. The issue of cyber-enabled espionage has been the proverbial ‘elephant in the room’ as far as international cybersecurity discussions are concerned (Broeders Citation 2024). Save for the US—China cybersecurity agreement that proscribed espionage for economic purposes (Yoo Citation 2015), there are no major international agreements that address the issue, either in terms of legal provisions or normative guardrails. On the other hand, China and Russia have sought to use the AHC negotiations on cybercrime to address cross-border espionage. To be sure, the Budapest Convention calls on states to criminalise electronic ‘interception without right’ that is committed ‘intentionally’. States could also require commission with ‘dishonest intent’ (Budapest Convention Citation 2001, Article 3) for criminality. However, as scholars have noted, the Budapest Convention only addresses the criminality of individual actions, and therefore is limited in addressing state espionage (Crootof Citation 2019; Rowe Citation 2020).\nIn contrast, China proposed at the AHC negotiations to hold states accountable for the interception of data (China Suggestion, Article Citation 4 (Citation 1) Citation 2022). The proposal read:\nStates shall not directly collect the data stored in foreign states from enterprises or individuals by technical means bypassing network security protection measures if such measures are against the laws of that foreign state.\nThe proposal not only highlighted a restriction on state activity, but also specifically emphasised the need to shield ‘enterprises and individuals’ from espionage activities. The Budapest Convention, in comparison, only refers to interception ‘to and from’ computer systems. While cyber operations that ‘bypass network security protection measures’ could refer to both disruptive operations as well as cyber-enabled espionage, China’s proposal should be read in the context of its domestic measures aimed at countering espionage. In 2023, China revised its counter-espionage law to include expansively the protection of ‘documents, data, materials and items related to national security and interests’ (Zhang Citation 2023). The revision specifically emphasised cyber operations, whether destructive or intelligence-gathering in nature, that targeted critical information infrastructure and ‘confidential-related units’ within state organs in China. The objective of the revised law is ostensibly to discourage multinational corporations and their employees from collaborating with foreign spy agencies (Marsh and Waldersee Citation 2023; Reuters Citation 2023) and has even resulted in the detention of a foreign national accused of spying (Global Times Citation 2023a; Global Times Citation 2023b). The geopolitical context is especially significant: in light of Chinese attempts to isolate itself from much of the world in the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, Western intelligence agencies have publicly emphasised the need to build ‘strong human intelligence capability’ in the country (Barnes and Wong Citation 2023; CGTN Citation 2023). Through its AHC proposal,\nChina sought not only to secure an international commitment that mirrored its domestic law but ultimately to provide it the legal imprimatur to thwart and deter US and Western intelligence operations that undermine its geopolitical or geoeconomic interests (Azcarate Citation 2023). Meanwhile, Beijing itself has reportedly leaned on proxy actors who make use of increasingly sophisticated methods for cyber espionage, that gives it greater room for deniability. Take for instance, the use by Chinese actors of disaggregate, compromised nodes such as private servers and IoT devices that make attribution to a single group or entity challenging (Raggi Citation 2024).\nRussia's original proposal tabled at the first AHC session similarly sought to criminalise the use of 'technical means to intercept traffic data and data processed by means of ICT that are not intended for public use' (Russia First Draft Citation 2021, Article 7). This is similar to the formulation in the Budapest Convention, although it is slightly modified to stipulate that interception carried out without 'appropriate authorisation' or in 'violation of established rules' should be unlawful. The Budapest Convention's formulation on interception, as noted previously, is more permissive towards espionage and only proscribes those operations conducted 'without right' by another state. Russia's standard is narrower, and allows for states to determine by domestic regulation what constitutes 'inappropriate' interception.\n## 4.4. Enhancing sovereign capacity against domestic and extraterritorial threats\nA second set of AHC proposals by Russia and China seeks to enhance the ability of governments to 'detect, suppress, investigate and prosecute' criminal activities – designated so by domestic law – within their own territories but also abroad (DTC September 2023, Article 1(1); Russia First Draft Citation 2021, Article 31). The latter objective has been sought through procedural measures that ease access to electronic evidence located in other countries and the dilution of human rights safeguards, especially in relation to the handling of data transferred between states. In promoting these proposals, China and Russia's overarching goal is arguably to limit the power of multinational technology companies as well as civil society organisations and coalitions, which are mainly based in, or draw their market strength or legitimacy from, advanced liberal economies. As highlighted previously, the effect of these proposals would be to limit the technical standard or policy-setting capacity of influential private actors on data governance and security, such as encryption and data storage. Admittedly, these proposals would also limit the ability of Chinese and Russian companies to set standards and shape policy. This outcome is in line with the heightened degrees of control, both from a policy and corporate governance perspective, that both states have exerted over their major technology players in recent years (Zhang Citation 2024).\nWe study six sets of proposals within this broader category (see) that advance this objective.\n## 4.5. Addressing ‘cyber-enabled’ crimes\nThe first category of proposals pertains to the types of crimes that can be prosecuted through the AHC convention. Both states have sought the criminalisation of ‘cyber-enabled’ crimes, i.e. crimes that have an ICT component relevant to their commission, as opposed to ‘cyber-dependent’ crimes, which fit more the traditional ‘CIA’ crimes – targeted by the Budapest Convention – that affect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of systems (Wilkinson Citation 2023). Many of these cyber-enabled crimes relate to the publication of online content, which is tightly regulated in authoritarian states. The AHC’s title itself – a committee to elaborate a treaty on ‘the use of ICTs for criminal purposes’ – was the effort of Russian resolutions at the UN General Assembly (Wilkinson Citation 2023). Non-government organizations (NGOs) and civil society organisations have not only decried the inclusion of content-related crimes as posing a ‘heightened risk’ (Privacy International and Electronic Frontier Foundation Citation 2022) to the exercise of human rights but also as impeding the work of journalists or whistle-blowers (Electronic Frontier Foundation Citation 2022). Russia and China have sought also to criminalise, respectively, ‘digital data to mislead the user’ and the ‘dissemination of false information’ (Martin Citation 2023), although these proposals have generated concern among industry and civil society (Bannelier Citation 2023). Neither formulation appears to have made it to the final rounds of negotiations. Russia, along with a number of developing countries, also proposed an all-encompassing clause to ensure the cybercrime treaty did not ‘preclude a State Party from establishing as an offence any other unlawful act committed intentionally with the use of information and communication technologies that causes significant damage’, which remains a legally ambiguous threshold (DTC September 2023, Art. 15 undecies). Targeting a broad range of ‘cyber-enabled crimes’ mirrors domestic criminal law provisions in both China and Russia and has been viewed by some experts as a means of legitimising and exporting their domestic governance models (Iyengar, Gamer and Rathi Citation 2023). Instrumentally, China’s focus has been on crimes faced by its own law enforcement agencies (Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024). Wider criminal provisions in domestic law and international treaty law boost state authority to assert control over individuals and companies that use cyberspace.\n## 4.6. Provisions on mutual legal assistance, human rights, jurisdiction and non-state actors\nBeyond seeking an expansive scope for the cybercrime treaty, we identify five areas where China and Russia have pushed for greater power for states to regulate digital activities at home and abroad. First, Russia has sought through the AHC convention to limit exemptions and safeguards against mutual legal assistance (MLA) requests by a state. These include rejecting clauses that allow states to refuse MLA requests for the prosecution of political offences (DTC September 2023, Art. 40 Clause 21 (c) bis) or those motivated by a ‘person's sex, race, language, religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinions’ (DTC September 2023, Art. 40 Clause 21 (c) ter).\nSecond, both China and Russia have advocated procedural reforms to domestic criminal law that would enable the easier prosecution of crimes committed through the use of ICTs. Russia has sought to ‘ensure that electronic evidence derived or extracted from [any ICT] shall have the probative value in criminal procedure’ (DTC September 2023, Article 30 bis). China and Russia have suggested that states should establish ‘relevant legal procedures and technical standards for the collection, retention and provision of electronic evidence to ensure the authenticity, integrity and legality of electronic evidence’ (DTC September 2023, Article 30 ter).\nThird, these states have, along with others, sought to limit human rights safeguards against the prosecution of cybercrime. Russia has objected to several proposals that introduce human rights safeguards against criminal prosecution, including in the case of ‘persons and groups in vulnerable situations’ (DTC September 2023, Article 5(2)). Moscow has also rejected a proposal to include the effective protection of human rights as a key element of cross-border technical assistance and capacity-building (DTC September 2023, Article 54). While China has not backed Russia on the proposal to remove human rights safeguards altogether, it has resisted attempts to introduce oversight mechanisms or limitations in the way governments can process and retain personal data transferred between states under the AHC convention (DTC September 2023, Article 36 sub-clause 2). Russia has also sought the use of the term ‘unlawful’ across the Consolidated Negotiation Text of the AHC draft to refer to specific acts that invite criminal prosecution. In contrast, the US, EU and like-minded countries prefer the phrase ‘without right’, which is more commonly used in the Budapest Convention. This distinction is important: ‘unlawful’ actions would be determined solely on the basis of domestic legislation, whereas the more permissive formulation ‘without right’ acknowledges the universal legitimacy of certain actions, such as accessing a free and open public computer system, instituting ‘protection activities’ (such as stronger encryption or cybersecurity safeguards) with the permission of those involved in transmitting data, or those actions taken in the pursuit of human rights such as privacy or free expression (Budapest Convention Citation 2001).\nFourth, Russia and China’s efforts to regulate extraterritorial activity go beyond proposals for expansive MLA. Notably, Russia has sought to extend states’ jurisdiction to cases in which ‘the offence is committed wholly or partly outside [their territory] but its effect in the territory [would] constitute an offence or result in the commission of an offense’ (DTC September 2023, Art. 22 sub-clause 2 c bis). Similarly, Russia has sought automatic jurisdiction for states if the ‘offence is committed against the State Party’ (DTC September 2023, Article 22 sub-clause 2 d). China has qualified its support to Russia’s invocation of the ‘effects doctrine’ Footnote ⁵ (Estey Citation 1997). Jurisdiction, in China’s view, should be based on a ‘true and sufficient’ link with criminal activities, giving priority to the place where the consequence of criminal activity occurs, where it is committed and the location of the perpetrator (China Suggestion Citation 3 (Citation 7) Citation 2022).\nFinally, both states have sought explicit control over internet service providers by national agencies. Such proposals have been an integral part of all Russian and Chinese drafts and contributions made to the AHC over six negotiating sessions. In its first draft proposal submitted to the AHC, Russia included two articles that specifically address the role of the private sector and ISPs, and also sought a code of conduct for their governance (Russian Federation Citation 2021, Article 43). China's proposals, while not as extensive, require companies and service providers to 'take technical measures and other necessary measures to effectively respond to criminal activities' (China's Suggestion Citation 2022, Article 3 (6)). Notably, both states have sought the criminalisation of the 'unlawful provision of service', understood as the providing of essentially any digitally-enabled service with 'the intent that the service or technical support be used for the commission of any of the offences' (DTC September 2023, Article 10 ter). Presumably, the service provider's 'intent' in this case would be discerned by states themselves, which enables the prosecution of any service provider that does not restrict internet services to communities or geographic areas proscribed by the state. Given the broad scope of offences that Russia and China, along with other authoritarian regimes, want to criminalise, this proposal could severely restrict the scope of operation of Virtual Private Networks or even secure messaging platforms that are set up with the intention of enabling secure and private communication away from the gaze of the state. These proposals are notable and offer important context to what China sees as the role of ISPs in 'decentralised internet infrastructure' models that it has floated at standards bodies.\nRussia's push for greater control over extraterritorial activity also throws into relief its original justification for not signing the Budapest Convention. Moscow has long expressed concerns over Article 32 of the Budapest Convention because it enables cross-border law enforcement access to territorial data without authorisation from the respective State Party. At the AHC negotiations, Russia has proposed that all cooperation under the cybercrime convention happens exclusively with the authorisation of State Parties. The cumulative effect of Russia's proposals would be that states become the sole arbiters of cross-border data access, but also have few procedural safeguards or human rights restrictions to refuse sharing data with other governments.\n# 5. Cybercrime negotiations and the future of the liberal cyber order\nRussia and China's proposals at the AHC reflect their efforts to shape systemically the governance of cyberspace, away from its liberal underpinnings. They attempt to reconfigure the norms and rules governing international relations in cyberspace by casting the territorial state as its main actor. Much like Western states have benefitted from a liberal order rooted in the dilution of the territorial state and the delegation of key cyberspace governance functions to private actors\n(Farrell and Newman Citation 2021), Russia and China seek geopolitical advantages from the alternative order they propose.\nDraft measures on the protection of CII and the criminalisation of cyber-enabled espionage constrain the freedom that Western intelligence agencies and commands enjoy in cyberspace for information-gathering and disruptive operations. On the other hand, stronger control over online content and the activities of digital services providers as well as weaker procedural and substantive safeguards on cross-border data-sharing between governments ensure that states can regulate private actors at home and also exert control over the data of users and entities held abroad (Harvey and Moore Citation 2022). The goal of these proposals is to limit the autonomy and influence of (mostly) Western technology companies in determining data flows and cybersecurity outcomes through their in-house policies and technical standards (Klonick Citation 2017).\nRussia and China's pursuit of an alternative cyber order is backed by several statements on issues discussed in the paper. While a detailed examination of these statements and strategies is outside the scope of this paper, we highlight a few notable examples. Beijing's repeated references to the US's 'empire of hacking' (Reuters Citation 2023) and Moscow's claims of US targeting critical infrastructure for subversive 'political and economic' operations suggest that their proposals at the AHC are motivated by overarching geopolitical motives, rather than by narrow domestic ones (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Citation 2022). Further, both countries have tried to use the platform of the AHC to promote their model among developing countries through language referencing the need for a systemic shift in cyberspace governance. China has declared that the AHC treaty should 'adjust [to] and create new contours for ensuring the security of states' (China Intervention Sixth Session Morning, UN Web TV 2023, 01:01:00 to 01:07:00). This messaging has been emphasised repeatedly by the Russian delegation as well. An article written by the Deputy Head of the Russian delegation amidst the AHC negotiations argued that the 'prospects for the global digitalisation process as a whole, the effectiveness and dynamics which depend on ensuring security, are in question' (Chernukhin Citation 2023).\nIndeed, Russia and China's diplomatic strategies at the AHC appear to exploit the Global South's 'discontent' against the LIO (Endaylalu Citation 2022). Both states have argued that debates on human rights are manufactured by states (liberal economies) who seek to 'retain their dominant position in the information sphere' at the cost of 'practical cooperation' on cybercrime (Russian Federation Citation 2022). In other words, the messaging here is not that human rights are bad, but that developing nations have more urgent priorities which are not highlighted in the current order. Relatedly, both states have also underlined the need for new rules to prosecute cybercrime, appealing to the deeply felt sentiment among African and Asian countries to be norm-makers and not norm-takers (Acharya Citation 2011). China's opening intervention at AHC negotiations stressed that including 'cyber-enabled crimes' in the cybercrime treaty is a way of ensuring that international law kept 'pace with the trends' (China, Intervention Sixth Session Morning, UN\nWeb TV 2023, 01:01:00 to 01:07:00). Russia has emphasised the fact that many countries stayed away from the Budapest Convention because they were not involved in its creation (Seger Citation 2016), denouncing the instrument as having failed to win the 'minds and hearts' of the developing world (Chernukhin Citation 2023).\nAs illustrates, Russia and China's own cyber diplomacy at the AHC has received steady support from some of its allies, but many developing countries and emerging powers (Chivvis and Geaghan-Breiner Citation 2024) have largely remained silent in response.\n# Table 2. States' responses to China and Russia's proposals at September 2023 negotiations.\nThe Draft Text of Convention (DTC) circulated by the AHC's chair in September 2023 omitted several proposals from China and Russia, especially on the scope and coverage of 'cyber-enabled crimes' as well as protection of CII. However, Russia attempted to reinsert all those proposals back into the DTC as red-line edits. China, as has illustrated, appears to have been less persistent in terms of reintroducing its original proposals. China's more moderate approach, as indicated in the first half of this paper, arguably reflects its heightened economic stake in cyberspace, compared to Russia's all-or-nothing strategy. Further, Russia's approach to the AHC negotiations reflects its strategy in the UN GGE and UN OEWG, where it scoped out similarly maximalist positions before engaging in last-minute, backroom deals to secure consensus within both groups. Chinese cyber diplomacy generally tends to avoid such grand bargains, and in the AHC appears to have prioritised some of its proposals over others.\nRegardless of their outcomes, it is clear from Russia and China's proposals that both states view the proposed AHC convention on cybercrime as an opportunity to chart new rules for the road for cyberspace. In a domain characterised mainly by informal norms of responsible behaviour and technical standards – a consequence of the liberal ordering of cyberspace – both states have arguably found it difficult to challenge the economic and normative clout of major private actors and to constrain the strategic advantages of powerful Western adversaries. They have sought consequently to use the prospective AHC treaty to usher in a cyber order that lends primacy to the territorial state – not only to govern domestic digital activity but also to shape international data flows and the use of offensive cyber capabilities.\n# Acknowledgement\nThe authors thank Isabella Wilkinson for comments on a previous draft of this article.\n# Disclosure statement\nThe authors report that there are no competing interests to declare."

As authoritarian states with strong restrictions on the online activities of individuals, businesses and NGOs, do they simply seek greater autonomy to regulate digital technologies in their territory without foreign intervention? China and Russia have been robustly engaged, for over two decades, in discussions on internet governance at the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) (Murgia and Gross Citation 2020; Yoo Citation 2023), regional cooperative institutions and multi-stakeholder entities such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) (Kennedy Citation 2013; Negro Citation 2020; Yan Citation 2015). Chinese and Russian proposals advanced at these forums have the effect of increasing states' capacity to manage the territorial conduct of private actors.\nThe proposals advanced by both states at international forums also signal their geopolitical interests in cyberspace. Discussions on international cybersecurity in the UN General Assembly's First Committee, where Russia and China have competed with the 'like-minded' Footnote 1 countries led by the United States and European Union on specific proposals, throw into relief those interests (Basu, Poetranto, and Lau Citation 2021; Tiirmaa-Klaar Citation 2021). Through their First Committee proposals, Russia and China have sought to limit the ability of Western adversaries to engage in offensive cyber operations against their digital assets and infrastructure, and simultaneously to legitimize their own strategies and practices (for example, their increasing use of proxies or 'cyber mercenaries') (Maurer Citation 2017; Sukumar Citation 2017).\nBy dint of institutional design and the fragmented nature of the cyber 'regime complex' (Nye Citation 2014), discussions on internet governance, cybercrime and norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace have hitherto taken place across a number of international forums. This fragmentation has occluded from analysis a complete picture of the systemic changes that Russia and China pursue for the governance of cyberspace. Given that they are major cyber powers, it is important to understand whether and why both states seek to influence how other states govern territorial networks to advance their own broader geopolitical and geoeconomic ambitions for the domain. For instance, China and Russia would want for other states to have greater agency over domestic networks, whether for the purpose of requesting them to thwart Western cyber operations, curtail the growing influence of Western technology companies whom they see as proxies of the US or its allies, or clamp down on foreign voices and institutions critical of them. Conversely, implementing tougher restrictions on online activity at home may often require China and Russia to seek data from abroad for investigative and prosecutorial purposes. For such data requests to succeed, states must not only be aligned on what counts as criminal activity in cyberspace, there should also be few procedural hurdles for interstate data transfers. These objectives require a major reconfiguration of the way in which states currently engage with each other in cyberspace, and with private actors both domestically and internationally.\nTo be sure, Russian and Chinese objectives for cyberspace governance differ in important respects. As Flonk notes, Russia relies more on policy-oriented measures to regulate internet infrastructure, users and networks than China, where technical infrastructure such as the Great Chinese Firewall allows for a high degree of centralisation over content control and platforms governance (Flonk Citation 2021). Secondly, with significantly higher economic stakes in cyberspace, China's geopolitical outlook differs somewhat from Russia's. China's cyber diplomacy and proposals are driven by a desire to support Chinese technology companies while seeking a significant degree of state control over ICT activities at home and abroad. Russia, on the other hand, does not have a significant domestic technology industry and is therefore arguably less concerned about the geoeconomic consequences of its cyber diplomacy (Broeders, Adamson, and Creemers Citation 2019). Finally, China is more selective than Russia in the execution of cyber operations. While Moscow undertakes a broad range of disruptive and\ndestructive cyber operations, including those aimed at systemic political destabilisation, Beijing has restricted itself to undertaking operations that incrementally advance its economic or security objectives. The difference could be attributed to the blowback that Chinese industry and states agencies would face as good-faith participants and key influencers of standards development (Russel and Berger Citation 2021) and digital markets were they to undertake cyber operations that cause widespread instability or degrade the availability of global internet services.\nThese differences notwithstanding, scholars have long highlighted the strong convergence of views between Russia and China in their ideological opposition to the liberal international order and to its application to cyberspace. This ‘liberal cyber order’ is marked not only by substantive norms that govern state behaviour in cyberspace but also by who sets those norms (Rovner Citation 2023). Open data flows, multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms and deference to the exercise of civil, political and economic liberties online constitute the defining characteristics of the liberal cyber order, whose influence on the internet is historical and still discernible (Deibert and Crete-Nishihata Citation 2012; Farrell and Newman Citation 2021; Hollis and Raustiala Citation 2022). In geopolitical terms, this order privileges liberal democracies and their constituents – in particular the United States and its trans-Atlantic allies who have helped incubate the growth of the internet since its early years – as rule-shapers (Farrell and Newman Citation 2021, Citation 2024). China and Russia are united in their goal to ‘reform the liberal cyber order’ (Wu Citation 2021), which includes upending liberal norms (Flonk Citation 2021) as well as the institutional governance mechanisms that are its mainstay (Raymond and Sherman Citation 2024). China and Russia are not the only actors who seek a ‘post-liberal cyberspace’ (Barrinha and Renard Citation 2020), but they are certainly its most powerful proponents, and frequent fellow travellers in diplomatic forums.\nThis article highlights Russian and Chinese efforts to orchestrate such a systemic reform or reconfiguration of the liberal cyber order through the proposed cybercrime convention currently negotiated by an Ad Hoc Committee (AHC) of the United Nations. While the AHC was established to develop a binding international instrument for states to tackle cybercrime – in official terms, counter the ‘use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) for criminal purposes’ – we show that Russia and China have sought for it to regulate activities that go well beyond the treaty’s intended scope. Their proposals, as this article empirically demonstrates, not only address cybercrime, but also implicate international cybersecurity governance and cross-border data access.\nChinese and Russian proposals at the AHC push for states to have greater control over digital infrastructure and activities. As this article's review of the literature highlights, this is consistent with longstanding Chinese and Russian views on cyberspace governance. Nonetheless, the AHC negotiations also demonstrate that their championing of 'cyber sovereignty' (Creemers Citation 2020; Stadnik Citation 2021; Thumfart Citation 2021; Zeng, Stevens, and Chen Citation 2017) is oriented towards specific objectives that in turn reveal China and Russia's aspirations towards\nsystemic changes in cyberspace governance. Their proposals empower the territorial state to regulate certain cyber operations of geopolitical concern to China and Russia. In the guise of addressing cybercrime, they also allow states to shape policies and standards on the storage and security of data, to exert control over digital activities abroad that bear on territorial concerns, and to fashion the governance of cross-border data flows as an exclusively intergovernmental prerogative with few procedural or human rights safeguards. Taken together, these proposals undermine key tenets of the liberal cyber order, that, through open networks and digital markets, have conferred geopolitical and geoeconomic advantages to liberal democracies and transnational actors based largely in Western states. Indeed, we present these findings as helping to advance a theoretical frontier in the literature on Chinese and Russian approaches to cyberspace governance. Whereas extant analyses (see Section 2) have shone a spotlight on the domestic and global impact of China and Russia's sovereignty-centric proposals, newer scholarship has begun to examine the order-level consequences of such proposals. China and Russia, these scholars note, foreground the territorial state in cyberspace for explicitly systemic objectives (Wu Citation 2021) and have attempted 'hegemonic socialisation', i.e. persuading states who are likely to agree to order-level changes (Hulvey Citation 2021, Citation 2022). Meanwhile, the order-level impact of their proposals has been clearly acknowledged and addressed as such by states like Brazil and India (Basu Citation 2024; Paulus Citation 2024), whose support is crucial for any major change to the liberal cyber order.\nAnalysing cybercrime proposals by Russia and China contextually and holistically is also important because their presentation before the AHC itself cannot be considered coincidental or opportunistic. The AHC negotiations are expressly oriented towards a treaty, in contrast to the non-binding, voluntary 'norms' on responsible behaviour that have hitherto guided interstate engagement in this domain. Moscow and Beijing have long sought to set multilateral rules not only for international cybersecurity (Levinson Citation 2021) but also for internet governance, mainly via the ITU (Radu and Gregorio Citation 2023). Those efforts have thus far not succeeded (Grigsby Citation 2017). Attempts by both states to promote technical standards that allow for greater state control over the governance of critical internet resources have not yet gained currency in multi-stakeholder forums that set standards for the internet (Hogeveen Citation 2022). Given the backdrop of 'pervasive informality' (Sukumar, Broeders, and Kello Citation 2024) in intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder models of cyberspace governance, the AHC provides a rare avenue for Russia and China to shoehorn their proposals into an instrument that binds the conduct of states.\nAt the time of writing, a draft convention text has been agreed upon by all participating states at the AHC. The final convention is expected to be adopted at a formal General Assembly vote later in 2024 (UNODC Citation 2024). As our empirical findings reveal, several proposals by Russia and China were rejected in earlier versions of the AHC draft text, while some others were reintroduced by either state in later stages of negotiation. Even if those proposals fail to gain\nacceptance, their tabling, and in some cases, persistent diplomatic efforts to push them through, indicate the importance both states attach to them, and their contribution to systemic reordering in cyberspace.\nSection 2 reviews the literature on Chinese and Russian approaches to cyberspace governance, framed against the backdrop of their broader challenge to the liberal international order. This section highlights why it is important to study their AHC proposals within this broader context, and why Russia and China have specifically sought the AHC to float those proposals. Section 3 offers a background to the cybercrime negotiations and explains how the article collected and reviewed data on Chinese and Russian AHC proposals. Section 4 forms the empirical core of this paper. It highlights various AHC proposals made by both states, dividing them into two broad categories that reflect the essence of their challenge to the liberal cyber order: one, proposals to constrain the actions of strategic Western adversaries who benefit from open digital networks, and two, proposals to enhance territorial and extraterritorial control over private actors.\n\n---\n\n## # 5.

    "# ABSTRACT\n\nCyberspace is still characterised by features that draw from the liberal international order into which it was born: namely, open data flows and multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms that allow private actors to shape global technical or normative standards. The application of this 'liberal cyber order' has been resisted by Russia and China who seek a greater role for the territorial state in cyberspace governance. They have long sought new, binding rules to this effect with little success. The UN cybercrime convention bucks the trend of informal, non-binding agreements in this domain. Through an empirical analysis of proposals advanced by Russia and China during negotiations toward the cybercrime convention, this article demonstrates how they have sought to use it to develop rules that blunt the advantages enjoyed by Western liberal economies and major transnational actors in the current order. Going beyond the regulation of cybercrime, Russian and Chinese proposals empower states to thwart disruptive and intelligence-gathering cyber operations that may be conducted globally by Western adversaries. Additionally, they enhance the state's regulatory capacity over private actors at home and abroad, limiting the ability of businesses or NGOs to shape cybersecurity and human rights standards around the transfer, retention and access of data.\n\n# KEYWORDS:\n\n- Cybercrime treaty\n- cyber sovereignty\n- liberal international order\n- cybersecurity governance\n\n# 1.

The difference could be attributed to the blowback that Chinese industry and states agencies would face as good-faith participants and key influencers of standards development (Russel and Berger Citation 2021) and digital markets were they to undertake cyber operations that cause widespread instability or degrade the availability of global internet services.\n\nThese differences notwithstanding, scholars have long highlighted the strong convergence of views between Russia and China in their ideological opposition to the liberal international order and to its application to cyberspace. This ‘liberal cyber order’ is marked not only by substantive norms that govern state behaviour in cyberspace but also by who sets those norms (Rovner Citation 2023). Open data flows, multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms and deference to the exercise of civil, political and economic liberties online constitute the defining characteristics of the liberal cyber order, whose influence on the internet is historical and still discernible (Deibert and Crete-Nishihata Citation 2012; Farrell and Newman Citation 2021; Hollis and Raustiala Citation 2022). In geopolitical terms, this order privileges liberal democracies and their constituents – in particular the United States and its trans-Atlantic allies who have helped incubate the growth of the internet since its early years – as rule-shapers (Farrell and Newman Citation 2021, Citation 2024). China and Russia are united in their goal to ‘reform the liberal cyber order’ (Wu Citation 2021), which includes upending liberal norms (Flonk Citation 2021) as well as the institutional governance mechanisms that are its mainstay (Raymond and Sherman Citation 2024). China and Russia are not the only actors who seek a ‘post-liberal cyberspace’ (Barrinha and Renard Citation 2020), but they are certainly its most powerful proponents, and frequent fellow travellers in diplomatic forums.\n\nThis article highlights Russian and Chinese efforts to orchestrate such a systemic reform or reconfiguration of the liberal cyber order through the proposed cybercrime convention currently negotiated by an Ad Hoc Committee (AHC) of the United Nations. While the AHC was established to develop a binding international instrument for states to tackle cybercrime – in official terms, counter the ‘use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) for criminal purposes’ – we show that Russia and China have sought for it to regulate activities that go well beyond the treaty’s intended scope. Their proposals, as this article empirically demonstrates, not only address cybercrime, but also implicate international cybersecurity governance and cross-border data access.\n\nChinese and Russian proposals at the AHC push for states to have greater control over digital infrastructure and activities. As this article's review of the literature highlights, this is consistent with longstanding Chinese and Russian views on cyberspace governance. Nonetheless, the AHC negotiations also demonstrate that their championing of 'cyber sovereignty' (Creemers Citation 2020; Stadnik Citation 2021; Thumfart Citation 2021; Zeng, Stevens, and Chen Citation 2017) is oriented towards specific objectives that in turn reveal China and Russia's aspirations towards",
    "systemic changes in cyberspace governance. Their proposals empower the territorial state to regulate certain cyber operations of geopolitical concern to China and Russia. In the guise of addressing cybercrime, they also allow states to shape policies and standards on the storage and security of data, to exert control over digital activities abroad that bear on territorial concerns, and to fashion the governance of cross-border data flows as an exclusively intergovernmental prerogative with few procedural or human rights safeguards. Taken together, these proposals undermine key tenets of the liberal cyber order, that, through open networks and digital markets, have conferred geopolitical and geoeconomic advantages to liberal democracies and transnational actors based largely in Western states. Indeed, we present these findings as helping to advance a theoretical frontier in the literature on Chinese and Russian approaches to cyberspace governance. Whereas extant analyses (see Section 2) have shone a spotlight on the domestic and global impact of China and Russia's sovereignty-centric proposals, newer scholarship has begun to examine the order-level consequences of such proposals. China and Russia, these scholars note, foreground the territorial state in cyberspace for explicitly systemic objectives (Wu Citation 2021) and have attempted 'hegemonic socialisation', i.e. persuading states who are likely to agree to order-level changes (Hulvey Citation 2021, Citation 2022). Meanwhile, the order-level impact of their proposals has been clearly acknowledged and addressed as such by states like Brazil and India (Basu Citation 2024; Paulus Citation 2024), whose support is crucial for any major change to the liberal cyber order.\n\nAnalysing cybercrime proposals by Russia and China contextually and holistically is also important because their presentation before the AHC itself cannot be considered coincidental or opportunistic. The AHC negotiations are expressly oriented towards a treaty, in contrast to the non-binding, voluntary 'norms' on responsible behaviour that have hitherto guided interstate engagement in this domain. Moscow and Beijing have long sought to set multilateral rules not only for international cybersecurity (Levinson Citation 2021) but also for internet governance, mainly via the ITU (Radu and Gregorio Citation 2023). Those efforts have thus far not succeeded (Grigsby Citation 2017). Attempts by both states to promote technical standards that allow for greater state control over the governance of critical internet resources have not yet gained currency in multi-stakeholder forums that set standards for the internet (Hogeveen Citation 2022). Given the backdrop of 'pervasive informality' (Sukumar, Broeders, and Kello Citation 2024) in intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder models of cyberspace governance, the AHC provides a rare avenue for Russia and China to shoehorn their proposals into an instrument that binds the conduct of states.\n\nAt the time of writing, a draft convention text has been agreed upon by all participating states at the AHC. The final convention is expected to be adopted at a formal General Assembly vote later in 2024 (UNODC Citation 2024). As our empirical findings reveal, several proposals by Russia and China were rejected in earlier versions of the AHC draft text, while some others were reintroduced by either state in later stages of negotiation. Even if those proposals fail to gain",
    "acceptance, their tabling, and in some cases, persistent diplomatic efforts to push them through, indicate the importance both states attach to them, and their contribution to systemic reordering in cyberspace.\n\nSection 2 reviews the literature on Chinese and Russian approaches to cyberspace governance, framed against the backdrop of their broader challenge to the liberal international order. This section highlights why it is important to study their AHC proposals within this broader context, and why Russia and China have specifically sought the AHC to float those proposals. Section 3 offers a background to the cybercrime negotiations and explains how the article collected and reviewed data on Chinese and Russian AHC proposals. Section 4 forms the empirical core of this paper. It highlights various AHC proposals made by both states, dividing them into two broad categories that reflect the essence of their challenge to the liberal cyber order: one, proposals to constrain the actions of strategic Western adversaries who benefit from open digital networks, and two, proposals to enhance territorial and extraterritorial control over private actors.\n\n## 2. China and Russia’s challenge to the liberal cyber order\n\nInternational order refers to the ‘explicit principles, rules, and institutions’ that manage and reflect ‘core relationships’ and ‘settled expectations’ between states (Ikenberry Citation 2001). The liberal international order is broadly premised on three elements: freer trade and security cooperation that is based on predictable and recognised rules, cooperation through multilateral institutions that is increasingly shifting to informal mechanisms, and the progressive growth of liberal democratic values and institutional arrangements across societies (Acharya Citation 2017; Ikenberry Citation 2010). Applying the liberal domestic values of ‘predictability, access, and representation’ to international politics (Deudney and Ikenberry Citation 1999), the LIO allows private actors – especially with transnational interests such as corporations and NGOs – to engage and seek direct representation in rules, norms or institutions (Handreider Citation 1978; Moravcsik Citation 2003; Scherer et al. Citation 2006).\n\nIn recent years, international relations scholarship has extensively debated the challenge posed by ‘revisionist’ powers like Russia and China to the LIO across regimes such as international security, trade and climate (Johnston Citation 2019; Lake, Martin, and Risse Citation 2021; Weiss and Wallace Citation 2021; Zürn Citation 2018). The nature of Chinese and Russian challenges to the LIO differ substantially. China, according to Goddard (Citation 2018), is a ‘bridging revisionist’ that is likely to use the existing international economic and political order to foment ‘rule-based revolution’, i.e. to transform existing rules over time to those more disposed to its interests. If its geoeconomic diplomacy in particular is any indication, China does not seek an overhaul of the LIO, but ‘prefers a more conservative version that emphasises Westphalian norms of sovereignty and non-interference’ (Weiss and Wallace Citation 2021). Russia, with fewer economic stakes in the LIO, has been more inclined to test its limits through ‘violent",
    "action' (Goddard Citation 2018) in contravention of basic tenets of the UN Charter and modern international relations. The outcomes of their challenges to the LIO depend in large measure on the approaches of emerging powers – with some of whom the liberal order still resonates ideologically or economically, despite their differences with the hegemon, the United States (Efstathopoulos Citation 2021). In this regard, Russia and China's joint emphasis on ‘hollowing out’ the LIO into its constitutive sovereignty elements (Johnston Citation 2019) – the sovereign equality of states, treaty-based agreements in lieu of informal agreements, consent-based dispute settlement mechanisms – may appeal to a broader audience, including emerging powers (Dugard Citation 2023).\n\nThe challenge posed by Russia and China to the LIO presents a necessary context to the understanding of ‘cyber ordering’ or the organisation of relations between states in cyberspace (Kello Citation 2017). As Barrinha and Renard note, cyberspace was itself the creation of the liberal order – characterised by open networks as well as private and decentralised governance (Barrinha and Renard Citation 2020). As is now widely acknowledged, various aspects of the cyber order have faced contestation from state and non-state actors in recent decades, resulting in a ‘retreat of liberal values’ (Barrinha and Renard Citation 2020; Deibert and Rohozinski Citation 2011; Mueller Citation 2017). As powerful nation states, China and Russia present the most potent challenge to the order. The remainder of this section reviews extant scholarship that analyses the Chinese and Russian challenge to the liberal cyber order, with a particular focus on cybersecurity governance. Then it highlights why studying proposals at the AHC negotiations offer a clearer picture of the alternative framework of rules that Russia and China want in cyberspace.\n\n## 2.1. Russian and Chinese approaches to global cybersecurity governance\n\nWe identify three strands of scholarship examining China and Russia’s approach to cybersecurity governance. The first strand includes conceptual and empirical assessments of the notion of cyber sovereignty, deployed discursively by both countries in domestic and international settings. This body of scholarship offers important insights into the evolution of domestic policy discourse and legislation by China and Russia to attain ‘cyber sovereignty’ and ‘information security’ respectively, two related concepts that have been at the crux of both countries’ approaches to the governance of cyberspace.\n\nChina’s evocation of ‘cyber sovereignty’ as a policy goal can be traced back to the 2010 White Paper on the internet in China published by the state council, the country’s apex administrative body (Information Office of the State Council Citation 2010). The concept has since made an appearance in speeches by China’s political leadership as well as its international cyberspace strategy (People’s Republic of China Citation 2017). Tracing its discursive evolution over the years, scholars have distilled ‘cyber sovereignty’ into two main components (Creemers Citation 2020; Fung Citation 2022). The first constitutive element is the core role of the state in",
    "'information management' (Fung Citation 2022), mainly by asserting territorial control over both domestic and foreign non-state actors. Such control may be exerted through technical measures or regulations around online activities within its jurisdiction (Deibert Citation 2015; Qiao-Franco Citation 2024). Control over the information environment is also exerted by facilitating a shift in global internet governance away from multi-stakeholder processes to articulate policy or technical standards towards intergovernmental processes under the auspices of the UN (Creemers Citation 2020; Fung Citation 2022).\n\nThe second constitutive element of cyber sovereignty is the equality of states in cyberspace (Zeng, Stevens, and Chen Citation 2017) which China has framed primarily in terms of the right to non-interference in a state's internal affairs. On the other hand, Russia's policy discourse on 'information security' has a longer lineage, but is essentially aligned with many of the aforesaid goals of China. First articulated in the 2000 Doctrine on Information Security, this concept is presented as a 'triad' of state, society and individual interests, whose protection from internal and external threats is ultimately the remit of the government (Stadnik Citation 2021). Over time, Russian controls over digital networks have mimicked Chinese measures (Weber Citation 2017). Such measures in Russia include online content filtering, mandatory data localisation, protection of critical information infrastructure and the 2019 Law on the Russian segment of the internet that aims to ward off external threats through centralised internet traffic routing and a national domain name system (Hakala and Melnchyuk Citation 2021; Stadnik Citation 2021). Russia has also sought the development of a legally-binding instrument for cyberspace, and to restrain states from weaponizing 'information to undermine the political, economic and social system' of others (Korzak Citation 2021).\n\nChina and Russia's pursuit of cyber sovereignty and information security is largely animated by the survival of its political institutions and the quest for social stability. However, there is also an important global dimension to these concepts, which the second strand of scholarship unpacks (Barrinha and Turner Citation 2024; Flonk, Jachtenfuchs, and Obendiek Citation 2020; Gao Citation 2022; Jiang Citation 2010; Nocetti Citation 2015). Analyses of Chinese and Russian proposals made at international forums have highlighted their substantive impact on users, businesses and NGOs as well as inter-state relations. Beijing and Moscow have emerged as entrepreneurs of 'illiberal norms' (Flonk Citation 2021), relating mainly to the control of online content and the governance of digital platforms, in venues such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), BRICS and the UN. Their proposals also contribute to the creation of 'sovereignty spheres', where states articulate policy and set standards on online content and internet governance, often superseding global, multi-stakeholder processes (Flonk, Jachtenfuchs, and Obendiek Citation 2020). Why would other states that have benefited from global standards opt into such sovereignty enclaves? Simmons and Hulvey note that states are 'anxious [of being] overwhelmed by global forces', among which the internet figures prominently (Simmons and Hulvey Citation 2022). Facing a 'sovereign identity crisis' in the age of the internet, they",
    "argue, states develop ‘border orientation preferences’ to ensure digital policies mirror the governance of territorial boundaries (Simmons and Hulvey Citation 2022). In this way, they try to ensure state-society relations are not destabilised by globalisation or open information flows.\n\nFinally, a third strand of scholarship examines how China and Russia engage tactically with norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace (Creemers Citation 2021; Fung Citation 2022; Raymond and Sherman Citation 2024). This literature has contributed significantly to the study of ‘cyber diplomacy’ by major powers and non-state actors. It focuses especially on the diplomatic rhetoric and narratives (Barrinha and Turner Citation 2024; Hansel Citation 2023) deployed by Moscow and Beijing to bolster support for their proposals (Fung Citation 2022), as well as their gaming of multilateral negotiation procedures – supporting consensus-based agreements, limiting private participation, ‘stack[ing] the deck’ with illiberal initiatives (Raymond and Sherman Citation 2024) – for the same purpose.\n\nTo summarise, China and Russia’s engagement with cybersecurity governance is characterised in the literature as driven mainly by the pursuit of cyber sovereignty, i.e. the enhancement of the state’s capacity to govern territorial networks and digital assets. The most conspicuous tool deployed in the pursuit of cyber sovereignty is online content control. Both states have engaged in diplomatic efforts to export their model of cyber sovereignty, especially to developing countries. The emergence of ‘sovereignty spheres’ akin to China and Russia, scholars point out, is likely to cause the ‘fragmentation’ of the liberal cyber order (Flonk, Jachtenfuchs, and Obendiek Citation 2020). Fragmentation, as per existing literature, could refer either to the fragmentation of regulatory regimes across jurisdictions, including liberal economies (Bradford Citation 2023), or to the technical splintering of the internet into non-interoperable, territorial networks (Drake, Cerf, and Kleinwachter Citation 2016). Pertinently, Mueller cautions against exaggerating the prospect of the technical fragmentation of the internet (Mueller Citation 2017, 17, 18). Fragmentation, he notes, is possible only if a critical mass of internet-users defect from the global internet, establishing technical incompatibilities that could sustain multiple ‘internets’ for a significant period of time. The economic and security costs of such defections may not outweigh the network benefits (Mueller Citation 2017; Polatin-Reuben and Wright Citation 2014). That said, Chinese industry players like Huawei have presented proposals on technical standards on ‘decentralised internet infrastructure’ at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). These proposals have been socialised by Chinese actors as ‘New IP’ technologies, which aim to ‘[reinvent] the internet's core architecture,’ (Hoffmann, Lazanski, and Taylor Citation 2020) and potentially create ‘non-interoperable networks’ across the globe (Sharp Citation 2020). The main challenge to the liberal cyber order consequently lies not only in a possible technical fragmentation of the internet but in ongoing attempts to subject its governance, domestically and internationally, to the territorial state.",
    "## 2.2. Significance of the Ad Hoc Committee on cybercrime\n\nThe enhanced cyber sovereignty of states, especially developing countries, allow them to resist ‘US [economic and political] hegemony in cyberspace’ (Gao Citation 2022). As challengers to the liberal cyber order, this is admittedly an important goal for China and Russia. Nevertheless, as major global players themselves, both states seek rules in a sovereignty-centric cyber order that specifically benefit them, drawing in no small part on their own traditional strengths and preferences in dealing exclusively with governments abroad. The following paragraphs highlight what those goals might be, why it has been challenging for China and Russia to achieve them, and how the AHC acquires salience in this context.\n\nAs a systemic objective, China and Russia seek to constrain certain inherent advantages that Western economies enjoy in the liberal cyber order. An open and free internet – a core tenet of the liberal order – not only has normative appeal but also confers instrumental geopolitical advantages to Western liberal states (Lahmann Citation 2021), to which both states are especially sensitive (Lokot and Wijermars Citation 2023). ‘Internet freedom’, which has been a key US foreign policy goal, is also an enabler of market access for multinational corporations – many of them based in the US – to gain from digital economies around the world (DeNardis and Hackl Citation 2015; Farrell Citation 2006; Farrell and Newman Citation 2021). It is a tool for soft power promotion in cyberspace, facilitating the import of Western cultural, ideological and intellectual motifs and themes by developing states (Rothkopf Citation 1997). An open internet is also beneficial to covert and overt military, intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the West that enjoy ‘home-field advantage’ (Buchanan Citation 2022) in a domain largely developed and innovated upon in liberal economies. Strategic adversaries such as China and Russia want to constrain the capabilities of the United States and like-minded countries to gather intelligence and ‘persistently engage’ (Goldsmith Citation 2022; US Cyber Command Citation 2022) digital networks to surveil and mount offensive cyber operations.\n\nAchieving this broader goal through the reform of existing multilateral institutions has proved challenging for Russia and China. Firstly, new rules that enhance the sovereign capacities of states are likely to be incompatible with rules incubated by existing liberal regimes, in which both Russia and China are willing participants. Any attempt to coerce other states into their preferred regimes will invite retaliation or be simply ignored for other, preferential regimes (Cha Citation 2023). Even if China or Russia were to set new rules, their challenge would be to draw away middle powers or developing countries, whose economic or security dependencies with advanced liberal economies may compel them to stick with existing regimes. The ‘counterhegemonic coalitions’ (Schweller and Pu Citation 2011) that both states have sought to incubate have had little success drawing in countries that were not already in their geopolitical orbit. Initiatives such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s Code of Conduct on Information Security or the China-promoted Global Initiative on Data Security seem unlikely to register acknowledgment",
    "among broader multilateral initiatives (Kynge Citation 2023). In China's case particularly, it has struggled also to shore up support for 'counter-institutionalization' in global economic governance, through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) that do not conflict with the Bretton Woods institutions but attempt to 'decrease [their] relevance' (Zürn Citation 2018). In the domain of international security, prospects for counter-institutionalization are likely to be even harder (Zürn Citation 2018).\n\nFurthermore, the world is witnessing a discernible shift towards informal global governance (Snidal Citation 2021; Westerwinter, Abbott, and Biersteker Citation 2021), undermining efforts by Russia and China to create a new international order through binding rules. Empirically documented by scholars of international law and international relations, this phenomenon has catalysed the proliferation of informal alliances, ad hoc coalitions and task forces in economic and security domains (Bradley, Goldsmith, and Hathaway Citation 2023; Reykers et al. Citation 2023). This shift has arguably been precipitated by the US's turn towards non-binding agreements, largely for reasons of domestic politics, such as difficulties in getting Senate ratification of treaties or the lack of interest in treaty-based cooperation from populist elites (Copelovitch and Pevehouse Citation 2019). The relative decline in traditional multilateral governance deprives China and Russia, among others, of opportunities to supplant existing rules and formal regimes. The cybersecurity regime is a prime example of this phenomenon, being characterised by 'pervasive informality' (Sukumar, Broeders, and Kello Citation 2024). At the UN, for instance, Russia has for more than two decades sought an international treaty on cybersecurity, only to have its proposals rebuffed by Western countries (Farrell and Newman Citation 2021). Neither the UN GGE nor the OEWG, the two main multilateral venues for discussions on international cybersecurity, has the power to bind states with its recommendations, and both have articulated in their stead voluntary norms suggesting the contours of 'responsible state behaviour' for the domain (Kavanagh Citation 2017). Informal global governance, including in cyberspace, has paved the way for private entities to forge multi-stakeholder partnerships in various governance domains (Johnstone, Sukumar, and Trachtman Citation 2023). In comparison to treaty negotiations, which traditionally offer limited roles for NGOs and private actors to offer substantive inputs, informal channels tend to be more open and inclusive.\n\nThe AHC negotiations arguably address both concerns for Russia and China, and explain the scope of their proposals. Although there exists an international cybercrime instrument – the Budapest Convention – it is not signed by either state, nor for that matter by the overwhelming majority of developing countries in Asia and Africa. There is little need to develop a ‘counter-institutional’ coalition against the Budapest Convention, when most major non-signatories have expressed their reservations about the instrument. The AHC, on the other hand, comprises all UN member states, making it easier for Russia and China to build coalitions and attract countries into their orbit on their specific proposals. To be sure, both still need to engage in diplomacy to",
    "evangelise their proposals and appear to acknowledge this reality (Barrinha and Turner Citation 2024; Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024). As Barrinha and Turner (Citation 2024) note, Russia even took a more accommodative stand towards non-state actor participation in the cybercrime discussions in order to shore up international support.\n\nSecondly, the AHC discussions were very clearly geared towards a cybercrime treaty which would create binding rules. This treaty bucks the trend of informal agreements in this domain. Shoehoring proposals on cybersecurity into the cybercrime convention allowed China and Russia to address topics that either are off the table at the UN GGE or OEWG, such as cyber-enabled espionage, or do not limit the use of offensive cyber weapons by (Western) states. Consequently, their AHC proposals reflected the regulation of a whole gamut of issues that have systemic, 'order'-level effects on cyberspace. Prior to highlighting those proposals in finer detail, a brief background on the negotiations themselves is necessary.\n\n# 3. Cybercrime negotiations at the United Nations\n\nThe 'Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) for Criminal Purposes' negotiated by an intergovernmental Ad Hoc Committee will be the first binding UN instrument on any issue pertaining to the governance of cyberspace. The AHC was established by the UN General Assembly in 2019. Like the Budapest Convention developed by the Council of Europe – in some respects the precursor not only to this instrument but also to several regional agreements on cybercrime (Shires Citation 2024) – the objective of the AHC is to develop global benchmarks on identifying cybercrime and enabling international cooperation to address it.\n\nThe political backdrop to the AHC negotiations is important. Neither Russia nor China are signatories to the Budapest Convention. China has stayed away from the Budapest Convention for two reasons: firstly, signing the CoE Convention would be contrary to its longstanding position that global governance, including of cyberspace, should be under the aegis of the UN; secondly, China has also argued that it was not consulted when the Budapest Convention was being drafted (Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024). Russia, until its expulsion in 2022 from the body, remained the only Council of Europe member not to have signed the Budapest Convention. Moscow has offered three reasons for its decision: the low number of offences addressed by the Budapest Convention; the lack of official statistics regarding its implementation; and the Convention's allowing states to access data located in another state without the latter's authorisation, thereby violating its sovereignty (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Citation 2021).\n\nRussia has instead been a longstanding champion for a cybercrime treaty negotiated under the auspices of the UN (Gullo and Rodriguez Citation 2023). Cybercrime discussions at the UN",
    "were previously guided through an open-ended Intergovernmental Expert Group to Conduct a Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime (United Nations General Assembly Citation 2011). The UN General Assembly resolution of December 2019 that established the AHC was a culmination of an effort by Russia to lay the diplomatic and procedural groundwork for a successful vote (Lederer Citation 2019; Rowe Citation 2020). In 2018, for example, Russia managed to push through a resolution requiring that the Secretary General collate country perspectives on cybercrime (United Nations General Assembly Citation 2018). Importantly, this resolution was titled 'Countering the use of information and communications technologies for criminal purposes', rather than simply a 'convention on cybercrime'. The 2018 resolution marked a clear and important departure from the way 'cybercrime' had been used in international discussions, especially around the Budapest Convention and also in Expert Group discussions (Hakmeh and Tropina Citation 2021). As the next section highlights, this shift is significant because it correlates to Russia and China seeking an expansive scope for the AHC convention by bringing a broad range of criminal activities within its ambit (Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024).\n\nWhile Europe, the United States and other like-minded states initially opposed the establishment of the AHC and did not support the Russian proposal, they have since participated actively in various negotiation sessions and intersessional consultations (Lewis and Painter Citation 2023). The AHC negotiations commenced in 2022 with plans originally for at least six negotiating sessions. At the time of writing, all planned negotiating sessions have been completed. No consensus outcome was attained at the originally stipulated concluding session in January 2024 and negotiators requested more time to complete deliberations. Consequently, a final session was scheduled for July-August 2024, during which a draft convention text was agreed upon by all participating countries. A General Assembly vote is expected in December 2024 to formally adopt the treaty (Digi Watch Citation 2024). Civil society groups and human rights campaigns have criticised the final text of the treaty due to insufficient human rights safeguards; its overly broad scope and presentation alongside a General Assembly resolution that could enable the reintroduction of cyber-enabled crimes; threats to security researchers; cementing expansive surveillance powers; enabling extensive data sharing without compatible human rights standards and safeguards and a lack of provisions on government accountability (Article 19 Citation 2024; Rodriquez Citation 2024; Tropina Citation 2024).\n\nThe Ad Hoc Committee was made up of the representatives of all UN member states and allowed the participation of non-voting private stakeholders, including civil society organisations and technology companies. Footnote 2 The negotiations were divided into eight broad thematic clusters, which ended up as the various operating sections of the final text of the draft convention. These included general provisions, relating to: criminalisation; jurisdiction; procedural measures of cooperation, especially among law enforcement agencies; general measures of international cooperation; preventive measures; and proposals on technical assistance and information exchange as well as mechanisms of implementation.",
    "At the first three sessions, states contributed various draft provisions that could be integrated into each cluster. In April and September 2023, states held discussions on a Consolidated Negotiating Document (CND) that was prepared by the Chair.\n\nWhile Russia and China have been active in all sessions, the former was more active than the latter. At the first AHC session in early 2022, Russia even suggested that the AHC adopt the complete text of a draft convention it first published in 2021. At the second and third sessions, Russia and China made joint proposals, especially on procedural cooperation, which are elaborated upon in the next section. To be sure, while Russia and China have led efforts on proposals challenging the liberal cyber order at the AHC, other countries including Pakistan and Iran have also been vocal about specific concerns, such as removing human rights safeguards within the Convention (Bannelier Citation 2023). While a detailed examination of these efforts is outside the scope of this paper, it is pertinent to note that Russia and China are not working in isolation but often collaborating with a small coalition of states to effect their proposals.\n\n## 3.1. Data collection and analysis\n\nThis article's analysis of Russian and Chinese proposals at the AHC is based primarily on a review of six documents containing proposals advanced by participating states prior to each negotiating session at the AHC. The first two documents pertain to proposals advanced separately by Russia (Russia Draft Citation 2021) and China (China Suggestion Citation 2022) at the first AHC negotiating session in February 2022. The subsequent two documents analysed were jointly published by Russia, China and several developing countries in June 2022 (Russia Joint Proposal June Citation 2022) as well as in September 2022. Finally, we reviewed two versions of the Consolidated Negotiating Document (CND) – tabled in April 2023 (Ad Hoc Committee April Citation 2023) and September 2023 Footnote 3 before the AHC – that contain red line-edits to the draft convention made by all negotiating parties. The CND/DTC was tabled by the Chair of the AHC and did not indicate in any way whether red-line edits (or even the text in black letters) were likely to find place in the final draft of the convention. States had the option to reintroduce proposals and object to existing proposals until the final stage of negotiations. Red-line edits made by states or coalitions of states are particularly valuable for our analysis as looking at them helps in attributing specific proposals to states and tracking their evolution. The Chair of the AHC additionally convened informal consultations, closed working groups on certain articles/ clusters of articles and multi-stakeholder consultations. However, as details of these meetings are not on public record, they are not included in our analysis.\n\nIn addition to proposals tabled at all six negotiation sessions, we also reviewed publicly accessible oral statements made by Russia, China, the United States, the EU and other like-minded countries accessed through the United Nations Web Television (UN WebTV) portal. In all, we reviewed documentary and media sources dating from February 2022 to September 2023.",
    "Footnote 4 To triangulate our analysis, we consulted secondary literature including media coverage of the negotiations and analyses from blogs and podcasts authored by diplomats, legal practitioners and scholars.\n\n# 4. Unpacking Chinese and Russian proposals at the AHC\n\nThis section highlights two sets of Chinese and Russian proposals at the AHC that, by enhancing the territorial capacity of states, attempt to limit strategic operations undertaken by their Western adversaries as well as the ability of influential non-state actors to set global technical standards or advance norms on cybersecurity and human rights. The first set of proposals seek the criminalisation of certain offensive cyber operations against critical information infrastructure (CII) and for the purpose of conducting espionage. Russia and China's goal here is to ensure that the openness of global digital networks do not allow adversaries the operational ability and freedom to execute such operations. A second category of proposals facilitate greater territorial and extra-territorial control of states over data, users and digital infrastructure. They do so not just through an expansive approach to defining crimes in cyberspace, but also through proposals to expand the jurisdiction of states over users and data abroad that are implicated in the commission of a crime in their own territories. These proposals on extra-territorial jurisdiction are complemented by those that relax procedural and human rights safeguards on the cross-border sharing of data between law enforcement agencies.\n\nTaken in toto, these proposals offer an alternative framework of rules that blunt key attributes of the liberal cyber order highlighted in Section II and consequently limit the inherent advantages enjoyed by Western states and transnational private actors in this order.\n\nhighlights both sets of proposals, along with the specific provisions or changes Russia and China have sought at various stages of the AHC negotiations.\n\n# Table 1. Summary of relevant proposals advanced by Russia and China at the AHC.\n\n# 4.1. Constraining strategic adversaries in cyberspace\n\nChina and Russia have called on states at the AHC to criminalise cyber operations targeting critical infrastructure as well as cyber-enabled espionage. To be sure, Russia and China have arguably engaged in cyber operations that would fall foul of the same provisions they seek in this regard. Their own acts of commission have not deterred their AHC diplomacy arguably for two reasons. The first explanation is that Russia and China perceive for themselves an exceptional status in an alternative cyber order, in much the same way they routinely accuse the United States and its allies of 'hypocritical' actions that contravene the liberal order (Cai Citation 2019, 160).",
    "Here, the distinction between the approaches of Russia and China is important. Russia has long sought binding rules against the targeting of critical infrastructure, while its conduct, both through operations undertaken by state agencies and via state-supported private groups, has been in flagrant contradiction to those proposals (Korzak Citation 2021). Moscow, which is more 'confrontational and disruptive' (Broeders, Adamson, and Creemers Citation 2019) towards the liberal cyber order, is apparently comfortable with its simultaneous championing and violation of cybersecurity rules. China, on the other hand, has been less forthcoming with specific proposals for cyberspace and tends more to point out the 'double standards' (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China Citation 2023) of the US, particularly in relation to surveillance and espionage. This distinction, as the following paragraphs show, is reflected in the two countries' degree of willingness to push their proposals at the AHC in the face of opposition – Russia more, China less so. A second, issue-specific explanation is that Russia and China have both turned increasingly towards private actors to undertake disruptive or data-gathering operations (Lonergan Citation 2022; Maurer Citation 2017). In contrast to Western liberal economies, which rely on cyber commands and intelligence agencies that are operationally or institutionally accountable to domestic oversight mechanisms, Russia and China's cyber statecraft is characterised by their reliance on proxies (Giles Citation 2023; Hmaidi Citation 2023; Sherman Citation 2022). Unsurprisingly, their AHC proposals criminalise only the conduct of states, allowing both states to claim plausible deniability for proxy actions and exploit the challenges of legally attributing proxy cyber operations to governments. Chinese and Russian proposals at the AHC specifically take aim against US policies such as 'persistent engagement' and 'defend forward', which seek to disrupt 'malicious cyber activity at its source' through the 'proactive' monitoring of foreign networks by US government agencies (Fischerkeller and Harknett Citation 2019; US Cyber Command Citation 2022).\n\n## 4.2. Critical infrastructure and cyber operations\n\nThe protection of CI has been discussed at the UN GGE and OEWG for nearly a decade. In 2015, the UN GGE articulated a norm calling on states to 'not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity' that 'intentionally damaged critical infrastructure or otherwise [impaired]' its use (Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, Citation 2015). Since its publication, several multi-stakeholder and intergovernmental bodies have articulated their own version of the norm, specifying either guidelines around state behaviour with respect to CI or identifying certain sectors as 'critical' and therefore deserving of protection (Kouloufakos Citation 2023). Turning the attention of the UN GGE towards the protection of CI has been a longstanding goal of all major actors involved in the process, but in Russia's case, its proposals should also be viewed in the broader geopolitical context of its diplomacy towards a cybersecurity treaty at the UN (Lilly and Cheravitch Citation 2020).",
    "Moscow's pursuit of a UN cybersecurity treaty was itself an attempt to constrain the development and use by the US and its allies of cyber offensive capabilities and generally limit the (then) advantages that the latter had in this domain (Croft Citation 2012 ; Demidov and Chernenko Citation 2015 ). The GGE format of discussions was the result of a US-Russia compromise to develop a 'framework of responsible state behaviour' through voluntary guidelines in lieu of a new treaty. The 2015 UN GGE's norm on the protection of CI, however, limited only those actions that would violate a state's obligations under existing international law. In other words, the norm concerned itself exclusively with cyber operations that either qualified as a 'use of force' or otherwise resulted in a major loss of functionality or physical effects (Haataja Citation 2023 ). Intelligence or espionage operations, including those with the intent of embedding themselves within critical infrastructure for the purposes of deploying countermeasures or 'active cyber defence' measures (Broeders Citation 2021 ) would be potentially excluded. The sixth UN GGE in 2021 affirmed this view (Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, Citation 2021 ).\n\nWith the GGE process not delivering the outcome it hoped for, Russia has since turned its attention towards the AHC. In 2022, the lead Russian negotiator to the UN GGE suggested that 'cybercrime is frequently used to disguise attacks against critical infrastructure [and] undermine [the] political and economic situation of governments' (Ministry of Foreign Affairs Citation 2022). Moscow has sought to criminalise 'unlawful interference' with critical infrastructure and critical information infrastructure (CII) since the first session of AHC negotiations, notwithstanding initial opposition from the US and like-minded countries in the European Union (Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes Citation 2023; \"EU Statement - UN Ad-Hoc Committee for a UN Convention on Cybercrime: Objectives and Scope of the Convention and EEAS.\" Citation 2022). Specifically, the Russian proposal suggests that parties should adopt 'legislative and other measures as are necessary under domestic law' to criminalise the creation of software or other digital information that can interfere with CII to destroy, impede or even copy information contained therein (Russia First Draft Article Citation 10 bis Citation 2021) [emphasis added]. The proposal makes clear that surveillance and intelligence-gathering operations would be covered under its remit. Further, the provision also criminalises non-compliance by private actors with government-issued guidelines related to securing CII if such non-compliance results in an attack or damage to information systems. The effect of this proposal is that multinational companies who supply or operate industrial control systems could also be implicated by domestic penal provisions.\n\nIn the UNGA First Committee, China too has called on states to refrain from targeting the 'critical infrastructures of other states' (People's Republic of China Citation 2017). Further, China has passed domestic legislation protecting CII, imposing duties and responsibilities on operators (Data Security Law of the People's Republic of China Citation 2021). China's first",
    "submission at the AHC sought to criminalise the ‘intrusion and destruction of ICTs facilities, systems, data or CII’. The Chinese proposal seeks to criminalise not only illegal ‘access’ and ‘interference’ with computer data and ‘information systems’ but also the lesser ‘infringement of critical information infrastructure’ (China Suggestion, Article Citation 3 ( Citation 1 ) Citation 2021 ). The protection of CII is also flagged by several joint Russian and Chinese proposals on international cooperation in the AHC. One such proposal seeks an ‘equal right’ to states for ‘the protection of its information resources and critical information infrastructures from misuse and unauthorised interference’ (Russia Joint Proposal June Citation 2022 , Art. 46 (5)). As the above statements indicate, China and Russia’s emphasis at the AHC is on CII, and not CI per se . While most countries share common perceptions of what constitutes CII (ITU-World Bank Citation 2021 ; Cybersecurity Authority of Singapore Citation 2018 ; Russia First Draft Citation 2021 ), it is still important to distinguish it from critical infrastructure. CII refers to information or communication systems or any other network resources that are by themselves required for discharging ‘vital’ services within a nation or essential to the uninterrupted functioning of critical infrastructure such as industrial control systems. Broad international convergence on many definitional aspects of CII notwithstanding, China’s position in particular – underpinned by its domestic law – is notable in the present context. China’s CII Security Protection Regulations, which took effect in 2021, defines CII to include systems whose ‘data leakage’ may ‘gravely harm’, inter alia , the ‘public interest’ (Data Security Law of the People’s Republic of China Citation 2021 ). In contrast, the EU’s focus, for example, is on the destruction or disruption of such infrastructure. Consistent with Russian proposals (Russia First Draft Citation 2021 , Article 11), and reading China’s AHC proposals alongside its domestic regulation (China’s Suggestion Citation 2021 , Article 3(2)), it would appear that Beijing has pursued a catch-all approach to CII as well as actions targeting such infrastructure that would be proscribed (including surveillance and espionage).\n\nWhile the Russian proposal on CII was removed in the Draft Text of the Convention (DTC) tabled by the AHC Chair before the Sixth Negotiating Session in September 2023, Moscow proposed its reintroduction into the negotiating process in the final session (Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes Citation 2023 , Article 10 bis). Notably, China did not support Russia's proposal to reintroduce criminal provisions on CII. US agencies assess that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been targeting and compromising US critical infrastructure potentially to leverage such access during conflict (United States Department of Defense Citation 2023 ; Washington Post Citation 2023 ). If accurate, these assessments would partly explain China's reluctance to push harder for criminal penalties against compromising CII through a cybercrime treaty. There is also the important consideration, noted at the beginning of this article, of China's global economic interests in cyberspace which outstrip those of Russia. China arguably would consider itself better off with some cybercrime treaty than none at all, which Russia's maximalist bargaining threatened to do at various stages of the AHC.",
    "## 4.3. Cyber-enabled espionage\n\nA related issue on which China and Russia have both floated AHC proposals is espionage. The issue of cyber-enabled espionage has been the proverbial ‘elephant in the room’ as far as international cybersecurity discussions are concerned (Broeders Citation 2024). Save for the US—China cybersecurity agreement that proscribed espionage for economic purposes (Yoo Citation 2015), there are no major international agreements that address the issue, either in terms of legal provisions or normative guardrails. On the other hand, China and Russia have sought to use the AHC negotiations on cybercrime to address cross-border espionage. To be sure, the Budapest Convention calls on states to criminalise electronic ‘interception without right’ that is committed ‘intentionally’. States could also require commission with ‘dishonest intent’ (Budapest Convention Citation 2001, Article 3) for criminality. However, as scholars have noted, the Budapest Convention only addresses the criminality of individual actions, and therefore is limited in addressing state espionage (Crootof Citation 2019; Rowe Citation 2020).\n\nIn contrast, China proposed at the AHC negotiations to hold states accountable for the interception of data (China Suggestion, Article Citation 4 (Citation 1) Citation 2022). The proposal read:\n\nStates shall not directly collect the data stored in foreign states from enterprises or individuals by technical means bypassing network security protection measures if such measures are against the laws of that foreign state.\n\nThe proposal not only highlighted a restriction on state activity, but also specifically emphasised the need to shield ‘enterprises and individuals’ from espionage activities. The Budapest Convention, in comparison, only refers to interception ‘to and from’ computer systems. While cyber operations that ‘bypass network security protection measures’ could refer to both disruptive operations as well as cyber-enabled espionage, China’s proposal should be read in the context of its domestic measures aimed at countering espionage. In 2023, China revised its counter-espionage law to include expansively the protection of ‘documents, data, materials and items related to national security and interests’ (Zhang Citation 2023). The revision specifically emphasised cyber operations, whether destructive or intelligence-gathering in nature, that targeted critical information infrastructure and ‘confidential-related units’ within state organs in China. The objective of the revised law is ostensibly to discourage multinational corporations and their employees from collaborating with foreign spy agencies (Marsh and Waldersee Citation 2023; Reuters Citation 2023) and has even resulted in the detention of a foreign national accused of spying (Global Times Citation 2023a; Global Times Citation 2023b). The geopolitical context is especially significant: in light of Chinese attempts to isolate itself from much of the world in the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, Western intelligence agencies have publicly emphasised the need to build ‘strong human intelligence capability’ in the country (Barnes and Wong Citation 2023; CGTN Citation 2023). Through its AHC proposal,",
    "China sought not only to secure an international commitment that mirrored its domestic law but ultimately to provide it the legal imprimatur to thwart and deter US and Western intelligence operations that undermine its geopolitical or geoeconomic interests (Azcarate Citation 2023). Meanwhile, Beijing itself has reportedly leaned on proxy actors who make use of increasingly sophisticated methods for cyber espionage, that gives it greater room for deniability. Take for instance, the use by Chinese actors of disaggregate, compromised nodes such as private servers and IoT devices that make attribution to a single group or entity challenging (Raggi Citation 2024).\n\nRussia's original proposal tabled at the first AHC session similarly sought to criminalise the use of 'technical means to intercept traffic data and data processed by means of ICT that are not intended for public use' (Russia First Draft Citation 2021, Article 7). This is similar to the formulation in the Budapest Convention, although it is slightly modified to stipulate that interception carried out without 'appropriate authorisation' or in 'violation of established rules' should be unlawful. The Budapest Convention's formulation on interception, as noted previously, is more permissive towards espionage and only proscribes those operations conducted 'without right' by another state. Russia's standard is narrower, and allows for states to determine by domestic regulation what constitutes 'inappropriate' interception.\n\n## 4.4. Enhancing sovereign capacity against domestic and extraterritorial threats\n\nA second set of AHC proposals by Russia and China seeks to enhance the ability of governments to 'detect, suppress, investigate and prosecute' criminal activities – designated so by domestic law – within their own territories but also abroad (DTC September 2023, Article 1(1); Russia First Draft Citation 2021, Article 31). The latter objective has been sought through procedural measures that ease access to electronic evidence located in other countries and the dilution of human rights safeguards, especially in relation to the handling of data transferred between states. In promoting these proposals, China and Russia's overarching goal is arguably to limit the power of multinational technology companies as well as civil society organisations and coalitions, which are mainly based in, or draw their market strength or legitimacy from, advanced liberal economies. As highlighted previously, the effect of these proposals would be to limit the technical standard or policy-setting capacity of influential private actors on data governance and security, such as encryption and data storage. Admittedly, these proposals would also limit the ability of Chinese and Russian companies to set standards and shape policy. This outcome is in line with the heightened degrees of control, both from a policy and corporate governance perspective, that both states have exerted over their major technology players in recent years (Zhang Citation 2024).\n\nWe study six sets of proposals within this broader category (see) that advance this objective.",
    "## 4.5. Addressing ‘cyber-enabled’ crimes\n\nThe first category of proposals pertains to the types of crimes that can be prosecuted through the AHC convention. Both states have sought the criminalisation of ‘cyber-enabled’ crimes, i.e. crimes that have an ICT component relevant to their commission, as opposed to ‘cyber-dependent’ crimes, which fit more the traditional ‘CIA’ crimes – targeted by the Budapest Convention – that affect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of systems (Wilkinson Citation 2023). Many of these cyber-enabled crimes relate to the publication of online content, which is tightly regulated in authoritarian states. The AHC’s title itself – a committee to elaborate a treaty on ‘the use of ICTs for criminal purposes’ – was the effort of Russian resolutions at the UN General Assembly (Wilkinson Citation 2023). Non-government organizations (NGOs) and civil society organisations have not only decried the inclusion of content-related crimes as posing a ‘heightened risk’ (Privacy International and Electronic Frontier Foundation Citation 2022) to the exercise of human rights but also as impeding the work of journalists or whistle-blowers (Electronic Frontier Foundation Citation 2022). Russia and China have sought also to criminalise, respectively, ‘digital data to mislead the user’ and the ‘dissemination of false information’ (Martin Citation 2023), although these proposals have generated concern among industry and civil society (Bannelier Citation 2023). Neither formulation appears to have made it to the final rounds of negotiations. Russia, along with a number of developing countries, also proposed an all-encompassing clause to ensure the cybercrime treaty did not ‘preclude a State Party from establishing as an offence any other unlawful act committed intentionally with the use of information and communication technologies that causes significant damage’, which remains a legally ambiguous threshold (DTC September 2023, Art. 15 undecies). Targeting a broad range of ‘cyber-enabled crimes’ mirrors domestic criminal law provisions in both China and Russia and has been viewed by some experts as a means of legitimising and exporting their domestic governance models (Iyengar, Gamer and Rathi Citation 2023). Instrumentally, China’s focus has been on crimes faced by its own law enforcement agencies (Zhang and Creemers Citation 2024). Wider criminal provisions in domestic law and international treaty law boost state authority to assert control over individuals and companies that use cyberspace.\n\n## 4.6. Provisions on mutual legal assistance, human rights, jurisdiction and non-state actors\n\nBeyond seeking an expansive scope for the cybercrime treaty, we identify five areas where China and Russia have pushed for greater power for states to regulate digital activities at home and abroad. First, Russia has sought through the AHC convention to limit exemptions and safeguards against mutual legal assistance (MLA) requests by a state. These include rejecting clauses that allow states to refuse MLA requests for the prosecution of political offences (DTC September 2023, Art. 40 Clause 21 (c) bis) or those motivated by a ‘person's sex, race, language, religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinions’ (DTC September 2023, Art. 40 Clause 21 (c) ter).",
    "Second, both China and Russia have advocated procedural reforms to domestic criminal law that would enable the easier prosecution of crimes committed through the use of ICTs. Russia has sought to ‘ensure that electronic evidence derived or extracted from [any ICT] shall have the probative value in criminal procedure’ (DTC September 2023, Article 30 bis). China and Russia have suggested that states should establish ‘relevant legal procedures and technical standards for the collection, retention and provision of electronic evidence to ensure the authenticity, integrity and legality of electronic evidence’ (DTC September 2023, Article 30 ter).\n\nThird, these states have, along with others, sought to limit human rights safeguards against the prosecution of cybercrime. Russia has objected to several proposals that introduce human rights safeguards against criminal prosecution, including in the case of ‘persons and groups in vulnerable situations’ (DTC September 2023, Article 5(2)). Moscow has also rejected a proposal to include the effective protection of human rights as a key element of cross-border technical assistance and capacity-building (DTC September 2023, Article 54). While China has not backed Russia on the proposal to remove human rights safeguards altogether, it has resisted attempts to introduce oversight mechanisms or limitations in the way governments can process and retain personal data transferred between states under the AHC convention (DTC September 2023, Article 36 sub-clause 2). Russia has also sought the use of the term ‘unlawful’ across the Consolidated Negotiation Text of the AHC draft to refer to specific acts that invite criminal prosecution. In contrast, the US, EU and like-minded countries prefer the phrase ‘without right’, which is more commonly used in the Budapest Convention. This distinction is important: ‘unlawful’ actions would be determined solely on the basis of domestic legislation, whereas the more permissive formulation ‘without right’ acknowledges the universal legitimacy of certain actions, such as accessing a free and open public computer system, instituting ‘protection activities’ (such as stronger encryption or cybersecurity safeguards) with the permission of those involved in transmitting data, or those actions taken in the pursuit of human rights such as privacy or free expression (Budapest Convention Citation 2001).\n\nFourth, Russia and China’s efforts to regulate extraterritorial activity go beyond proposals for expansive MLA. Notably, Russia has sought to extend states’ jurisdiction to cases in which ‘the offence is committed wholly or partly outside [their territory] but its effect in the territory [would] constitute an offence or result in the commission of an offense’ (DTC September 2023, Art. 22 sub-clause 2 c bis). Similarly, Russia has sought automatic jurisdiction for states if the ‘offence is committed against the State Party’ (DTC September 2023, Article 22 sub-clause 2 d). China has qualified its support to Russia’s invocation of the ‘effects doctrine’ Footnote ⁵ (Estey Citation 1997). Jurisdiction, in China’s view, should be based on a ‘true and sufficient’ link with criminal activities, giving priority to the place where the consequence of criminal activity occurs, where it is committed and the location of the perpetrator (China Suggestion Citation 3 (Citation 7) Citation 2022).",
    "Finally, both states have sought explicit control over internet service providers by national agencies. Such proposals have been an integral part of all Russian and Chinese drafts and contributions made to the AHC over six negotiating sessions. In its first draft proposal submitted to the AHC, Russia included two articles that specifically address the role of the private sector and ISPs, and also sought a code of conduct for their governance (Russian Federation Citation 2021, Article 43). China's proposals, while not as extensive, require companies and service providers to 'take technical measures and other necessary measures to effectively respond to criminal activities' (China's Suggestion Citation 2022, Article 3 (6)). Notably, both states have sought the criminalisation of the 'unlawful provision of service', understood as the providing of essentially any digitally-enabled service with 'the intent that the service or technical support be used for the commission of any of the offences' (DTC September 2023, Article 10 ter). Presumably, the service provider's 'intent' in this case would be discerned by states themselves, which enables the prosecution of any service provider that does not restrict internet services to communities or geographic areas proscribed by the state. Given the broad scope of offences that Russia and China, along with other authoritarian regimes, want to criminalise, this proposal could severely restrict the scope of operation of Virtual Private Networks or even secure messaging platforms that are set up with the intention of enabling secure and private communication away from the gaze of the state. These proposals are notable and offer important context to what China sees as the role of ISPs in 'decentralised internet infrastructure' models that it has floated at standards bodies.\n\nRussia's push for greater control over extraterritorial activity also throws into relief its original justification for not signing the Budapest Convention. Moscow has long expressed concerns over Article 32 of the Budapest Convention because it enables cross-border law enforcement access to territorial data without authorisation from the respective State Party. At the AHC negotiations, Russia has proposed that all cooperation under the cybercrime convention happens exclusively with the authorisation of State Parties. The cumulative effect of Russia's proposals would be that states become the sole arbiters of cross-border data access, but also have few procedural safeguards or human rights restrictions to refuse sharing data with other governments.\n\n# 5. Cybercrime negotiations and the future of the liberal cyber order\n\nRussia and China's proposals at the AHC reflect their efforts to shape systemically the governance of cyberspace, away from its liberal underpinnings. They attempt to reconfigure the norms and rules governing international relations in cyberspace by casting the territorial state as its main actor. Much like Western states have benefitted from a liberal order rooted in the dilution of the territorial state and the delegation of key cyberspace governance functions to private actors",
    "(Farrell and Newman Citation 2021), Russia and China seek geopolitical advantages from the alternative order they propose.\n\nDraft measures on the protection of CII and the criminalisation of cyber-enabled espionage constrain the freedom that Western intelligence agencies and commands enjoy in cyberspace for information-gathering and disruptive operations. On the other hand, stronger control over online content and the activities of digital services providers as well as weaker procedural and substantive safeguards on cross-border data-sharing between governments ensure that states can regulate private actors at home and also exert control over the data of users and entities held abroad (Harvey and Moore Citation 2022). The goal of these proposals is to limit the autonomy and influence of (mostly) Western technology companies in determining data flows and cybersecurity outcomes through their in-house policies and technical standards (Klonick Citation 2017).\n\nRussia and China's pursuit of an alternative cyber order is backed by several statements on issues discussed in the paper. While a detailed examination of these statements and strategies is outside the scope of this paper, we highlight a few notable examples. Beijing's repeated references to the US's 'empire of hacking' (Reuters Citation 2023) and Moscow's claims of US targeting critical infrastructure for subversive 'political and economic' operations suggest that their proposals at the AHC are motivated by overarching geopolitical motives, rather than by narrow domestic ones (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Citation 2022). Further, both countries have tried to use the platform of the AHC to promote their model among developing countries through language referencing the need for a systemic shift in cyberspace governance. China has declared that the AHC treaty should 'adjust [to] and create new contours for ensuring the security of states' (China Intervention Sixth Session Morning, UN Web TV 2023, 01:01:00 to 01:07:00). This messaging has been emphasised repeatedly by the Russian delegation as well. An article written by the Deputy Head of the Russian delegation amidst the AHC negotiations argued that the 'prospects for the global digitalisation process as a whole, the effectiveness and dynamics which depend on ensuring security, are in question' (Chernukhin Citation 2023).\n\nIndeed, Russia and China's diplomatic strategies at the AHC appear to exploit the Global South's 'discontent' against the LIO (Endaylalu Citation 2022). Both states have argued that debates on human rights are manufactured by states (liberal economies) who seek to 'retain their dominant position in the information sphere' at the cost of 'practical cooperation' on cybercrime (Russian Federation Citation 2022). In other words, the messaging here is not that human rights are bad, but that developing nations have more urgent priorities which are not highlighted in the current order. Relatedly, both states have also underlined the need for new rules to prosecute cybercrime, appealing to the deeply felt sentiment among African and Asian countries to be norm-makers and not norm-takers (Acharya Citation 2011). China's opening intervention at AHC negotiations stressed that including 'cyber-enabled crimes' in the cybercrime treaty is a way of ensuring that international law kept 'pace with the trends' (China, Intervention Sixth Session Morning, UN",
    "Web TV 2023, 01:01:00 to 01:07:00). Russia has emphasised the fact that many countries stayed away from the Budapest Convention because they were not involved in its creation (Seger Citation 2016), denouncing the instrument as having failed to win the 'minds and hearts' of the developing world (Chernukhin Citation 2023).\n\nAs illustrates, Russia and China's own cyber diplomacy at the AHC has received steady support from some of its allies, but many developing countries and emerging powers (Chivvis and Geaghan-Breiner Citation 2024) have largely remained silent in response.\n\n# Table 2. States' responses to China and Russia's proposals at September 2023 negotiations.\n\nThe Draft Text of Convention (DTC) circulated by the AHC's chair in September 2023 omitted several proposals from China and Russia, especially on the scope and coverage of 'cyber-enabled crimes' as well as protection of CII. However, Russia attempted to reinsert all those proposals back into the DTC as red-line edits. China, as has illustrated, appears to have been less persistent in terms of reintroducing its original proposals. China's more moderate approach, as indicated in the first half of this paper, arguably reflects its heightened economic stake in cyberspace, compared to Russia's all-or-nothing strategy. Further, Russia's approach to the AHC negotiations reflects its strategy in the UN GGE and UN OEWG, where it scoped out similarly maximalist positions before engaging in last-minute, backroom deals to secure consensus within both groups. Chinese cyber diplomacy generally tends to avoid such grand bargains, and in the AHC appears to have prioritised some of its proposals over others.\n\nRegardless of their outcomes, it is clear from Russia and China's proposals that both states view the proposed AHC convention on cybercrime as an opportunity to chart new rules for the road for cyberspace. In a domain characterised mainly by informal norms of responsible behaviour and technical standards – a consequence of the liberal ordering of cyberspace – both states have arguably found it difficult to challenge the economic and normative clout of major private actors and to constrain the strategic advantages of powerful Western adversaries. They have sought consequently to use the prospective AHC treaty to usher in a cyber order that lends primacy to the territorial state – not only to govern domestic digital activity but also to shape international data flows and the use of offensive cyber capabilities.\n\n# Acknowledgement\n\nThe authors thank Isabella Wilkinson for comments on a previous draft of this article.",

    "abstract": "Cyberspace is still characterised by features that draw from the liberal international order into which it was born: namely, open data flows and multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms that allow private actors to shape global technical or normative standards. The application of this 'liberal cyber order' has been resisted by Russia and China who seek a greater role for the territorial state in cyberspace governance. They have long sought new, binding rules to this effect with little success. The UN cybercrime convention bucks the trend of informal, non-binding agreements in this domain. Through an empirical analysis of proposals advanced by Russia and China during negotiations toward the cybercrime convention, this article demonstrates how they have sought to use it to develop rules that blunt the advantages enjoyed by Western liberal economies and major transnational actors in the current order. Going beyond the regulation of cybercrime, Russian and Chinese proposals empower states to thwart disruptive and intelligence-gathering cyber operations that may be conducted globally by Western adversaries. Additionally, they enhance the state's regulatory capacity over private actors at home and abroad, limiting the ability of businesses or NGOs to shape cybersecurity and human rights standards around the transfer, retention and access of data.",
