This right has as corollary a duty: the obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States, in particular their\n¹ On the principle of due diligence, see, generally: the seminal work of Joanna Kulesza, *Due Diligence in International Law* (Brill &amp; Martinus Nijhoff Publishers 2016); Riccardo Pisillo Mazzeschi, *‘Due diligence’ e responsabilità internazionale degli stati* (Giuffrè 1989).

As mentioned, the obligation of due diligence developed in various branches of international law, but the notion is also used to describe other forms of legal or political obligations, within and outside the realm of international law. Broadly, due diligence is understood as a standard of conduct required to discharge an obligation. In other words, due diligence is often referred to as representing a certain standard of conduct that should be observed by States or other actors in performing particular acts or regarding specific obligations. The recent discussion in the European Journal of International Law on the ‘human rights due diligence’ in the 2011 United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights perfectly highlights the risk of confusion between the various dimensions of due diligence, and notably the ongoing debate on the due diligence of both private and public actors.¹⁹ The development of ICT technologies also raises the question of the due diligence obligations of both public and private actors. Alongside the obligation for a State not to allow knowingly its ICT infrastructure to be used for malicious acts, there are also the questions, for instance, of the duties of private companies not to let their ICT infrastructure be used for such acts and to avoid releasing software flawed with vulnerabilities.²⁰ The private sector’s due diligence is outside the scope of this book. Consequently, it seems necessary to clarify that the present chapter focuses exclusively on due diligence understood as ‘every State’s obligation not to\n¹⁶ Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

International law is primarily the law of States and it cannot generally be enforced directly upon non-state actors. The principle of due diligence renders a State responsible or liable for the occurrence of acts of other actors, including non-state actors, perpetrated in its territory or jurisdiction in some specific circumstances. This is the sense of the sixth norm of the 'Singapore Norm Package' adopted by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) in November 2018:\nNon-state actors should not engage in offensive cyber operations and state actors should prevent and respond to such activities if they occur.²⁵\n²¹ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22.\n²² Karine Bannelier-Christakis, 'Obligations de diligence dans le cyberespace: qui a peur de la cyber-diligence?'

The GCSC demonstrates here how this principle is relevant to regulating such a situation, emphasising in the commentary to the norm that ‘[i]f states permit such action, they may therefore be held responsible under international law. States must act, domestically and internationally, to prevent offensive cyber operations by non-state actors.’²⁶\nThe UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security integrated cyber due diligence into its 2013 report as a norm of behaviour, and again in its 2015 report. The report stated that ‘States should seek to ensure that their territories are not used by non-State actors for unlawful use of ICTs’.²⁷\nSimilarly, the experts involved in the Tallinn Manual process agreed on the application of the principle of due diligence. In the Tallinn Manual 1.0, Rule 5²⁸ dealt with the principle of due diligence, and the commentary makes clear that the experts disagreed on the particular features of this principle.²⁹ In the Tallinn Manual 2.0,³⁰ Rule 6 rephrases\n²⁶ ibid 19 (footnote omitted).\n²⁷ UNGA, ‘Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ (24 June 2013) UN Doc A/68/98, para 23. In its reply to this report, Germany referred to the principle of due diligence and its application to cyber operations: ‘States should take all necessary measures to ensure that their territories are not used by other States or by non-State actors for purposes of unlawful use of information and communications technology against other States and their interests’; quoted in UNGA, ‘Report of the Secretary-General on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (Addendum)’ (9 September 2013) UN Doc A/68/156/Add.1 9.\n²⁸ Michael N Schmitt (ed), Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (CUP 2013) 26, Rule 5 (‘A State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States.’). In addition, the Tallinn Manual states that a neutral State to an international armed conflict should not allow its cyber infrastructure to be used by the belligerent parties: ibid 252, Rule 93.

Ian Yuying Liu wrote an article analysing the Tallinn Manual 2.0’s rules on due diligence as well as the reluctance of some States regarding the application of the principle of due diligence to cyber conducts: Ian Yuying Liu, ‘The Due Diligence Doctrine under Tallinn Manual 2.0’ (2017) 33 Computer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 390. Michael\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nand modifies the fifth Rule of the first edition, and reads: '[a] State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States';[31] in addition, Rule 7 deals with compliance with the due diligence principle and recalls that States are required to take all feasible measures that are foreseeable.[32]\nThe application of the principle of due diligence to the cyber realm remains, however, a controversial issue. Some States are reluctant to extend this principle to cyberspace because of the corresponding obligations it would impose on them.[33] Moreover, another difficulty arises concerning the distinction between States from which the cyber operation is launched and States of transit, that is to say States through which the cyber operation is routed. The present chapter asserts that the principle of due diligence is applicable to cyber operations, and analyses how it applies and what the corresponding obligations that it imposes on States are. The duty of cyber due diligence may be seen as a coin with two faces; on the one side, there is the duty to prevent the use of the ICT infrastructure (8.1), and on the other, there is the obligation to take measures to terminate a cyber operation that has been detected (8.3). This chapter also analyses whether the invocation of the principle of due diligence is subject to a threshold of harm (8.2). Moreover, this chapter investigates two possible variations of due diligence regarding cyber operations, that may be developed in the future: the creation of a duty to (i) prevent the potential transboundary harm caused by cyber operations (8.4) and (ii) disclose zero-day vulnerabilities (8.5).\n## 8.1 Does a Duty to Prevent Any Use of State Cyber Infrastructures Exist?\nDoes a State have a general duty to prevent any use of its cyber infrastructure for the perpetration by another State, or by non-state actors, of a cyber operation against another State? Such obligation may be\nN Schmitt published an article highlighting some points dealt with in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that would deserve further work, including due diligence: Michael N Schmitt, 'Grey Zones in the International Law of Cyberspace' (2017) 42 The Yale Journal of International Law Online 1, 11-13.\n31 Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 30.\n32 ibid 43.\n33 Schmitt, 'Due Diligence in Cyberspace' (n 22) 71, 73; Liu (n 30).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO PREVENT\n359\nconsidered as implying a duty on the State to monitor all Internet traffic emanating from and transiting via its territory or via cyber infrastructures under its control. There is no general duty to monitor and control the Internet traffic emanating from and transiting via the territory of a State or via cyber infrastructures under its control. In any case, this is unlikely to happen for two reasons: firstly, it could constitute a justification for mass-surveillance programmes and is also irrelevant for the objective pursued (8.1.2); secondly, there is no obligation for a State to know everything about what is happening on its territory (8.1.1). Finally, it is necessary to distinguish between situations where cyber operations only use the cyber infrastructures of a State and situations where there is also a physical dimension on the territory of the State (8.1.3).\n## 8.1.1 A State Has No Obligation to Have Absolute Knowledge of All Events and Activities on Its Territory or in Cyber Infrastructures under Its Control\nUnder international law, a State is not obliged to have absolute knowledge of all events and activities happening on its territory. As recalled by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case:\nit cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known, of any unlawful act perpetrated therein, nor yet that it necessarily knew, or should have known, the authors.³⁴\nThe fact that the cyber operation emanates from or transits through the computer networks located on the territory of a State does not render this State responsible, nor does it transfer the burden of proof onto, this State.³⁵\nA State is under the obligation to take all feasible measures to prevent the use of its territory for activities that breach the rights of other States. As already mentioned, it is an obligation of conduct – to take measures – and not of result.\nI agree with the experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that the obligation of due diligence of a State applies regarding cyber activities taking place on its territory and extends extraterritorially to those taking place on\n³⁴ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 18.\n³⁵ ibid.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\ncontrolled territory abroad, as well as in cyber infrastructure located abroad under its control.³⁶\nIn the cyber realm, does this obligation impose a duty on the State to monitor the Internet traffic emanating from and transiting via its cyber infrastructure? The next section demonstrates why the question should be answered negatively.\n## 8.1.2 The Slippery Slope of Justifying Mass Surveillance\nA general duty to know what is happening in the computer networks of a State may be understood as implying mass and indiscriminate surveillance of these networks by the State. Thus, such a duty would serve as a justification for mass surveillance. Not only does it risk a slippery slope in terms of civil liberties and human rights, but it would also be of limited relevance for the duty of diligence, as detailed below.\nThe mass surveillance programme of the NSA was, at its best, able to monitor 75 per cent of US Internet traffic.³⁷ Thus, it was not able to monitor all the traffic emanating or transiting through the State. Even if it was possible to monitor all the Internet traffic, the treatment of the monitored data would necessitate too much work to be relevant or even attainable. Indeed, in the case of the mass-surveillance programme, the objective is generally to filter specific communications or the use of specific words, i.e. there is something to look for. In the case of cyber operations, they can take a wide variety of forms and it would be almost impossible to identify specific filters that would allow them to be detected. Monitoring the metadata would not suffice. It would be necessary to undertake a deep inspection of each packet of data to determine its real content and the purpose of this content. Moreover, it is not very difficult to embed a malicious code into another code of legitimate software; therefore, it would be necessary to be able to distinguish which part of the code belongs to the malware. The perpetrators would also sooner or later understand how the filters operate and would be able to adapt the structure of their malicious code to address the new situation, therefore always managing to find cracks in the system and to exploit\n³⁶ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 32–33, commentary to Rule 6, paras 8–10.\n³⁷ Jennifer Valentino-Devries and Siobhan Gorman, ‘New Details Show Broader NSA Surveillance Reach: Programs Cover 75% of Nation’s Traffic, Can Snare Emails’, Wall Street Journal (20 August 2013) www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324108204579022874091732470.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO PREVENT\n361\nthem. From this perspective, it can be noted that States having mass surveillance programmes, such as the United States, are still unable to prevent cyber operations from entering their networks and damaging their cyber infrastructure. On top of all these difficulties and as a final remark, most cyber operations take place within very short lapses of time, often only a few seconds. By extension, this means that monitoring and identifications processes have to take place within a very short timeframe.³⁸ This is almost unachievable, given the current state of technology. Because the objective is to prevent the transit of a cyber operation in a State infrastructure, the response must take place at the same time as the identification. Perhaps technological evolution, which is unfolding rapidly in the cyber realm, will be able to offer us new solutions to these difficulties which can improve the technical appropriateness and abilities of such monitoring techniques (for instance the development of artificial intelligence).³⁹ Irrespective of these new developments, the legal problems that they trigger would not change. In addition to this, as noted by Michael N Schmitt, '[t]here appears to be an emerging consensus among scholars and state legal advisers against the existence of obligations either to monitor cyber activities on one's territory or to prevent malicious use of cyber infrastructure located within one's borders'.⁴⁰ I believe that all these reasons demonstrate the irrelevance of implementing mass monitoring in the cyber infrastructures of a State for the purposes of due diligence.\nOne may argue that the surveillance activities of a State are limited by international law, human rights law and domestic law,⁴¹ which would limit the possible negative consequences. Yet, taking this approach would be a very slippery slope with almost no value in preventing cyber threats from using the computer networks of a State.\nAs often noted already, the duty of diligence is only an obligation of conduct and not of result. Nonetheless, a requirement to monitor Internet traffic would then transform into a justification for mass-surveillance programmes without actually making much contribution to fulfilling this duty. The duty of diligence must not constitute an excessive burden on\n³⁸ Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual* (n 28) 27, commentary to Rule 5, para 4; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 28.\n³⁹ Schmitt, *'Due Diligence in Cyberspace'* (n 22) 72–73.\n⁴⁰ *ibid* 75.\n⁴¹ Bannelier-Christakis (n 22) 644; Bannelier and Christakis (n 4) 20; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 30.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nthe State, and the implementation of such monitoring would represent a twofold excessive burden – on the State's capacities and human rights law. Thus, such an obligation would be considered unreasonable.\nThe situation may differ if such monitoring capacities already exist. In such cases, does the State with monitoring capacities have an obligation to use them in order to comply with its due diligence obligations? The short answer is yes. The State has an obligation to use any means at its disposal to comply with its due diligence duty. Thus, the duty of diligence does not oblige the State to implement a monitoring programme for Internet traffic, but when such capacities already exist, then the State has to use them. The content of the duty of diligence depends on the capacity of each State. The ILA's first report on due diligence highlighted this point in regard to due diligence in human rights law and international environmental law.⁴² It stressed that it was necessary to differentiate between the treatment of developed States and that of developing ones, as they may not have the same capacity to control and to comply with their due diligence duty. Similarly, in cyberspace not all States are equal and some may be better equipped to comply with their obligations than others,⁴³ in particular those where a mass-surveillance programme already exists and therefore may be used to monitor cyber activities. The burden of the duty of diligence must be reasonable, however. It cannot exceed the State's capacity.\nIn sum, the duty of diligence does not impose a duty on States to monitor the Internet traffic of cyber infrastructures located on their territory,⁴⁴ nor to develop the necessary technologies to perform such monitoring. In the case of a State having already developed the capabilities to conduct such monitoring programmes, to comply with the obligation of diligence this State would have to use these capabilities. It must be highlighted that such situation does not legitimate nor preclude the potential wrongfulness of such capabilities under domestic or international laws.\n## 8.1.3 The Difference between Cyber Operations Launched from or Solely Transiting through the Territory of the State\nIt is impossible to completely separate cyber operations from the physical world. A cyber operation that is simply transiting through the territory of\n⁴² ILA Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law – First Report (n 1) respectively 18 and 27.\n⁴³ Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 74–75.\n⁴⁴ For a similar view, see Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 43–46, commentary to Rule 7, paras 3–13.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE ABSENCE OF A THRESHOLD OF HARM\na State only requires electronic impulses via cables and devices, and this transit lasts less than a second in most cases. Conversely, the launch of a cyber operation from the territory of a State would take more than just a few electronic impulses. It would also integrate a physical dimension in most cases. Two situations should be distinguished from one another: firstly, the launch of a cyber operation via a cyber infrastructure that is remotely under the control of the perpetrator; secondly, the launch of a cyber operation from the territory of a State.\nA cyber operation can be launched via a cyber infrastructure located on the territory of one State, but be infected and controlled by the perpetrators located in another. This is, for instance, the case with bots, also known as 'zombified' computers, which are used to perpetrate DDoS attacks. The perpetrators of a DDoS attack targeting State A may be located in State B, using a botnet of 'zombified' computers located in States X, Y and Z. In this situation, what obligation arises in terms of due diligence of States X, Y and Z? Here again, they have no obligation to monitor their Internet traffic nor to know of all events and activities happening in the cyber infrastructure on their territory. The situation may be different if, as we will see in the next section, they know or should know about the malicious use of the controlled infrastructures on their territory.\nIn the case of a cyber operation launched directly from the territory of a State, for example by an organised group located on its territory, the duty of diligence applies. The territorial State has, in such cases, means other than solely cyber ones to make itself aware of such use. In the case of highly sophisticated cyber operations, the preparatory phases often involve physical input that may be detectable by the State. For instance, it may be visible that something is under preparation or already happening owing to an increase in activity of a specific group already under scrutiny by the State.\nI will come back to the distinction between State of transit and State of launch, and the consequences of this distinction for the application of the principle of due diligence to cyber operations, in the third section (8.3).\n## 8.2 The Absence of a Threshold of Harm\nThe experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 condition the applicability of the principle of due diligence to two cumulative requirements: firstly, the cyber operation concerned must be 'contrary to the rights' of the affected\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nState under international law; and, secondly, it must have ‘serious adverse consequences’.⁴⁵ Moreover, they also ‘concurred that the due diligence principle extends to cyber operations conducted by non-State actors that, while not violating international law per se, nevertheless result in serious adverse consequences and [...] affect the right of the target State’.⁴⁶ In addition, they note that the threshold of harm does not depend on the occurrence of ‘physical damage to objects or injuries to individuals’.⁴⁷\nThe first requirement derives directly from the dictum of the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case,⁴⁸ and does not raise any specific issue. The second requirement, the threshold of harm, may be more controversial. The commentary to Rule 6 states that:\nThe precise threshold of harm at which the due diligence principle applies is unsettled in international law. All of the Experts agreed that the due diligence requirement arises when the situation involves a cyber operation that results in ‘serious adverse consequences’, although they could identify no bright line threshold for the identification of such consequences. They adopted this standard by analogy from application of the due diligence principle in the context of international environmental law. Some of them supported a lower threshold of application for the Rule, for instance, by proposing the term ‘significant’ or ‘substantial’ in lieu of ‘serious’.⁴⁹\nIndeed, in the Trail Smelter arbitral award, the court held that under the principles of international law, as well as of the law of the United States:\nno State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein, when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is established by clear and convincing evidence.⁵⁰\nThus, this arbitral award recognised the existence of a threshold of harm regarding the application of the principle of due diligence in preventing transboundary environmental harm.⁵¹ On this basis, the experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 assert that a similar standard exists regarding cyber operations.\n⁴⁵ ibid 34, commentary to Rule 6, para 15.\n⁴⁶ ibid 35, commentary to Rule 6, para 21.\n⁴⁷ ibid 37–38, commentary to Rule 6, para 28.\n⁴⁸ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22.\n⁴⁹ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 36–37, commentary to Rule 6, para 25 (footnotes omitted).\n⁵⁰ Trail Smelter case (United States, Canada) (n 8) 1965.\n⁵¹ See generally Kulesza (n 1) 91–105.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE ABSENCE OF A THRESHOLD OF HARM\nFurther on the experts clarified their idea, as they agreed that ‘merely affecting the interests of the target State, as in the case of causing inconvenience, minor disruption, or negligible expense, is not the type of harm envisaged; thus, not every use of a State’s territory that produces negative effects for a target State implicates the due diligence principle’.⁵²\nI am not convinced that such requirement of a threshold of harm is part of the customary principle of due diligence, and thus of the *lex lata* applicable to cyber operations. In my view, the assessment of the intensity of the cyber operations concerned does not condition whether the State has the possibility of invoking the obligation of due diligence of the territorial State from the perspective of international law. Conversely, it may condition whether the State will actually invoke the obligation of due diligence of the territorial State. It is thus not a legal requirement, but a requirement regarding the opportunity for the State to invoke this principle, or not. More precisely, the occurrence of a damage or harm is not a necessary element of the principle of due diligence.⁵³ According to the principle, States must exercise due diligence in ensuring that territory and objects over which they enjoy sovereignty are not to be used to harm other States. This principle does not require that an actual harm or damage occurs; on the contrary, it relies on the potential damage or harm that may be suffered by the other States. Even if this damage or harm never materialises, the State still has to comply with its duty of diligence. Consequently, the second requirement of ‘serious adverse consequences’ does not seem to flow from general international law nor does it seem justified.\nIn that perspective, my analysis of the threshold of harm for the principle of due diligence asserted by the *Tallinn Manual 2.0* is similar to the one I have already made regarding the same proposed threshold for the qualification of the violation of territorial sovereignty.⁵⁴\nTo conclude, it seems that the general customary principle of due diligence does not involve a threshold of harm. However, such threshold has already been identified in specific dimensions of the principle of due diligence, as for instance regarding transboundary environmental harm,\n⁵² Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 37, commentary to Rule 6, para 26.\n⁵³ More generally, the occurrence of a damage is not a necessary element of an internationally wrongful act; see: ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (2001) 2 Yearbook of the International Law Commission (Part II) 31, 92, commentary to Article 21, para 6; James Crawford, *State Responsibility: The General Part* (CUP 2013) 54et seq.\n⁵⁴ See supra 5.3.2.2B The Absence of a Damage Requirement.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nand may translate into other dimensions in the future, including cyber operations. Indeed, it is important to distinguish the recourse to the principle of due diligence to establish, on the one hand, the responsibility of a State for not having complied with its due diligence obligations, from, on the other, the liability of a State for a significant transboundary harm. In the first case, which was developed in the present section, there is not a threshold of harm, while in the second case, which is developed later, in Section 8.4, such a threshold exists.\n## 8.3 The Duty of a State to Take Measures to Terminate an Unlawful Cyber Operation Using Its Infrastructure\nAnother principal component of the principle of due diligence is the obligation for a State that is aware of an unlawful cyber operation – which is using its cyber infrastructure – to take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate the operation.^[55]^ The resulting obligation has three dimensions: firstly, knowledge of the cyber operation by the territorial State (8.2.1); secondly, balancing the feasibility and reasonableness of the measures that should be taken (8.2.2); and finally, the distinction between cyber operations merely transiting via the State and those emanating from the territory of the State (8.2.3).\n## 8.3.1 Knowledge of the Territorial State\nAs a prerequisite, the territorial State has to be aware that a cyber operation is using its cyber infrastructure. Two situations should be distinguished from one another. Firstly, the victim State of a cyber operation has to notify the territorial State and ask it to take measures to terminate it. In such cases, there is no doubt that the territorial State is aware of the cyber operation and thus is obliged to take all feasible and reasonable measures against it. Secondly, the territorial State may also know about it even in the absence of notification by the victim State. In such circumstances, the burden of proof that the territorial State knows or should have known about the cyber operation is on the victim State. There is no transfer of the burden of proof as the territorial State has no\n^[55] Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 43, Rule 7; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 37; Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 72–75. See, more generally, Tehran Hostages (Judgment) (n 14) 32–33, para 68.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE DUTY TO TAKE MEASURES TO TERMINATE THE ACT 367\nobligation to have absolute knowledge of everything taking place on its territory.⁵⁶ When a State has actual knowledge, then it is without a shadow of a doubt bound by the duty of diligence.⁵⁷\nIs constructive knowledge sufficient? In other words, is the fact that a State should have known about the cyber operation enough? The experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 ‘agreed that knowledge encompasses constructive knowledge for the purpose of [Rule 6]’.⁵⁸ On the one hand, the territorial State ‘cannot evade such a request by limiting itself to a reply that it is ignorant of the circumstances of the act and of its authors. The State may, up to a certain point, be bound to supply particulars of the use made by it of the means of information and inquiry at its disposal.’⁵⁹ On the other, the standard of proof would be very high for the State invoking its responsibility to prove that the territorial State should have known. Ultimately, the State invoking non-compliance with the duty of diligence would have to prove that the territorial State actually knew, rather than should have known.\n## 8.3.2 Measures to Terminate the Cyber Operation\nA State that knows its territory is being used for the perpetration of an unlawful cyber operation must take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate it.⁶⁰ As an obligation of conduct and not of result, the State is expected to undertake its ‘best efforts’ to terminate the cyber operation, but would not bear responsibility only because it failed to terminate it.⁶¹ Conversely, if the State did not use all means at its disposal, and did not take all feasible and reasonable measures, it would not have fulfilled its obligation under the duty of diligence.\nIn a number of cases, the speed of cyber operations may render the principle of due diligence almost inapplicable. Some cyber operations only take milliseconds to launch, transit and produce effects, and thus the\n⁵⁶ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 18.\n⁵⁷ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 40, commentary to Rule 6, para 37; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 28–29.\n⁵⁸ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 41, commentary to Rule 6, para 39. Interestingly, the experts taking part in the first edition of the Tallinn Manual were split on this issue: Schmitt, Tallinn Manual (n 28) 28, commentary to Rule 5, para 11; see also Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 29.\n⁵⁹ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 18.\n⁶⁰ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 43, Rule 7.\n⁶¹ Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 7) 221, para 430.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nterritorial State would not have enough time to identify them and respond accordingly.⁶² Already in the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ highlighted the significance of the time dimension.⁶³ An instantaneous reaction is not expected from the territorial State, which must have enough time to be made aware and react. The speed of certain cyber operations renders reaction even more complicated. This is, however, not true of all cyber operations. Some have a continuous character, at least for some of the time. DDoS attacks, for instance, need to take place over a period of time to be effective. Similarly, complex cyber operations, such as Stuxnet, last for several years, during which time they may continuously communicate with their perpetrator and thus use cyber infrastructures located in various countries, for example remotely controlled servers. In such cases, the duty of diligence is particularly relevant. In the case of an ongoing DDoS attack, for instance, the victim State may make a request to the States in which the zombified computers and controlling servers are located to take action against them. It may not halt the DDoS attack but it may diminish its scale and effects.\n## 8.3.3 Distinction between State of Transit and State of Launch\nDoes the duty of diligence apply to cyber operations that are only transiting through the territory of a State? In other words, does the territorial State have an obligation to take measures to terminate the transit of a cyber operation via the computer networks located on its territory? The experts taking part in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 consider that the obligation of due diligence also applies to the transit State, which must act accordingly ‘when it (1) possesses knowledge [...] of an offending operation that reaches the requisite threshold of harm and (2) can take feasible measures to effectively terminate it’.⁶⁴ Karine Bannelier-Christakis rightly highlights that ‘there is no legal reason to consider that transit States do not have a duty of diligence’.⁶⁵ The State of transit has, in theory, the obligation under the duty of diligence to take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate the transit of a cyber operation via the computer networks located on its territory.\n⁶² Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 28.\n⁶³ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22–23.\n⁶⁴ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 33, commentary to Rule 6, para 13.\n⁶⁵ Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 27.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO PREVENT SIGNIFICANT TRANSBOUNDARY HARM 369\nThe technical reality is an important limitation to this duty.⁶⁶ The Internet has been conceived in a way that the packets should arrive at their destination even if the path they use is no longer available. If the paths used by the packets to reach their target is not available, they will use another one. Although this reality makes the duty to terminate the transit difficult to implement, it is not impossible. Implementation would probably slow down or even temporarily block the perpetration of a cyber operation, or diminish the scale of a DDoS attack, but it would never constitute a panacea.\nThe balancing of reasonableness is important in such cases. For instance, it appears unreasonable to expect the transit State to shut down all Internet traffic transiting via its territory in order to end a cyber operation. What should be expected from the State is not its shut-down, but rather the implementation of filters capable of blocking specific packets that embed malicious code from transiting through their networks when they are aware of it. Again, the speed of most cyber operations may render this operation irrelevant, as the time needed to implement these filters may exceed the length of the actual cyber operation.\nIn short, the duty of diligence extends to the State of transit, but the technical reality of the operations of computer networks and the transit of cyber operations render such duty almost impossible to implement. This reality does not prevent the transit State from taking measures, if possible, nor does it excuse its inaction.\n## 8.4 Toward a Duty to Prevent the Potential Significant Transboundary Harm Caused by Cyber Operations\nA State may be held responsible for a cyber operation that is attributable to it and constitutes an internationally wrongful act. Due diligence is a subsidiary principle to State responsibility according to which a State may be held responsible for the occurrence of a cyber operation, without being responsible for the cyber operation itself. More recently, this principle has also served as a basis for the development of a regime of State liability for the consequences of acts that are not prohibited under\n⁶⁶ See also Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 34, commentary to Rule 6, para 14.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\ninternational law. Such a regime of liability has found fertile ground in international space law⁶⁷ and international environmental law.\nIn international environmental law, States have an obligation to prevent the use of their territory for activities causing injury or damage in the territory of another State as well as a duty to prevent transboundary harm from hazardous activities. The first obligation was introduced in the Trail Smelter arbitration. In this case, the aerial pollution of a Canadian smelter located near the border with the United States damaged trees and crops located in American territory. The Tribunal noted that:\nunder the principles of international law, as well as of the law of the United States, no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein, when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is established by clear and convincing evidence.⁶⁸\nThe ILC also worked on the question of the consequences of transboundary harms resulting from an act not prohibited under international law, and ultimately adopted the ‘Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities’ in 2001⁶⁹ and the ‘Draft Principles on the Allocation of Loss in the Case of Transboundary Harm Arising out of Hazardous Activities’ in 2006.⁷⁰\nThe duty of diligence stipulated in international environmental law or international space law cannot be transposed directly to the cyber realm given that the situations are different. It shows, however, some interesting paths that could be taken in order to develop a similar duty of diligence regarding cyber activities. WannaCry and NotPetya may constitute at the maximum breaches of the territorial sovereignty of the targeted States.⁷¹\n⁶⁷ Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (adopted on 29 March 1972, entered into force on 1 September 1972) 961 UNTS 187, 24 UST 2389, 10 ILM 965 (1971).\n⁶⁸ Trail Smelter case (United States, Canada) (n 8), 1965.\n⁶⁹ ‘Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities’ (adopted by the Commission at its fifty-third session, in 2001, and submitted to the General Assembly as a part of the Commission’s report covering the work of that session (A/56/10)).\n⁷⁰ ‘Draft Principles on the Allocation of Loss in the Case of Transboundary Harm Arising out of Hazardous Activities’ (adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-eighth session, in 2006, and submitted to the General Assembly as a part of the Commission’s report covering the work of that session (A/61/10)).\n⁷¹ See supra 230–232.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO DISCLOSE ZERO-DAY VULNERABILITIES\n371\nYet, they resulted in massive economic loss for numerous companies in several States. We may wonder whether a specific regime could develop under international law to cover such losses. In such cases, the obligation of the perpetrating State would be twofold. Firstly, it would be responsible for internationally wrongful acts it committed, for instance the breach of the territorial sovereignty of the victim States. Secondly, it would be held liable for the harm and damage resulting from its cyber operations. Moreover, such regime could also be applied in cases in which the cyber operations concerned were not amounting to an internationally wrongful act. In such case, the responsibility of the perpetrating State could not be invoked, but the State could be held liable for the resulting harm and damage. It must be recalled that such principle has not yet been clearly created regarding cybersecurity and cyber operations, and thus the assertions made in this paragraph are purely hypothetical.\nIf such duty to prevent transboundary harm caused by cyber operations was to be recognised, it would be conditioned to a threshold of harm. Indeed, a State would be liable only when the transboundary harm was of a certain significance, as is the case in international environmental law.\nThe recognition of such a principle of liability regarding the consequences of cyber operations could also contribute to the creation and strengthening of a global culture of cybersecurity. Indeed, it might prompt States to be more cautious about, and careful when, conducting cyber operations, notably regarding the potential for the involuntary spread of malware and side effects of these operations. The recognition of such a principle of liability for the transboundary harm caused by cyber operations currently remains a highly hypothetical scenario, which can only be confirmed by State practice.\n## 8.5 Toward a Duty to Disclose Zero-Day Vulnerabilities\nThe WannaCry case leads to two distinct questions regarding State responsibility. Firstly, some States have publicly attributed WannaCry to North Korea, and they could thus have invoked the responsibility of North Korea under international law, if they consider WannaCry to be an internationally wrongful act.72\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nThe second question on responsibility departs from the traditional approach of the law on State responsibility: is the United States responsible for not having informed Microsoft of the existence of a vulnerability in their product and for having created the exploit later used by WannaCry?\nThe Russian President Vladimir Putin stated about WannaCry that '[a]s regards the source of these threats, I believe that the leadership of Microsoft have announced this plainly, that the initial source of the virus is the intelligence services of the United States'.73\nIn a similar vein, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, declared in a statement on Microsoft's blog:\nFinally, this attack provides yet another example of why the stockpiling of vulnerabilities by governments is such a problem. This is an emerging pattern in 2017. We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks, and now this vulnerability stolen from the NSA has affected customers around the world. Repeatedly, exploits in the hands of governments have leaked into the public domain and caused widespread damage. An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the U.S. military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen. And this most recent attack represents a completely unintended but disconcerting link between the two most serious forms of cybersecurity threats in the world today – nation-state action and organized criminal action.\nThe governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call. They need to take a different approach and adhere in cyberspace to the same rules applied to weapons in the physical world. We need governments to consider the damage to civilians that comes from hoarding these vulnerabilities and the use of these exploits. This is one reason we called in February for a new 'Digital Geneva Convention' to govern these issues, including a new requirement for governments to report vulnerabilities to vendors, rather than stockpile, sell, or exploit them.74\nTo be addressed, the question of the potential responsibility of the United States regarding WannaCry and NotPetya must be broken down into three sub-questions.\n73 Macarena Vidal Liy, 'Putin culpa a los servicios secretos de EE UU por el virus \"WannaCry\" que desencadenó el ciberataque mundial', *El País* (Madrid, 15 May 2017) https://elpais.com/internacional/2017/05/15/actualidad/1494855826_022843.html; 'Putin Warns of Risks of Governments Creating Hacking Tools', *Reuters* (15 May 2017) www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attacks-putin-idUSKCN18B15Y..\n74 Brad Smith, 'The Need for Urgent Collective Action to Keep People Safe Online: Lessons from Last Week's Cyberattack' (Microsoft On the Issues, 14 May 2017) https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/05/14/need-urgent-collective-action-keep-people-safe-online-lessons-last-weeks-cyberattack/.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO DISCLOSE ZERO-DAY VULNERABILITIES\n373\nThe first sub-question concerns whether the paternity of the NSA over EternalBlue and DoublePulsar is enough to attribute WannaCry to the United States. The answer is indubitably no. The fact that an actor, including a State, uses a tool produced by another State is not enough to attribute the consequences of that use to the latter State. Indeed, it does not create a sufficient subordination nexus, if any, between the concerned State and the perpetrator.\nThe second sub-question concerns whether the behaviour of the United States constitutes a breach of its obligation of due diligence. In other words, whether the United States knowingly allowed the use of its territory for the perpetration of WannaCry – if we paraphrase the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.75 In the WannaCry situation, however, the territory of the United States was not used for the perpetration of the ransomware campaign. Consequently, the United States has not breached its obligation of due diligence regarding the use of its territory.\nFinally, the third sub-question concerns whether there might be a plurality of actors sharing the responsibility for WannaCry, including the United States, and this is addressed later in the book.76\nThis section demonstrated that neither the non-disclosure of a vulnerability nor the development of a related exploit by a State constitutes an internationally wrongful act.77 Similarly, in a situation in which a third party would use this vulnerability or exploit, this State could not be held responsible under international law. That being said, it is important to note that the approach of States on the disclosure of vulnerabilities is slowly evolving owing to the global pressure for more transparency following, inter alia, the Snowden revelations and more recently the leak of the NSA's hacking tool by the Shadow Brokers. Several States are indeed implementing Vulnerabilities Equities Processes (VEP) aimed at determining whether they should disclose zero-day vulnerabilities or keep them secret for potential future use.78\n75 Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22.\n76 See infra 420.\n77 This analysis was developed during the master class I delivered with Aude Géry at the Forum international de la Cybersécurité in January 2018 on 'Proliferation of Cyberweapons and International Law'.\n78 See, for instance: Sasha Romanosky, 'Developing an Objective, Repeatable Scoring System for a Vulnerability Equities Process' (Lawfare, 4 February 2019) www.lawfareblog.com/developing-objective-repeatable-scoring-system-vulnerability-equities-process; Sven Herpig and Ari Schwartz, 'The Future of Vulnerabilities Equities Processes Around the World' (Lawfare, 4 January 2019) www.lawfareblog.com/future-vulnerabilities-equities-processes-around-world; Kate Charlet, Sasha Romanosky and Bert Thompson, 'It's Time for the International Community to Get Serious about Vulnerability Equities'\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\n## 8.6 Concluding Remarks on Cyber Due Diligence\nThe obligation of due diligence is an obligation of conduct, and not of result. States are under a duty to both prevent the use of cyber infrastructure and take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate cyber operations emanating from or transiting through the computer networks located on their territory. This duty does not include an obligation to monitor all Internet traffic within the computer networks on the territory of the State. Similarly, the duty of diligence can only be invoked during an ongoing unlawful action, such as a cyber operation.⁷⁹\nIn the same tenor as *ad impossibilia nemo tenetur*, or ‘nobody is held to the impossible’, the measures adopted by the territorial State must be assessed in light of the test of reasonableness and feasibility. They must not represent an overly onerous burden on the State. Thus, the measures must be commensurate with its capacity, which may differ from State to State. The State is free to choose the measures to be implemented, which can take various forms including being of a technical, political or legal nature.⁸⁰ The duty of diligence cannot impose a duty to enact specific legislation as this would then shift from an obligation of conduct to an obligation of result.⁸¹ It may, however, constitute a strong incentive to integrate some specific legislative measures into the domestic legal order for the purposes of compliance.\nIn a limited number of cases, the victim State of the cyber operation would be entitled to invoke the responsibility of the territorial State for not complying with its duty of diligence, and even to compel the territorial State to take appropriate measures.⁸²\nPart I was dedicated to the question of attribution. Due diligence may constitute an interesting palliative to the problem of attribution.⁸³ Most cyber operations that have taken place are almost impossible to attribute to a State or other actor with any certainty. In several cases, the victim State will have a strong suspicion that one or more States are responsible\n(Lawfare, 15 November 2017) www.lawfareblog.com/its-time-international-community-get-serious-about-vulnerability-equities.\n⁷⁹ Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 75.\n⁸⁰ Ziolkowski (n 23) 169.\n⁸¹ Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 33–35.\n⁸² Part III of this book deals specifically with State responsibility and measures of self-help to be taken by the victim State against the responsible State; see *infra* Chapter 9 and Chapter 10.\n⁸³ In this perspective, see the interesting discussion on the relationship between State sovereignty and due diligence regarding international security in Kulesza (n 1) 276 et seq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n375\nfor the cyber operation; however, often it will not have any definitive material proof to support such allegations. In some cases, if the victim State is able to prove that the cyber operation was launched from or transited through the territory of a State, then it could thus invoke the territorial State's responsibility for the non-fulfilment of its obligation of due diligence. This would offer a basis for the victim State to invoke the responsibility of and take measures against the State that is allegedly responsible. The remedies and measures to be taken by the victim State against the responsible State must be proportionate and necessary. Clearly, they will be of less intensity in cases involving the non-fulfilment of due diligence than in cases involving a definitive attribution of an unlawful cyber operation.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
  "flat_text": "The principle of due diligence is an obligation on States not to knowingly allow the use of their territory for the perpetration of acts contrary to the rights of other States. The duty of diligence was referred to by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case: every State has the ‘obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’. It is an old principle that was used in 1872 in the Alabama arbitration concerning the duty of neutrality of the United Kingdom during the American Civil War. It derives directly from the principles of territorial sovereignty and the sovereign equality of States, as recalled by Max Huber in the Island of Palmas arbitration:\nTerritorial sovereignty [...] involves the exclusive right to display the activities of a State. This right has as corollary a duty: the obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States, in particular their\n On the principle of due diligence, see, generally: the seminal work of Joanna Kulesza, *Due Diligence in International Law* (Brill &amp; Martinus Nijhoff Publishers 2016); Riccardo Pisillo Mazzeschi, *‘Due diligence’ e responsabilità internazionale degli stati* (Giuffrè 1989).

A State will incur responsibility not because it did not achieve the expected result but because it manifestly failed to take measures to prevent the act from happening despite being under an obligation to do so. The attribution of the act does not matter; it can be perpetrated by a State or a non-state actor. The only matter of concern is the fact that the concerned State allows its territory to be used for the perpetration of acts contrary to the rights of another State.\nThe principle of due diligence found fertile ground in international environmental law, diplomatic law and the protection of aliens. Due diligence obligations have, however, developed in various other branches of international law. In international jurisprudence, such obligations have included, inter alia, the duty of neutrality during the American Civil War, the obligation to notify ships of the existence of mines in their waters, the obligation to protect the diplomatic and consular premises and staff of a foreign State, the duty to tackle the flow of arms crossing the territory of a State, the duty to take action against rebel groups\n The Island of Palmas (or Miangas) (1928) 11 RIAA 831, 839; see also Affaire des biens britanniques au Maroc espagnol (Espagne contre Royaume-Uni) (1925) 2 RIAA 615, 649.\n On the distinction between obligation of result and obligation of conduct, see: Alain Pellet et al, Droit international public (8th edn, LGDJ 2009) 859–862, para 473.\n Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

As mentioned, the obligation of due diligence developed in various branches of international law, but the notion is also used to describe other forms of legal or political obligations, within and outside the realm of international law. Broadly, due diligence is understood as a standard of conduct required to discharge an obligation. In other words, due diligence is often referred to as representing a certain standard of conduct that should be observed by States or other actors in performing particular acts or regarding specific obligations. The recent discussion in the European Journal of International Law on the ‘human rights due diligence’ in the 2011 United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights perfectly highlights the risk of confusion between the various dimensions of due diligence, and notably the ongoing debate on the due diligence of both private and public actors. The development of ICT technologies also raises the question of the due diligence obligations of both public and private actors. Alongside the obligation for a State not to allow knowingly its ICT infrastructure to be used for malicious acts, there are also the questions, for instance, of the duties of private companies not to let their ICT infrastructure be used for such acts and to avoid releasing software flawed with vulnerabilities. The private sector’s due diligence is outside the scope of this book. Consequently, it seems necessary to clarify that the present chapter focuses exclusively on due diligence understood as ‘every State’s obligation not to\n Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

This would mean that it imposes a duty on States not to allow their territory to be used for the launch or transit of cyber operations targeting another State. In that perspective, due diligence may constitute an interesting palliative to the problem of attribution.\nThe principle of due diligence in international law is particularly relevant regarding the behaviours of non-state actors, since this principle subjects these behaviours to some limitations imposed by international law by creating a bridge between them and State responsibility. International law is primarily the law of States and it cannot generally be enforced directly upon non-state actors. The principle of due diligence renders a State responsible or liable for the occurrence of acts of other actors, including non-state actors, perpetrated in its territory or jurisdiction in some specific circumstances. This is the sense of the sixth norm of the 'Singapore Norm Package' adopted by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) in November 2018:\nNon-state actors should not engage in offensive cyber operations and state actors should prevent and respond to such activities if they occur.\n Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22.\n Karine Bannelier-Christakis, 'Obligations de diligence dans le cyberespace: qui a peur de la cyber-diligence?'

The GCSC demonstrates here how this principle is relevant to regulating such a situation, emphasising in the commentary to the norm that ‘[i]f states permit such action, they may therefore be held responsible under international law. States must act, domestically and internationally, to prevent offensive cyber operations by non-state actors.’\nThe UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security integrated cyber due diligence into its 2013 report as a norm of behaviour, and again in its 2015 report. The report stated that ‘States should seek to ensure that their territories are not used by non-State actors for unlawful use of ICTs’.\nSimilarly, the experts involved in the Tallinn Manual process agreed on the application of the principle of due diligence. In the Tallinn Manual 1.0, Rule 5 dealt with the principle of due diligence, and the commentary makes clear that the experts disagreed on the particular features of this principle.

In addition, the Tallinn Manual states that a neutral State to an international armed conflict should not allow its cyber infrastructure to be used by the belligerent parties: ibid 252, Rule 93.

Michael\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nand modifies the fifth Rule of the first edition, and reads: '[a] State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States';[31] in addition, Rule 7 deals with compliance with the due diligence principle and recalls that States are required to take all feasible measures that are foreseeable.[32]\nThe application of the principle of due diligence to the cyber realm remains, however, a controversial issue. Some States are reluctant to extend this principle to cyberspace because of the corresponding obligations it would impose on them.[33] Moreover, another difficulty arises concerning the distinction between States from which the cyber operation is launched and States of transit, that is to say States through which the cyber operation is routed. The present chapter asserts that the principle of due diligence is applicable to cyber operations, and analyses how it applies and what the corresponding obligations that it imposes on States are. The duty of cyber due diligence may be seen as a coin with two faces; on the one side, there is the duty to prevent the use of the ICT infrastructure (8.1), and on the other, there is the obligation to take measures to terminate a cyber operation that has been detected (8.3). This chapter also analyses whether the invocation of the principle of due diligence is subject to a threshold of harm (8.2). Moreover, this chapter investigates two possible variations of due diligence regarding cyber operations, that may be developed in the future: the creation of a duty to (i) prevent the potential transboundary harm caused by cyber operations (8.4) and (ii) disclose zero-day vulnerabilities (8.5).\n## 8.1 Does a Duty to Prevent Any Use of State Cyber Infrastructures Exist?\nDoes a State have a general duty to prevent any use of its cyber infrastructure for the perpetration by another State, or by non-state actors, of a cyber operation against another State? Such obligation may be\nN Schmitt published an article highlighting some points dealt with in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that would deserve further work, including due diligence: Michael N Schmitt, 'Grey Zones in the International Law of Cyberspace' (2017) 42 The Yale Journal of International Law Online 1, 11-13.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO PREVENT\n\n## 8.1.1 A State Has No Obligation to Have Absolute Knowledge of All Events and Activities on Its Territory or in Cyber Infrastructures under Its Control\nUnder international law, a State is not obliged to have absolute knowledge of all events and activities happening on its territory. As recalled by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case:\nit cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known, of any unlawful act perpetrated therein, nor yet that it necessarily knew, or should have known, the authors.\nThe fact that the cyber operation emanates from or transits through the computer networks located on the territory of a State does not render this State responsible, nor does it transfer the burden of proof onto, this State.\nA State is under the obligation to take all feasible measures to prevent the use of its territory for activities that breach the rights of other States. As already mentioned, it is an obligation of conduct – to take measures – and not of result.\nI agree with the experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that the obligation of due diligence of a State applies regarding cyber activities taking place on its territory and extends extraterritorially to those taking place on\n Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 18.\n ibid.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\ncontrolled territory abroad, as well as in cyber infrastructure located abroad under its control.\nIn the cyber realm, does this obligation impose a duty on the State to monitor the Internet traffic emanating from and transiting via its cyber infrastructure? The next section demonstrates why the question should be answered negatively.\n## 8.1.2 The Slippery Slope of Justifying Mass Surveillance\nA general duty to know what is happening in the computer networks of a State may be understood as implying mass and indiscriminate surveillance of these networks by the State. Thus, such a duty would serve as a justification for mass surveillance. Not only does it risk a slippery slope in terms of civil liberties and human rights, but it would also be of limited relevance for the duty of diligence, as detailed below.\nThe mass surveillance programme of the NSA was, at its best, able to monitor 75 per cent of US Internet traffic. Thus, it was not able to monitor all the traffic emanating or transiting through the State. Even if it was possible to monitor all the Internet traffic, the treatment of the monitored data would necessitate too much work to be relevant or even attainable. Indeed, in the case of the mass-surveillance programme, the objective is generally to filter specific communications or the use of specific words, i.e. there is something to look for. In the case of cyber operations, they can take a wide variety of forms and it would be almost impossible to identify specific filters that would allow them to be detected. Monitoring the metadata would not suffice. It would be necessary to undertake a deep inspection of each packet of data to determine its real content and the purpose of this content. Moreover, it is not very difficult to embed a malicious code into another code of legitimate software; therefore, it would be necessary to be able to distinguish which part of the code belongs to the malware. The perpetrators would also sooner or later understand how the filters operate and would be able to adapt the structure of their malicious code to address the new situation, therefore always managing to find cracks in the system and to exploit\n Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 32–33, commentary to Rule 6, paras 8–10.\n Jennifer Valentino-Devries and Siobhan Gorman, ‘New Details Show Broader NSA Surveillance Reach: Programs Cover 75% of Nation’s Traffic, Can Snare Emails’, Wall Street Journal (20 August 2013) www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324108204579022874091732470.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO PREVENT\n\nOne may argue that the surveillance activities of a State are limited by international law, human rights law and domestic law, which would limit the possible negative consequences. Yet, taking this approach would be a very slippery slope with almost no value in preventing cyber threats from using the computer networks of a State.\nAs often noted already, the duty of diligence is only an obligation of conduct and not of result. Nonetheless, a requirement to monitor Internet traffic would then transform into a justification for mass-surveillance programmes without actually making much contribution to fulfilling this duty. The duty of diligence must not constitute an excessive burden on\n Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual* (n 28) 27, commentary to Rule 5, para 4; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 28.\n Schmitt, *'Due Diligence in Cyberspace'* (n 22) 72–73.\n *ibid* 75.\n Bannelier-Christakis (n 22) 644; Bannelier and Christakis (n 4) 20; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 30.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nthe State, and the implementation of such monitoring would represent a twofold excessive burden – on the State's capacities and human rights law. Thus, such an obligation would be considered unreasonable.\nThe situation may differ if such monitoring capacities already exist. In such cases, does the State with monitoring capacities have an obligation to use them in order to comply with its due diligence obligations? The short answer is yes. The State has an obligation to use any means at its disposal to comply with its due diligence duty. Thus, the duty of diligence does not oblige the State to implement a monitoring programme for Internet traffic, but when such capacities already exist, then the State has to use them. The content of the duty of diligence depends on the capacity of each State. The ILA's first report on due diligence highlighted this point in regard to due diligence in human rights law and international environmental law. It stressed that it was necessary to differentiate between the treatment of developed States and that of developing ones, as they may not have the same capacity to control and to comply with their due diligence duty. Similarly, in cyberspace not all States are equal and some may be better equipped to comply with their obligations than others, in particular those where a mass-surveillance programme already exists and therefore may be used to monitor cyber activities. The burden of the duty of diligence must be reasonable, however. It cannot exceed the State's capacity.\nIn sum, the duty of diligence does not impose a duty on States to monitor the Internet traffic of cyber infrastructures located on their territory, nor to develop the necessary technologies to perform such monitoring. In the case of a State having already developed the capabilities to conduct such monitoring programmes, to comply with the obligation of diligence this State would have to use these capabilities. It must be highlighted that such situation does not legitimate nor preclude the potential wrongfulness of such capabilities under domestic or international laws.\n## 8.1.3 The Difference between Cyber Operations Launched from or Solely Transiting through the Territory of the State\nIt is impossible to completely separate cyber operations from the physical world. A cyber operation that is simply transiting through the territory of\n ILA Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law – First Report (n 1) respectively 18 and 27.\n Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 74–75.\n For a similar view, see Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 43–46, commentary to Rule 7, paras 3–13.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE ABSENCE OF A THRESHOLD OF HARM\na State only requires electronic impulses via cables and devices, and this transit lasts less than a second in most cases. Conversely, the launch of a cyber operation from the territory of a State would take more than just a few electronic impulses. It would also integrate a physical dimension in most cases. Two situations should be distinguished from one another: firstly, the launch of a cyber operation via a cyber infrastructure that is remotely under the control of the perpetrator; secondly, the launch of a cyber operation from the territory of a State.\nA cyber operation can be launched via a cyber infrastructure located on the territory of one State, but be infected and controlled by the perpetrators located in another. This is, for instance, the case with bots, also known as 'zombified' computers, which are used to perpetrate DDoS attacks. The perpetrators of a DDoS attack targeting State A may be located in State B, using a botnet of 'zombified' computers located in States X, Y and Z. In this situation, what obligation arises in terms of due diligence of States X, Y and Z? Here again, they have no obligation to monitor their Internet traffic nor to know of all events and activities happening in the cyber infrastructure on their territory. The situation may be different if, as we will see in the next section, they know or should know about the malicious use of the controlled infrastructures on their territory.\nIn the case of a cyber operation launched directly from the territory of a State, for example by an organised group located on its territory, the duty of diligence applies. The territorial State has, in such cases, means other than solely cyber ones to make itself aware of such use. In the case of highly sophisticated cyber operations, the preparatory phases often involve physical input that may be detectable by the State. For instance, it may be visible that something is under preparation or already happening owing to an increase in activity of a specific group already under scrutiny by the State.\nI will come back to the distinction between State of transit and State of launch, and the consequences of this distinction for the application of the principle of due diligence to cyber operations, in the third section (8.3).\n## 8.2 The Absence of a Threshold of Harm\nThe experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 condition the applicability of the principle of due diligence to two cumulative requirements: firstly, the cyber operation concerned must be 'contrary to the rights' of the affected\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nState under international law; and, secondly, it must have ‘serious adverse consequences’. Moreover, they also ‘concurred that the due diligence principle extends to cyber operations conducted by non-State actors that, while not violating international law per se, nevertheless result in serious adverse consequences and [...] affect the right of the target State’. In addition, they note that the threshold of harm does not depend on the occurrence of ‘physical damage to objects or injuries to individuals’.\nThe first requirement derives directly from the dictum of the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case, and does not raise any specific issue. The second requirement, the threshold of harm, may be more controversial. The commentary to Rule 6 states that:\nThe precise threshold of harm at which the due diligence principle applies is unsettled in international law. All of the Experts agreed that the due diligence requirement arises when the situation involves a cyber operation that results in ‘serious adverse consequences’, although they could identify no bright line threshold for the identification of such consequences. They adopted this standard by analogy from application of the due diligence principle in the context of international environmental law. Some of them supported a lower threshold of application for the Rule, for instance, by proposing the term ‘significant’ or ‘substantial’ in lieu of ‘serious’.\nIndeed, in the Trail Smelter arbitral award, the court held that under the principles of international law, as well as of the law of the United States:\nno State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein, when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is established by clear and convincing evidence.\nThus, this arbitral award recognised the existence of a threshold of harm regarding the application of the principle of due diligence in preventing transboundary environmental harm. On this basis, the experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 assert that a similar standard exists regarding cyber operations.\n ibid 34, commentary to Rule 6, para 15.\n ibid 35, commentary to Rule 6, para 21.\n ibid 37–38, commentary to Rule 6, para 28.\n Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22.\n Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 36–37, commentary to Rule 6, para 25 (footnotes omitted).\n Trail Smelter case (United States, Canada) (n 8) 1965.\n See generally Kulesza (n 1) 91–105.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE ABSENCE OF A THRESHOLD OF HARM\nFurther on the experts clarified their idea, as they agreed that ‘merely affecting the interests of the target State, as in the case of causing inconvenience, minor disruption, or negligible expense, is not the type of harm envisaged; thus, not every use of a State’s territory that produces negative effects for a target State implicates the due diligence principle’.\nI am not convinced that such requirement of a threshold of harm is part of the customary principle of due diligence, and thus of the *lex lata* applicable to cyber operations. In my view, the assessment of the intensity of the cyber operations concerned does not condition whether the State has the possibility of invoking the obligation of due diligence of the territorial State from the perspective of international law. Conversely, it may condition whether the State will actually invoke the obligation of due diligence of the territorial State. It is thus not a legal requirement, but a requirement regarding the opportunity for the State to invoke this principle, or not. More precisely, the occurrence of a damage or harm is not a necessary element of the principle of due diligence. According to the principle, States must exercise due diligence in ensuring that territory and objects over which they enjoy sovereignty are not to be used to harm other States. This principle does not require that an actual harm or damage occurs; on the contrary, it relies on the potential damage or harm that may be suffered by the other States. Even if this damage or harm never materialises, the State still has to comply with its duty of diligence. Consequently, the second requirement of ‘serious adverse consequences’ does not seem to flow from general international law nor does it seem justified.\nIn that perspective, my analysis of the threshold of harm for the principle of due diligence asserted by the *Tallinn Manual 2.0* is similar to the one I have already made regarding the same proposed threshold for the qualification of the violation of territorial sovereignty.\nTo conclude, it seems that the general customary principle of due diligence does not involve a threshold of harm. However, such threshold has already been identified in specific dimensions of the principle of due diligence, as for instance regarding transboundary environmental harm,\n Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 37, commentary to Rule 6, para 26.\n More generally, the occurrence of a damage is not a necessary element of an internationally wrongful act; see: ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (2001) 2 Yearbook of the International Law Commission (Part II) 31, 92, commentary to Article 21, para 6; James Crawford, *State Responsibility: The General Part* (CUP 2013) 54et seq.\n See supra 5.3.2.2B The Absence of a Damage Requirement.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nand may translate into other dimensions in the future, including cyber operations. Indeed, it is important to distinguish the recourse to the principle of due diligence to establish, on the one hand, the responsibility of a State for not having complied with its due diligence obligations, from, on the other, the liability of a State for a significant transboundary harm. In the first case, which was developed in the present section, there is not a threshold of harm, while in the second case, which is developed later, in Section 8.4, such a threshold exists.\n## 8.3 The Duty of a State to Take Measures to Terminate an Unlawful Cyber Operation Using Its Infrastructure\nAnother principal component of the principle of due diligence is the obligation for a State that is aware of an unlawful cyber operation – which is using its cyber infrastructure – to take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate the operation.^[55]^ The resulting obligation has three dimensions: firstly, knowledge of the cyber operation by the territorial State (8.2.1); secondly, balancing the feasibility and reasonableness of the measures that should be taken (8.2.2); and finally, the distinction between cyber operations merely transiting via the State and those emanating from the territory of the State (8.2.3).\n## 8.3.1 Knowledge of the Territorial State\nAs a prerequisite, the territorial State has to be aware that a cyber operation is using its cyber infrastructure. Two situations should be distinguished from one another. Firstly, the victim State of a cyber operation has to notify the territorial State and ask it to take measures to terminate it. In such cases, there is no doubt that the territorial State is aware of the cyber operation and thus is obliged to take all feasible and reasonable measures against it. Secondly, the territorial State may also know about it even in the absence of notification by the victim State. In such circumstances, the burden of proof that the territorial State knows or should have known about the cyber operation is on the victim State. There is no transfer of the burden of proof as the territorial State has no\n^[55] Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 43, Rule 7; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 37; Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 72–75.

When a State has actual knowledge, then it is without a shadow of a doubt bound by the duty of diligence.\nIs constructive knowledge sufficient? In other words, is the fact that a State should have known about the cyber operation enough? The experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 ‘agreed that knowledge encompasses constructive knowledge for the purpose of [Rule 6]’. On the one hand, the territorial State ‘cannot evade such a request by limiting itself to a reply that it is ignorant of the circumstances of the act and of its authors. The State may, up to a certain point, be bound to supply particulars of the use made by it of the means of information and inquiry at its disposal.’ On the other, the standard of proof would be very high for the State invoking its responsibility to prove that the territorial State should have known. Ultimately, the State invoking non-compliance with the duty of diligence would have to prove that the territorial State actually knew, rather than should have known.\n## 8.3.2 Measures to Terminate the Cyber Operation\nA State that knows its territory is being used for the perpetration of an unlawful cyber operation must take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate it. As an obligation of conduct and not of result, the State is expected to undertake its ‘best efforts’ to terminate the cyber operation, but would not bear responsibility only because it failed to terminate it. Conversely, if the State did not use all means at its disposal, and did not take all feasible and reasonable measures, it would not have fulfilled its obligation under the duty of diligence.\nIn a number of cases, the speed of cyber operations may render the principle of due diligence almost inapplicable. Some cyber operations only take milliseconds to launch, transit and produce effects, and thus the\n Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 18.\n Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 40, commentary to Rule 6, para 37; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 28–29.\n Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 41, commentary to Rule 6, para 39.

Already in the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ highlighted the significance of the time dimension. An instantaneous reaction is not expected from the territorial State, which must have enough time to be made aware and react. The speed of certain cyber operations renders reaction even more complicated. This is, however, not true of all cyber operations. Some have a continuous character, at least for some of the time. DDoS attacks, for instance, need to take place over a period of time to be effective. Similarly, complex cyber operations, such as Stuxnet, last for several years, during which time they may continuously communicate with their perpetrator and thus use cyber infrastructures located in various countries, for example remotely controlled servers. In such cases, the duty of diligence is particularly relevant. In the case of an ongoing DDoS attack, for instance, the victim State may make a request to the States in which the zombified computers and controlling servers are located to take action against them. It may not halt the DDoS attack but it may diminish its scale and effects.\n## 8.3.3 Distinction between State of Transit and State of Launch\nDoes the duty of diligence apply to cyber operations that are only transiting through the territory of a State? In other words, does the territorial State have an obligation to take measures to terminate the transit of a cyber operation via the computer networks located on its territory? The experts taking part in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 consider that the obligation of due diligence also applies to the transit State, which must act accordingly ‘when it (1) possesses knowledge [...] of an offending operation that reaches the requisite threshold of harm and (2) can take feasible measures to effectively terminate it’. Karine Bannelier-Christakis rightly highlights that ‘there is no legal reason to consider that transit States do not have a duty of diligence’. The State of transit has, in theory, the obligation under the duty of diligence to take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate the transit of a cyber operation via the computer networks located on its territory.\n Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 28.\n Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22–23.\n Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 33, commentary to Rule 6, para 13.\n Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 27.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO PREVENT SIGNIFICANT TRANSBOUNDARY HARM 369\nThe technical reality is an important limitation to this duty. The Internet has been conceived in a way that the packets should arrive at their destination even if the path they use is no longer available. If the paths used by the packets to reach their target is not available, they will use another one. Although this reality makes the duty to terminate the transit difficult to implement, it is not impossible. Implementation would probably slow down or even temporarily block the perpetration of a cyber operation, or diminish the scale of a DDoS attack, but it would never constitute a panacea.\nThe balancing of reasonableness is important in such cases. For instance, it appears unreasonable to expect the transit State to shut down all Internet traffic transiting via its territory in order to end a cyber operation. What should be expected from the State is not its shut-down, but rather the implementation of filters capable of blocking specific packets that embed malicious code from transiting through their networks when they are aware of it. Again, the speed of most cyber operations may render this operation irrelevant, as the time needed to implement these filters may exceed the length of the actual cyber operation.\nIn short, the duty of diligence extends to the State of transit, but the technical reality of the operations of computer networks and the transit of cyber operations render such duty almost impossible to implement. This reality does not prevent the transit State from taking measures, if possible, nor does it excuse its inaction.\n## 8.4 Toward a Duty to Prevent the Potential Significant Transboundary Harm Caused by Cyber Operations\nA State may be held responsible for a cyber operation that is attributable to it and constitutes an internationally wrongful act. Due diligence is a subsidiary principle to State responsibility according to which a State may be held responsible for the occurrence of a cyber operation, without being responsible for the cyber operation itself. More recently, this principle has also served as a basis for the development of a regime of State liability for the consequences of acts that are not prohibited under\n See also Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 34, commentary to Rule 6, para 14.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\ninternational law. Such a regime of liability has found fertile ground in international space law and international environmental law.\nIn international environmental law, States have an obligation to prevent the use of their territory for activities causing injury or damage in the territory of another State as well as a duty to prevent transboundary harm from hazardous activities. The first obligation was introduced in the Trail Smelter arbitration. In this case, the aerial pollution of a Canadian smelter located near the border with the United States damaged trees and crops located in American territory. The Tribunal noted that:\nunder the principles of international law, as well as of the law of the United States, no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein, when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is established by clear and convincing evidence.\nThe ILC also worked on the question of the consequences of transboundary harms resulting from an act not prohibited under international law, and ultimately adopted the ‘Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities’ in 2001 and the ‘Draft Principles on the Allocation of Loss in the Case of Transboundary Harm Arising out of Hazardous Activities’ in 2006.\nThe duty of diligence stipulated in international environmental law or international space law cannot be transposed directly to the cyber realm given that the situations are different. It shows, however, some interesting paths that could be taken in order to develop a similar duty of diligence regarding cyber activities. WannaCry and NotPetya may constitute at the maximum breaches of the territorial sovereignty of the targeted States.\n Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (adopted on 29 March 1972, entered into force on 1 September 1972) 961 UNTS 187, 24 UST 2389, 10 ILM 965 (1971).\n Trail Smelter case (United States, Canada) (n 8), 1965.\n ‘Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities’ (adopted by the Commission at its fifty-third session, in 2001, and submitted to the General Assembly as a part of the Commission’s report covering the work of that session (A/56/10)).\n ‘Draft Principles on the Allocation of Loss in the Case of Transboundary Harm Arising out of Hazardous Activities’ (adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-eighth session, in 2006, and submitted to the General Assembly as a part of the Commission’s report covering the work of that session (A/61/10)).\n See supra 230–232.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO DISCLOSE ZERO-DAY VULNERABILITIES\n\nIf such duty to prevent transboundary harm caused by cyber operations was to be recognised, it would be conditioned to a threshold of harm. Indeed, a State would be liable only when the transboundary harm was of a certain significance, as is the case in international environmental law.\nThe recognition of such a principle of liability regarding the consequences of cyber operations could also contribute to the creation and strengthening of a global culture of cybersecurity. Indeed, it might prompt States to be more cautious about, and careful when, conducting cyber operations, notably regarding the potential for the involuntary spread of malware and side effects of these operations. The recognition of such a principle of liability for the transboundary harm caused by cyber operations currently remains a highly hypothetical scenario, which can only be confirmed by State practice.\n## 8.5 Toward a Duty to Disclose Zero-Day Vulnerabilities\nThe WannaCry case leads to two distinct questions regarding State responsibility. Firstly, some States have publicly attributed WannaCry to North Korea, and they could thus have invoked the responsibility of North Korea under international law, if they consider WannaCry to be an internationally wrongful act.72\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nThe second question on responsibility departs from the traditional approach of the law on State responsibility: is the United States responsible for not having informed Microsoft of the existence of a vulnerability in their product and for having created the exploit later used by WannaCry?\nThe Russian President Vladimir Putin stated about WannaCry that '[a]s regards the source of these threats, I believe that the leadership of Microsoft have announced this plainly, that the initial source of the virus is the intelligence services of the United States'.73\nIn a similar vein, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, declared in a statement on Microsoft's blog:\nFinally, this attack provides yet another example of why the stockpiling of vulnerabilities by governments is such a problem. This is an emerging pattern in 2017. We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks, and now this vulnerability stolen from the NSA has affected customers around the world. Repeatedly, exploits in the hands of governments have leaked into the public domain and caused widespread damage. An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the U.S. military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen. And this most recent attack represents a completely unintended but disconcerting link between the two most serious forms of cybersecurity threats in the world today – nation-state action and organized criminal action.\nThe governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call. They need to take a different approach and adhere in cyberspace to the same rules applied to weapons in the physical world. We need governments to consider the damage to civilians that comes from hoarding these vulnerabilities and the use of these exploits. This is one reason we called in February for a new 'Digital Geneva Convention' to govern these issues, including a new requirement for governments to report vulnerabilities to vendors, rather than stockpile, sell, or exploit them.74\nTo be addressed, the question of the potential responsibility of the United States regarding WannaCry and NotPetya must be broken down into three sub-questions.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO DISCLOSE ZERO-DAY VULNERABILITIES\n\nThe second sub-question concerns whether the behaviour of the United States constitutes a breach of its obligation of due diligence. In other words, whether the United States knowingly allowed the use of its territory for the perpetration of WannaCry – if we paraphrase the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.75 In the WannaCry situation, however, the territory of the United States was not used for the perpetration of the ransomware campaign. Consequently, the United States has not breached its obligation of due diligence regarding the use of its territory.\nFinally, the third sub-question concerns whether there might be a plurality of actors sharing the responsibility for WannaCry, including the United States, and this is addressed later in the book.76\nThis section demonstrated that neither the non-disclosure of a vulnerability nor the development of a related exploit by a State constitutes an internationally wrongful act.77 Similarly, in a situation in which a third party would use this vulnerability or exploit, this State could not be held responsible under international law. That being said, it is important to note that the approach of States on the disclosure of vulnerabilities is slowly evolving owing to the global pressure for more transparency following, inter alia, the Snowden revelations and more recently the leak of the NSA's hacking tool by the Shadow Brokers. Several States are indeed implementing Vulnerabilities Equities Processes (VEP) aimed at determining whether they should disclose zero-day vulnerabilities or keep them secret for potential future use.78\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\n## 8.6 Concluding Remarks on Cyber Due Diligence\nThe obligation of due diligence is an obligation of conduct, and not of result. States are under a duty to both prevent the use of cyber infrastructure and take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate cyber operations emanating from or transiting through the computer networks located on their territory. This duty does not include an obligation to monitor all Internet traffic within the computer networks on the territory of the State. Similarly, the duty of diligence can only be invoked during an ongoing unlawful action, such as a cyber operation.\nIn the same tenor as *ad impossibilia nemo tenetur*, or ‘nobody is held to the impossible’, the measures adopted by the territorial State must be assessed in light of the test of reasonableness and feasibility. They must not represent an overly onerous burden on the State. Thus, the measures must be commensurate with its capacity, which may differ from State to State. The State is free to choose the measures to be implemented, which can take various forms including being of a technical, political or legal nature. The duty of diligence cannot impose a duty to enact specific legislation as this would then shift from an obligation of conduct to an obligation of result. It may, however, constitute a strong incentive to integrate some specific legislative measures into the domestic legal order for the purposes of compliance.\nIn a limited number of cases, the victim State of the cyber operation would be entitled to invoke the responsibility of the territorial State for not complying with its duty of diligence, and even to compel the territorial State to take appropriate measures.\nPart I was dedicated to the question of attribution. Due diligence may constitute an interesting palliative to the problem of attribution. Most cyber operations that have taken place are almost impossible to attribute to a State or other actor with any certainty. In several cases, the victim State will have a strong suspicion that one or more States are responsible\n(Lawfare, 15 November 2017) www.lawfareblog.com/its-time-international-community-get-serious-about-vulnerability-equities.\n Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 75.\n Ziolkowski (n 23) 169.\n Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 33–35.\n Part III of this book deals specifically with State responsibility and measures of self-help to be taken by the victim State against the responsible State; see *infra* Chapter 9 and Chapter 10.\n In this perspective, see the interesting discussion on the relationship between State sovereignty and due diligence regarding international security in Kulesza (n 1) 276 et seq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

Such obligation may be\nN Schmitt published an article highlighting some points dealt with in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that would deserve further work, including due diligence: Michael N Schmitt, 'Grey Zones in the International Law of Cyberspace' (2017) 42 The Yale Journal of International Law Online 1, 11-13.\n31 Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 30.\n32 ibid 43.\n33 Schmitt, 'Due Diligence in Cyberspace' (n 22) 71, 73; Liu (n 30).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO PREVENT\n359\nconsidered as implying a duty on the State to monitor all Internet traffic emanating from and transiting via its territory or via cyber infrastructures under its control. There is no general duty to monitor and control the Internet traffic emanating from and transiting via the territory of a State or via cyber infrastructures under its control. In any case, this is unlikely to happen for two reasons: firstly, it could constitute a justification for mass-surveillance programmes and is also irrelevant for the objective pursued (8.1.2); secondly, there is no obligation for a State to know everything about what is happening on its territory (8.1.1). Finally, it is necessary to distinguish between situations where cyber operations only use the cyber infrastructures of a State and situations where there is also a physical dimension on the territory of the State (8.1.3).",
    "## 8.1.1 A State Has No Obligation to Have Absolute Knowledge of All Events and Activities on Its Territory or in Cyber Infrastructures under Its Control": "Under international law, a State is not obliged to have absolute knowledge of all events and activities happening on its territory. As recalled by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case:\nit cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known, of any unlawful act perpetrated therein, nor yet that it necessarily knew, or should have known, the authors.³⁴\nThe fact that the cyber operation emanates from or transits through the computer networks located on the territory of a State does not render this State responsible, nor does it transfer the burden of proof onto, this State.³⁵\nA State is under the obligation to take all feasible measures to prevent the use of its territory for activities that breach the rights of other States. As already mentioned, it is an obligation of conduct – to take measures – and not of result.\nI agree with the experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that the obligation of due diligence of a State applies regarding cyber activities taking place on its territory and extends extraterritorially to those taking place on\n³⁴ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 18.\n³⁵ ibid.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\ncontrolled territory abroad, as well as in cyber infrastructure located abroad under its control.³⁶\nIn the cyber realm, does this obligation impose a duty on the State to monitor the Internet traffic emanating from and transiting via its cyber infrastructure? The next section demonstrates why the question should be answered negatively.",
    "## 8.1.2 The Slippery Slope of Justifying Mass Surveillance": "A general duty to know what is happening in the computer networks of a State may be understood as implying mass and indiscriminate surveillance of these networks by the State. Thus, such a duty would serve as a justification for mass surveillance. Not only does it risk a slippery slope in terms of civil liberties and human rights, but it would also be of limited relevance for the duty of diligence, as detailed below.\nThe mass surveillance programme of the NSA was, at its best, able to monitor 75 per cent of US Internet traffic.³⁷ Thus, it was not able to monitor all the traffic emanating or transiting through the State. Even if it was possible to monitor all the Internet traffic, the treatment of the monitored data would necessitate too much work to be relevant or even attainable. Indeed, in the case of the mass-surveillance programme, the objective is generally to filter specific communications or the use of specific words, i.e. there is something to look for. In the case of cyber operations, they can take a wide variety of forms and it would be almost impossible to identify specific filters that would allow them to be detected. Monitoring the metadata would not suffice. It would be necessary to undertake a deep inspection of each packet of data to determine its real content and the purpose of this content. Moreover, it is not very difficult to embed a malicious code into another code of legitimate software; therefore, it would be necessary to be able to distinguish which part of the code belongs to the malware. The perpetrators would also sooner or later understand how the filters operate and would be able to adapt the structure of their malicious code to address the new situation, therefore always managing to find cracks in the system and to exploit\n³⁶ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 32–33, commentary to Rule 6, paras 8–10.\n³⁷ Jennifer Valentino-Devries and Siobhan Gorman, ‘New Details Show Broader NSA Surveillance Reach: Programs Cover 75% of Nation’s Traffic, Can Snare Emails’, Wall Street Journal (20 August 2013) www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324108204579022874091732470.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO PREVENT\n361\nthem. From this perspective, it can be noted that States having mass surveillance programmes, such as the United States, are still unable to prevent cyber operations from entering their networks and damaging their cyber infrastructure. On top of all these difficulties and as a final remark, most cyber operations take place within very short lapses of time, often only a few seconds. By extension, this means that monitoring and identifications processes have to take place within a very short timeframe.³⁸ This is almost unachievable, given the current state of technology. Because the objective is to prevent the transit of a cyber operation in a State infrastructure, the response must take place at the same time as the identification. Perhaps technological evolution, which is unfolding rapidly in the cyber realm, will be able to offer us new solutions to these difficulties which can improve the technical appropriateness and abilities of such monitoring techniques (for instance the development of artificial intelligence).³⁹ Irrespective of these new developments, the legal problems that they trigger would not change. In addition to this, as noted by Michael N Schmitt, '[t]here appears to be an emerging consensus among scholars and state legal advisers against the existence of obligations either to monitor cyber activities on one's territory or to prevent malicious use of cyber infrastructure located within one's borders'.⁴⁰ I believe that all these reasons demonstrate the irrelevance of implementing mass monitoring in the cyber infrastructures of a State for the purposes of due diligence.\nOne may argue that the surveillance activities of a State are limited by international law, human rights law and domestic law,⁴¹ which would limit the possible negative consequences. Yet, taking this approach would be a very slippery slope with almost no value in preventing cyber threats from using the computer networks of a State.\nAs often noted already, the duty of diligence is only an obligation of conduct and not of result. Nonetheless, a requirement to monitor Internet traffic would then transform into a justification for mass-surveillance programmes without actually making much contribution to fulfilling this duty. The duty of diligence must not constitute an excessive burden on\n³⁸ Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual* (n 28) 27, commentary to Rule 5, para 4; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 28.\n³⁹ Schmitt, *'Due Diligence in Cyberspace'* (n 22) 72–73.\n⁴⁰ *ibid* 75.\n⁴¹ Bannelier-Christakis (n 22) 644; Bannelier and Christakis (n 4) 20; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 30.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nthe State, and the implementation of such monitoring would represent a twofold excessive burden – on the State's capacities and human rights law. Thus, such an obligation would be considered unreasonable.\nThe situation may differ if such monitoring capacities already exist. In such cases, does the State with monitoring capacities have an obligation to use them in order to comply with its due diligence obligations? The short answer is yes. The State has an obligation to use any means at its disposal to comply with its due diligence duty. Thus, the duty of diligence does not oblige the State to implement a monitoring programme for Internet traffic, but when such capacities already exist, then the State has to use them. The content of the duty of diligence depends on the capacity of each State. The ILA's first report on due diligence highlighted this point in regard to due diligence in human rights law and international environmental law.⁴² It stressed that it was necessary to differentiate between the treatment of developed States and that of developing ones, as they may not have the same capacity to control and to comply with their due diligence duty. Similarly, in cyberspace not all States are equal and some may be better equipped to comply with their obligations than others,⁴³ in particular those where a mass-surveillance programme already exists and therefore may be used to monitor cyber activities. The burden of the duty of diligence must be reasonable, however. It cannot exceed the State's capacity.\nIn sum, the duty of diligence does not impose a duty on States to monitor the Internet traffic of cyber infrastructures located on their territory,⁴⁴ nor to develop the necessary technologies to perform such monitoring. In the case of a State having already developed the capabilities to conduct such monitoring programmes, to comply with the obligation of diligence this State would have to use these capabilities. It must be highlighted that such situation does not legitimate nor preclude the potential wrongfulness of such capabilities under domestic or international laws.",
    "## 8.1.3 The Difference between Cyber Operations Launched from or Solely Transiting through the Territory of the State": "It is impossible to completely separate cyber operations from the physical world. A cyber operation that is simply transiting through the territory of\n⁴² ILA Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law – First Report (n 1) respectively 18 and 27.\n⁴³ Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 74–75.\n⁴⁴ For a similar view, see Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 43–46, commentary to Rule 7, paras 3–13.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE ABSENCE OF A THRESHOLD OF HARM\na State only requires electronic impulses via cables and devices, and this transit lasts less than a second in most cases. Conversely, the launch of a cyber operation from the territory of a State would take more than just a few electronic impulses. It would also integrate a physical dimension in most cases. Two situations should be distinguished from one another: firstly, the launch of a cyber operation via a cyber infrastructure that is remotely under the control of the perpetrator; secondly, the launch of a cyber operation from the territory of a State.\nA cyber operation can be launched via a cyber infrastructure located on the territory of one State, but be infected and controlled by the perpetrators located in another. This is, for instance, the case with bots, also known as 'zombified' computers, which are used to perpetrate DDoS attacks. The perpetrators of a DDoS attack targeting State A may be located in State B, using a botnet of 'zombified' computers located in States X, Y and Z. In this situation, what obligation arises in terms of due diligence of States X, Y and Z? Here again, they have no obligation to monitor their Internet traffic nor to know of all events and activities happening in the cyber infrastructure on their territory. The situation may be different if, as we will see in the next section, they know or should know about the malicious use of the controlled infrastructures on their territory.\nIn the case of a cyber operation launched directly from the territory of a State, for example by an organised group located on its territory, the duty of diligence applies. The territorial State has, in such cases, means other than solely cyber ones to make itself aware of such use. In the case of highly sophisticated cyber operations, the preparatory phases often involve physical input that may be detectable by the State. For instance, it may be visible that something is under preparation or already happening owing to an increase in activity of a specific group already under scrutiny by the State.\nI will come back to the distinction between State of transit and State of launch, and the consequences of this distinction for the application of the principle of due diligence to cyber operations, in the third section (8.3).",
    "## 8.2 The Absence of a Threshold of Harm": "The experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 condition the applicability of the principle of due diligence to two cumulative requirements: firstly, the cyber operation concerned must be 'contrary to the rights' of the affected\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nState under international law; and, secondly, it must have ‘serious adverse consequences’.⁴⁵ Moreover, they also ‘concurred that the due diligence principle extends to cyber operations conducted by non-State actors that, while not violating international law per se, nevertheless result in serious adverse consequences and [...] affect the right of the target State’.⁴⁶ In addition, they note that the threshold of harm does not depend on the occurrence of ‘physical damage to objects or injuries to individuals’.⁴⁷\nThe first requirement derives directly from the dictum of the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case,⁴⁸ and does not raise any specific issue. The second requirement, the threshold of harm, may be more controversial. The commentary to Rule 6 states that:\nThe precise threshold of harm at which the due diligence principle applies is unsettled in international law. All of the Experts agreed that the due diligence requirement arises when the situation involves a cyber operation that results in ‘serious adverse consequences’, although they could identify no bright line threshold for the identification of such consequences. They adopted this standard by analogy from application of the due diligence principle in the context of international environmental law. Some of them supported a lower threshold of application for the Rule, for instance, by proposing the term ‘significant’ or ‘substantial’ in lieu of ‘serious’.⁴⁹\nIndeed, in the Trail Smelter arbitral award, the court held that under the principles of international law, as well as of the law of the United States:\nno State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein, when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is established by clear and convincing evidence.⁵⁰\nThus, this arbitral award recognised the existence of a threshold of harm regarding the application of the principle of due diligence in preventing transboundary environmental harm.⁵¹ On this basis, the experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 assert that a similar standard exists regarding cyber operations.\n⁴⁵ ibid 34, commentary to Rule 6, para 15.\n⁴⁶ ibid 35, commentary to Rule 6, para 21.\n⁴⁷ ibid 37–38, commentary to Rule 6, para 28.\n⁴⁸ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22.\n⁴⁹ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 36–37, commentary to Rule 6, para 25 (footnotes omitted).\n⁵⁰ Trail Smelter case (United States, Canada) (n 8) 1965.\n⁵¹ See generally Kulesza (n 1) 91–105.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE ABSENCE OF A THRESHOLD OF HARM\nFurther on the experts clarified their idea, as they agreed that ‘merely affecting the interests of the target State, as in the case of causing inconvenience, minor disruption, or negligible expense, is not the type of harm envisaged; thus, not every use of a State’s territory that produces negative effects for a target State implicates the due diligence principle’.⁵²\nI am not convinced that such requirement of a threshold of harm is part of the customary principle of due diligence, and thus of the *lex lata* applicable to cyber operations. In my view, the assessment of the intensity of the cyber operations concerned does not condition whether the State has the possibility of invoking the obligation of due diligence of the territorial State from the perspective of international law. Conversely, it may condition whether the State will actually invoke the obligation of due diligence of the territorial State. It is thus not a legal requirement, but a requirement regarding the opportunity for the State to invoke this principle, or not. More precisely, the occurrence of a damage or harm is not a necessary element of the principle of due diligence.⁵³ According to the principle, States must exercise due diligence in ensuring that territory and objects over which they enjoy sovereignty are not to be used to harm other States. This principle does not require that an actual harm or damage occurs; on the contrary, it relies on the potential damage or harm that may be suffered by the other States. Even if this damage or harm never materialises, the State still has to comply with its duty of diligence. Consequently, the second requirement of ‘serious adverse consequences’ does not seem to flow from general international law nor does it seem justified.\nIn that perspective, my analysis of the threshold of harm for the principle of due diligence asserted by the *Tallinn Manual 2.0* is similar to the one I have already made regarding the same proposed threshold for the qualification of the violation of territorial sovereignty.⁵⁴\nTo conclude, it seems that the general customary principle of due diligence does not involve a threshold of harm. However, such threshold has already been identified in specific dimensions of the principle of due diligence, as for instance regarding transboundary environmental harm,\n⁵² Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 37, commentary to Rule 6, para 26.\n⁵³ More generally, the occurrence of a damage is not a necessary element of an internationally wrongful act; see: ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (2001) 2 Yearbook of the International Law Commission (Part II) 31, 92, commentary to Article 21, para 6; James Crawford, *State Responsibility: The General Part* (CUP 2013) 54et seq.\n⁵⁴ See supra 5.3.2.2B The Absence of a Damage Requirement.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nand may translate into other dimensions in the future, including cyber operations. Indeed, it is important to distinguish the recourse to the principle of due diligence to establish, on the one hand, the responsibility of a State for not having complied with its due diligence obligations, from, on the other, the liability of a State for a significant transboundary harm. In the first case, which was developed in the present section, there is not a threshold of harm, while in the second case, which is developed later, in Section 8.4, such a threshold exists.",
    "## 8.3 The Duty of a State to Take Measures to Terminate an Unlawful Cyber Operation Using Its Infrastructure": "Another principal component of the principle of due diligence is the obligation for a State that is aware of an unlawful cyber operation – which is using its cyber infrastructure – to take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate the operation.^^ The resulting obligation has three dimensions: firstly, knowledge of the cyber operation by the territorial State (8.2.1); secondly, balancing the feasibility and reasonableness of the measures that should be taken (8.2.2); and finally, the distinction between cyber operations merely transiting via the State and those emanating from the territory of the State (8.2.3).",
    "## 8.3.1 Knowledge of the Territorial State": "As a prerequisite, the territorial State has to be aware that a cyber operation is using its cyber infrastructure. Two situations should be distinguished from one another. Firstly, the victim State of a cyber operation has to notify the territorial State and ask it to take measures to terminate it. In such cases, there is no doubt that the territorial State is aware of the cyber operation and thus is obliged to take all feasible and reasonable measures against it. Secondly, the territorial State may also know about it even in the absence of notification by the victim State. In such circumstances, the burden of proof that the territorial State knows or should have known about the cyber operation is on the victim State. There is no transfer of the burden of proof as the territorial State has no\n^ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 43, Rule 7; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 37; Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 72–75. See, more generally, Tehran Hostages (Judgment) (n 14) 32–33, para 68.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE DUTY TO TAKE MEASURES TO TERMINATE THE ACT 367\nobligation to have absolute knowledge of everything taking place on its territory.⁵⁶ When a State has actual knowledge, then it is without a shadow of a doubt bound by the duty of diligence.⁵⁷\nIs constructive knowledge sufficient? In other words, is the fact that a State should have known about the cyber operation enough? The experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 ‘agreed that knowledge encompasses constructive knowledge for the purpose of [Rule 6]’.⁵⁸ On the one hand, the territorial State ‘cannot evade such a request by limiting itself to a reply that it is ignorant of the circumstances of the act and of its authors. The State may, up to a certain point, be bound to supply particulars of the use made by it of the means of information and inquiry at its disposal.’⁵⁹ On the other, the standard of proof would be very high for the State invoking its responsibility to prove that the territorial State should have known. Ultimately, the State invoking non-compliance with the duty of diligence would have to prove that the territorial State actually knew, rather than should have known.",
    "## 8.3.2 Measures to Terminate the Cyber Operation": "A State that knows its territory is being used for the perpetration of an unlawful cyber operation must take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate it.⁶⁰ As an obligation of conduct and not of result, the State is expected to undertake its ‘best efforts’ to terminate the cyber operation, but would not bear responsibility only because it failed to terminate it.⁶¹ Conversely, if the State did not use all means at its disposal, and did not take all feasible and reasonable measures, it would not have fulfilled its obligation under the duty of diligence.\nIn a number of cases, the speed of cyber operations may render the principle of due diligence almost inapplicable. Some cyber operations only take milliseconds to launch, transit and produce effects, and thus the\n⁵⁶ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 18.\n⁵⁷ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 40, commentary to Rule 6, para 37; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 28–29.\n⁵⁸ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 41, commentary to Rule 6, para 39. Interestingly, the experts taking part in the first edition of the Tallinn Manual were split on this issue: Schmitt, Tallinn Manual (n 28) 28, commentary to Rule 5, para 11; see also Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 29.\n⁵⁹ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 18.\n⁶⁰ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 43, Rule 7.\n⁶¹ Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 7) 221, para 430.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nterritorial State would not have enough time to identify them and respond accordingly.⁶² Already in the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ highlighted the significance of the time dimension.⁶³ An instantaneous reaction is not expected from the territorial State, which must have enough time to be made aware and react. The speed of certain cyber operations renders reaction even more complicated. This is, however, not true of all cyber operations. Some have a continuous character, at least for some of the time. DDoS attacks, for instance, need to take place over a period of time to be effective. Similarly, complex cyber operations, such as Stuxnet, last for several years, during which time they may continuously communicate with their perpetrator and thus use cyber infrastructures located in various countries, for example remotely controlled servers. In such cases, the duty of diligence is particularly relevant. In the case of an ongoing DDoS attack, for instance, the victim State may make a request to the States in which the zombified computers and controlling servers are located to take action against them. It may not halt the DDoS attack but it may diminish its scale and effects.",
    "## 8.3.3 Distinction between State of Transit and State of Launch": "Does the duty of diligence apply to cyber operations that are only transiting through the territory of a State? In other words, does the territorial State have an obligation to take measures to terminate the transit of a cyber operation via the computer networks located on its territory? The experts taking part in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 consider that the obligation of due diligence also applies to the transit State, which must act accordingly ‘when it (1) possesses knowledge [...] of an offending operation that reaches the requisite threshold of harm and (2) can take feasible measures to effectively terminate it’.⁶⁴ Karine Bannelier-Christakis rightly highlights that ‘there is no legal reason to consider that transit States do not have a duty of diligence’.⁶⁵ The State of transit has, in theory, the obligation under the duty of diligence to take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate the transit of a cyber operation via the computer networks located on its territory.\n⁶² Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 28.\n⁶³ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22–23.\n⁶⁴ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 33, commentary to Rule 6, para 13.\n⁶⁵ Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 27.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO PREVENT SIGNIFICANT TRANSBOUNDARY HARM 369\nThe technical reality is an important limitation to this duty.⁶⁶ The Internet has been conceived in a way that the packets should arrive at their destination even if the path they use is no longer available. If the paths used by the packets to reach their target is not available, they will use another one. Although this reality makes the duty to terminate the transit difficult to implement, it is not impossible. Implementation would probably slow down or even temporarily block the perpetration of a cyber operation, or diminish the scale of a DDoS attack, but it would never constitute a panacea.\nThe balancing of reasonableness is important in such cases. For instance, it appears unreasonable to expect the transit State to shut down all Internet traffic transiting via its territory in order to end a cyber operation. What should be expected from the State is not its shut-down, but rather the implementation of filters capable of blocking specific packets that embed malicious code from transiting through their networks when they are aware of it. Again, the speed of most cyber operations may render this operation irrelevant, as the time needed to implement these filters may exceed the length of the actual cyber operation.\nIn short, the duty of diligence extends to the State of transit, but the technical reality of the operations of computer networks and the transit of cyber operations render such duty almost impossible to implement. This reality does not prevent the transit State from taking measures, if possible, nor does it excuse its inaction.",
    "## 8.4 Toward a Duty to Prevent the Potential Significant Transboundary Harm Caused by Cyber Operations": "A State may be held responsible for a cyber operation that is attributable to it and constitutes an internationally wrongful act. Due diligence is a subsidiary principle to State responsibility according to which a State may be held responsible for the occurrence of a cyber operation, without being responsible for the cyber operation itself. More recently, this principle has also served as a basis for the development of a regime of State liability for the consequences of acts that are not prohibited under\n⁶⁶ See also Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 34, commentary to Rule 6, para 14.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\ninternational law. Such a regime of liability has found fertile ground in international space law⁶⁷ and international environmental law.\nIn international environmental law, States have an obligation to prevent the use of their territory for activities causing injury or damage in the territory of another State as well as a duty to prevent transboundary harm from hazardous activities. The first obligation was introduced in the Trail Smelter arbitration. In this case, the aerial pollution of a Canadian smelter located near the border with the United States damaged trees and crops located in American territory. The Tribunal noted that:\nunder the principles of international law, as well as of the law of the United States, no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein, when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is established by clear and convincing evidence.⁶⁸\nThe ILC also worked on the question of the consequences of transboundary harms resulting from an act not prohibited under international law, and ultimately adopted the ‘Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities’ in 2001⁶⁹ and the ‘Draft Principles on the Allocation of Loss in the Case of Transboundary Harm Arising out of Hazardous Activities’ in 2006.⁷⁰\nThe duty of diligence stipulated in international environmental law or international space law cannot be transposed directly to the cyber realm given that the situations are different. It shows, however, some interesting paths that could be taken in order to develop a similar duty of diligence regarding cyber activities. WannaCry and NotPetya may constitute at the maximum breaches of the territorial sovereignty of the targeted States.⁷¹\n⁶⁷ Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (adopted on 29 March 1972, entered into force on 1 September 1972) 961 UNTS 187, 24 UST 2389, 10 ILM 965 (1971).\n⁶⁸ Trail Smelter case (United States, Canada) (n 8), 1965.\n⁶⁹ ‘Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities’ (adopted by the Commission at its fifty-third session, in 2001, and submitted to the General Assembly as a part of the Commission’s report covering the work of that session (A/56/10)).\n⁷⁰ ‘Draft Principles on the Allocation of Loss in the Case of Transboundary Harm Arising out of Hazardous Activities’ (adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-eighth session, in 2006, and submitted to the General Assembly as a part of the Commission’s report covering the work of that session (A/61/10)).\n⁷¹ See supra 230–232.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO DISCLOSE ZERO-DAY VULNERABILITIES\n371\nYet, they resulted in massive economic loss for numerous companies in several States. We may wonder whether a specific regime could develop under international law to cover such losses. In such cases, the obligation of the perpetrating State would be twofold. Firstly, it would be responsible for internationally wrongful acts it committed, for instance the breach of the territorial sovereignty of the victim States. Secondly, it would be held liable for the harm and damage resulting from its cyber operations. Moreover, such regime could also be applied in cases in which the cyber operations concerned were not amounting to an internationally wrongful act. In such case, the responsibility of the perpetrating State could not be invoked, but the State could be held liable for the resulting harm and damage. It must be recalled that such principle has not yet been clearly created regarding cybersecurity and cyber operations, and thus the assertions made in this paragraph are purely hypothetical.\nIf such duty to prevent transboundary harm caused by cyber operations was to be recognised, it would be conditioned to a threshold of harm. Indeed, a State would be liable only when the transboundary harm was of a certain significance, as is the case in international environmental law.\nThe recognition of such a principle of liability regarding the consequences of cyber operations could also contribute to the creation and strengthening of a global culture of cybersecurity. Indeed, it might prompt States to be more cautious about, and careful when, conducting cyber operations, notably regarding the potential for the involuntary spread of malware and side effects of these operations. The recognition of such a principle of liability for the transboundary harm caused by cyber operations currently remains a highly hypothetical scenario, which can only be confirmed by State practice.",
    "## 8.5 Toward a Duty to Disclose Zero-Day Vulnerabilities": "The WannaCry case leads to two distinct questions regarding State responsibility. Firstly, some States have publicly attributed WannaCry to North Korea, and they could thus have invoked the responsibility of North Korea under international law, if they consider WannaCry to be an internationally wrongful act.72\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nThe second question on responsibility departs from the traditional approach of the law on State responsibility: is the United States responsible for not having informed Microsoft of the existence of a vulnerability in their product and for having created the exploit later used by WannaCry?\nThe Russian President Vladimir Putin stated about WannaCry that '[a]s regards the source of these threats, I believe that the leadership of Microsoft have announced this plainly, that the initial source of the virus is the intelligence services of the United States'.73\nIn a similar vein, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, declared in a statement on Microsoft's blog:\nFinally, this attack provides yet another example of why the stockpiling of vulnerabilities by governments is such a problem. This is an emerging pattern in 2017. We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks, and now this vulnerability stolen from the NSA has affected customers around the world. Repeatedly, exploits in the hands of governments have leaked into the public domain and caused widespread damage. An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the U.S. military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen. And this most recent attack represents a completely unintended but disconcerting link between the two most serious forms of cybersecurity threats in the world today – nation-state action and organized criminal action.\nThe governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call. They need to take a different approach and adhere in cyberspace to the same rules applied to weapons in the physical world. We need governments to consider the damage to civilians that comes from hoarding these vulnerabilities and the use of these exploits. This is one reason we called in February for a new 'Digital Geneva Convention' to govern these issues, including a new requirement for governments to report vulnerabilities to vendors, rather than stockpile, sell, or exploit them.74\nTo be addressed, the question of the potential responsibility of the United States regarding WannaCry and NotPetya must be broken down into three sub-questions.\n73 Macarena Vidal Liy, 'Putin culpa a los servicios secretos de EE UU por el virus \"WannaCry\" que desencadenó el ciberataque mundial', *El País* (Madrid, 15 May 2017) https://elpais.com/internacional/2017/05/15/actualidad/1494855826_022843.html; 'Putin Warns of Risks of Governments Creating Hacking Tools', *Reuters* (15 May 2017) www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attacks-putin-idUSKCN18B15Y..\n74 Brad Smith, 'The Need for Urgent Collective Action to Keep People Safe Online: Lessons from Last Week's Cyberattack' (Microsoft On the Issues, 14 May 2017) https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/05/14/need-urgent-collective-action-keep-people-safe-online-lessons-last-weeks-cyberattack/.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO DISCLOSE ZERO-DAY VULNERABILITIES\n373\nThe first sub-question concerns whether the paternity of the NSA over EternalBlue and DoublePulsar is enough to attribute WannaCry to the United States. The answer is indubitably no. The fact that an actor, including a State, uses a tool produced by another State is not enough to attribute the consequences of that use to the latter State. Indeed, it does not create a sufficient subordination nexus, if any, between the concerned State and the perpetrator.\nThe second sub-question concerns whether the behaviour of the United States constitutes a breach of its obligation of due diligence. In other words, whether the United States knowingly allowed the use of its territory for the perpetration of WannaCry – if we paraphrase the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.75 In the WannaCry situation, however, the territory of the United States was not used for the perpetration of the ransomware campaign. Consequently, the United States has not breached its obligation of due diligence regarding the use of its territory.\nFinally, the third sub-question concerns whether there might be a plurality of actors sharing the responsibility for WannaCry, including the United States, and this is addressed later in the book.76\nThis section demonstrated that neither the non-disclosure of a vulnerability nor the development of a related exploit by a State constitutes an internationally wrongful act.77 Similarly, in a situation in which a third party would use this vulnerability or exploit, this State could not be held responsible under international law. That being said, it is important to note that the approach of States on the disclosure of vulnerabilities is slowly evolving owing to the global pressure for more transparency following, inter alia, the Snowden revelations and more recently the leak of the NSA's hacking tool by the Shadow Brokers. Several States are indeed implementing Vulnerabilities Equities Processes (VEP) aimed at determining whether they should disclose zero-day vulnerabilities or keep them secret for potential future use.78\n75 Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22.\n76 See infra 420.\n77 This analysis was developed during the master class I delivered with Aude Géry at the Forum international de la Cybersécurité in January 2018 on 'Proliferation of Cyberweapons and International Law'.\n78 See, for instance: Sasha Romanosky, 'Developing an Objective, Repeatable Scoring System for a Vulnerability Equities Process' (Lawfare, 4 February 2019) www.lawfareblog.com/developing-objective-repeatable-scoring-system-vulnerability-equities-process; Sven Herpig and Ari Schwartz, 'The Future of Vulnerabilities Equities Processes Around the World' (Lawfare, 4 January 2019) www.lawfareblog.com/future-vulnerabilities-equities-processes-around-world; Kate Charlet, Sasha Romanosky and Bert Thompson, 'It's Time for the International Community to Get Serious about Vulnerability Equities'\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE",
    "## 8.6 Concluding Remarks on Cyber Due Diligence": "The obligation of due diligence is an obligation of conduct, and not of result. States are under a duty to both prevent the use of cyber infrastructure and take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate cyber operations emanating from or transiting through the computer networks located on their territory. This duty does not include an obligation to monitor all Internet traffic within the computer networks on the territory of the State. Similarly, the duty of diligence can only be invoked during an ongoing unlawful action, such as a cyber operation.⁷⁹\nIn the same tenor as *ad impossibilia nemo tenetur*, or ‘nobody is held to the impossible’, the measures adopted by the territorial State must be assessed in light of the test of reasonableness and feasibility. They must not represent an overly onerous burden on the State. Thus, the measures must be commensurate with its capacity, which may differ from State to State. The State is free to choose the measures to be implemented, which can take various forms including being of a technical, political or legal nature.⁸⁰ The duty of diligence cannot impose a duty to enact specific legislation as this would then shift from an obligation of conduct to an obligation of result.⁸¹ It may, however, constitute a strong incentive to integrate some specific legislative measures into the domestic legal order for the purposes of compliance.\nIn a limited number of cases, the victim State of the cyber operation would be entitled to invoke the responsibility of the territorial State for not complying with its duty of diligence, and even to compel the territorial State to take appropriate measures.⁸²\nPart I was dedicated to the question of attribution. Due diligence may constitute an interesting palliative to the problem of attribution.⁸³ Most cyber operations that have taken place are almost impossible to attribute to a State or other actor with any certainty. In several cases, the victim State will have a strong suspicion that one or more States are responsible\n(Lawfare, 15 November 2017) www.lawfareblog.com/its-time-international-community-get-serious-about-vulnerability-equities.\n⁷⁹ Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 75.\n⁸⁰ Ziolkowski (n 23) 169.\n⁸¹ Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 33–35.\n⁸² Part III of this book deals specifically with State responsibility and measures of self-help to be taken by the victim State against the responsible State; see *infra* Chapter 9 and Chapter 10.\n⁸³ In this perspective, see the interesting discussion on the relationship between State sovereignty and due diligence regarding international security in Kulesza (n 1) 276 et seq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n375\nfor the cyber operation; however, often it will not have any definitive material proof to support such allegations. In some cases, if the victim State is able to prove that the cyber operation was launched from or transited through the territory of a State, then it could thus invoke the territorial State's responsibility for the non-fulfilment of its obligation of due diligence. This would offer a basis for the victim State to invoke the responsibility of and take measures against the State that is allegedly responsible. The remedies and measures to be taken by the victim State against the responsible State must be proportionate and necessary. Clearly, they will be of less intensity in cases involving the non-fulfilment of due diligence than in cases involving a definitive attribution of an unlawful cyber operation.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press"

The duty of diligence was referred to by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case: every State has the ‘obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’. It is an old principle that was used in 1872 in the Alabama arbitration concerning the duty of neutrality of the United Kingdom during the American Civil War. It derives directly from the principles of territorial sovereignty and the sovereign equality of States, as recalled by Max Huber in the Island of Palmas arbitration:\nTerritorial sovereignty [...] involves the exclusive right to display the activities of a State. This right has as corollary a duty: the obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States, in particular their\n On the principle of due diligence, see, generally: the seminal work of Joanna Kulesza, *Due Diligence in International Law* (Brill &amp; Martinus Nijhoff Publishers 2016); Riccardo Pisillo Mazzeschi, *‘Due diligence’ e responsabilità internazionale degli stati* (Giuffrè 1989).

A State will incur responsibility not because it did not achieve the expected result but because it manifestly failed to take measures to prevent the act from happening despite being under an obligation to do so. The attribution of the act does not matter; it can be perpetrated by a State or a non-state actor. The only matter of concern is the fact that the concerned State allows its territory to be used for the perpetration of acts contrary to the rights of another State.\nThe principle of due diligence found fertile ground in international environmental law, diplomatic law and the protection of aliens. Due diligence obligations have, however, developed in various other branches of international law. In international jurisprudence, such obligations have included, inter alia, the duty of neutrality during the American Civil War, the obligation to notify ships of the existence of mines in their waters, the obligation to protect the diplomatic and consular premises and staff of a foreign State, the duty to tackle the flow of arms crossing the territory of a State, the duty to take action against rebel groups\n The Island of Palmas (or Miangas) (1928) 11 RIAA 831, 839; see also Affaire des biens britanniques au Maroc espagnol (Espagne contre Royaume-Uni) (1925) 2 RIAA 615, 649.\n On the distinction between obligation of result and obligation of conduct, see: Alain Pellet et al, Droit international public (8th edn, LGDJ 2009) 859–862, para 473.\n Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

As mentioned, the obligation of due diligence developed in various branches of international law, but the notion is also used to describe other forms of legal or political obligations, within and outside the realm of international law. Broadly, due diligence is understood as a standard of conduct required to discharge an obligation. In other words, due diligence is often referred to as representing a certain standard of conduct that should be observed by States or other actors in performing particular acts or regarding specific obligations. The recent discussion in the European Journal of International Law on the ‘human rights due diligence’ in the 2011 United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights perfectly highlights the risk of confusion between the various dimensions of due diligence, and notably the ongoing debate on the due diligence of both private and public actors. The development of ICT technologies also raises the question of the due diligence obligations of both public and private actors. Alongside the obligation for a State not to allow knowingly its ICT infrastructure to be used for malicious acts, there are also the questions, for instance, of the duties of private companies not to let their ICT infrastructure be used for such acts and to avoid releasing software flawed with vulnerabilities. The private sector’s due diligence is outside the scope of this book. Consequently, it seems necessary to clarify that the present chapter focuses exclusively on due diligence understood as ‘every State’s obligation not to\n Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

This would mean that it imposes a duty on States not to allow their territory to be used for the launch or transit of cyber operations targeting another State. In that perspective, due diligence may constitute an interesting palliative to the problem of attribution.\nThe principle of due diligence in international law is particularly relevant regarding the behaviours of non-state actors, since this principle subjects these behaviours to some limitations imposed by international law by creating a bridge between them and State responsibility. International law is primarily the law of States and it cannot generally be enforced directly upon non-state actors. The principle of due diligence renders a State responsible or liable for the occurrence of acts of other actors, including non-state actors, perpetrated in its territory or jurisdiction in some specific circumstances. This is the sense of the sixth norm of the 'Singapore Norm Package' adopted by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) in November 2018:\nNon-state actors should not engage in offensive cyber operations and state actors should prevent and respond to such activities if they occur.\n Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22.\n Karine Bannelier-Christakis, 'Obligations de diligence dans le cyberespace: qui a peur de la cyber-diligence?'

The GCSC demonstrates here how this principle is relevant to regulating such a situation, emphasising in the commentary to the norm that ‘[i]f states permit such action, they may therefore be held responsible under international law. States must act, domestically and internationally, to prevent offensive cyber operations by non-state actors.’\nThe UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security integrated cyber due diligence into its 2013 report as a norm of behaviour, and again in its 2015 report. The report stated that ‘States should seek to ensure that their territories are not used by non-State actors for unlawful use of ICTs’.\nSimilarly, the experts involved in the Tallinn Manual process agreed on the application of the principle of due diligence. In the Tallinn Manual 1.0, Rule 5 dealt with the principle of due diligence, and the commentary makes clear that the experts disagreed on the particular features of this principle. In the Tallinn Manual 2.0, Rule 6 rephrases\n ibid 19 (footnote omitted).\n UNGA, ‘Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ (24 June 2013) UN Doc A/68/98, para 23.

In addition, the Tallinn Manual states that a neutral State to an international armed conflict should not allow its cyber infrastructure to be used by the belligerent parties: ibid 252, Rule 93.

Ian Yuying Liu wrote an article analysing the Tallinn Manual 2.0’s rules on due diligence as well as the reluctance of some States regarding the application of the principle of due diligence to cyber conducts: Ian Yuying Liu, ‘The Due Diligence Doctrine under Tallinn Manual 2.0’ (2017) 33 Computer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 390. Michael\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nand modifies the fifth Rule of the first edition, and reads: '[a] State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States';[31] in addition, Rule 7 deals with compliance with the due diligence principle and recalls that States are required to take all feasible measures that are foreseeable.[32]\nThe application of the principle of due diligence to the cyber realm remains, however, a controversial issue. Some States are reluctant to extend this principle to cyberspace because of the corresponding obligations it would impose on them.[33] Moreover, another difficulty arises concerning the distinction between States from which the cyber operation is launched and States of transit, that is to say States through which the cyber operation is routed. The present chapter asserts that the principle of due diligence is applicable to cyber operations, and analyses how it applies and what the corresponding obligations that it imposes on States are. The duty of cyber due diligence may be seen as a coin with two faces; on the one side, there is the duty to prevent the use of the ICT infrastructure (8.1), and on the other, there is the obligation to take measures to terminate a cyber operation that has been detected (8.3). This chapter also analyses whether the invocation of the principle of due diligence is subject to a threshold of harm (8.2). Moreover, this chapter investigates two possible variations of due diligence regarding cyber operations, that may be developed in the future: the creation of a duty to (i) prevent the potential transboundary harm caused by cyber operations (8.4) and (ii) disclose zero-day vulnerabilities (8.5).\n## 8.1 Does a Duty to Prevent Any Use of State Cyber Infrastructures Exist?\nDoes a State have a general duty to prevent any use of its cyber infrastructure for the perpetration by another State, or by non-state actors, of a cyber operation against another State? Such obligation may be\nN Schmitt published an article highlighting some points dealt with in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that would deserve further work, including due diligence: Michael N Schmitt, 'Grey Zones in the International Law of Cyberspace' (2017) 42 The Yale Journal of International Law Online 1, 11-13.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO PREVENT\n\n## 8.1.1 A State Has No Obligation to Have Absolute Knowledge of All Events and Activities on Its Territory or in Cyber Infrastructures under Its Control\nUnder international law, a State is not obliged to have absolute knowledge of all events and activities happening on its territory. As recalled by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case:\nit cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known, of any unlawful act perpetrated therein, nor yet that it necessarily knew, or should have known, the authors.\nThe fact that the cyber operation emanates from or transits through the computer networks located on the territory of a State does not render this State responsible, nor does it transfer the burden of proof onto, this State.\nA State is under the obligation to take all feasible measures to prevent the use of its territory for activities that breach the rights of other States. As already mentioned, it is an obligation of conduct – to take measures – and not of result.\nI agree with the experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that the obligation of due diligence of a State applies regarding cyber activities taking place on its territory and extends extraterritorially to those taking place on\n Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 18.\n ibid.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\ncontrolled territory abroad, as well as in cyber infrastructure located abroad under its control.\nIn the cyber realm, does this obligation impose a duty on the State to monitor the Internet traffic emanating from and transiting via its cyber infrastructure? The next section demonstrates why the question should be answered negatively.\n## 8.1.2 The Slippery Slope of Justifying Mass Surveillance\nA general duty to know what is happening in the computer networks of a State may be understood as implying mass and indiscriminate surveillance of these networks by the State. Thus, such a duty would serve as a justification for mass surveillance. Not only does it risk a slippery slope in terms of civil liberties and human rights, but it would also be of limited relevance for the duty of diligence, as detailed below.\nThe mass surveillance programme of the NSA was, at its best, able to monitor 75 per cent of US Internet traffic. Thus, it was not able to monitor all the traffic emanating or transiting through the State. Even if it was possible to monitor all the Internet traffic, the treatment of the monitored data would necessitate too much work to be relevant or even attainable. Indeed, in the case of the mass-surveillance programme, the objective is generally to filter specific communications or the use of specific words, i.e. there is something to look for. In the case of cyber operations, they can take a wide variety of forms and it would be almost impossible to identify specific filters that would allow them to be detected. Monitoring the metadata would not suffice. It would be necessary to undertake a deep inspection of each packet of data to determine its real content and the purpose of this content. Moreover, it is not very difficult to embed a malicious code into another code of legitimate software; therefore, it would be necessary to be able to distinguish which part of the code belongs to the malware. The perpetrators would also sooner or later understand how the filters operate and would be able to adapt the structure of their malicious code to address the new situation, therefore always managing to find cracks in the system and to exploit\n Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 32–33, commentary to Rule 6, paras 8–10.\n Jennifer Valentino-Devries and Siobhan Gorman, ‘New Details Show Broader NSA Surveillance Reach: Programs Cover 75% of Nation’s Traffic, Can Snare Emails’, Wall Street Journal (20 August 2013) www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324108204579022874091732470.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO PREVENT\n\nOne may argue that the surveillance activities of a State are limited by international law, human rights law and domestic law, which would limit the possible negative consequences. Yet, taking this approach would be a very slippery slope with almost no value in preventing cyber threats from using the computer networks of a State.\nAs often noted already, the duty of diligence is only an obligation of conduct and not of result. Nonetheless, a requirement to monitor Internet traffic would then transform into a justification for mass-surveillance programmes without actually making much contribution to fulfilling this duty. The duty of diligence must not constitute an excessive burden on\n Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual* (n 28) 27, commentary to Rule 5, para 4; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 28.\n Schmitt, *'Due Diligence in Cyberspace'* (n 22) 72–73.\n *ibid* 75.\n Bannelier-Christakis (n 22) 644; Bannelier and Christakis (n 4) 20; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 30.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nthe State, and the implementation of such monitoring would represent a twofold excessive burden – on the State's capacities and human rights law. Thus, such an obligation would be considered unreasonable.\nThe situation may differ if such monitoring capacities already exist. In such cases, does the State with monitoring capacities have an obligation to use them in order to comply with its due diligence obligations? The short answer is yes. The State has an obligation to use any means at its disposal to comply with its due diligence duty. Thus, the duty of diligence does not oblige the State to implement a monitoring programme for Internet traffic, but when such capacities already exist, then the State has to use them. The content of the duty of diligence depends on the capacity of each State. The ILA's first report on due diligence highlighted this point in regard to due diligence in human rights law and international environmental law. It stressed that it was necessary to differentiate between the treatment of developed States and that of developing ones, as they may not have the same capacity to control and to comply with their due diligence duty. Similarly, in cyberspace not all States are equal and some may be better equipped to comply with their obligations than others, in particular those where a mass-surveillance programme already exists and therefore may be used to monitor cyber activities. The burden of the duty of diligence must be reasonable, however. It cannot exceed the State's capacity.\nIn sum, the duty of diligence does not impose a duty on States to monitor the Internet traffic of cyber infrastructures located on their territory, nor to develop the necessary technologies to perform such monitoring. In the case of a State having already developed the capabilities to conduct such monitoring programmes, to comply with the obligation of diligence this State would have to use these capabilities. It must be highlighted that such situation does not legitimate nor preclude the potential wrongfulness of such capabilities under domestic or international laws.\n## 8.1.3 The Difference between Cyber Operations Launched from or Solely Transiting through the Territory of the State\nIt is impossible to completely separate cyber operations from the physical world. A cyber operation that is simply transiting through the territory of\n ILA Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law – First Report (n 1) respectively 18 and 27.\n Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 74–75.\n For a similar view, see Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 43–46, commentary to Rule 7, paras 3–13.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE ABSENCE OF A THRESHOLD OF HARM\na State only requires electronic impulses via cables and devices, and this transit lasts less than a second in most cases. Conversely, the launch of a cyber operation from the territory of a State would take more than just a few electronic impulses. It would also integrate a physical dimension in most cases. Two situations should be distinguished from one another: firstly, the launch of a cyber operation via a cyber infrastructure that is remotely under the control of the perpetrator; secondly, the launch of a cyber operation from the territory of a State.\nA cyber operation can be launched via a cyber infrastructure located on the territory of one State, but be infected and controlled by the perpetrators located in another. This is, for instance, the case with bots, also known as 'zombified' computers, which are used to perpetrate DDoS attacks. The perpetrators of a DDoS attack targeting State A may be located in State B, using a botnet of 'zombified' computers located in States X, Y and Z. In this situation, what obligation arises in terms of due diligence of States X, Y and Z? Here again, they have no obligation to monitor their Internet traffic nor to know of all events and activities happening in the cyber infrastructure on their territory. The situation may be different if, as we will see in the next section, they know or should know about the malicious use of the controlled infrastructures on their territory.\nIn the case of a cyber operation launched directly from the territory of a State, for example by an organised group located on its territory, the duty of diligence applies. The territorial State has, in such cases, means other than solely cyber ones to make itself aware of such use. In the case of highly sophisticated cyber operations, the preparatory phases often involve physical input that may be detectable by the State. For instance, it may be visible that something is under preparation or already happening owing to an increase in activity of a specific group already under scrutiny by the State.\nI will come back to the distinction between State of transit and State of launch, and the consequences of this distinction for the application of the principle of due diligence to cyber operations, in the third section (8.3).\n## 8.2 The Absence of a Threshold of Harm\nThe experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 condition the applicability of the principle of due diligence to two cumulative requirements: firstly, the cyber operation concerned must be 'contrary to the rights' of the affected\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nState under international law; and, secondly, it must have ‘serious adverse consequences’. Moreover, they also ‘concurred that the due diligence principle extends to cyber operations conducted by non-State actors that, while not violating international law per se, nevertheless result in serious adverse consequences and [...] affect the right of the target State’. In addition, they note that the threshold of harm does not depend on the occurrence of ‘physical damage to objects or injuries to individuals’.\nThe first requirement derives directly from the dictum of the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case, and does not raise any specific issue. The second requirement, the threshold of harm, may be more controversial. The commentary to Rule 6 states that:\nThe precise threshold of harm at which the due diligence principle applies is unsettled in international law. All of the Experts agreed that the due diligence requirement arises when the situation involves a cyber operation that results in ‘serious adverse consequences’, although they could identify no bright line threshold for the identification of such consequences. They adopted this standard by analogy from application of the due diligence principle in the context of international environmental law. Some of them supported a lower threshold of application for the Rule, for instance, by proposing the term ‘significant’ or ‘substantial’ in lieu of ‘serious’.\nIndeed, in the Trail Smelter arbitral award, the court held that under the principles of international law, as well as of the law of the United States:\nno State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein, when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is established by clear and convincing evidence.\nThus, this arbitral award recognised the existence of a threshold of harm regarding the application of the principle of due diligence in preventing transboundary environmental harm. On this basis, the experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 assert that a similar standard exists regarding cyber operations.\n ibid 34, commentary to Rule 6, para 15.\n ibid 35, commentary to Rule 6, para 21.\n ibid 37–38, commentary to Rule 6, para 28.\n Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22.\n Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 36–37, commentary to Rule 6, para 25 (footnotes omitted).\n Trail Smelter case (United States, Canada) (n 8) 1965.\n See generally Kulesza (n 1) 91–105.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE ABSENCE OF A THRESHOLD OF HARM\nFurther on the experts clarified their idea, as they agreed that ‘merely affecting the interests of the target State, as in the case of causing inconvenience, minor disruption, or negligible expense, is not the type of harm envisaged; thus, not every use of a State’s territory that produces negative effects for a target State implicates the due diligence principle’.\nI am not convinced that such requirement of a threshold of harm is part of the customary principle of due diligence, and thus of the *lex lata* applicable to cyber operations. In my view, the assessment of the intensity of the cyber operations concerned does not condition whether the State has the possibility of invoking the obligation of due diligence of the territorial State from the perspective of international law. Conversely, it may condition whether the State will actually invoke the obligation of due diligence of the territorial State. It is thus not a legal requirement, but a requirement regarding the opportunity for the State to invoke this principle, or not. More precisely, the occurrence of a damage or harm is not a necessary element of the principle of due diligence. According to the principle, States must exercise due diligence in ensuring that territory and objects over which they enjoy sovereignty are not to be used to harm other States. This principle does not require that an actual harm or damage occurs; on the contrary, it relies on the potential damage or harm that may be suffered by the other States. Even if this damage or harm never materialises, the State still has to comply with its duty of diligence. Consequently, the second requirement of ‘serious adverse consequences’ does not seem to flow from general international law nor does it seem justified.\nIn that perspective, my analysis of the threshold of harm for the principle of due diligence asserted by the *Tallinn Manual 2.0* is similar to the one I have already made regarding the same proposed threshold for the qualification of the violation of territorial sovereignty.\nTo conclude, it seems that the general customary principle of due diligence does not involve a threshold of harm. However, such threshold has already been identified in specific dimensions of the principle of due diligence, as for instance regarding transboundary environmental harm,\n Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 37, commentary to Rule 6, para 26.\n More generally, the occurrence of a damage is not a necessary element of an internationally wrongful act; see: ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (2001) 2 Yearbook of the International Law Commission (Part II) 31, 92, commentary to Article 21, para 6; James Crawford, *State Responsibility: The General Part* (CUP 2013) 54et seq.\n See supra 5.3.2.2B The Absence of a Damage Requirement.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nand may translate into other dimensions in the future, including cyber operations. Indeed, it is important to distinguish the recourse to the principle of due diligence to establish, on the one hand, the responsibility of a State for not having complied with its due diligence obligations, from, on the other, the liability of a State for a significant transboundary harm. In the first case, which was developed in the present section, there is not a threshold of harm, while in the second case, which is developed later, in Section 8.4, such a threshold exists.\n## 8.3 The Duty of a State to Take Measures to Terminate an Unlawful Cyber Operation Using Its Infrastructure\nAnother principal component of the principle of due diligence is the obligation for a State that is aware of an unlawful cyber operation – which is using its cyber infrastructure – to take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate the operation.^[55]^ The resulting obligation has three dimensions: firstly, knowledge of the cyber operation by the territorial State (8.2.1); secondly, balancing the feasibility and reasonableness of the measures that should be taken (8.2.2); and finally, the distinction between cyber operations merely transiting via the State and those emanating from the territory of the State (8.2.3).\n## 8.3.1 Knowledge of the Territorial State\nAs a prerequisite, the territorial State has to be aware that a cyber operation is using its cyber infrastructure. Two situations should be distinguished from one another. Firstly, the victim State of a cyber operation has to notify the territorial State and ask it to take measures to terminate it. In such cases, there is no doubt that the territorial State is aware of the cyber operation and thus is obliged to take all feasible and reasonable measures against it. Secondly, the territorial State may also know about it even in the absence of notification by the victim State. In such circumstances, the burden of proof that the territorial State knows or should have known about the cyber operation is on the victim State. There is no transfer of the burden of proof as the territorial State has no\n^[55] Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 43, Rule 7; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 37; Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 72–75. See, more generally, Tehran Hostages (Judgment) (n 14) 32–33, para 68.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE DUTY TO TAKE MEASURES TO TERMINATE THE ACT 367\nobligation to have absolute knowledge of everything taking place on its territory. When a State has actual knowledge, then it is without a shadow of a doubt bound by the duty of diligence.\nIs constructive knowledge sufficient? In other words, is the fact that a State should have known about the cyber operation enough? The experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 ‘agreed that knowledge encompasses constructive knowledge for the purpose of [Rule 6]’. On the one hand, the territorial State ‘cannot evade such a request by limiting itself to a reply that it is ignorant of the circumstances of the act and of its authors. The State may, up to a certain point, be bound to supply particulars of the use made by it of the means of information and inquiry at its disposal.’ On the other, the standard of proof would be very high for the State invoking its responsibility to prove that the territorial State should have known. Ultimately, the State invoking non-compliance with the duty of diligence would have to prove that the territorial State actually knew, rather than should have known.\n## 8.3.2 Measures to Terminate the Cyber Operation\nA State that knows its territory is being used for the perpetration of an unlawful cyber operation must take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate it. As an obligation of conduct and not of result, the State is expected to undertake its ‘best efforts’ to terminate the cyber operation, but would not bear responsibility only because it failed to terminate it. Conversely, if the State did not use all means at its disposal, and did not take all feasible and reasonable measures, it would not have fulfilled its obligation under the duty of diligence.\nIn a number of cases, the speed of cyber operations may render the principle of due diligence almost inapplicable. Some cyber operations only take milliseconds to launch, transit and produce effects, and thus the\n Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 18.\n Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 40, commentary to Rule 6, para 37; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 28–29.\n Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 41, commentary to Rule 6, para 39. Interestingly, the experts taking part in the first edition of the Tallinn Manual were split on this issue: Schmitt, Tallinn Manual (n 28) 28, commentary to Rule 5, para 11; see also Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 29.\n Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 18.\n Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 43, Rule 7.\n Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 7) 221, para 430.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nterritorial State would not have enough time to identify them and respond accordingly. Already in the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ highlighted the significance of the time dimension. An instantaneous reaction is not expected from the territorial State, which must have enough time to be made aware and react. The speed of certain cyber operations renders reaction even more complicated. This is, however, not true of all cyber operations. Some have a continuous character, at least for some of the time. DDoS attacks, for instance, need to take place over a period of time to be effective. Similarly, complex cyber operations, such as Stuxnet, last for several years, during which time they may continuously communicate with their perpetrator and thus use cyber infrastructures located in various countries, for example remotely controlled servers. In such cases, the duty of diligence is particularly relevant. In the case of an ongoing DDoS attack, for instance, the victim State may make a request to the States in which the zombified computers and controlling servers are located to take action against them. It may not halt the DDoS attack but it may diminish its scale and effects.\n## 8.3.3 Distinction between State of Transit and State of Launch\nDoes the duty of diligence apply to cyber operations that are only transiting through the territory of a State? In other words, does the territorial State have an obligation to take measures to terminate the transit of a cyber operation via the computer networks located on its territory? The experts taking part in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 consider that the obligation of due diligence also applies to the transit State, which must act accordingly ‘when it (1) possesses knowledge [...] of an offending operation that reaches the requisite threshold of harm and (2) can take feasible measures to effectively terminate it’. Karine Bannelier-Christakis rightly highlights that ‘there is no legal reason to consider that transit States do not have a duty of diligence’. The State of transit has, in theory, the obligation under the duty of diligence to take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate the transit of a cyber operation via the computer networks located on its territory.\n Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 28.\n Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22–23.\n Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 33, commentary to Rule 6, para 13.\n Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 27.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO PREVENT SIGNIFICANT TRANSBOUNDARY HARM 369\nThe technical reality is an important limitation to this duty. The Internet has been conceived in a way that the packets should arrive at their destination even if the path they use is no longer available. If the paths used by the packets to reach their target is not available, they will use another one. Although this reality makes the duty to terminate the transit difficult to implement, it is not impossible. Implementation would probably slow down or even temporarily block the perpetration of a cyber operation, or diminish the scale of a DDoS attack, but it would never constitute a panacea.\nThe balancing of reasonableness is important in such cases. For instance, it appears unreasonable to expect the transit State to shut down all Internet traffic transiting via its territory in order to end a cyber operation. What should be expected from the State is not its shut-down, but rather the implementation of filters capable of blocking specific packets that embed malicious code from transiting through their networks when they are aware of it. Again, the speed of most cyber operations may render this operation irrelevant, as the time needed to implement these filters may exceed the length of the actual cyber operation.\nIn short, the duty of diligence extends to the State of transit, but the technical reality of the operations of computer networks and the transit of cyber operations render such duty almost impossible to implement. This reality does not prevent the transit State from taking measures, if possible, nor does it excuse its inaction.\n## 8.4 Toward a Duty to Prevent the Potential Significant Transboundary Harm Caused by Cyber Operations\nA State may be held responsible for a cyber operation that is attributable to it and constitutes an internationally wrongful act. Due diligence is a subsidiary principle to State responsibility according to which a State may be held responsible for the occurrence of a cyber operation, without being responsible for the cyber operation itself. More recently, this principle has also served as a basis for the development of a regime of State liability for the consequences of acts that are not prohibited under\n See also Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 34, commentary to Rule 6, para 14.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\ninternational law. Such a regime of liability has found fertile ground in international space law and international environmental law.\nIn international environmental law, States have an obligation to prevent the use of their territory for activities causing injury or damage in the territory of another State as well as a duty to prevent transboundary harm from hazardous activities. The first obligation was introduced in the Trail Smelter arbitration. In this case, the aerial pollution of a Canadian smelter located near the border with the United States damaged trees and crops located in American territory. The Tribunal noted that:\nunder the principles of international law, as well as of the law of the United States, no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein, when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is established by clear and convincing evidence.\nThe ILC also worked on the question of the consequences of transboundary harms resulting from an act not prohibited under international law, and ultimately adopted the ‘Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities’ in 2001 and the ‘Draft Principles on the Allocation of Loss in the Case of Transboundary Harm Arising out of Hazardous Activities’ in 2006.\nThe duty of diligence stipulated in international environmental law or international space law cannot be transposed directly to the cyber realm given that the situations are different. It shows, however, some interesting paths that could be taken in order to develop a similar duty of diligence regarding cyber activities. WannaCry and NotPetya may constitute at the maximum breaches of the territorial sovereignty of the targeted States.\n Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (adopted on 29 March 1972, entered into force on 1 September 1972) 961 UNTS 187, 24 UST 2389, 10 ILM 965 (1971).\n Trail Smelter case (United States, Canada) (n 8), 1965.\n ‘Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities’ (adopted by the Commission at its fifty-third session, in 2001, and submitted to the General Assembly as a part of the Commission’s report covering the work of that session (A/56/10)).\n ‘Draft Principles on the Allocation of Loss in the Case of Transboundary Harm Arising out of Hazardous Activities’ (adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-eighth session, in 2006, and submitted to the General Assembly as a part of the Commission’s report covering the work of that session (A/61/10)).\n See supra 230–232.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO DISCLOSE ZERO-DAY VULNERABILITIES\n\nIf such duty to prevent transboundary harm caused by cyber operations was to be recognised, it would be conditioned to a threshold of harm. Indeed, a State would be liable only when the transboundary harm was of a certain significance, as is the case in international environmental law.\nThe recognition of such a principle of liability regarding the consequences of cyber operations could also contribute to the creation and strengthening of a global culture of cybersecurity. Indeed, it might prompt States to be more cautious about, and careful when, conducting cyber operations, notably regarding the potential for the involuntary spread of malware and side effects of these operations. The recognition of such a principle of liability for the transboundary harm caused by cyber operations currently remains a highly hypothetical scenario, which can only be confirmed by State practice.\n## 8.5 Toward a Duty to Disclose Zero-Day Vulnerabilities\nThe WannaCry case leads to two distinct questions regarding State responsibility. Firstly, some States have publicly attributed WannaCry to North Korea, and they could thus have invoked the responsibility of North Korea under international law, if they consider WannaCry to be an internationally wrongful act.72\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nThe second question on responsibility departs from the traditional approach of the law on State responsibility: is the United States responsible for not having informed Microsoft of the existence of a vulnerability in their product and for having created the exploit later used by WannaCry?\nThe Russian President Vladimir Putin stated about WannaCry that '[a]s regards the source of these threats, I believe that the leadership of Microsoft have announced this plainly, that the initial source of the virus is the intelligence services of the United States'.73\nIn a similar vein, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, declared in a statement on Microsoft's blog:\nFinally, this attack provides yet another example of why the stockpiling of vulnerabilities by governments is such a problem. This is an emerging pattern in 2017. We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks, and now this vulnerability stolen from the NSA has affected customers around the world. Repeatedly, exploits in the hands of governments have leaked into the public domain and caused widespread damage. An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the U.S. military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen. And this most recent attack represents a completely unintended but disconcerting link between the two most serious forms of cybersecurity threats in the world today – nation-state action and organized criminal action.\nThe governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call. They need to take a different approach and adhere in cyberspace to the same rules applied to weapons in the physical world. We need governments to consider the damage to civilians that comes from hoarding these vulnerabilities and the use of these exploits. This is one reason we called in February for a new 'Digital Geneva Convention' to govern these issues, including a new requirement for governments to report vulnerabilities to vendors, rather than stockpile, sell, or exploit them.74\nTo be addressed, the question of the potential responsibility of the United States regarding WannaCry and NotPetya must be broken down into three sub-questions.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO DISCLOSE ZERO-DAY VULNERABILITIES\n\nThe second sub-question concerns whether the behaviour of the United States constitutes a breach of its obligation of due diligence. In other words, whether the United States knowingly allowed the use of its territory for the perpetration of WannaCry – if we paraphrase the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.75 In the WannaCry situation, however, the territory of the United States was not used for the perpetration of the ransomware campaign. Consequently, the United States has not breached its obligation of due diligence regarding the use of its territory.\nFinally, the third sub-question concerns whether there might be a plurality of actors sharing the responsibility for WannaCry, including the United States, and this is addressed later in the book.76\nThis section demonstrated that neither the non-disclosure of a vulnerability nor the development of a related exploit by a State constitutes an internationally wrongful act.77 Similarly, in a situation in which a third party would use this vulnerability or exploit, this State could not be held responsible under international law. That being said, it is important to note that the approach of States on the disclosure of vulnerabilities is slowly evolving owing to the global pressure for more transparency following, inter alia, the Snowden revelations and more recently the leak of the NSA's hacking tool by the Shadow Brokers. Several States are indeed implementing Vulnerabilities Equities Processes (VEP) aimed at determining whether they should disclose zero-day vulnerabilities or keep them secret for potential future use.78\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\n## 8.6 Concluding Remarks on Cyber Due Diligence\nThe obligation of due diligence is an obligation of conduct, and not of result. States are under a duty to both prevent the use of cyber infrastructure and take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate cyber operations emanating from or transiting through the computer networks located on their territory. This duty does not include an obligation to monitor all Internet traffic within the computer networks on the territory of the State. Similarly, the duty of diligence can only be invoked during an ongoing unlawful action, such as a cyber operation.\nIn the same tenor as *ad impossibilia nemo tenetur*, or ‘nobody is held to the impossible’, the measures adopted by the territorial State must be assessed in light of the test of reasonableness and feasibility. They must not represent an overly onerous burden on the State. Thus, the measures must be commensurate with its capacity, which may differ from State to State. The State is free to choose the measures to be implemented, which can take various forms including being of a technical, political or legal nature. The duty of diligence cannot impose a duty to enact specific legislation as this would then shift from an obligation of conduct to an obligation of result. It may, however, constitute a strong incentive to integrate some specific legislative measures into the domestic legal order for the purposes of compliance.\nIn a limited number of cases, the victim State of the cyber operation would be entitled to invoke the responsibility of the territorial State for not complying with its duty of diligence, and even to compel the territorial State to take appropriate measures.\nPart I was dedicated to the question of attribution. Due diligence may constitute an interesting palliative to the problem of attribution. Most cyber operations that have taken place are almost impossible to attribute to a State or other actor with any certainty. In several cases, the victim State will have a strong suspicion that one or more States are responsible\n(Lawfare, 15 November 2017) www.lawfareblog.com/its-time-international-community-get-serious-about-vulnerability-equities.\n Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 75.\n Ziolkowski (n 23) 169.\n Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 33–35.\n Part III of this book deals specifically with State responsibility and measures of self-help to be taken by the victim State against the responsible State; see *infra* Chapter 9 and Chapter 10.\n In this perspective, see the interesting discussion on the relationship between State sovereignty and due diligence regarding international security in Kulesza (n 1) 276 et seq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

The duty of diligence was referred to by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case: every State has the ‘obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’. It is an old principle that was used in 1872 in the Alabama arbitration concerning the duty of neutrality of the United Kingdom during the American Civil War. It derives directly from the principles of territorial sovereignty and the sovereign equality of States, as recalled by Max Huber in the Island of Palmas arbitration:\nTerritorial sovereignty [...] involves the exclusive right to display the activities of a State. This right has as corollary a duty: the obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States, in particular their\n On the principle of due diligence, see, generally: the seminal work of Joanna Kulesza, *Due Diligence in International Law* (Brill &amp; Martinus Nijhoff Publishers 2016); Riccardo Pisillo Mazzeschi, *‘Due diligence’ e responsabilità internazionale degli stati* (Giuffrè 1989).

A State will incur responsibility not because it did not achieve the expected result but because it manifestly failed to take measures to prevent the act from happening despite being under an obligation to do so. The attribution of the act does not matter; it can be perpetrated by a State or a non-state actor. The only matter of concern is the fact that the concerned State allows its territory to be used for the perpetration of acts contrary to the rights of another State.\nThe principle of due diligence found fertile ground in international environmental law, diplomatic law and the protection of aliens. Due diligence obligations have, however, developed in various other branches of international law. In international jurisprudence, such obligations have included, inter alia, the duty of neutrality during the American Civil War, the obligation to notify ships of the existence of mines in their waters, the obligation to protect the diplomatic and consular premises and staff of a foreign State, the duty to tackle the flow of arms crossing the territory of a State, the duty to take action against rebel groups\n The Island of Palmas (or Miangas) (1928) 11 RIAA 831, 839; see also Affaire des biens britanniques au Maroc espagnol (Espagne contre Royaume-Uni) (1925) 2 RIAA 615, 649.\n On the distinction between obligation of result and obligation of conduct, see: Alain Pellet et al, Droit international public (8th edn, LGDJ 2009) 859–862, para 473.\n Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

As mentioned, the obligation of due diligence developed in various branches of international law, but the notion is also used to describe other forms of legal or political obligations, within and outside the realm of international law. Broadly, due diligence is understood as a standard of conduct required to discharge an obligation. In other words, due diligence is often referred to as representing a certain standard of conduct that should be observed by States or other actors in performing particular acts or regarding specific obligations. The recent discussion in the European Journal of International Law on the ‘human rights due diligence’ in the 2011 United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights perfectly highlights the risk of confusion between the various dimensions of due diligence, and notably the ongoing debate on the due diligence of both private and public actors. The development of ICT technologies also raises the question of the due diligence obligations of both public and private actors. Alongside the obligation for a State not to allow knowingly its ICT infrastructure to be used for malicious acts, there are also the questions, for instance, of the duties of private companies not to let their ICT infrastructure be used for such acts and to avoid releasing software flawed with vulnerabilities. The private sector’s due diligence is outside the scope of this book. Consequently, it seems necessary to clarify that the present chapter focuses exclusively on due diligence understood as ‘every State’s obligation not to\n Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

This would mean that it imposes a duty on States not to allow their territory to be used for the launch or transit of cyber operations targeting another State. In that perspective, due diligence may constitute an interesting palliative to the problem of attribution.\nThe principle of due diligence in international law is particularly relevant regarding the behaviours of non-state actors, since this principle subjects these behaviours to some limitations imposed by international law by creating a bridge between them and State responsibility. International law is primarily the law of States and it cannot generally be enforced directly upon non-state actors. The principle of due diligence renders a State responsible or liable for the occurrence of acts of other actors, including non-state actors, perpetrated in its territory or jurisdiction in some specific circumstances. This is the sense of the sixth norm of the 'Singapore Norm Package' adopted by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) in November 2018:\nNon-state actors should not engage in offensive cyber operations and state actors should prevent and respond to such activities if they occur.\n Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22.\n Karine Bannelier-Christakis, 'Obligations de diligence dans le cyberespace: qui a peur de la cyber-diligence?'

The GCSC demonstrates here how this principle is relevant to regulating such a situation, emphasising in the commentary to the norm that ‘[i]f states permit such action, they may therefore be held responsible under international law. States must act, domestically and internationally, to prevent offensive cyber operations by non-state actors.’\nThe UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security integrated cyber due diligence into its 2013 report as a norm of behaviour, and again in its 2015 report. The report stated that ‘States should seek to ensure that their territories are not used by non-State actors for unlawful use of ICTs’.\nSimilarly, the experts involved in the Tallinn Manual process agreed on the application of the principle of due diligence. In the Tallinn Manual 1.0, Rule 5 dealt with the principle of due diligence, and the commentary makes clear that the experts disagreed on the particular features of this principle. In the Tallinn Manual 2.0, Rule 6 rephrases\n ibid 19 (footnote omitted).\n UNGA, ‘Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ (24 June 2013) UN Doc A/68/98, para 23. In its reply to this report, Germany referred to the principle of due diligence and its application to cyber operations: ‘States should take all necessary measures to ensure that their territories are not used by other States or by non-State actors for purposes of unlawful use of information and communications technology against other States and their interests’; quoted in UNGA, ‘Report of the Secretary-General on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (Addendum)’ (9 September 2013) UN Doc A/68/156/Add.1 9.\n Michael N Schmitt (ed), Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (CUP 2013) 26, Rule 5 (‘A State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States.’). In addition, the Tallinn Manual states that a neutral State to an international armed conflict should not allow its cyber infrastructure to be used by the belligerent parties: ibid 252, Rule 93.

Michael\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nand modifies the fifth Rule of the first edition, and reads: '[a] State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States';[31] in addition, Rule 7 deals with compliance with the due diligence principle and recalls that States are required to take all feasible measures that are foreseeable.[32]\nThe application of the principle of due diligence to the cyber realm remains, however, a controversial issue. Some States are reluctant to extend this principle to cyberspace because of the corresponding obligations it would impose on them.[33] Moreover, another difficulty arises concerning the distinction between States from which the cyber operation is launched and States of transit, that is to say States through which the cyber operation is routed. The present chapter asserts that the principle of due diligence is applicable to cyber operations, and analyses how it applies and what the corresponding obligations that it imposes on States are. The duty of cyber due diligence may be seen as a coin with two faces; on the one side, there is the duty to prevent the use of the ICT infrastructure (8.1), and on the other, there is the obligation to take measures to terminate a cyber operation that has been detected (8.3). This chapter also analyses whether the invocation of the principle of due diligence is subject to a threshold of harm (8.2). Moreover, this chapter investigates two possible variations of due diligence regarding cyber operations, that may be developed in the future: the creation of a duty to (i) prevent the potential transboundary harm caused by cyber operations (8.4) and (ii) disclose zero-day vulnerabilities (8.5).\n## 8.1 Does a Duty to Prevent Any Use of State Cyber Infrastructures Exist?\nDoes a State have a general duty to prevent any use of its cyber infrastructure for the perpetration by another State, or by non-state actors, of a cyber operation against another State? Such obligation may be\nN Schmitt published an article highlighting some points dealt with in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that would deserve further work, including due diligence: Michael N Schmitt, 'Grey Zones in the International Law of Cyberspace' (2017) 42 The Yale Journal of International Law Online 1, 11-13.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO PREVENT\n\n## 8.1.1 A State Has No Obligation to Have Absolute Knowledge of All Events and Activities on Its Territory or in Cyber Infrastructures under Its Control\nUnder international law, a State is not obliged to have absolute knowledge of all events and activities happening on its territory. As recalled by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case:\nit cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known, of any unlawful act perpetrated therein, nor yet that it necessarily knew, or should have known, the authors.\nThe fact that the cyber operation emanates from or transits through the computer networks located on the territory of a State does not render this State responsible, nor does it transfer the burden of proof onto, this State.\nA State is under the obligation to take all feasible measures to prevent the use of its territory for activities that breach the rights of other States. As already mentioned, it is an obligation of conduct – to take measures – and not of result.\nI agree with the experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that the obligation of due diligence of a State applies regarding cyber activities taking place on its territory and extends extraterritorially to those taking place on\n Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 18.\n ibid.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\ncontrolled territory abroad, as well as in cyber infrastructure located abroad under its control.\nIn the cyber realm, does this obligation impose a duty on the State to monitor the Internet traffic emanating from and transiting via its cyber infrastructure? The next section demonstrates why the question should be answered negatively.\n## 8.1.2 The Slippery Slope of Justifying Mass Surveillance\nA general duty to know what is happening in the computer networks of a State may be understood as implying mass and indiscriminate surveillance of these networks by the State. Thus, such a duty would serve as a justification for mass surveillance. Not only does it risk a slippery slope in terms of civil liberties and human rights, but it would also be of limited relevance for the duty of diligence, as detailed below.\nThe mass surveillance programme of the NSA was, at its best, able to monitor 75 per cent of US Internet traffic. Thus, it was not able to monitor all the traffic emanating or transiting through the State. Even if it was possible to monitor all the Internet traffic, the treatment of the monitored data would necessitate too much work to be relevant or even attainable. Indeed, in the case of the mass-surveillance programme, the objective is generally to filter specific communications or the use of specific words, i.e. there is something to look for. In the case of cyber operations, they can take a wide variety of forms and it would be almost impossible to identify specific filters that would allow them to be detected. Monitoring the metadata would not suffice. It would be necessary to undertake a deep inspection of each packet of data to determine its real content and the purpose of this content. Moreover, it is not very difficult to embed a malicious code into another code of legitimate software; therefore, it would be necessary to be able to distinguish which part of the code belongs to the malware. The perpetrators would also sooner or later understand how the filters operate and would be able to adapt the structure of their malicious code to address the new situation, therefore always managing to find cracks in the system and to exploit\n Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 32–33, commentary to Rule 6, paras 8–10.\n Jennifer Valentino-Devries and Siobhan Gorman, ‘New Details Show Broader NSA Surveillance Reach: Programs Cover 75% of Nation’s Traffic, Can Snare Emails’, Wall Street Journal (20 August 2013) www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324108204579022874091732470.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO PREVENT\n\nOne may argue that the surveillance activities of a State are limited by international law, human rights law and domestic law, which would limit the possible negative consequences. Yet, taking this approach would be a very slippery slope with almost no value in preventing cyber threats from using the computer networks of a State.\nAs often noted already, the duty of diligence is only an obligation of conduct and not of result. Nonetheless, a requirement to monitor Internet traffic would then transform into a justification for mass-surveillance programmes without actually making much contribution to fulfilling this duty. The duty of diligence must not constitute an excessive burden on\n Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual* (n 28) 27, commentary to Rule 5, para 4; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 28.\n Schmitt, *'Due Diligence in Cyberspace'* (n 22) 72–73.\n *ibid* 75.\n Bannelier-Christakis (n 22) 644; Bannelier and Christakis (n 4) 20; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 30.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nthe State, and the implementation of such monitoring would represent a twofold excessive burden – on the State's capacities and human rights law. Thus, such an obligation would be considered unreasonable.\nThe situation may differ if such monitoring capacities already exist. In such cases, does the State with monitoring capacities have an obligation to use them in order to comply with its due diligence obligations? The short answer is yes. The State has an obligation to use any means at its disposal to comply with its due diligence duty. Thus, the duty of diligence does not oblige the State to implement a monitoring programme for Internet traffic, but when such capacities already exist, then the State has to use them. The content of the duty of diligence depends on the capacity of each State. The ILA's first report on due diligence highlighted this point in regard to due diligence in human rights law and international environmental law. It stressed that it was necessary to differentiate between the treatment of developed States and that of developing ones, as they may not have the same capacity to control and to comply with their due diligence duty. Similarly, in cyberspace not all States are equal and some may be better equipped to comply with their obligations than others, in particular those where a mass-surveillance programme already exists and therefore may be used to monitor cyber activities. The burden of the duty of diligence must be reasonable, however. It cannot exceed the State's capacity.\nIn sum, the duty of diligence does not impose a duty on States to monitor the Internet traffic of cyber infrastructures located on their territory, nor to develop the necessary technologies to perform such monitoring. In the case of a State having already developed the capabilities to conduct such monitoring programmes, to comply with the obligation of diligence this State would have to use these capabilities. It must be highlighted that such situation does not legitimate nor preclude the potential wrongfulness of such capabilities under domestic or international laws.\n## 8.1.3 The Difference between Cyber Operations Launched from or Solely Transiting through the Territory of the State\nIt is impossible to completely separate cyber operations from the physical world. A cyber operation that is simply transiting through the territory of\n ILA Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law – First Report (n 1) respectively 18 and 27.\n Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 74–75.\n For a similar view, see Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 43–46, commentary to Rule 7, paras 3–13.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE ABSENCE OF A THRESHOLD OF HARM\na State only requires electronic impulses via cables and devices, and this transit lasts less than a second in most cases. Conversely, the launch of a cyber operation from the territory of a State would take more than just a few electronic impulses. It would also integrate a physical dimension in most cases. Two situations should be distinguished from one another: firstly, the launch of a cyber operation via a cyber infrastructure that is remotely under the control of the perpetrator; secondly, the launch of a cyber operation from the territory of a State.\nA cyber operation can be launched via a cyber infrastructure located on the territory of one State, but be infected and controlled by the perpetrators located in another. This is, for instance, the case with bots, also known as 'zombified' computers, which are used to perpetrate DDoS attacks. The perpetrators of a DDoS attack targeting State A may be located in State B, using a botnet of 'zombified' computers located in States X, Y and Z. In this situation, what obligation arises in terms of due diligence of States X, Y and Z? Here again, they have no obligation to monitor their Internet traffic nor to know of all events and activities happening in the cyber infrastructure on their territory. The situation may be different if, as we will see in the next section, they know or should know about the malicious use of the controlled infrastructures on their territory.\nIn the case of a cyber operation launched directly from the territory of a State, for example by an organised group located on its territory, the duty of diligence applies. The territorial State has, in such cases, means other than solely cyber ones to make itself aware of such use. In the case of highly sophisticated cyber operations, the preparatory phases often involve physical input that may be detectable by the State. For instance, it may be visible that something is under preparation or already happening owing to an increase in activity of a specific group already under scrutiny by the State.\nI will come back to the distinction between State of transit and State of launch, and the consequences of this distinction for the application of the principle of due diligence to cyber operations, in the third section (8.3).\n## 8.2 The Absence of a Threshold of Harm\nThe experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 condition the applicability of the principle of due diligence to two cumulative requirements: firstly, the cyber operation concerned must be 'contrary to the rights' of the affected\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nState under international law; and, secondly, it must have ‘serious adverse consequences’. Moreover, they also ‘concurred that the due diligence principle extends to cyber operations conducted by non-State actors that, while not violating international law per se, nevertheless result in serious adverse consequences and [...] affect the right of the target State’. In addition, they note that the threshold of harm does not depend on the occurrence of ‘physical damage to objects or injuries to individuals’.\nThe first requirement derives directly from the dictum of the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case, and does not raise any specific issue. The second requirement, the threshold of harm, may be more controversial. The commentary to Rule 6 states that:\nThe precise threshold of harm at which the due diligence principle applies is unsettled in international law. All of the Experts agreed that the due diligence requirement arises when the situation involves a cyber operation that results in ‘serious adverse consequences’, although they could identify no bright line threshold for the identification of such consequences. They adopted this standard by analogy from application of the due diligence principle in the context of international environmental law. Some of them supported a lower threshold of application for the Rule, for instance, by proposing the term ‘significant’ or ‘substantial’ in lieu of ‘serious’.\nIndeed, in the Trail Smelter arbitral award, the court held that under the principles of international law, as well as of the law of the United States:\nno State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein, when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is established by clear and convincing evidence.\nThus, this arbitral award recognised the existence of a threshold of harm regarding the application of the principle of due diligence in preventing transboundary environmental harm. On this basis, the experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 assert that a similar standard exists regarding cyber operations.\n ibid 34, commentary to Rule 6, para 15.\n ibid 35, commentary to Rule 6, para 21.\n ibid 37–38, commentary to Rule 6, para 28.\n Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22.\n Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 36–37, commentary to Rule 6, para 25 (footnotes omitted).\n Trail Smelter case (United States, Canada) (n 8) 1965.\n See generally Kulesza (n 1) 91–105.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE ABSENCE OF A THRESHOLD OF HARM\nFurther on the experts clarified their idea, as they agreed that ‘merely affecting the interests of the target State, as in the case of causing inconvenience, minor disruption, or negligible expense, is not the type of harm envisaged; thus, not every use of a State’s territory that produces negative effects for a target State implicates the due diligence principle’.\nI am not convinced that such requirement of a threshold of harm is part of the customary principle of due diligence, and thus of the *lex lata* applicable to cyber operations. In my view, the assessment of the intensity of the cyber operations concerned does not condition whether the State has the possibility of invoking the obligation of due diligence of the territorial State from the perspective of international law. Conversely, it may condition whether the State will actually invoke the obligation of due diligence of the territorial State. It is thus not a legal requirement, but a requirement regarding the opportunity for the State to invoke this principle, or not. More precisely, the occurrence of a damage or harm is not a necessary element of the principle of due diligence. According to the principle, States must exercise due diligence in ensuring that territory and objects over which they enjoy sovereignty are not to be used to harm other States. This principle does not require that an actual harm or damage occurs; on the contrary, it relies on the potential damage or harm that may be suffered by the other States. Even if this damage or harm never materialises, the State still has to comply with its duty of diligence. Consequently, the second requirement of ‘serious adverse consequences’ does not seem to flow from general international law nor does it seem justified.\nIn that perspective, my analysis of the threshold of harm for the principle of due diligence asserted by the *Tallinn Manual 2.0* is similar to the one I have already made regarding the same proposed threshold for the qualification of the violation of territorial sovereignty.\nTo conclude, it seems that the general customary principle of due diligence does not involve a threshold of harm. However, such threshold has already been identified in specific dimensions of the principle of due diligence, as for instance regarding transboundary environmental harm,\n Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 37, commentary to Rule 6, para 26.\n More generally, the occurrence of a damage is not a necessary element of an internationally wrongful act; see: ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (2001) 2 Yearbook of the International Law Commission (Part II) 31, 92, commentary to Article 21, para 6; James Crawford, *State Responsibility: The General Part* (CUP 2013) 54et seq.\n See supra 5.3.2.2B The Absence of a Damage Requirement.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nand may translate into other dimensions in the future, including cyber operations. Indeed, it is important to distinguish the recourse to the principle of due diligence to establish, on the one hand, the responsibility of a State for not having complied with its due diligence obligations, from, on the other, the liability of a State for a significant transboundary harm. In the first case, which was developed in the present section, there is not a threshold of harm, while in the second case, which is developed later, in Section 8.4, such a threshold exists.\n## 8.3 The Duty of a State to Take Measures to Terminate an Unlawful Cyber Operation Using Its Infrastructure\nAnother principal component of the principle of due diligence is the obligation for a State that is aware of an unlawful cyber operation – which is using its cyber infrastructure – to take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate the operation.^[55]^ The resulting obligation has three dimensions: firstly, knowledge of the cyber operation by the territorial State (8.2.1); secondly, balancing the feasibility and reasonableness of the measures that should be taken (8.2.2); and finally, the distinction between cyber operations merely transiting via the State and those emanating from the territory of the State (8.2.3).\n## 8.3.1 Knowledge of the Territorial State\nAs a prerequisite, the territorial State has to be aware that a cyber operation is using its cyber infrastructure. Two situations should be distinguished from one another. Firstly, the victim State of a cyber operation has to notify the territorial State and ask it to take measures to terminate it. In such cases, there is no doubt that the territorial State is aware of the cyber operation and thus is obliged to take all feasible and reasonable measures against it. Secondly, the territorial State may also know about it even in the absence of notification by the victim State. In such circumstances, the burden of proof that the territorial State knows or should have known about the cyber operation is on the victim State. There is no transfer of the burden of proof as the territorial State has no\n^[55] Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 43, Rule 7; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 37; Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 72–75. See, more generally, Tehran Hostages (Judgment) (n 14) 32–33, para 68.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE DUTY TO TAKE MEASURES TO TERMINATE THE ACT 367\nobligation to have absolute knowledge of everything taking place on its territory. When a State has actual knowledge, then it is without a shadow of a doubt bound by the duty of diligence.\nIs constructive knowledge sufficient? In other words, is the fact that a State should have known about the cyber operation enough? The experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 ‘agreed that knowledge encompasses constructive knowledge for the purpose of [Rule 6]’. On the one hand, the territorial State ‘cannot evade such a request by limiting itself to a reply that it is ignorant of the circumstances of the act and of its authors. The State may, up to a certain point, be bound to supply particulars of the use made by it of the means of information and inquiry at its disposal.’ On the other, the standard of proof would be very high for the State invoking its responsibility to prove that the territorial State should have known. Ultimately, the State invoking non-compliance with the duty of diligence would have to prove that the territorial State actually knew, rather than should have known.\n## 8.3.2 Measures to Terminate the Cyber Operation\nA State that knows its territory is being used for the perpetration of an unlawful cyber operation must take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate it. As an obligation of conduct and not of result, the State is expected to undertake its ‘best efforts’ to terminate the cyber operation, but would not bear responsibility only because it failed to terminate it. Conversely, if the State did not use all means at its disposal, and did not take all feasible and reasonable measures, it would not have fulfilled its obligation under the duty of diligence.\nIn a number of cases, the speed of cyber operations may render the principle of due diligence almost inapplicable. Some cyber operations only take milliseconds to launch, transit and produce effects, and thus the\n Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 18.\n Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 40, commentary to Rule 6, para 37; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 28–29.\n Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 41, commentary to Rule 6, para 39. Interestingly, the experts taking part in the first edition of the Tallinn Manual were split on this issue: Schmitt, Tallinn Manual (n 28) 28, commentary to Rule 5, para 11; see also Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 29.\n Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 18.\n Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 43, Rule 7.\n Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 7) 221, para 430.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nterritorial State would not have enough time to identify them and respond accordingly. Already in the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ highlighted the significance of the time dimension. An instantaneous reaction is not expected from the territorial State, which must have enough time to be made aware and react. The speed of certain cyber operations renders reaction even more complicated. This is, however, not true of all cyber operations. Some have a continuous character, at least for some of the time. DDoS attacks, for instance, need to take place over a period of time to be effective. Similarly, complex cyber operations, such as Stuxnet, last for several years, during which time they may continuously communicate with their perpetrator and thus use cyber infrastructures located in various countries, for example remotely controlled servers. In such cases, the duty of diligence is particularly relevant. In the case of an ongoing DDoS attack, for instance, the victim State may make a request to the States in which the zombified computers and controlling servers are located to take action against them. It may not halt the DDoS attack but it may diminish its scale and effects.\n## 8.3.3 Distinction between State of Transit and State of Launch\nDoes the duty of diligence apply to cyber operations that are only transiting through the territory of a State? In other words, does the territorial State have an obligation to take measures to terminate the transit of a cyber operation via the computer networks located on its territory? The experts taking part in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 consider that the obligation of due diligence also applies to the transit State, which must act accordingly ‘when it (1) possesses knowledge [...] of an offending operation that reaches the requisite threshold of harm and (2) can take feasible measures to effectively terminate it’. Karine Bannelier-Christakis rightly highlights that ‘there is no legal reason to consider that transit States do not have a duty of diligence’. The State of transit has, in theory, the obligation under the duty of diligence to take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate the transit of a cyber operation via the computer networks located on its territory.\n Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 28.\n Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22–23.\n Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 33, commentary to Rule 6, para 13.\n Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 27.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO PREVENT SIGNIFICANT TRANSBOUNDARY HARM 369\nThe technical reality is an important limitation to this duty. The Internet has been conceived in a way that the packets should arrive at their destination even if the path they use is no longer available. If the paths used by the packets to reach their target is not available, they will use another one. Although this reality makes the duty to terminate the transit difficult to implement, it is not impossible. Implementation would probably slow down or even temporarily block the perpetration of a cyber operation, or diminish the scale of a DDoS attack, but it would never constitute a panacea.\nThe balancing of reasonableness is important in such cases. For instance, it appears unreasonable to expect the transit State to shut down all Internet traffic transiting via its territory in order to end a cyber operation. What should be expected from the State is not its shut-down, but rather the implementation of filters capable of blocking specific packets that embed malicious code from transiting through their networks when they are aware of it. Again, the speed of most cyber operations may render this operation irrelevant, as the time needed to implement these filters may exceed the length of the actual cyber operation.\nIn short, the duty of diligence extends to the State of transit, but the technical reality of the operations of computer networks and the transit of cyber operations render such duty almost impossible to implement. This reality does not prevent the transit State from taking measures, if possible, nor does it excuse its inaction.\n## 8.4 Toward a Duty to Prevent the Potential Significant Transboundary Harm Caused by Cyber Operations\nA State may be held responsible for a cyber operation that is attributable to it and constitutes an internationally wrongful act. Due diligence is a subsidiary principle to State responsibility according to which a State may be held responsible for the occurrence of a cyber operation, without being responsible for the cyber operation itself. More recently, this principle has also served as a basis for the development of a regime of State liability for the consequences of acts that are not prohibited under\n See also Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 34, commentary to Rule 6, para 14.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\ninternational law. Such a regime of liability has found fertile ground in international space law and international environmental law.\nIn international environmental law, States have an obligation to prevent the use of their territory for activities causing injury or damage in the territory of another State as well as a duty to prevent transboundary harm from hazardous activities. The first obligation was introduced in the Trail Smelter arbitration. In this case, the aerial pollution of a Canadian smelter located near the border with the United States damaged trees and crops located in American territory. The Tribunal noted that:\nunder the principles of international law, as well as of the law of the United States, no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein, when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is established by clear and convincing evidence.\nThe ILC also worked on the question of the consequences of transboundary harms resulting from an act not prohibited under international law, and ultimately adopted the ‘Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities’ in 2001 and the ‘Draft Principles on the Allocation of Loss in the Case of Transboundary Harm Arising out of Hazardous Activities’ in 2006.\nThe duty of diligence stipulated in international environmental law or international space law cannot be transposed directly to the cyber realm given that the situations are different. It shows, however, some interesting paths that could be taken in order to develop a similar duty of diligence regarding cyber activities. WannaCry and NotPetya may constitute at the maximum breaches of the territorial sovereignty of the targeted States.\n Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (adopted on 29 March 1972, entered into force on 1 September 1972) 961 UNTS 187, 24 UST 2389, 10 ILM 965 (1971).\n Trail Smelter case (United States, Canada) (n 8), 1965.\n ‘Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities’ (adopted by the Commission at its fifty-third session, in 2001, and submitted to the General Assembly as a part of the Commission’s report covering the work of that session (A/56/10)).\n ‘Draft Principles on the Allocation of Loss in the Case of Transboundary Harm Arising out of Hazardous Activities’ (adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-eighth session, in 2006, and submitted to the General Assembly as a part of the Commission’s report covering the work of that session (A/61/10)).\n See supra 230–232.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO DISCLOSE ZERO-DAY VULNERABILITIES\n\nIf such duty to prevent transboundary harm caused by cyber operations was to be recognised, it would be conditioned to a threshold of harm. Indeed, a State would be liable only when the transboundary harm was of a certain significance, as is the case in international environmental law.\nThe recognition of such a principle of liability regarding the consequences of cyber operations could also contribute to the creation and strengthening of a global culture of cybersecurity. Indeed, it might prompt States to be more cautious about, and careful when, conducting cyber operations, notably regarding the potential for the involuntary spread of malware and side effects of these operations. The recognition of such a principle of liability for the transboundary harm caused by cyber operations currently remains a highly hypothetical scenario, which can only be confirmed by State practice.\n## 8.5 Toward a Duty to Disclose Zero-Day Vulnerabilities\nThe WannaCry case leads to two distinct questions regarding State responsibility. Firstly, some States have publicly attributed WannaCry to North Korea, and they could thus have invoked the responsibility of North Korea under international law, if they consider WannaCry to be an internationally wrongful act.72\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nThe second question on responsibility departs from the traditional approach of the law on State responsibility: is the United States responsible for not having informed Microsoft of the existence of a vulnerability in their product and for having created the exploit later used by WannaCry?\nThe Russian President Vladimir Putin stated about WannaCry that '[a]s regards the source of these threats, I believe that the leadership of Microsoft have announced this plainly, that the initial source of the virus is the intelligence services of the United States'.73\nIn a similar vein, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, declared in a statement on Microsoft's blog:\nFinally, this attack provides yet another example of why the stockpiling of vulnerabilities by governments is such a problem. This is an emerging pattern in 2017. We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks, and now this vulnerability stolen from the NSA has affected customers around the world. Repeatedly, exploits in the hands of governments have leaked into the public domain and caused widespread damage. An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the U.S. military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen. And this most recent attack represents a completely unintended but disconcerting link between the two most serious forms of cybersecurity threats in the world today – nation-state action and organized criminal action.\nThe governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call. They need to take a different approach and adhere in cyberspace to the same rules applied to weapons in the physical world. We need governments to consider the damage to civilians that comes from hoarding these vulnerabilities and the use of these exploits. This is one reason we called in February for a new 'Digital Geneva Convention' to govern these issues, including a new requirement for governments to report vulnerabilities to vendors, rather than stockpile, sell, or exploit them.74\nTo be addressed, the question of the potential responsibility of the United States regarding WannaCry and NotPetya must be broken down into three sub-questions.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO DISCLOSE ZERO-DAY VULNERABILITIES\n\nThe second sub-question concerns whether the behaviour of the United States constitutes a breach of its obligation of due diligence. In other words, whether the United States knowingly allowed the use of its territory for the perpetration of WannaCry – if we paraphrase the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.75 In the WannaCry situation, however, the territory of the United States was not used for the perpetration of the ransomware campaign. Consequently, the United States has not breached its obligation of due diligence regarding the use of its territory.\nFinally, the third sub-question concerns whether there might be a plurality of actors sharing the responsibility for WannaCry, including the United States, and this is addressed later in the book.76\nThis section demonstrated that neither the non-disclosure of a vulnerability nor the development of a related exploit by a State constitutes an internationally wrongful act.77 Similarly, in a situation in which a third party would use this vulnerability or exploit, this State could not be held responsible under international law. That being said, it is important to note that the approach of States on the disclosure of vulnerabilities is slowly evolving owing to the global pressure for more transparency following, inter alia, the Snowden revelations and more recently the leak of the NSA's hacking tool by the Shadow Brokers. Several States are indeed implementing Vulnerabilities Equities Processes (VEP) aimed at determining whether they should disclose zero-day vulnerabilities or keep them secret for potential future use.78\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\n## 8.6 Concluding Remarks on Cyber Due Diligence\nThe obligation of due diligence is an obligation of conduct, and not of result. States are under a duty to both prevent the use of cyber infrastructure and take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate cyber operations emanating from or transiting through the computer networks located on their territory. This duty does not include an obligation to monitor all Internet traffic within the computer networks on the territory of the State. Similarly, the duty of diligence can only be invoked during an ongoing unlawful action, such as a cyber operation.\nIn the same tenor as *ad impossibilia nemo tenetur*, or ‘nobody is held to the impossible’, the measures adopted by the territorial State must be assessed in light of the test of reasonableness and feasibility. They must not represent an overly onerous burden on the State. Thus, the measures must be commensurate with its capacity, which may differ from State to State. The State is free to choose the measures to be implemented, which can take various forms including being of a technical, political or legal nature. The duty of diligence cannot impose a duty to enact specific legislation as this would then shift from an obligation of conduct to an obligation of result. It may, however, constitute a strong incentive to integrate some specific legislative measures into the domestic legal order for the purposes of compliance.\nIn a limited number of cases, the victim State of the cyber operation would be entitled to invoke the responsibility of the territorial State for not complying with its duty of diligence, and even to compel the territorial State to take appropriate measures.\nPart I was dedicated to the question of attribution. Due diligence may constitute an interesting palliative to the problem of attribution. Most cyber operations that have taken place are almost impossible to attribute to a State or other actor with any certainty. In several cases, the victim State will have a strong suspicion that one or more States are responsible\n(Lawfare, 15 November 2017) www.lawfareblog.com/its-time-international-community-get-serious-about-vulnerability-equities.\n Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 75.\n Ziolkowski (n 23) 169.\n Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 33–35.\n Part III of this book deals specifically with State responsibility and measures of self-help to be taken by the victim State against the responsible State; see *infra* Chapter 9 and Chapter 10.\n In this perspective, see the interesting discussion on the relationship between State sovereignty and due diligence regarding international security in Kulesza (n 1) 276 et seq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press"

This right has as corollary a duty: the obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States, in particular their\n¹ On the principle of due diligence, see, generally: the seminal work of Joanna Kulesza, *Due Diligence in International Law* (Brill &amp; Martinus Nijhoff Publishers 2016); Riccardo Pisillo Mazzeschi, *‘Due diligence’ e responsabilità internazionale degli stati* (Giuffrè 1989).

As mentioned, the obligation of due diligence developed in various branches of international law, but the notion is also used to describe other forms of legal or political obligations, within and outside the realm of international law. Broadly, due diligence is understood as a standard of conduct required to discharge an obligation. In other words, due diligence is often referred to as representing a certain standard of conduct that should be observed by States or other actors in performing particular acts or regarding specific obligations. The recent discussion in the European Journal of International Law on the ‘human rights due diligence’ in the 2011 United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights perfectly highlights the risk of confusion between the various dimensions of due diligence, and notably the ongoing debate on the due diligence of both private and public actors.¹⁹ The development of ICT technologies also raises the question of the due diligence obligations of both public and private actors. Alongside the obligation for a State not to allow knowingly its ICT infrastructure to be used for malicious acts, there are also the questions, for instance, of the duties of private companies not to let their ICT infrastructure be used for such acts and to avoid releasing software flawed with vulnerabilities.²⁰ The private sector’s due diligence is outside the scope of this book. Consequently, it seems necessary to clarify that the present chapter focuses exclusively on due diligence understood as ‘every State’s obligation not to\n¹⁶ Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

International law is primarily the law of States and it cannot generally be enforced directly upon non-state actors. The principle of due diligence renders a State responsible or liable for the occurrence of acts of other actors, including non-state actors, perpetrated in its territory or jurisdiction in some specific circumstances. This is the sense of the sixth norm of the 'Singapore Norm Package' adopted by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) in November 2018:\nNon-state actors should not engage in offensive cyber operations and state actors should prevent and respond to such activities if they occur.²⁵\n²¹ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22.\n²² Karine Bannelier-Christakis, 'Obligations de diligence dans le cyberespace: qui a peur de la cyber-diligence?'

The GCSC demonstrates here how this principle is relevant to regulating such a situation, emphasising in the commentary to the norm that ‘[i]f states permit such action, they may therefore be held responsible under international law. States must act, domestically and internationally, to prevent offensive cyber operations by non-state actors.’²⁶\nThe UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security integrated cyber due diligence into its 2013 report as a norm of behaviour, and again in its 2015 report. The report stated that ‘States should seek to ensure that their territories are not used by non-State actors for unlawful use of ICTs’.²⁷\nSimilarly, the experts involved in the Tallinn Manual process agreed on the application of the principle of due diligence. In the Tallinn Manual 1.0, Rule 5²⁸ dealt with the principle of due diligence, and the commentary makes clear that the experts disagreed on the particular features of this principle.²⁹ In the Tallinn Manual 2.0,³⁰ Rule 6 rephrases\n²⁶ ibid 19 (footnote omitted).\n²⁷ UNGA, ‘Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ (24 June 2013) UN Doc A/68/98, para 23. In its reply to this report, Germany referred to the principle of due diligence and its application to cyber operations: ‘States should take all necessary measures to ensure that their territories are not used by other States or by non-State actors for purposes of unlawful use of information and communications technology against other States and their interests’; quoted in UNGA, ‘Report of the Secretary-General on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (Addendum)’ (9 September 2013) UN Doc A/68/156/Add.1 9.\n²⁸ Michael N Schmitt (ed), Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (CUP 2013) 26, Rule 5 (‘A State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States.’). In addition, the Tallinn Manual states that a neutral State to an international armed conflict should not allow its cyber infrastructure to be used by the belligerent parties: ibid 252, Rule 93. On due diligence and international humanitarian law in general, see ILA Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law – First Report (n 1) 11–14.\n²⁹ See the commentary to Rule 5 in Schmitt, Tallinn Manual (n 28) 26–29; see also Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 70–71.\n³⁰ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 30–50, Rules 6–7. Ian Yuying Liu wrote an article analysing the Tallinn Manual 2.0’s rules on due diligence as well as the reluctance of some States regarding the application of the principle of due diligence to cyber conducts: Ian Yuying Liu, ‘The Due Diligence Doctrine under Tallinn Manual 2.0’ (2017) 33 Computer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 390. Michael\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nand modifies the fifth Rule of the first edition, and reads: '[a] State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States'; in addition, Rule 7 deals with compliance with the due diligence principle and recalls that States are required to take all feasible measures that are foreseeable.\nThe application of the principle of due diligence to the cyber realm remains, however, a controversial issue. Some States are reluctant to extend this principle to cyberspace because of the corresponding obligations it would impose on them. Moreover, another difficulty arises concerning the distinction between States from which the cyber operation is launched and States of transit, that is to say States through which the cyber operation is routed. The present chapter asserts that the principle of due diligence is applicable to cyber operations, and analyses how it applies and what the corresponding obligations that it imposes on States are. The duty of cyber due diligence may be seen as a coin with two faces; on the one side, there is the duty to prevent the use of the ICT infrastructure (8.1), and on the other, there is the obligation to take measures to terminate a cyber operation that has been detected (8.3). This chapter also analyses whether the invocation of the principle of due diligence is subject to a threshold of harm (8.2). Moreover, this chapter investigates two possible variations of due diligence regarding cyber operations, that may be developed in the future: the creation of a duty to (i) prevent the potential transboundary harm caused by cyber operations (8.4) and (ii) disclose zero-day vulnerabilities (8.5).\n## 8.1 Does a Duty to Prevent Any Use of State Cyber Infrastructures Exist?\nDoes a State have a general duty to prevent any use of its cyber infrastructure for the perpetration by another State, or by non-state actors, of a cyber operation against another State? Such obligation may be\nN Schmitt published an article highlighting some points dealt with in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that would deserve further work, including due diligence: Michael N Schmitt, 'Grey Zones in the International Law of Cyberspace' (2017) 42 The Yale Journal of International Law Online 1, 11-13.\n31 Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 30.\n32 ibid 43.\n33 Schmitt, 'Due Diligence in Cyberspace' (n 22) 71, 73; Liu (n 30).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO PREVENT\n359\nconsidered as implying a duty on the State to monitor all Internet traffic emanating from and transiting via its territory or via cyber infrastructures under its control. There is no general duty to monitor and control the Internet traffic emanating from and transiting via the territory of a State or via cyber infrastructures under its control. In any case, this is unlikely to happen for two reasons: firstly, it could constitute a justification for mass-surveillance programmes and is also irrelevant for the objective pursued (8.1.2); secondly, there is no obligation for a State to know everything about what is happening on its territory (8.1.1). Finally, it is necessary to distinguish between situations where cyber operations only use the cyber infrastructures of a State and situations where there is also a physical dimension on the territory of the State (8.1.3).\n## 8.1.1 A State Has No Obligation to Have Absolute Knowledge of All Events and Activities on Its Territory or in Cyber Infrastructures under Its Control\nUnder international law, a State is not obliged to have absolute knowledge of all events and activities happening on its territory. As recalled by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case:\nit cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known, of any unlawful act perpetrated therein, nor yet that it necessarily knew, or should have known, the authors.³⁴\nThe fact that the cyber operation emanates from or transits through the computer networks located on the territory of a State does not render this State responsible, nor does it transfer the burden of proof onto, this State.³⁵\nA State is under the obligation to take all feasible measures to prevent the use of its territory for activities that breach the rights of other States. As already mentioned, it is an obligation of conduct – to take measures – and not of result.\nI agree with the experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that the obligation of due diligence of a State applies regarding cyber activities taking place on its territory and extends extraterritorially to those taking place on\n³⁴ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 18.\n³⁵ ibid.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\ncontrolled territory abroad, as well as in cyber infrastructure located abroad under its control.³⁶\nIn the cyber realm, does this obligation impose a duty on the State to monitor the Internet traffic emanating from and transiting via its cyber infrastructure? The next section demonstrates why the question should be answered negatively.\n## 8.1.2 The Slippery Slope of Justifying Mass Surveillance\nA general duty to know what is happening in the computer networks of a State may be understood as implying mass and indiscriminate surveillance of these networks by the State. Thus, such a duty would serve as a justification for mass surveillance. Not only does it risk a slippery slope in terms of civil liberties and human rights, but it would also be of limited relevance for the duty of diligence, as detailed below.\nThe mass surveillance programme of the NSA was, at its best, able to monitor 75 per cent of US Internet traffic.³⁷ Thus, it was not able to monitor all the traffic emanating or transiting through the State. Even if it was possible to monitor all the Internet traffic, the treatment of the monitored data would necessitate too much work to be relevant or even attainable. Indeed, in the case of the mass-surveillance programme, the objective is generally to filter specific communications or the use of specific words, i.e. there is something to look for. In the case of cyber operations, they can take a wide variety of forms and it would be almost impossible to identify specific filters that would allow them to be detected. Monitoring the metadata would not suffice. It would be necessary to undertake a deep inspection of each packet of data to determine its real content and the purpose of this content. Moreover, it is not very difficult to embed a malicious code into another code of legitimate software; therefore, it would be necessary to be able to distinguish which part of the code belongs to the malware. The perpetrators would also sooner or later understand how the filters operate and would be able to adapt the structure of their malicious code to address the new situation, therefore always managing to find cracks in the system and to exploit\n³⁶ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 32–33, commentary to Rule 6, paras 8–10.\n³⁷ Jennifer Valentino-Devries and Siobhan Gorman, ‘New Details Show Broader NSA Surveillance Reach: Programs Cover 75% of Nation’s Traffic, Can Snare Emails’, Wall Street Journal (20 August 2013) www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324108204579022874091732470.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO PREVENT\n361\nthem. From this perspective, it can be noted that States having mass surveillance programmes, such as the United States, are still unable to prevent cyber operations from entering their networks and damaging their cyber infrastructure. On top of all these difficulties and as a final remark, most cyber operations take place within very short lapses of time, often only a few seconds. By extension, this means that monitoring and identifications processes have to take place within a very short timeframe.³⁸ This is almost unachievable, given the current state of technology. Because the objective is to prevent the transit of a cyber operation in a State infrastructure, the response must take place at the same time as the identification. Perhaps technological evolution, which is unfolding rapidly in the cyber realm, will be able to offer us new solutions to these difficulties which can improve the technical appropriateness and abilities of such monitoring techniques (for instance the development of artificial intelligence).³⁹ Irrespective of these new developments, the legal problems that they trigger would not change. In addition to this, as noted by Michael N Schmitt, '[t]here appears to be an emerging consensus among scholars and state legal advisers against the existence of obligations either to monitor cyber activities on one's territory or to prevent malicious use of cyber infrastructure located within one's borders'.⁴⁰ I believe that all these reasons demonstrate the irrelevance of implementing mass monitoring in the cyber infrastructures of a State for the purposes of due diligence.\nOne may argue that the surveillance activities of a State are limited by international law, human rights law and domestic law,⁴¹ which would limit the possible negative consequences. Yet, taking this approach would be a very slippery slope with almost no value in preventing cyber threats from using the computer networks of a State.\nAs often noted already, the duty of diligence is only an obligation of conduct and not of result. Nonetheless, a requirement to monitor Internet traffic would then transform into a justification for mass-surveillance programmes without actually making much contribution to fulfilling this duty. The duty of diligence must not constitute an excessive burden on\n³⁸ Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual* (n 28) 27, commentary to Rule 5, para 4; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 28.\n³⁹ Schmitt, *'Due Diligence in Cyberspace'* (n 22) 72–73.\n⁴⁰ *ibid* 75.\n⁴¹ Bannelier-Christakis (n 22) 644; Bannelier and Christakis (n 4) 20; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 30.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nthe State, and the implementation of such monitoring would represent a twofold excessive burden – on the State's capacities and human rights law. Thus, such an obligation would be considered unreasonable.\nThe situation may differ if such monitoring capacities already exist. In such cases, does the State with monitoring capacities have an obligation to use them in order to comply with its due diligence obligations? The short answer is yes. The State has an obligation to use any means at its disposal to comply with its due diligence duty. Thus, the duty of diligence does not oblige the State to implement a monitoring programme for Internet traffic, but when such capacities already exist, then the State has to use them. The content of the duty of diligence depends on the capacity of each State. The ILA's first report on due diligence highlighted this point in regard to due diligence in human rights law and international environmental law.⁴² It stressed that it was necessary to differentiate between the treatment of developed States and that of developing ones, as they may not have the same capacity to control and to comply with their due diligence duty. Similarly, in cyberspace not all States are equal and some may be better equipped to comply with their obligations than others,⁴³ in particular those where a mass-surveillance programme already exists and therefore may be used to monitor cyber activities. The burden of the duty of diligence must be reasonable, however. It cannot exceed the State's capacity.\nIn sum, the duty of diligence does not impose a duty on States to monitor the Internet traffic of cyber infrastructures located on their territory,⁴⁴ nor to develop the necessary technologies to perform such monitoring. In the case of a State having already developed the capabilities to conduct such monitoring programmes, to comply with the obligation of diligence this State would have to use these capabilities. It must be highlighted that such situation does not legitimate nor preclude the potential wrongfulness of such capabilities under domestic or international laws.\n## 8.1.3 The Difference between Cyber Operations Launched from or Solely Transiting through the Territory of the State\nIt is impossible to completely separate cyber operations from the physical world. A cyber operation that is simply transiting through the territory of\n⁴² ILA Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law – First Report (n 1) respectively 18 and 27.\n⁴³ Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 74–75.\n⁴⁴ For a similar view, see Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 43–46, commentary to Rule 7, paras 3–13.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE ABSENCE OF A THRESHOLD OF HARM\na State only requires electronic impulses via cables and devices, and this transit lasts less than a second in most cases. Conversely, the launch of a cyber operation from the territory of a State would take more than just a few electronic impulses. It would also integrate a physical dimension in most cases. Two situations should be distinguished from one another: firstly, the launch of a cyber operation via a cyber infrastructure that is remotely under the control of the perpetrator; secondly, the launch of a cyber operation from the territory of a State.\nA cyber operation can be launched via a cyber infrastructure located on the territory of one State, but be infected and controlled by the perpetrators located in another. This is, for instance, the case with bots, also known as 'zombified' computers, which are used to perpetrate DDoS attacks. The perpetrators of a DDoS attack targeting State A may be located in State B, using a botnet of 'zombified' computers located in States X, Y and Z. In this situation, what obligation arises in terms of due diligence of States X, Y and Z? Here again, they have no obligation to monitor their Internet traffic nor to know of all events and activities happening in the cyber infrastructure on their territory. The situation may be different if, as we will see in the next section, they know or should know about the malicious use of the controlled infrastructures on their territory.\nIn the case of a cyber operation launched directly from the territory of a State, for example by an organised group located on its territory, the duty of diligence applies. The territorial State has, in such cases, means other than solely cyber ones to make itself aware of such use. In the case of highly sophisticated cyber operations, the preparatory phases often involve physical input that may be detectable by the State. For instance, it may be visible that something is under preparation or already happening owing to an increase in activity of a specific group already under scrutiny by the State.\nI will come back to the distinction between State of transit and State of launch, and the consequences of this distinction for the application of the principle of due diligence to cyber operations, in the third section (8.3).\n## 8.2 The Absence of a Threshold of Harm\nThe experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 condition the applicability of the principle of due diligence to two cumulative requirements: firstly, the cyber operation concerned must be 'contrary to the rights' of the affected\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nState under international law; and, secondly, it must have ‘serious adverse consequences’.⁴⁵ Moreover, they also ‘concurred that the due diligence principle extends to cyber operations conducted by non-State actors that, while not violating international law per se, nevertheless result in serious adverse consequences and [...] affect the right of the target State’.⁴⁶ In addition, they note that the threshold of harm does not depend on the occurrence of ‘physical damage to objects or injuries to individuals’.⁴⁷\nThe first requirement derives directly from the dictum of the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case,⁴⁸ and does not raise any specific issue. The second requirement, the threshold of harm, may be more controversial. The commentary to Rule 6 states that:\nThe precise threshold of harm at which the due diligence principle applies is unsettled in international law. All of the Experts agreed that the due diligence requirement arises when the situation involves a cyber operation that results in ‘serious adverse consequences’, although they could identify no bright line threshold for the identification of such consequences. They adopted this standard by analogy from application of the due diligence principle in the context of international environmental law. Some of them supported a lower threshold of application for the Rule, for instance, by proposing the term ‘significant’ or ‘substantial’ in lieu of ‘serious’.⁴⁹\nIndeed, in the Trail Smelter arbitral award, the court held that under the principles of international law, as well as of the law of the United States:\nno State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein, when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is established by clear and convincing evidence.⁵⁰\nThus, this arbitral award recognised the existence of a threshold of harm regarding the application of the principle of due diligence in preventing transboundary environmental harm.⁵¹ On this basis, the experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 assert that a similar standard exists regarding cyber operations.\n⁴⁵ ibid 34, commentary to Rule 6, para 15.\n⁴⁶ ibid 35, commentary to Rule 6, para 21.\n⁴⁷ ibid 37–38, commentary to Rule 6, para 28.\n⁴⁸ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22.\n⁴⁹ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 36–37, commentary to Rule 6, para 25 (footnotes omitted).\n⁵⁰ Trail Smelter case (United States, Canada) (n 8) 1965.\n⁵¹ See generally Kulesza (n 1) 91–105.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE ABSENCE OF A THRESHOLD OF HARM\nFurther on the experts clarified their idea, as they agreed that ‘merely affecting the interests of the target State, as in the case of causing inconvenience, minor disruption, or negligible expense, is not the type of harm envisaged; thus, not every use of a State’s territory that produces negative effects for a target State implicates the due diligence principle’.⁵²\nI am not convinced that such requirement of a threshold of harm is part of the customary principle of due diligence, and thus of the *lex lata* applicable to cyber operations. In my view, the assessment of the intensity of the cyber operations concerned does not condition whether the State has the possibility of invoking the obligation of due diligence of the territorial State from the perspective of international law. Conversely, it may condition whether the State will actually invoke the obligation of due diligence of the territorial State. It is thus not a legal requirement, but a requirement regarding the opportunity for the State to invoke this principle, or not. More precisely, the occurrence of a damage or harm is not a necessary element of the principle of due diligence.⁵³ According to the principle, States must exercise due diligence in ensuring that territory and objects over which they enjoy sovereignty are not to be used to harm other States. This principle does not require that an actual harm or damage occurs; on the contrary, it relies on the potential damage or harm that may be suffered by the other States. Even if this damage or harm never materialises, the State still has to comply with its duty of diligence. Consequently, the second requirement of ‘serious adverse consequences’ does not seem to flow from general international law nor does it seem justified.\nIn that perspective, my analysis of the threshold of harm for the principle of due diligence asserted by the *Tallinn Manual 2.0* is similar to the one I have already made regarding the same proposed threshold for the qualification of the violation of territorial sovereignty.⁵⁴\nTo conclude, it seems that the general customary principle of due diligence does not involve a threshold of harm. However, such threshold has already been identified in specific dimensions of the principle of due diligence, as for instance regarding transboundary environmental harm,\n⁵² Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 37, commentary to Rule 6, para 26.\n⁵³ More generally, the occurrence of a damage is not a necessary element of an internationally wrongful act; see: ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (2001) 2 Yearbook of the International Law Commission (Part II) 31, 92, commentary to Article 21, para 6; James Crawford, *State Responsibility: The General Part* (CUP 2013) 54et seq.\n⁵⁴ See supra 5.3.2.2B The Absence of a Damage Requirement.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nand may translate into other dimensions in the future, including cyber operations. Indeed, it is important to distinguish the recourse to the principle of due diligence to establish, on the one hand, the responsibility of a State for not having complied with its due diligence obligations, from, on the other, the liability of a State for a significant transboundary harm. In the first case, which was developed in the present section, there is not a threshold of harm, while in the second case, which is developed later, in Section 8.4, such a threshold exists.\n## 8.3 The Duty of a State to Take Measures to Terminate an Unlawful Cyber Operation Using Its Infrastructure\nAnother principal component of the principle of due diligence is the obligation for a State that is aware of an unlawful cyber operation – which is using its cyber infrastructure – to take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate the operation.^^ The resulting obligation has three dimensions: firstly, knowledge of the cyber operation by the territorial State (8.2.1); secondly, balancing the feasibility and reasonableness of the measures that should be taken (8.2.2); and finally, the distinction between cyber operations merely transiting via the State and those emanating from the territory of the State (8.2.3).\n## 8.3.1 Knowledge of the Territorial State\nAs a prerequisite, the territorial State has to be aware that a cyber operation is using its cyber infrastructure. Two situations should be distinguished from one another. Firstly, the victim State of a cyber operation has to notify the territorial State and ask it to take measures to terminate it. In such cases, there is no doubt that the territorial State is aware of the cyber operation and thus is obliged to take all feasible and reasonable measures against it. Secondly, the territorial State may also know about it even in the absence of notification by the victim State. In such circumstances, the burden of proof that the territorial State knows or should have known about the cyber operation is on the victim State. There is no transfer of the burden of proof as the territorial State has no\n^ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 43, Rule 7; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 37; Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 72–75. See, more generally, Tehran Hostages (Judgment) (n 14) 32–33, para 68.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE DUTY TO TAKE MEASURES TO TERMINATE THE ACT 367\nobligation to have absolute knowledge of everything taking place on its territory.⁵⁶ When a State has actual knowledge, then it is without a shadow of a doubt bound by the duty of diligence.⁵⁷\nIs constructive knowledge sufficient? In other words, is the fact that a State should have known about the cyber operation enough? The experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 ‘agreed that knowledge encompasses constructive knowledge for the purpose of [Rule 6]’.⁵⁸ On the one hand, the territorial State ‘cannot evade such a request by limiting itself to a reply that it is ignorant of the circumstances of the act and of its authors. The State may, up to a certain point, be bound to supply particulars of the use made by it of the means of information and inquiry at its disposal.’⁵⁹ On the other, the standard of proof would be very high for the State invoking its responsibility to prove that the territorial State should have known. Ultimately, the State invoking non-compliance with the duty of diligence would have to prove that the territorial State actually knew, rather than should have known.\n## 8.3.2 Measures to Terminate the Cyber Operation\nA State that knows its territory is being used for the perpetration of an unlawful cyber operation must take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate it.⁶⁰ As an obligation of conduct and not of result, the State is expected to undertake its ‘best efforts’ to terminate the cyber operation, but would not bear responsibility only because it failed to terminate it.⁶¹ Conversely, if the State did not use all means at its disposal, and did not take all feasible and reasonable measures, it would not have fulfilled its obligation under the duty of diligence.\nIn a number of cases, the speed of cyber operations may render the principle of due diligence almost inapplicable. Some cyber operations only take milliseconds to launch, transit and produce effects, and thus the\n⁵⁶ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 18.\n⁵⁷ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 40, commentary to Rule 6, para 37; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 28–29.\n⁵⁸ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 41, commentary to Rule 6, para 39. Interestingly, the experts taking part in the first edition of the Tallinn Manual were split on this issue: Schmitt, Tallinn Manual (n 28) 28, commentary to Rule 5, para 11; see also Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 29.\n⁵⁹ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 18.\n⁶⁰ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 43, Rule 7.\n⁶¹ Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 7) 221, para 430.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nterritorial State would not have enough time to identify them and respond accordingly.⁶² Already in the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ highlighted the significance of the time dimension.⁶³ An instantaneous reaction is not expected from the territorial State, which must have enough time to be made aware and react. The speed of certain cyber operations renders reaction even more complicated. This is, however, not true of all cyber operations. Some have a continuous character, at least for some of the time. DDoS attacks, for instance, need to take place over a period of time to be effective. Similarly, complex cyber operations, such as Stuxnet, last for several years, during which time they may continuously communicate with their perpetrator and thus use cyber infrastructures located in various countries, for example remotely controlled servers. In such cases, the duty of diligence is particularly relevant. In the case of an ongoing DDoS attack, for instance, the victim State may make a request to the States in which the zombified computers and controlling servers are located to take action against them. It may not halt the DDoS attack but it may diminish its scale and effects.\n## 8.3.3 Distinction between State of Transit and State of Launch\nDoes the duty of diligence apply to cyber operations that are only transiting through the territory of a State? In other words, does the territorial State have an obligation to take measures to terminate the transit of a cyber operation via the computer networks located on its territory? The experts taking part in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 consider that the obligation of due diligence also applies to the transit State, which must act accordingly ‘when it (1) possesses knowledge [...] of an offending operation that reaches the requisite threshold of harm and (2) can take feasible measures to effectively terminate it’.⁶⁴ Karine Bannelier-Christakis rightly highlights that ‘there is no legal reason to consider that transit States do not have a duty of diligence’.⁶⁵ The State of transit has, in theory, the obligation under the duty of diligence to take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate the transit of a cyber operation via the computer networks located on its territory.\n⁶² Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 28.\n⁶³ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22–23.\n⁶⁴ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 33, commentary to Rule 6, para 13.\n⁶⁵ Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 27.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO PREVENT SIGNIFICANT TRANSBOUNDARY HARM 369\nThe technical reality is an important limitation to this duty.⁶⁶ The Internet has been conceived in a way that the packets should arrive at their destination even if the path they use is no longer available. If the paths used by the packets to reach their target is not available, they will use another one. Although this reality makes the duty to terminate the transit difficult to implement, it is not impossible. Implementation would probably slow down or even temporarily block the perpetration of a cyber operation, or diminish the scale of a DDoS attack, but it would never constitute a panacea.\nThe balancing of reasonableness is important in such cases. For instance, it appears unreasonable to expect the transit State to shut down all Internet traffic transiting via its territory in order to end a cyber operation. What should be expected from the State is not its shut-down, but rather the implementation of filters capable of blocking specific packets that embed malicious code from transiting through their networks when they are aware of it. Again, the speed of most cyber operations may render this operation irrelevant, as the time needed to implement these filters may exceed the length of the actual cyber operation.\nIn short, the duty of diligence extends to the State of transit, but the technical reality of the operations of computer networks and the transit of cyber operations render such duty almost impossible to implement. This reality does not prevent the transit State from taking measures, if possible, nor does it excuse its inaction.\n## 8.4 Toward a Duty to Prevent the Potential Significant Transboundary Harm Caused by Cyber Operations\nA State may be held responsible for a cyber operation that is attributable to it and constitutes an internationally wrongful act. Due diligence is a subsidiary principle to State responsibility according to which a State may be held responsible for the occurrence of a cyber operation, without being responsible for the cyber operation itself. More recently, this principle has also served as a basis for the development of a regime of State liability for the consequences of acts that are not prohibited under\n⁶⁶ See also Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 34, commentary to Rule 6, para 14.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\ninternational law. Such a regime of liability has found fertile ground in international space law⁶⁷ and international environmental law.\nIn international environmental law, States have an obligation to prevent the use of their territory for activities causing injury or damage in the territory of another State as well as a duty to prevent transboundary harm from hazardous activities. The first obligation was introduced in the Trail Smelter arbitration. In this case, the aerial pollution of a Canadian smelter located near the border with the United States damaged trees and crops located in American territory. The Tribunal noted that:\nunder the principles of international law, as well as of the law of the United States, no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein, when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is established by clear and convincing evidence.⁶⁸\nThe ILC also worked on the question of the consequences of transboundary harms resulting from an act not prohibited under international law, and ultimately adopted the ‘Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities’ in 2001⁶⁹ and the ‘Draft Principles on the Allocation of Loss in the Case of Transboundary Harm Arising out of Hazardous Activities’ in 2006.⁷⁰\nThe duty of diligence stipulated in international environmental law or international space law cannot be transposed directly to the cyber realm given that the situations are different. It shows, however, some interesting paths that could be taken in order to develop a similar duty of diligence regarding cyber activities. WannaCry and NotPetya may constitute at the maximum breaches of the territorial sovereignty of the targeted States.⁷¹\n⁶⁷ Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (adopted on 29 March 1972, entered into force on 1 September 1972) 961 UNTS 187, 24 UST 2389, 10 ILM 965 (1971).\n⁶⁸ Trail Smelter case (United States, Canada) (n 8), 1965.\n⁶⁹ ‘Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities’ (adopted by the Commission at its fifty-third session, in 2001, and submitted to the General Assembly as a part of the Commission’s report covering the work of that session (A/56/10)).\n⁷⁰ ‘Draft Principles on the Allocation of Loss in the Case of Transboundary Harm Arising out of Hazardous Activities’ (adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-eighth session, in 2006, and submitted to the General Assembly as a part of the Commission’s report covering the work of that session (A/61/10)).\n⁷¹ See supra 230–232.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO DISCLOSE ZERO-DAY VULNERABILITIES\n371\nYet, they resulted in massive economic loss for numerous companies in several States. We may wonder whether a specific regime could develop under international law to cover such losses. In such cases, the obligation of the perpetrating State would be twofold. Firstly, it would be responsible for internationally wrongful acts it committed, for instance the breach of the territorial sovereignty of the victim States. Secondly, it would be held liable for the harm and damage resulting from its cyber operations. Moreover, such regime could also be applied in cases in which the cyber operations concerned were not amounting to an internationally wrongful act. In such case, the responsibility of the perpetrating State could not be invoked, but the State could be held liable for the resulting harm and damage. It must be recalled that such principle has not yet been clearly created regarding cybersecurity and cyber operations, and thus the assertions made in this paragraph are purely hypothetical.\nIf such duty to prevent transboundary harm caused by cyber operations was to be recognised, it would be conditioned to a threshold of harm. Indeed, a State would be liable only when the transboundary harm was of a certain significance, as is the case in international environmental law.\nThe recognition of such a principle of liability regarding the consequences of cyber operations could also contribute to the creation and strengthening of a global culture of cybersecurity. Indeed, it might prompt States to be more cautious about, and careful when, conducting cyber operations, notably regarding the potential for the involuntary spread of malware and side effects of these operations. The recognition of such a principle of liability for the transboundary harm caused by cyber operations currently remains a highly hypothetical scenario, which can only be confirmed by State practice.\n## 8.5 Toward a Duty to Disclose Zero-Day Vulnerabilities\nThe WannaCry case leads to two distinct questions regarding State responsibility. Firstly, some States have publicly attributed WannaCry to North Korea, and they could thus have invoked the responsibility of North Korea under international law, if they consider WannaCry to be an internationally wrongful act.72\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\nThe second question on responsibility departs from the traditional approach of the law on State responsibility: is the United States responsible for not having informed Microsoft of the existence of a vulnerability in their product and for having created the exploit later used by WannaCry?\nThe Russian President Vladimir Putin stated about WannaCry that '[a]s regards the source of these threats, I believe that the leadership of Microsoft have announced this plainly, that the initial source of the virus is the intelligence services of the United States'.73\nIn a similar vein, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, declared in a statement on Microsoft's blog:\nFinally, this attack provides yet another example of why the stockpiling of vulnerabilities by governments is such a problem. This is an emerging pattern in 2017. We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks, and now this vulnerability stolen from the NSA has affected customers around the world. Repeatedly, exploits in the hands of governments have leaked into the public domain and caused widespread damage. An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the U.S. military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen. And this most recent attack represents a completely unintended but disconcerting link between the two most serious forms of cybersecurity threats in the world today – nation-state action and organized criminal action.\nThe governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call. They need to take a different approach and adhere in cyberspace to the same rules applied to weapons in the physical world. We need governments to consider the damage to civilians that comes from hoarding these vulnerabilities and the use of these exploits. This is one reason we called in February for a new 'Digital Geneva Convention' to govern these issues, including a new requirement for governments to report vulnerabilities to vendors, rather than stockpile, sell, or exploit them.74\nTo be addressed, the question of the potential responsibility of the United States regarding WannaCry and NotPetya must be broken down into three sub-questions.\n73 Macarena Vidal Liy, 'Putin culpa a los servicios secretos de EE UU por el virus \"WannaCry\" que desencadenó el ciberataque mundial', *El País* (Madrid, 15 May 2017) https://elpais.com/internacional/2017/05/15/actualidad/1494855826_022843.html; 'Putin Warns of Risks of Governments Creating Hacking Tools', *Reuters* (15 May 2017) www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attacks-putin-idUSKCN18B15Y..\n74 Brad Smith, 'The Need for Urgent Collective Action to Keep People Safe Online: Lessons from Last Week's Cyberattack' (Microsoft On the Issues, 14 May 2017) https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/05/14/need-urgent-collective-action-keep-people-safe-online-lessons-last-weeks-cyberattack/.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO DISCLOSE ZERO-DAY VULNERABILITIES\n373\nThe first sub-question concerns whether the paternity of the NSA over EternalBlue and DoublePulsar is enough to attribute WannaCry to the United States. The answer is indubitably no. The fact that an actor, including a State, uses a tool produced by another State is not enough to attribute the consequences of that use to the latter State. Indeed, it does not create a sufficient subordination nexus, if any, between the concerned State and the perpetrator.\nThe second sub-question concerns whether the behaviour of the United States constitutes a breach of its obligation of due diligence. In other words, whether the United States knowingly allowed the use of its territory for the perpetration of WannaCry – if we paraphrase the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.75 In the WannaCry situation, however, the territory of the United States was not used for the perpetration of the ransomware campaign. Consequently, the United States has not breached its obligation of due diligence regarding the use of its territory.\nFinally, the third sub-question concerns whether there might be a plurality of actors sharing the responsibility for WannaCry, including the United States, and this is addressed later in the book.76\nThis section demonstrated that neither the non-disclosure of a vulnerability nor the development of a related exploit by a State constitutes an internationally wrongful act.77 Similarly, in a situation in which a third party would use this vulnerability or exploit, this State could not be held responsible under international law. That being said, it is important to note that the approach of States on the disclosure of vulnerabilities is slowly evolving owing to the global pressure for more transparency following, inter alia, the Snowden revelations and more recently the leak of the NSA's hacking tool by the Shadow Brokers. Several States are indeed implementing Vulnerabilities Equities Processes (VEP) aimed at determining whether they should disclose zero-day vulnerabilities or keep them secret for potential future use.78\n75 Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22.\n76 See infra 420.\n77 This analysis was developed during the master class I delivered with Aude Géry at the Forum international de la Cybersécurité in January 2018 on 'Proliferation of Cyberweapons and International Law'.\n78 See, for instance: Sasha Romanosky, 'Developing an Objective, Repeatable Scoring System for a Vulnerability Equities Process' (Lawfare, 4 February 2019) www.lawfareblog.com/developing-objective-repeatable-scoring-system-vulnerability-equities-process; Sven Herpig and Ari Schwartz, 'The Future of Vulnerabilities Equities Processes Around the World' (Lawfare, 4 January 2019) www.lawfareblog.com/future-vulnerabilities-equities-processes-around-world; Kate Charlet, Sasha Romanosky and Bert Thompson, 'It's Time for the International Community to Get Serious about Vulnerability Equities'\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\n## 8.6 Concluding Remarks on Cyber Due Diligence\nThe obligation of due diligence is an obligation of conduct, and not of result. States are under a duty to both prevent the use of cyber infrastructure and take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate cyber operations emanating from or transiting through the computer networks located on their territory. This duty does not include an obligation to monitor all Internet traffic within the computer networks on the territory of the State. Similarly, the duty of diligence can only be invoked during an ongoing unlawful action, such as a cyber operation.⁷⁹\nIn the same tenor as *ad impossibilia nemo tenetur*, or ‘nobody is held to the impossible’, the measures adopted by the territorial State must be assessed in light of the test of reasonableness and feasibility. They must not represent an overly onerous burden on the State. Thus, the measures must be commensurate with its capacity, which may differ from State to State. The State is free to choose the measures to be implemented, which can take various forms including being of a technical, political or legal nature.⁸⁰ The duty of diligence cannot impose a duty to enact specific legislation as this would then shift from an obligation of conduct to an obligation of result.⁸¹ It may, however, constitute a strong incentive to integrate some specific legislative measures into the domestic legal order for the purposes of compliance.\nIn a limited number of cases, the victim State of the cyber operation would be entitled to invoke the responsibility of the territorial State for not complying with its duty of diligence, and even to compel the territorial State to take appropriate measures.⁸²\nPart I was dedicated to the question of attribution. Due diligence may constitute an interesting palliative to the problem of attribution.⁸³ Most cyber operations that have taken place are almost impossible to attribute to a State or other actor with any certainty. In several cases, the victim State will have a strong suspicion that one or more States are responsible\n(Lawfare, 15 November 2017) www.lawfareblog.com/its-time-international-community-get-serious-about-vulnerability-equities.\n⁷⁹ Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 75.\n⁸⁰ Ziolkowski (n 23) 169.\n⁸¹ Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 33–35.\n⁸² Part III of this book deals specifically with State responsibility and measures of self-help to be taken by the victim State against the responsible State; see *infra* Chapter 9 and Chapter 10.\n⁸³ In this perspective, see the interesting discussion on the relationship between State sovereignty and due diligence regarding international security in Kulesza (n 1) 276 et seq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n375\nfor the cyber operation; however, often it will not have any definitive material proof to support such allegations. In some cases, if the victim State is able to prove that the cyber operation was launched from or transited through the territory of a State, then it could thus invoke the territorial State's responsibility for the non-fulfilment of its obligation of due diligence. This would offer a basis for the victim State to invoke the responsibility of and take measures against the State that is allegedly responsible. The remedies and measures to be taken by the victim State against the responsible State must be proportionate and necessary. Clearly, they will be of less intensity in cases involving the non-fulfilment of due diligence than in cases involving a definitive attribution of an unlawful cyber operation.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press"

As mentioned, the obligation of due diligence developed in various branches of international law, but the notion is also used to describe other forms of legal or political obligations, within and outside the realm of international law. Broadly, due diligence is understood as a standard of conduct required to discharge an obligation. In other words, due diligence is often referred to as representing a certain standard of conduct that should be observed by States or other actors in performing particular acts or regarding specific obligations. The recent discussion in the European Journal of International Law on the ‘human rights due diligence’ in the 2011 United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights perfectly highlights the risk of confusion between the various dimensions of due diligence, and notably the ongoing debate on the due diligence of both private and public actors.¹⁹ The development of ICT technologies also raises the question of the due diligence obligations of both public and private actors. Alongside the obligation for a State not to allow knowingly its ICT infrastructure to be used for malicious acts, there are also the questions, for instance, of the duties of private companies not to let their ICT infrastructure be used for such acts and to avoid releasing software flawed with vulnerabilities.²⁰ The private sector’s due diligence is outside the scope of this book. Consequently, it seems necessary to clarify that the present chapter focuses exclusively on due diligence understood as ‘every State’s obligation not to ¹⁶ Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

International law is primarily the law of States and it cannot generally be enforced directly upon non-state actors. The principle of due diligence renders a State responsible or liable for the occurrence of acts of other actors, including non-state actors, perpetrated in its territory or jurisdiction in some specific circumstances. This is the sense of the sixth norm of the 'Singapore Norm Package' adopted by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) in November 2018: Non-state actors should not engage in offensive cyber operations and state actors should prevent and respond to such activities if they occur.²⁵ ²¹ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22.\n²² Karine Bannelier-Christakis, 'Obligations de diligence dans le cyberespace: qui a peur de la cyber-diligence?'

The GCSC demonstrates here how this principle is relevant to regulating such a situation, emphasising in the commentary to the norm that ‘[i]f states permit such action, they may therefore be held responsible under international law. States must act, domestically and internationally, to prevent offensive cyber operations by non-state actors.’²⁶ The UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security integrated cyber due diligence into its 2013 report as a norm of behaviour, and again in its 2015 report. The report stated that ‘States should seek to ensure that their territories are not used by non-State actors for unlawful use of ICTs’.²⁷ Similarly, the experts involved in the Tallinn Manual process agreed on the application of the principle of due diligence. In the Tallinn Manual 1.0, Rule 5²⁸ dealt with the principle of due diligence, and the commentary makes clear that the experts disagreed on the particular features of this principle.²⁹ In the Tallinn Manual 2.0,³⁰ Rule 6 rephrases ²⁶ ibid 19 (footnote omitted).\n²⁷ UNGA, ‘Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ (24 June 2013) UN Doc A/68/98, para 23.

In addition, the Tallinn Manual states that a neutral State to an international armed conflict should not allow its cyber infrastructure to be used by the belligerent parties: ibid 252, Rule 93. On due diligence and international humanitarian law in general, see ILA Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law – First Report (n 1) 11–14.\n²⁹ See the commentary to Rule 5 in Schmitt, Tallinn Manual (n 28) 26–29; see also Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 70–71.\n³⁰ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 30–50, Rules 6–7. Ian Yuying Liu wrote an article analysing the Tallinn Manual 2.0’s rules on due diligence as well as the reluctance of some States regarding the application of the principle of due diligence to cyber conducts: Ian Yuying Liu, ‘The Due Diligence Doctrine under Tallinn Manual 2.0’ (2017) 33 Computer Law &amp; Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice 390. Michael https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press CYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE and modifies the fifth Rule of the first edition, and reads: '[a] State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States';[31] in addition, Rule 7 deals with compliance with the due diligence principle and recalls that States are required to take all feasible measures that are foreseeable.[32] The application of the principle of due diligence to the cyber realm remains, however, a controversial issue. Some States are reluctant to extend this principle to cyberspace because of the corresponding obligations it would impose on them.[33] Moreover, another difficulty arises concerning the distinction between States from which the cyber operation is launched and States of transit, that is to say States through which the cyber operation is routed. The present chapter asserts that the principle of due diligence is applicable to cyber operations, and analyses how it applies and what the corresponding obligations that it imposes on States are. The duty of cyber due diligence may be seen as a coin with two faces; on the one side, there is the duty to prevent the use of the ICT infrastructure (8.1), and on the other, there is the obligation to take measures to terminate a cyber operation that has been detected (8.3). This chapter also analyses whether the invocation of the principle of due diligence is subject to a threshold of harm (8.2). Moreover, this chapter investigates two possible variations of due diligence regarding cyber operations, that may be developed in the future: the creation of a duty to (i) prevent the potential transboundary harm caused by cyber operations (8.4) and (ii) disclose zero-day vulnerabilities (8.5).\n## 8.1 Does a Duty to Prevent Any Use of State Cyber Infrastructures Exist?\nDoes a State have a general duty to prevent any use of its cyber infrastructure for the perpetration by another State, or by non-state actors, of a cyber operation against another State? Such obligation may be N Schmitt published an article highlighting some points dealt with in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that would deserve further work, including due diligence: Michael N Schmitt, 'Grey Zones in the International Law of Cyberspace' (2017) 42 The Yale Journal of International Law Online 1, 11-13.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press DUTY TO PREVENT\n\n## 8.1.1 A State Has No Obligation to Have Absolute Knowledge of All Events and Activities on Its Territory or in Cyber Infrastructures under Its Control\nUnder international law, a State is not obliged to have absolute knowledge of all events and activities happening on its territory. As recalled by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case:\nit cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known, of any unlawful act perpetrated therein, nor yet that it necessarily knew, or should have known, the authors.³⁴\nThe fact that the cyber operation emanates from or transits through the computer networks located on the territory of a State does not render this State responsible, nor does it transfer the burden of proof onto, this State.³⁵\nA State is under the obligation to take all feasible measures to prevent the use of its territory for activities that breach the rights of other States. As already mentioned, it is an obligation of conduct – to take measures – and not of result.\nI agree with the experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that the obligation of due diligence of a State applies regarding cyber activities taking place on its territory and extends extraterritorially to those taking place on\n³⁴ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 18.\n³⁵ ibid.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\ncontrolled territory abroad, as well as in cyber infrastructure located abroad under its control.³⁶\nIn the cyber realm, does this obligation impose a duty on the State to monitor the Internet traffic emanating from and transiting via its cyber infrastructure? The next section demonstrates why the question should be answered negatively.\n## 8.1.2 The Slippery Slope of Justifying Mass Surveillance\nA general duty to know what is happening in the computer networks of a State may be understood as implying mass and indiscriminate surveillance of these networks by the State. Thus, such a duty would serve as a justification for mass surveillance. Not only does it risk a slippery slope in terms of civil liberties and human rights, but it would also be of limited relevance for the duty of diligence, as detailed below.\nThe mass surveillance programme of the NSA was, at its best, able to monitor 75 per cent of US Internet traffic.³⁷ Thus, it was not able to monitor all the traffic emanating or transiting through the State. Even if it was possible to monitor all the Internet traffic, the treatment of the monitored data would necessitate too much work to be relevant or even attainable. Indeed, in the case of the mass-surveillance programme, the objective is generally to filter specific communications or the use of specific words, i.e. there is something to look for. In the case of cyber operations, they can take a wide variety of forms and it would be almost impossible to identify specific filters that would allow them to be detected. Monitoring the metadata would not suffice. It would be necessary to undertake a deep inspection of each packet of data to determine its real content and the purpose of this content. Moreover, it is not very difficult to embed a malicious code into another code of legitimate software; therefore, it would be necessary to be able to distinguish which part of the code belongs to the malware. The perpetrators would also sooner or later understand how the filters operate and would be able to adapt the structure of their malicious code to address the new situation, therefore always managing to find cracks in the system and to exploit\n³⁶ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 32–33, commentary to Rule 6, paras 8–10.\n³⁷ Jennifer Valentino-Devries and Siobhan Gorman, ‘New Details Show Broader NSA Surveillance Reach: Programs Cover 75% of Nation’s Traffic, Can Snare Emails’, Wall Street Journal (20 August 2013) www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324108204579022874091732470.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDUTY TO PREVENT\n\nOne may argue that the surveillance activities of a State are limited by international law, human rights law and domestic law,⁴¹ which would limit the possible negative consequences. Yet, taking this approach would be a very slippery slope with almost no value in preventing cyber threats from using the computer networks of a State.\nAs often noted already, the duty of diligence is only an obligation of conduct and not of result. Nonetheless, a requirement to monitor Internet traffic would then transform into a justification for mass-surveillance programmes without actually making much contribution to fulfilling this duty. The duty of diligence must not constitute an excessive burden on ³⁸ Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual* (n 28) 27, commentary to Rule 5, para 4; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 28.\n³⁹ Schmitt, *'Due Diligence in Cyberspace'* (n 22) 72–73.\n⁴⁰ *ibid* 75.\n⁴¹ Bannelier-Christakis (n 22) 644; Bannelier and Christakis (n 4) 20; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 30.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press CYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE the State, and the implementation of such monitoring would represent a twofold excessive burden – on the State's capacities and human rights law. Thus, such an obligation would be considered unreasonable.\nThe situation may differ if such monitoring capacities already exist. In such cases, does the State with monitoring capacities have an obligation to use them in order to comply with its due diligence obligations? The short answer is yes. The State has an obligation to use any means at its disposal to comply with its due diligence duty. Thus, the duty of diligence does not oblige the State to implement a monitoring programme for Internet traffic, but when such capacities already exist, then the State has to use them. The content of the duty of diligence depends on the capacity of each State. The ILA's first report on due diligence highlighted this point in regard to due diligence in human rights law and international environmental law.⁴² It stressed that it was necessary to differentiate between the treatment of developed States and that of developing ones, as they may not have the same capacity to control and to comply with their due diligence duty. Similarly, in cyberspace not all States are equal and some may be better equipped to comply with their obligations than others,⁴³ in particular those where a mass-surveillance programme already exists and therefore may be used to monitor cyber activities. The burden of the duty of diligence must be reasonable, however. It cannot exceed the State's capacity.\nIn sum, the duty of diligence does not impose a duty on States to monitor the Internet traffic of cyber infrastructures located on their territory,⁴⁴ nor to develop the necessary technologies to perform such monitoring. In the case of a State having already developed the capabilities to conduct such monitoring programmes, to comply with the obligation of diligence this State would have to use these capabilities. It must be highlighted that such situation does not legitimate nor preclude the potential wrongfulness of such capabilities under domestic or international laws.\n## 8.1.3 The Difference between Cyber Operations Launched from or Solely Transiting through the Territory of the State It is impossible to completely separate cyber operations from the physical world. A cyber operation that is simply transiting through the territory of ⁴² ILA Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law – First Report (n 1) respectively 18 and 27.\n⁴³ Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 74–75.\n⁴⁴ For a similar view, see Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 43–46, commentary to Rule 7, paras 3–13.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press THE ABSENCE OF A THRESHOLD OF HARM a State only requires electronic impulses via cables and devices, and this transit lasts less than a second in most cases. Conversely, the launch of a cyber operation from the territory of a State would take more than just a few electronic impulses. It would also integrate a physical dimension in most cases. Two situations should be distinguished from one another: firstly, the launch of a cyber operation via a cyber infrastructure that is remotely under the control of the perpetrator; secondly, the launch of a cyber operation from the territory of a State.\nA cyber operation can be launched via a cyber infrastructure located on the territory of one State, but be infected and controlled by the perpetrators located in another. This is, for instance, the case with bots, also known as 'zombified' computers, which are used to perpetrate DDoS attacks. The perpetrators of a DDoS attack targeting State A may be located in State B, using a botnet of 'zombified' computers located in States X, Y and Z. In this situation, what obligation arises in terms of due diligence of States X, Y and Z? Here again, they have no obligation to monitor their Internet traffic nor to know of all events and activities happening in the cyber infrastructure on their territory. The situation may be different if, as we will see in the next section, they know or should know about the malicious use of the controlled infrastructures on their territory.\nIn the case of a cyber operation launched directly from the territory of a State, for example by an organised group located on its territory, the duty of diligence applies. The territorial State has, in such cases, means other than solely cyber ones to make itself aware of such use. In the case of highly sophisticated cyber operations, the preparatory phases often involve physical input that may be detectable by the State. For instance, it may be visible that something is under preparation or already happening owing to an increase in activity of a specific group already under scrutiny by the State.\nI will come back to the distinction between State of transit and State of launch, and the consequences of this distinction for the application of the principle of due diligence to cyber operations, in the third section (8.3).\n## 8.2 The Absence of a Threshold of Harm The experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 condition the applicability of the principle of due diligence to two cumulative requirements: firstly, the cyber operation concerned must be 'contrary to the rights' of the affected https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press CYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE State under international law; and, secondly, it must have ‘serious adverse consequences’.⁴⁵ Moreover, they also ‘concurred that the due diligence principle extends to cyber operations conducted by non-State actors that, while not violating international law per se, nevertheless result in serious adverse consequences and [...] affect the right of the target State’.⁴⁶ In addition, they note that the threshold of harm does not depend on the occurrence of ‘physical damage to objects or injuries to individuals’.⁴⁷ The first requirement derives directly from the dictum of the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case,⁴⁸ and does not raise any specific issue. The second requirement, the threshold of harm, may be more controversial. The commentary to Rule 6 states that: The precise threshold of harm at which the due diligence principle applies is unsettled in international law. All of the Experts agreed that the due diligence requirement arises when the situation involves a cyber operation that results in ‘serious adverse consequences’, although they could identify no bright line threshold for the identification of such consequences. They adopted this standard by analogy from application of the due diligence principle in the context of international environmental law. Some of them supported a lower threshold of application for the Rule, for instance, by proposing the term ‘significant’ or ‘substantial’ in lieu of ‘serious’.⁴⁹ Indeed, in the Trail Smelter arbitral award, the court held that under the principles of international law, as well as of the law of the United States: no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein, when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is established by clear and convincing evidence.⁵⁰ Thus, this arbitral award recognised the existence of a threshold of harm regarding the application of the principle of due diligence in preventing transboundary environmental harm.⁵¹ On this basis, the experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 assert that a similar standard exists regarding cyber operations.\n⁴⁵ ibid 34, commentary to Rule 6, para 15.\n⁴⁶ ibid 35, commentary to Rule 6, para 21.\n⁴⁷ ibid 37–38, commentary to Rule 6, para 28.\n⁴⁸ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22.\n⁴⁹ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 36–37, commentary to Rule 6, para 25 (footnotes omitted).\n⁵⁰ Trail Smelter case (United States, Canada) (n 8) 1965.\n⁵¹ See generally Kulesza (n 1) 91–105.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press THE ABSENCE OF A THRESHOLD OF HARM Further on the experts clarified their idea, as they agreed that ‘merely affecting the interests of the target State, as in the case of causing inconvenience, minor disruption, or negligible expense, is not the type of harm envisaged; thus, not every use of a State’s territory that produces negative effects for a target State implicates the due diligence principle’.⁵² I am not convinced that such requirement of a threshold of harm is part of the customary principle of due diligence, and thus of the *lex lata* applicable to cyber operations. In my view, the assessment of the intensity of the cyber operations concerned does not condition whether the State has the possibility of invoking the obligation of due diligence of the territorial State from the perspective of international law. Conversely, it may condition whether the State will actually invoke the obligation of due diligence of the territorial State. It is thus not a legal requirement, but a requirement regarding the opportunity for the State to invoke this principle, or not. More precisely, the occurrence of a damage or harm is not a necessary element of the principle of due diligence.⁵³ According to the principle, States must exercise due diligence in ensuring that territory and objects over which they enjoy sovereignty are not to be used to harm other States. This principle does not require that an actual harm or damage occurs; on the contrary, it relies on the potential damage or harm that may be suffered by the other States. Even if this damage or harm never materialises, the State still has to comply with its duty of diligence. Consequently, the second requirement of ‘serious adverse consequences’ does not seem to flow from general international law nor does it seem justified.\nIn that perspective, my analysis of the threshold of harm for the principle of due diligence asserted by the *Tallinn Manual 2.0* is similar to the one I have already made regarding the same proposed threshold for the qualification of the violation of territorial sovereignty.⁵⁴ To conclude, it seems that the general customary principle of due diligence does not involve a threshold of harm. However, such threshold has already been identified in specific dimensions of the principle of due diligence, as for instance regarding transboundary environmental harm, ⁵² Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 37, commentary to Rule 6, para 26.\n⁵³ More generally, the occurrence of a damage is not a necessary element of an internationally wrongful act; see: ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (2001) 2 Yearbook of the International Law Commission (Part II) 31, 92, commentary to Article 21, para 6; James Crawford, *State Responsibility: The General Part* 54et seq.\n⁵⁴ See supra 5.3.2.2B The Absence of a Damage Requirement.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press CYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE and may translate into other dimensions in the future, including cyber operations. Indeed, it is important to distinguish the recourse to the principle of due diligence to establish, on the one hand, the responsibility of a State for not having complied with its due diligence obligations, from, on the other, the liability of a State for a significant transboundary harm. In the first case, which was developed in the present section, there is not a threshold of harm, while in the second case, which is developed later, in Section 8.4, such a threshold exists.\n## 8.3 The Duty of a State to Take Measures to Terminate an Unlawful Cyber Operation Using Its Infrastructure Another principal component of the principle of due diligence is the obligation for a State that is aware of an unlawful cyber operation – which is using its cyber infrastructure – to take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate the operation.^[55]^ The resulting obligation has three dimensions: firstly, knowledge of the cyber operation by the territorial State (8.2.1); secondly, balancing the feasibility and reasonableness of the measures that should be taken (8.2.2); and finally, the distinction between cyber operations merely transiting via the State and those emanating from the territory of the State (8.2.3).\n## 8.3.1 Knowledge of the Territorial State As a prerequisite, the territorial State has to be aware that a cyber operation is using its cyber infrastructure. Two situations should be distinguished from one another. Firstly, the victim State of a cyber operation has to notify the territorial State and ask it to take measures to terminate it. In such cases, there is no doubt that the territorial State is aware of the cyber operation and thus is obliged to take all feasible and reasonable measures against it. Secondly, the territorial State may also know about it even in the absence of notification by the victim State. In such circumstances, the burden of proof that the territorial State knows or should have known about the cyber operation is on the victim State. There is no transfer of the burden of proof as the territorial State has no ^[55] Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 43, Rule 7; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 37; Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 72–75. See, more generally, Tehran Hostages (Judgment) (n 14) 32–33, para 68.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press THE DUTY TO TAKE MEASURES TO TERMINATE THE ACT 367 obligation to have absolute knowledge of everything taking place on its territory.⁵⁶ When a State has actual knowledge, then it is without a shadow of a doubt bound by the duty of diligence.⁵⁷ Is constructive knowledge sufficient? In other words, is the fact that a State should have known about the cyber operation enough? The experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 ‘agreed that knowledge encompasses constructive knowledge for the purpose of [Rule 6]’.⁵⁸ On the one hand, the territorial State ‘cannot evade such a request by limiting itself to a reply that it is ignorant of the circumstances of the act and of its authors. The State may, up to a certain point, be bound to supply particulars of the use made by it of the means of information and inquiry at its disposal.’⁵⁹ On the other, the standard of proof would be very high for the State invoking its responsibility to prove that the territorial State should have known. Ultimately, the State invoking non-compliance with the duty of diligence would have to prove that the territorial State actually knew, rather than should have known.\n## 8.3.2 Measures to Terminate the Cyber Operation A State that knows its territory is being used for the perpetration of an unlawful cyber operation must take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate it.⁶⁰ As an obligation of conduct and not of result, the State is expected to undertake its ‘best efforts’ to terminate the cyber operation, but would not bear responsibility only because it failed to terminate it.⁶¹ Conversely, if the State did not use all means at its disposal, and did not take all feasible and reasonable measures, it would not have fulfilled its obligation under the duty of diligence.\nIn a number of cases, the speed of cyber operations may render the principle of due diligence almost inapplicable. Some cyber operations only take milliseconds to launch, transit and produce effects, and thus the ⁵⁶ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 18.\n⁵⁷ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 40, commentary to Rule 6, para 37; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 28–29.\n⁵⁸ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 41, commentary to Rule 6, para 39. Interestingly, the experts taking part in the first edition of the Tallinn Manual were split on this issue: Schmitt, Tallinn Manual (n 28) 28, commentary to Rule 5, para 11; see also Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 29.\n⁵⁹ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 18.\n⁶⁰ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 43, Rule 7.\n⁶¹ Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 7) 221, para 430.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press CYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE territorial State would not have enough time to identify them and respond accordingly.⁶² Already in the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ highlighted the significance of the time dimension.⁶³ An instantaneous reaction is not expected from the territorial State, which must have enough time to be made aware and react. The speed of certain cyber operations renders reaction even more complicated. This is, however, not true of all cyber operations. Some have a continuous character, at least for some of the time. DDoS attacks, for instance, need to take place over a period of time to be effective. Similarly, complex cyber operations, such as Stuxnet, last for several years, during which time they may continuously communicate with their perpetrator and thus use cyber infrastructures located in various countries, for example remotely controlled servers. In such cases, the duty of diligence is particularly relevant. In the case of an ongoing DDoS attack, for instance, the victim State may make a request to the States in which the zombified computers and controlling servers are located to take action against them. It may not halt the DDoS attack but it may diminish its scale and effects.\n## 8.3.3 Distinction between State of Transit and State of Launch Does the duty of diligence apply to cyber operations that are only transiting through the territory of a State? In other words, does the territorial State have an obligation to take measures to terminate the transit of a cyber operation via the computer networks located on its territory? The experts taking part in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 consider that the obligation of due diligence also applies to the transit State, which must act accordingly ‘when it (1) possesses knowledge [...] of an offending operation that reaches the requisite threshold of harm and (2) can take feasible measures to effectively terminate it’.⁶⁴ Karine Bannelier-Christakis rightly highlights that ‘there is no legal reason to consider that transit States do not have a duty of diligence’.⁶⁵ The State of transit has, in theory, the obligation under the duty of diligence to take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate the transit of a cyber operation via the computer networks located on its territory.\n⁶² Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 28.\n⁶³ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22–23.\n⁶⁴ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 33, commentary to Rule 6, para 13.\n⁶⁵ Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 27.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press DUTY TO PREVENT SIGNIFICANT TRANSBOUNDARY HARM 369 The technical reality is an important limitation to this duty.⁶⁶ The Internet has been conceived in a way that the packets should arrive at their destination even if the path they use is no longer available. If the paths used by the packets to reach their target is not available, they will use another one. Although this reality makes the duty to terminate the transit difficult to implement, it is not impossible. Implementation would probably slow down or even temporarily block the perpetration of a cyber operation, or diminish the scale of a DDoS attack, but it would never constitute a panacea.\nThe balancing of reasonableness is important in such cases. For instance, it appears unreasonable to expect the transit State to shut down all Internet traffic transiting via its territory in order to end a cyber operation. What should be expected from the State is not its shut-down, but rather the implementation of filters capable of blocking specific packets that embed malicious code from transiting through their networks when they are aware of it. Again, the speed of most cyber operations may render this operation irrelevant, as the time needed to implement these filters may exceed the length of the actual cyber operation.\nIn short, the duty of diligence extends to the State of transit, but the technical reality of the operations of computer networks and the transit of cyber operations render such duty almost impossible to implement. This reality does not prevent the transit State from taking measures, if possible, nor does it excuse its inaction.\n## 8.4 Toward a Duty to Prevent the Potential Significant Transboundary Harm Caused by Cyber Operations A State may be held responsible for a cyber operation that is attributable to it and constitutes an internationally wrongful act. Due diligence is a subsidiary principle to State responsibility according to which a State may be held responsible for the occurrence of a cyber operation, without being responsible for the cyber operation itself. More recently, this principle has also served as a basis for the development of a regime of State liability for the consequences of acts that are not prohibited under ⁶⁶ See also Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 34, commentary to Rule 6, para 14.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press CYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE international law. Such a regime of liability has found fertile ground in international space law⁶⁷ and international environmental law.\nIn international environmental law, States have an obligation to prevent the use of their territory for activities causing injury or damage in the territory of another State as well as a duty to prevent transboundary harm from hazardous activities. The first obligation was introduced in the Trail Smelter arbitration. In this case, the aerial pollution of a Canadian smelter located near the border with the United States damaged trees and crops located in American territory. The Tribunal noted that: under the principles of international law, as well as of the law of the United States, no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein, when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is established by clear and convincing evidence.⁶⁸ The ILC also worked on the question of the consequences of transboundary harms resulting from an act not prohibited under international law, and ultimately adopted the ‘Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities’ in 2001⁶⁹ and the ‘Draft Principles on the Allocation of Loss in the Case of Transboundary Harm Arising out of Hazardous Activities’ in 2006.⁷⁰ The duty of diligence stipulated in international environmental law or international space law cannot be transposed directly to the cyber realm given that the situations are different. It shows, however, some interesting paths that could be taken in order to develop a similar duty of diligence regarding cyber activities. WannaCry and NotPetya may constitute at the maximum breaches of the territorial sovereignty of the targeted States.⁷¹ ⁶⁷ Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (adopted on 29 March 1972, entered into force on 1 September 1972) 961 UNTS 187, 24 UST 2389, 10 ILM 965 (1971).\n⁶⁸ Trail Smelter case (United States, Canada) (n 8), 1965.\n⁶⁹ ‘Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities’ (adopted by the Commission at its fifty-third session, in 2001, and submitted to the General Assembly as a part of the Commission’s report covering the work of that session (A/56/10)).\n⁷⁰ ‘Draft Principles on the Allocation of Loss in the Case of Transboundary Harm Arising out of Hazardous Activities’ (adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-eighth session, in 2006, and submitted to the General Assembly as a part of the Commission’s report covering the work of that session (A/61/10)).\n⁷¹ See supra 230–232.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press DUTY TO DISCLOSE ZERO-DAY VULNERABILITIES If such duty to prevent transboundary harm caused by cyber operations was to be recognised, it would be conditioned to a threshold of harm. Indeed, a State would be liable only when the transboundary harm was of a certain significance, as is the case in international environmental law.\nThe recognition of such a principle of liability regarding the consequences of cyber operations could also contribute to the creation and strengthening of a global culture of cybersecurity. Indeed, it might prompt States to be more cautious about, and careful when, conducting cyber operations, notably regarding the potential for the involuntary spread of malware and side effects of these operations. The recognition of such a principle of liability for the transboundary harm caused by cyber operations currently remains a highly hypothetical scenario, which can only be confirmed by State practice.\n## 8.5 Toward a Duty to Disclose Zero-Day Vulnerabilities The WannaCry case leads to two distinct questions regarding State responsibility. Firstly, some States have publicly attributed WannaCry to North Korea, and they could thus have invoked the responsibility of North Korea under international law, if they consider WannaCry to be an internationally wrongful act.72 https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press CYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE The second question on responsibility departs from the traditional approach of the law on State responsibility: is the United States responsible for not having informed Microsoft of the existence of a vulnerability in their product and for having created the exploit later used by WannaCry?\nThe Russian President Vladimir Putin stated about WannaCry that '[a]s regards the source of these threats, I believe that the leadership of Microsoft have announced this plainly, that the initial source of the virus is the intelligence services of the United States'.73 In a similar vein, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, declared in a statement on Microsoft's blog: Finally, this attack provides yet another example of why the stockpiling of vulnerabilities by governments is such a problem. This is an emerging pattern in 2017. We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks, and now this vulnerability stolen from the NSA has affected customers around the world. Repeatedly, exploits in the hands of governments have leaked into the public domain and caused widespread damage. An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the U.S. military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen. And this most recent attack represents a completely unintended but disconcerting link between the two most serious forms of cybersecurity threats in the world today – nation-state action and organized criminal action.\nThe governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call. They need to take a different approach and adhere in cyberspace to the same rules applied to weapons in the physical world. We need governments to consider the damage to civilians that comes from hoarding these vulnerabilities and the use of these exploits. This is one reason we called in February for a new 'Digital Geneva Convention' to govern these issues, including a new requirement for governments to report vulnerabilities to vendors, rather than stockpile, sell, or exploit them.74 To be addressed, the question of the potential responsibility of the United States regarding WannaCry and NotPetya must be broken down into three sub-questions.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press DUTY TO DISCLOSE ZERO-DAY VULNERABILITIES The second sub-question concerns whether the behaviour of the United States constitutes a breach of its obligation of due diligence. In other words, whether the United States knowingly allowed the use of its territory for the perpetration of WannaCry – if we paraphrase the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.75 In the WannaCry situation, however, the territory of the United States was not used for the perpetration of the ransomware campaign. Consequently, the United States has not breached its obligation of due diligence regarding the use of its territory.\nFinally, the third sub-question concerns whether there might be a plurality of actors sharing the responsibility for WannaCry, including the United States, and this is addressed later in the book.76 This section demonstrated that neither the non-disclosure of a vulnerability nor the development of a related exploit by a State constitutes an internationally wrongful act.77 Similarly, in a situation in which a third party would use this vulnerability or exploit, this State could not be held responsible under international law. That being said, it is important to note that the approach of States on the disclosure of vulnerabilities is slowly evolving owing to the global pressure for more transparency following, inter alia, the Snowden revelations and more recently the leak of the NSA's hacking tool by the Shadow Brokers. Several States are indeed implementing Vulnerabilities Equities Processes (VEP) aimed at determining whether they should disclose zero-day vulnerabilities or keep them secret for potential future use.78 https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press CYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE ## 8.6 Concluding Remarks on Cyber Due Diligence The obligation of due diligence is an obligation of conduct, and not of result. States are under a duty to both prevent the use of cyber infrastructure and take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate cyber operations emanating from or transiting through the computer networks located on their territory. This duty does not include an obligation to monitor all Internet traffic within the computer networks on the territory of the State. Similarly, the duty of diligence can only be invoked during an ongoing unlawful action, such as a cyber operation.⁷⁹ In the same tenor as *ad impossibilia nemo tenetur*, or ‘nobody is held to the impossible’, the measures adopted by the territorial State must be assessed in light of the test of reasonableness and feasibility. They must not represent an overly onerous burden on the State. Thus, the measures must be commensurate with its capacity, which may differ from State to State. The State is free to choose the measures to be implemented, which can take various forms including being of a technical, political or legal nature.⁸⁰ The duty of diligence cannot impose a duty to enact specific legislation as this would then shift from an obligation of conduct to an obligation of result.⁸¹ It may, however, constitute a strong incentive to integrate some specific legislative measures into the domestic legal order for the purposes of compliance.\nIn a limited number of cases, the victim State of the cyber operation would be entitled to invoke the responsibility of the territorial State for not complying with its duty of diligence, and even to compel the territorial State to take appropriate measures.⁸² Part I was dedicated to the question of attribution. Due diligence may constitute an interesting palliative to the problem of attribution.⁸³ Most cyber operations that have taken place are almost impossible to attribute to a State or other actor with any certainty. In several cases, the victim State will have a strong suspicion that one or more States are responsible (Lawfare, 15 November 2017) www.lawfareblog.com/its-time-international-community-get-serious-about-vulnerability-equities.\n⁷⁹ Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 75.\n⁸⁰ Ziolkowski (n 23) 169.\n⁸¹ Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 33–35.\n⁸² Part III of this book deals specifically with State responsibility and measures of self-help to be taken by the victim State against the responsible State; see *infra* Chapter 9 and Chapter 10.\n⁸³ In this perspective, see the interesting discussion on the relationship between State sovereignty and due diligence regarding international security in Kulesza (n 1) 276 et seq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press CONCLUDING REMARKS https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press"

States are under a duty to both prevent the use of cyber infrastructure and take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate cyber operations emanating from or transiting through the computer networks located on their territory. This duty does not include an obligation to monitor all Internet traffic within the computer networks on the territory of the State. Similarly, the duty of diligence can only be invoked during an ongoing unlawful action, such as a cyber operation.⁷⁹\nIn the same tenor as *ad impossibilia nemo tenetur*, or ‘nobody is held to the impossible’, the measures adopted by the territorial State must be assessed in light of the test of reasonableness and feasibility. They must not represent an overly onerous burden on the State. Thus, the measures must be commensurate with its capacity, which may differ from State to State. The State is free to choose the measures to be implemented, which can take various forms including being of a technical, political or legal nature.⁸⁰ The duty of diligence cannot impose a duty to enact specific legislation as this would then shift from an obligation of conduct to an obligation of result.⁸¹ It may, however, constitute a strong incentive to integrate some specific legislative measures into the domestic legal order for the purposes of compliance.\nIn a limited number of cases, the victim State of the cyber operation would be entitled to invoke the responsibility of the territorial State for not complying with its duty of diligence, and even to compel the territorial State to take appropriate measures.⁸²\nPart I was dedicated to the question of attribution. Due diligence may constitute an interesting palliative to the problem of attribution.⁸³ Most cyber operations that have taken place are almost impossible to attribute to a State or other actor with any certainty. In several cases, the victim State will have a strong suspicion that one or more States are responsible\n(Lawfare, 15 November 2017) www.lawfareblog.com/its-time-international-community-get-serious-about-vulnerability-equities.\n⁷⁹ Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 75.\n⁸⁰ Ziolkowski (n 23) 169.\n⁸¹ Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 33–35.\n⁸² Part III of this book deals specifically with State responsibility and measures of self-help to be taken by the victim State against the responsible State; see *infra* Chapter 9 and Chapter 10.\n⁸³ In this perspective, see the interesting discussion on the relationship between State sovereignty and due diligence regarding international security in Kulesza (n 1) 276 et seq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n375\nfor the cyber operation; however, often it will not have any definitive material proof to support such allegations. In some cases, if the victim State is able to prove that the cyber operation was launched from or transited through the territory of a State, then it could thus invoke the territorial State's responsibility for the non-fulfilment of its obligation of due diligence. This would offer a basis for the victim State to invoke the responsibility of and take measures against the State that is allegedly responsible. The remedies and measures to be taken by the victim State against the responsible State must be proportionate and necessary. Clearly, they will be of less intensity in cases involving the non-fulfilment of due diligence than in cases involving a definitive attribution of an unlawful cyber operation.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

This right has as corollary a duty: the obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States, in particular their\n\n¹ On the principle of due diligence, see, generally: the seminal work of Joanna Kulesza, *Due Diligence in International Law* (Brill &amp; Martinus Nijhoff Publishers 2016); Riccardo Pisillo Mazzeschi, *‘Due diligence’ e responsabilità internazionale degli stati* (Giuffrè 1989).

As mentioned, the obligation of due diligence developed in various branches of international law, but the notion is also used to describe other forms of legal or political obligations, within and outside the realm of international law. Broadly, due diligence is understood as a standard of conduct required to discharge an obligation. In other words, due diligence is often referred to as representing a certain standard of conduct that should be observed by States or other actors in performing particular acts or regarding specific obligations. The recent discussion in the European Journal of International Law on the ‘human rights due diligence’ in the 2011 United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights perfectly highlights the risk of confusion between the various dimensions of due diligence, and notably the ongoing debate on the due diligence of both private and public actors.¹⁹ The development of ICT technologies also raises the question of the due diligence obligations of both public and private actors. Alongside the obligation for a State not to allow knowingly its ICT infrastructure to be used for malicious acts, there are also the questions, for instance, of the duties of private companies not to let their ICT infrastructure be used for such acts and to avoid releasing software flawed with vulnerabilities.²⁰ The private sector’s due diligence is outside the scope of this book. Consequently, it seems necessary to clarify that the present chapter focuses exclusively on due diligence understood as ‘every State’s obligation not to\n\n¹⁶ Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

International law is primarily the law of States and it cannot generally be enforced directly upon non-state actors. The principle of due diligence renders a State responsible or liable for the occurrence of acts of other actors, including non-state actors, perpetrated in its territory or jurisdiction in some specific circumstances. This is the sense of the sixth norm of the 'Singapore Norm Package' adopted by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) in November 2018:\n\nNon-state actors should not engage in offensive cyber operations and state actors should prevent and respond to such activities if they occur.²⁵\n\n²¹ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22.\n\n²² Karine Bannelier-Christakis, 'Obligations de diligence dans le cyberespace: qui a peur de la cyber-diligence?'

    "CYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\n\nThis norm is built on and interprets the international law principle of due diligence in the specific context of cyber operations conducted by non-state actors. The GCSC demonstrates here how this principle is relevant to regulating such a situation, emphasising in the commentary to the norm that ‘[i]f states permit such action, they may therefore be held responsible under international law. States must act, domestically and internationally, to prevent offensive cyber operations by non-state actors.’²⁶\n\nThe UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security integrated cyber due diligence into its 2013 report as a norm of behaviour, and again in its 2015 report. The report stated that ‘States should seek to ensure that their territories are not used by non-State actors for unlawful use of ICTs’.²⁷\n\nSimilarly, the experts involved in the Tallinn Manual process agreed on the application of the principle of due diligence. In the Tallinn Manual 1.0, Rule 5²⁸ dealt with the principle of due diligence, and the commentary makes clear that the experts disagreed on the particular features of this principle.²⁹ In the Tallinn Manual 2.0,³⁰ Rule 6 rephrases\n\n²⁶ ibid 19 (footnote omitted).\n\n²⁷ UNGA, ‘Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ (24 June 2013) UN Doc A/68/98, para 23.

Some States are reluctant to extend this principle to cyberspace because of the corresponding obligations it would impose on them.[33] Moreover, another difficulty arises concerning the distinction between States from which the cyber operation is launched and States of transit, that is to say States through which the cyber operation is routed. The present chapter asserts that the principle of due diligence is applicable to cyber operations, and analyses how it applies and what the corresponding obligations that it imposes on States are. The duty of cyber due diligence may be seen as a coin with two faces; on the one side, there is the duty to prevent the use of the ICT infrastructure (8.1), and on the other, there is the obligation to take measures to terminate a cyber operation that has been detected (8.3). This chapter also analyses whether the invocation of the principle of due diligence is subject to a threshold of harm (8.2). Moreover, this chapter investigates two possible variations of due diligence regarding cyber operations, that may be developed in the future: the creation of a duty to (i) prevent the potential transboundary harm caused by cyber operations (8.4) and (ii) disclose zero-day vulnerabilities (8.5).\n\n## 8.1 Does a Duty to Prevent Any Use of State Cyber Infrastructures Exist?\n\nDoes a State have a general duty to prevent any use of its cyber infrastructure for the perpetration by another State, or by non-state actors, of a cyber operation against another State?

The next section demonstrates why the question should be answered negatively.\n\n## 8.1.2 The Slippery Slope of Justifying Mass Surveillance\n\nA general duty to know what is happening in the computer networks of a State may be understood as implying mass and indiscriminate surveillance of these networks by the State. Thus, such a duty would serve as a justification for mass surveillance. Not only does it risk a slippery slope in terms of civil liberties and human rights, but it would also be of limited relevance for the duty of diligence, as detailed below.\n\nThe mass surveillance programme of the NSA was, at its best, able to monitor 75 per cent of US Internet traffic.³⁷ Thus, it was not able to monitor all the traffic emanating or transiting through the State. Even if it was possible to monitor all the Internet traffic, the treatment of the monitored data would necessitate too much work to be relevant or even attainable. Indeed, in the case of the mass-surveillance programme, the objective is generally to filter specific communications or the use of specific words, i.e. there is something to look for. In the case of cyber operations, they can take a wide variety of forms and it would be almost impossible to identify specific filters that would allow them to be detected. Monitoring the metadata would not suffice. It would be necessary to undertake a deep inspection of each packet of data to determine its real content and the purpose of this content. Moreover, it is not very difficult to embed a malicious code into another code of legitimate software; therefore, it would be necessary to be able to distinguish which part of the code belongs to the malware. The perpetrators would also sooner or later understand how the filters operate and would be able to adapt the structure of their malicious code to address the new situation, therefore always managing to find cracks in the system and to exploit\n\n³⁶ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 32–33, commentary to Rule 6, paras 8–10.\n\n³⁷ Jennifer Valentino-Devries and Siobhan Gorman, ‘New Details Show Broader NSA Surveillance Reach: Programs Cover 75% of Nation’s Traffic, Can Snare Emails’, Wall Street Journal (20 August 2013) www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324108204579022874091732470.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

From this perspective, it can be noted that States having mass surveillance programmes, such as the United States, are still unable to prevent cyber operations from entering their networks and damaging their cyber infrastructure. On top of all these difficulties and as a final remark, most cyber operations take place within very short lapses of time, often only a few seconds. By extension, this means that monitoring and identifications processes have to take place within a very short timeframe.³⁸ This is almost unachievable, given the current state of technology. Because the objective is to prevent the transit of a cyber operation in a State infrastructure, the response must take place at the same time as the identification. Perhaps technological evolution, which is unfolding rapidly in the cyber realm, will be able to offer us new solutions to these difficulties which can improve the technical appropriateness and abilities of such monitoring techniques (for instance the development of artificial intelligence).³⁹ Irrespective of these new developments, the legal problems that they trigger would not change. In addition to this, as noted by Michael N Schmitt, '[t]here appears to be an emerging consensus among scholars and state legal advisers against the existence of obligations either to monitor cyber activities on one's territory or to prevent malicious use of cyber infrastructure located within one's borders'.⁴⁰ I believe that all these reasons demonstrate the irrelevance of implementing mass monitoring in the cyber infrastructures of a State for the purposes of due diligence.\n\nOne may argue that the surveillance activities of a State are limited by international law, human rights law and domestic law,⁴¹ which would limit the possible negative consequences. Yet, taking this approach would be a very slippery slope with almost no value in preventing cyber threats from using the computer networks of a State.\n\nAs often noted already, the duty of diligence is only an obligation of conduct and not of result. Nonetheless, a requirement to monitor Internet traffic would then transform into a justification for mass-surveillance programmes without actually making much contribution to fulfilling this duty.

Thus, such an obligation would be considered unreasonable.\n\nThe situation may differ if such monitoring capacities already exist. In such cases, does the State with monitoring capacities have an obligation to use them in order to comply with its due diligence obligations? The short answer is yes. The State has an obligation to use any means at its disposal to comply with its due diligence duty. Thus, the duty of diligence does not oblige the State to implement a monitoring programme for Internet traffic, but when such capacities already exist, then the State has to use them. The content of the duty of diligence depends on the capacity of each State. The ILA's first report on due diligence highlighted this point in regard to due diligence in human rights law and international environmental law.⁴² It stressed that it was necessary to differentiate between the treatment of developed States and that of developing ones, as they may not have the same capacity to control and to comply with their due diligence duty. Similarly, in cyberspace not all States are equal and some may be better equipped to comply with their obligations than others,⁴³ in particular those where a mass-surveillance programme already exists and therefore may be used to monitor cyber activities. The burden of the duty of diligence must be reasonable, however. It cannot exceed the State's capacity.\n\nIn sum, the duty of diligence does not impose a duty on States to monitor the Internet traffic of cyber infrastructures located on their territory,⁴⁴ nor to develop the necessary technologies to perform such monitoring. In the case of a State having already developed the capabilities to conduct such monitoring programmes, to comply with the obligation of diligence this State would have to use these capabilities. It must be highlighted that such situation does not legitimate nor preclude the potential wrongfulness of such capabilities under domestic or international laws.\n\n## 8.1.3 The Difference between Cyber Operations Launched from or Solely Transiting through the Territory of the State\n\nIt is impossible to completely separate cyber operations from the physical world. A cyber operation that is simply transiting through the territory of\n\n⁴² ILA Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law – First Report (n 1) respectively 18 and 27.\n⁴³ Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 74–75.\n⁴⁴ For a similar view, see Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 43–46, commentary to Rule 7, paras 3–13.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "THE ABSENCE OF A THRESHOLD OF HARM\n\na State only requires electronic impulses via cables and devices, and this transit lasts less than a second in most cases. Conversely, the launch of a cyber operation from the territory of a State would take more than just a few electronic impulses. It would also integrate a physical dimension in most cases. Two situations should be distinguished from one another: firstly, the launch of a cyber operation via a cyber infrastructure that is remotely under the control of the perpetrator; secondly, the launch of a cyber operation from the territory of a State.\n\nA cyber operation can be launched via a cyber infrastructure located on the territory of one State, but be infected and controlled by the perpetrators located in another. This is, for instance, the case with bots, also known as 'zombified' computers, which are used to perpetrate DDoS attacks. The perpetrators of a DDoS attack targeting State A may be located in State B, using a botnet of 'zombified' computers located in States X, Y and Z. In this situation, what obligation arises in terms of due diligence of States X, Y and Z? Here again, they have no obligation to monitor their Internet traffic nor to know of all events and activities happening in the cyber infrastructure on their territory. The situation may be different if, as we will see in the next section, they know or should know about the malicious use of the controlled infrastructures on their territory.\n\nIn the case of a cyber operation launched directly from the territory of a State, for example by an organised group located on its territory, the duty of diligence applies. The territorial State has, in such cases, means other than solely cyber ones to make itself aware of such use. In the case of highly sophisticated cyber operations, the preparatory phases often involve physical input that may be detectable by the State. For instance, it may be visible that something is under preparation or already happening owing to an increase in activity of a specific group already under scrutiny by the State.\n\nI will come back to the distinction between State of transit and State of launch, and the consequences of this distinction for the application of the principle of due diligence to cyber operations, in the third section (8.3).\n\n## 8.2 The Absence of a Threshold of Harm\n\nThe experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 condition the applicability of the principle of due diligence to two cumulative requirements: firstly, the cyber operation concerned must be 'contrary to the rights' of the affected\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "CYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\n\nState under international law; and, secondly, it must have ‘serious adverse consequences’.⁴⁵ Moreover, they also ‘concurred that the due diligence principle extends to cyber operations conducted by non-State actors that, while not violating international law per se, nevertheless result in serious adverse consequences and [...] affect the right of the target State’.⁴⁶ In addition, they note that the threshold of harm does not depend on the occurrence of ‘physical damage to objects or injuries to individuals’.⁴⁷\n\nThe first requirement derives directly from the dictum of the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case,⁴⁸ and does not raise any specific issue. The second requirement, the threshold of harm, may be more controversial. The commentary to Rule 6 states that:\n\nThe precise threshold of harm at which the due diligence principle applies is unsettled in international law. All of the Experts agreed that the due diligence requirement arises when the situation involves a cyber operation that results in ‘serious adverse consequences’, although they could identify no bright line threshold for the identification of such consequences. They adopted this standard by analogy from application of the due diligence principle in the context of international environmental law. Some of them supported a lower threshold of application for the Rule, for instance, by proposing the term ‘significant’ or ‘substantial’ in lieu of ‘serious’.⁴⁹\n\nIndeed, in the Trail Smelter arbitral award, the court held that under the principles of international law, as well as of the law of the United States:\n\nno State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein, when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is established by clear and convincing evidence.⁵⁰\n\nThus, this arbitral award recognised the existence of a threshold of harm regarding the application of the principle of due diligence in preventing transboundary environmental harm.⁵¹ On this basis, the experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 assert that a similar standard exists regarding cyber operations.\n\n⁴⁵ ibid 34, commentary to Rule 6, para 15.\n⁴⁶ ibid 35, commentary to Rule 6, para 21.\n⁴⁷ ibid 37–38, commentary to Rule 6, para 28.\n⁴⁸ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22.\n⁴⁹ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 36–37, commentary to Rule 6, para 25 (footnotes omitted).\n⁵⁰ Trail Smelter case (United States, Canada) (n 8) 1965.\n⁵¹ See generally Kulesza (n 1) 91–105.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "THE ABSENCE OF A THRESHOLD OF HARM\n\nFurther on the experts clarified their idea, as they agreed that ‘merely affecting the interests of the target State, as in the case of causing inconvenience, minor disruption, or negligible expense, is not the type of harm envisaged; thus, not every use of a State’s territory that produces negative effects for a target State implicates the due diligence principle’.⁵²\n\nI am not convinced that such requirement of a threshold of harm is part of the customary principle of due diligence, and thus of the *lex lata* applicable to cyber operations. In my view, the assessment of the intensity of the cyber operations concerned does not condition whether the State has the possibility of invoking the obligation of due diligence of the territorial State from the perspective of international law. Conversely, it may condition whether the State will actually invoke the obligation of due diligence of the territorial State. It is thus not a legal requirement, but a requirement regarding the opportunity for the State to invoke this principle, or not. More precisely, the occurrence of a damage or harm is not a necessary element of the principle of due diligence.⁵³ According to the principle, States must exercise due diligence in ensuring that territory and objects over which they enjoy sovereignty are not to be used to harm other States. This principle does not require that an actual harm or damage occurs; on the contrary, it relies on the potential damage or harm that may be suffered by the other States. Even if this damage or harm never materialises, the State still has to comply with its duty of diligence. Consequently, the second requirement of ‘serious adverse consequences’ does not seem to flow from general international law nor does it seem justified.\n\nIn that perspective, my analysis of the threshold of harm for the principle of due diligence asserted by the *Tallinn Manual 2.0* is similar to the one I have already made regarding the same proposed threshold for the qualification of the violation of territorial sovereignty.⁵⁴\n\nTo conclude, it seems that the general customary principle of due diligence does not involve a threshold of harm. However, such threshold has already been identified in specific dimensions of the principle of due diligence, as for instance regarding transboundary environmental harm,\n\n⁵² Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 37, commentary to Rule 6, para 26.\n\n⁵³ More generally, the occurrence of a damage is not a necessary element of an internationally wrongful act; see: ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (2001) 2 Yearbook of the International Law Commission (Part II) 31, 92, commentary to Article 21, para 6; James Crawford, *State Responsibility: The General Part* (CUP 2013) 54et seq.\n\n⁵⁴ See supra 5.3.2.2B The Absence of a Damage Requirement.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "CYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\n\nand may translate into other dimensions in the future, including cyber operations. Indeed, it is important to distinguish the recourse to the principle of due diligence to establish, on the one hand, the responsibility of a State for not having complied with its due diligence obligations, from, on the other, the liability of a State for a significant transboundary harm. In the first case, which was developed in the present section, there is not a threshold of harm, while in the second case, which is developed later, in Section 8.4, such a threshold exists.\n\n## 8.3 The Duty of a State to Take Measures to Terminate an Unlawful Cyber Operation Using Its Infrastructure\n\nAnother principal component of the principle of due diligence is the obligation for a State that is aware of an unlawful cyber operation – which is using its cyber infrastructure – to take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate the operation.^[55]^ The resulting obligation has three dimensions: firstly, knowledge of the cyber operation by the territorial State (8.2.1); secondly, balancing the feasibility and reasonableness of the measures that should be taken (8.2.2); and finally, the distinction between cyber operations merely transiting via the State and those emanating from the territory of the State (8.2.3).\n\n## 8.3.1 Knowledge of the Territorial State\n\nAs a prerequisite, the territorial State has to be aware that a cyber operation is using its cyber infrastructure. Two situations should be distinguished from one another. Firstly, the victim State of a cyber operation has to notify the territorial State and ask it to take measures to terminate it. In such cases, there is no doubt that the territorial State is aware of the cyber operation and thus is obliged to take all feasible and reasonable measures against it. Secondly, the territorial State may also know about it even in the absence of notification by the victim State. In such circumstances, the burden of proof that the territorial State knows or should have known about the cyber operation is on the victim State. There is no transfer of the burden of proof as the territorial State has no\n\n^[55] Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 43, Rule 7; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 37; Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 72–75.

    "THE DUTY TO TAKE MEASURES TO TERMINATE THE ACT 367\n\nobligation to have absolute knowledge of everything taking place on its territory.⁵⁶ When a State has actual knowledge, then it is without a shadow of a doubt bound by the duty of diligence.⁵⁷\n\nIs constructive knowledge sufficient? In other words, is the fact that a State should have known about the cyber operation enough? The experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 ‘agreed that knowledge encompasses constructive knowledge for the purpose of [Rule 6]’.⁵⁸ On the one hand, the territorial State ‘cannot evade such a request by limiting itself to a reply that it is ignorant of the circumstances of the act and of its authors. The State may, up to a certain point, be bound to supply particulars of the use made by it of the means of information and inquiry at its disposal.’⁵⁹ On the other, the standard of proof would be very high for the State invoking its responsibility to prove that the territorial State should have known. Ultimately, the State invoking non-compliance with the duty of diligence would have to prove that the territorial State actually knew, rather than should have known.\n\n## 8.3.2 Measures to Terminate the Cyber Operation\n\nA State that knows its territory is being used for the perpetration of an unlawful cyber operation must take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate it.⁶⁰ As an obligation of conduct and not of result, the State is expected to undertake its ‘best efforts’ to terminate the cyber operation, but would not bear responsibility only because it failed to terminate it.⁶¹ Conversely, if the State did not use all means at its disposal, and did not take all feasible and reasonable measures, it would not have fulfilled its obligation under the duty of diligence.\n\nIn a number of cases, the speed of cyber operations may render the principle of due diligence almost inapplicable. Some cyber operations only take milliseconds to launch, transit and produce effects, and thus the\n\n⁵⁶ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 18.\n⁵⁷ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 40, commentary to Rule 6, para 37; Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 28–29.\n⁵⁸ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 41, commentary to Rule 6, para 39.

    "CYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\n\nterritorial State would not have enough time to identify them and respond accordingly.⁶² Already in the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ highlighted the significance of the time dimension.⁶³ An instantaneous reaction is not expected from the territorial State, which must have enough time to be made aware and react. The speed of certain cyber operations renders reaction even more complicated. This is, however, not true of all cyber operations. Some have a continuous character, at least for some of the time. DDoS attacks, for instance, need to take place over a period of time to be effective. Similarly, complex cyber operations, such as Stuxnet, last for several years, during which time they may continuously communicate with their perpetrator and thus use cyber infrastructures located in various countries, for example remotely controlled servers. In such cases, the duty of diligence is particularly relevant. In the case of an ongoing DDoS attack, for instance, the victim State may make a request to the States in which the zombified computers and controlling servers are located to take action against them. It may not halt the DDoS attack but it may diminish its scale and effects.\n\n## 8.3.3 Distinction between State of Transit and State of Launch\n\nDoes the duty of diligence apply to cyber operations that are only transiting through the territory of a State? In other words, does the territorial State have an obligation to take measures to terminate the transit of a cyber operation via the computer networks located on its territory? The experts taking part in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 consider that the obligation of due diligence also applies to the transit State, which must act accordingly ‘when it (1) possesses knowledge [...] of an offending operation that reaches the requisite threshold of harm and (2) can take feasible measures to effectively terminate it’.⁶⁴ Karine Bannelier-Christakis rightly highlights that ‘there is no legal reason to consider that transit States do not have a duty of diligence’.⁶⁵ The State of transit has, in theory, the obligation under the duty of diligence to take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate the transit of a cyber operation via the computer networks located on its territory.\n\n⁶² Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 28.\n⁶³ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 2) 22–23.\n⁶⁴ Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 33, commentary to Rule 6, para 13.\n⁶⁵ Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 27.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "DUTY TO PREVENT SIGNIFICANT TRANSBOUNDARY HARM 369\n\nThe technical reality is an important limitation to this duty.⁶⁶ The Internet has been conceived in a way that the packets should arrive at their destination even if the path they use is no longer available. If the paths used by the packets to reach their target is not available, they will use another one. Although this reality makes the duty to terminate the transit difficult to implement, it is not impossible. Implementation would probably slow down or even temporarily block the perpetration of a cyber operation, or diminish the scale of a DDoS attack, but it would never constitute a panacea.\n\nThe balancing of reasonableness is important in such cases. For instance, it appears unreasonable to expect the transit State to shut down all Internet traffic transiting via its territory in order to end a cyber operation. What should be expected from the State is not its shut-down, but rather the implementation of filters capable of blocking specific packets that embed malicious code from transiting through their networks when they are aware of it. Again, the speed of most cyber operations may render this operation irrelevant, as the time needed to implement these filters may exceed the length of the actual cyber operation.\n\nIn short, the duty of diligence extends to the State of transit, but the technical reality of the operations of computer networks and the transit of cyber operations render such duty almost impossible to implement. This reality does not prevent the transit State from taking measures, if possible, nor does it excuse its inaction.\n\n## 8.4 Toward a Duty to Prevent the Potential Significant Transboundary Harm Caused by Cyber Operations\n\nA State may be held responsible for a cyber operation that is attributable to it and constitutes an internationally wrongful act. Due diligence is a subsidiary principle to State responsibility according to which a State may be held responsible for the occurrence of a cyber operation, without being responsible for the cyber operation itself. More recently, this principle has also served as a basis for the development of a regime of State liability for the consequences of acts that are not prohibited under\n\n⁶⁶ See also Schmitt and Vihul (n 22) 34, commentary to Rule 6, para 14.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "CYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\n\ninternational law. Such a regime of liability has found fertile ground in international space law⁶⁷ and international environmental law.\n\nIn international environmental law, States have an obligation to prevent the use of their territory for activities causing injury or damage in the territory of another State as well as a duty to prevent transboundary harm from hazardous activities. The first obligation was introduced in the Trail Smelter arbitration. In this case, the aerial pollution of a Canadian smelter located near the border with the United States damaged trees and crops located in American territory. The Tribunal noted that:\n\nunder the principles of international law, as well as of the law of the United States, no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein, when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is established by clear and convincing evidence.⁶⁸\n\nThe ILC also worked on the question of the consequences of transboundary harms resulting from an act not prohibited under international law, and ultimately adopted the ‘Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities’ in 2001⁶⁹ and the ‘Draft Principles on the Allocation of Loss in the Case of Transboundary Harm Arising out of Hazardous Activities’ in 2006.⁷⁰\n\nThe duty of diligence stipulated in international environmental law or international space law cannot be transposed directly to the cyber realm given that the situations are different. It shows, however, some interesting paths that could be taken in order to develop a similar duty of diligence regarding cyber activities. WannaCry and NotPetya may constitute at the maximum breaches of the territorial sovereignty of the targeted States.⁷¹\n\n⁶⁷ Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (adopted on 29 March 1972, entered into force on 1 September 1972) 961 UNTS 187, 24 UST 2389, 10 ILM 965 (1971).\n\n⁶⁸ Trail Smelter case (United States, Canada) (n 8), 1965.\n\n⁶⁹ ‘Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities’ (adopted by the Commission at its fifty-third session, in 2001, and submitted to the General Assembly as a part of the Commission’s report covering the work of that session (A/56/10)).\n\n⁷⁰ ‘Draft Principles on the Allocation of Loss in the Case of Transboundary Harm Arising out of Hazardous Activities’ (adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-eighth session, in 2006, and submitted to the General Assembly as a part of the Commission’s report covering the work of that session (A/61/10)).\n\n⁷¹ See supra 230–232.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "DUTY TO DISCLOSE ZERO-DAY VULNERABILITIES\n371\n\nYet, they resulted in massive economic loss for numerous companies in several States. We may wonder whether a specific regime could develop under international law to cover such losses. In such cases, the obligation of the perpetrating State would be twofold. Firstly, it would be responsible for internationally wrongful acts it committed, for instance the breach of the territorial sovereignty of the victim States. Secondly, it would be held liable for the harm and damage resulting from its cyber operations. Moreover, such regime could also be applied in cases in which the cyber operations concerned were not amounting to an internationally wrongful act. In such case, the responsibility of the perpetrating State could not be invoked, but the State could be held liable for the resulting harm and damage. It must be recalled that such principle has not yet been clearly created regarding cybersecurity and cyber operations, and thus the assertions made in this paragraph are purely hypothetical.\n\nIf such duty to prevent transboundary harm caused by cyber operations was to be recognised, it would be conditioned to a threshold of harm. Indeed, a State would be liable only when the transboundary harm was of a certain significance, as is the case in international environmental law.\n\nThe recognition of such a principle of liability regarding the consequences of cyber operations could also contribute to the creation and strengthening of a global culture of cybersecurity. Indeed, it might prompt States to be more cautious about, and careful when, conducting cyber operations, notably regarding the potential for the involuntary spread of malware and side effects of these operations. The recognition of such a principle of liability for the transboundary harm caused by cyber operations currently remains a highly hypothetical scenario, which can only be confirmed by State practice.\n\n## 8.5 Toward a Duty to Disclose Zero-Day Vulnerabilities\n\nThe WannaCry case leads to two distinct questions regarding State responsibility. Firstly, some States have publicly attributed WannaCry to North Korea, and they could thus have invoked the responsibility of North Korea under international law, if they consider WannaCry to be an internationally wrongful act.72\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "CYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\n\nThe second question on responsibility departs from the traditional approach of the law on State responsibility: is the United States responsible for not having informed Microsoft of the existence of a vulnerability in their product and for having created the exploit later used by WannaCry?\n\nThe Russian President Vladimir Putin stated about WannaCry that '[a]s regards the source of these threats, I believe that the leadership of Microsoft have announced this plainly, that the initial source of the virus is the intelligence services of the United States'.73\n\nIn a similar vein, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, declared in a statement on Microsoft's blog:\n\nFinally, this attack provides yet another example of why the stockpiling of vulnerabilities by governments is such a problem. This is an emerging pattern in 2017. We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks, and now this vulnerability stolen from the NSA has affected customers around the world. Repeatedly, exploits in the hands of governments have leaked into the public domain and caused widespread damage. An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the U.S. military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen. And this most recent attack represents a completely unintended but disconcerting link between the two most serious forms of cybersecurity threats in the world today – nation-state action and organized criminal action.\n\nThe governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call. They need to take a different approach and adhere in cyberspace to the same rules applied to weapons in the physical world. We need governments to consider the damage to civilians that comes from hoarding these vulnerabilities and the use of these exploits. This is one reason we called in February for a new 'Digital Geneva Convention' to govern these issues, including a new requirement for governments to report vulnerabilities to vendors, rather than stockpile, sell, or exploit them.74\n\nTo be addressed, the question of the potential responsibility of the United States regarding WannaCry and NotPetya must be broken down into three sub-questions.\n\n73 Macarena Vidal Liy, 'Putin culpa a los servicios secretos de EE UU por el virus \"WannaCry\" que desencadenó el ciberataque mundial', *El País* (Madrid, 15 May 2017) https://elpais.com/internacional/2017/05/15/actualidad/1494855826_022843.html; 'Putin Warns of Risks of Governments Creating Hacking Tools', *Reuters* (15 May 2017) www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attacks-putin-idUSKCN18B15Y..\n74 Brad Smith, 'The Need for Urgent Collective Action to Keep People Safe Online: Lessons from Last Week's Cyberattack' (Microsoft On the Issues, 14 May 2017) https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/05/14/need-urgent-collective-action-keep-people-safe-online-lessons-last-weeks-cyberattack/.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "DUTY TO DISCLOSE ZERO-DAY VULNERABILITIES\n373\n\nThe first sub-question concerns whether the paternity of the NSA over EternalBlue and DoublePulsar is enough to attribute WannaCry to the United States. The answer is indubitably no. The fact that an actor, including a State, uses a tool produced by another State is not enough to attribute the consequences of that use to the latter State. Indeed, it does not create a sufficient subordination nexus, if any, between the concerned State and the perpetrator.\n\nThe second sub-question concerns whether the behaviour of the United States constitutes a breach of its obligation of due diligence. In other words, whether the United States knowingly allowed the use of its territory for the perpetration of WannaCry – if we paraphrase the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.75 In the WannaCry situation, however, the territory of the United States was not used for the perpetration of the ransomware campaign. Consequently, the United States has not breached its obligation of due diligence regarding the use of its territory.\n\nFinally, the third sub-question concerns whether there might be a plurality of actors sharing the responsibility for WannaCry, including the United States, and this is addressed later in the book.76\n\nThis section demonstrated that neither the non-disclosure of a vulnerability nor the development of a related exploit by a State constitutes an internationally wrongful act.77 Similarly, in a situation in which a third party would use this vulnerability or exploit, this State could not be held responsible under international law. That being said, it is important to note that the approach of States on the disclosure of vulnerabilities is slowly evolving owing to the global pressure for more transparency following, inter alia, the Snowden revelations and more recently the leak of the NSA's hacking tool by the Shadow Brokers.

    "CYBER OPERATIONS AND DUE DILIGENCE\n\n## 8.6 Concluding Remarks on Cyber Due Diligence\n\nThe obligation of due diligence is an obligation of conduct, and not of result. States are under a duty to both prevent the use of cyber infrastructure and take all feasible and reasonable measures to terminate cyber operations emanating from or transiting through the computer networks located on their territory. This duty does not include an obligation to monitor all Internet traffic within the computer networks on the territory of the State. Similarly, the duty of diligence can only be invoked during an ongoing unlawful action, such as a cyber operation.⁷⁹\n\nIn the same tenor as *ad impossibilia nemo tenetur*, or ‘nobody is held to the impossible’, the measures adopted by the territorial State must be assessed in light of the test of reasonableness and feasibility. They must not represent an overly onerous burden on the State. Thus, the measures must be commensurate with its capacity, which may differ from State to State. The State is free to choose the measures to be implemented, which can take various forms including being of a technical, political or legal nature.⁸⁰ The duty of diligence cannot impose a duty to enact specific legislation as this would then shift from an obligation of conduct to an obligation of result.⁸¹ It may, however, constitute a strong incentive to integrate some specific legislative measures into the domestic legal order for the purposes of compliance.\n\nIn a limited number of cases, the victim State of the cyber operation would be entitled to invoke the responsibility of the territorial State for not complying with its duty of diligence, and even to compel the territorial State to take appropriate measures.⁸²\n\nPart I was dedicated to the question of attribution. Due diligence may constitute an interesting palliative to the problem of attribution.⁸³ Most cyber operations that have taken place are almost impossible to attribute to a State or other actor with any certainty. In several cases, the victim State will have a strong suspicion that one or more States are responsible\n\n(Lawfare, 15 November 2017) www.lawfareblog.com/its-time-international-community-get-serious-about-vulnerability-equities.\n\n⁷⁹ Schmitt, ‘Due Diligence in Cyberspace’ (n 22) 75.\n⁸⁰ Ziolkowski (n 23) 169.\n⁸¹ Bannelier-Christakis (n 9) 33–35.\n⁸² Part III of this book deals specifically with State responsibility and measures of self-help to be taken by the victim State against the responsible State; see *infra* Chapter 9 and Chapter 10.\n⁸³ In this perspective, see the interesting discussion on the relationship between State sovereignty and due diligence regarding international security in Kulesza (n 1) 276 et seq.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "CONCLUDING REMARKS\n375\n\nfor the cyber operation; however, often it will not have any definitive material proof to support such allegations. In some cases, if the victim State is able to prove that the cyber operation was launched from or transited through the territory of a State, then it could thus invoke the territorial State's responsibility for the non-fulfilment of its obligation of due diligence. This would offer a basis for the victim State to invoke the responsibility of and take measures against the State that is allegedly responsible. The remedies and measures to be taken by the victim State against the responsible State must be proportionate and necessary. Clearly, they will be of less intensity in cases involving the non-fulfilment of due diligence than in cases involving a definitive attribution of an unlawful cyber operation.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
