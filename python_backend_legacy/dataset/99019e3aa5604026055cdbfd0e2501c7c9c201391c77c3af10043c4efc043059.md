There is also a growing consideration of vulnerabilities in the physical transportation infrastructure, which is comprised of a number of interlinking components that enable international trade in raw materials and consumer goods, known as commodity value chains. Through the use of scenario analysis and document analysis, this article investigates the feasibility and legal considerations of cyberattacks to target commodity value chains in order to further or protect national interests.\nKeywords: Commodity Value Chain, Critical Infrastructure Protection, Cyber-Operations, Economic Information Warfare (EIW), International Humanitarian Law (IHL)\n# Introduction\nThe focus of the cyber-security efforts appears to be on the power and financial systems. However, the physical transport infrastructure is often not considered; and, if it is, the scope is limited. However, all trade of commodities and products is conducted via this infrastructure. In particular, commodities can be seen to have global value chains with specific trade corridors, allowing the commodity market to be affected by targeting the supporting transport infrastructure. Therefore, cyber-operations that disrupt the physical transport infrastructure can have significant economic consequences for the victim. One example is the impact the NotPetya ransomware had on the shipping company Maersk. Maersk's global operations were disrupted, and the company is estimated to have lost between $250 million to $300 million (Cimpanu 2018).\nJournal of Information Warfare (2019) 18.2: 31-48\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nThis article aims to investigate the feasibility of cyber-operations against the physical transport infrastructure as an aspect of Economic Information Warfare. The article is conceptual, using hypothetical examples, documents, and logical discussion to illustrate the technical and legal considerations for Economic Information Warfare (EIW) to gain or protect competitive economic advantage based on commodity trade. The basis of the discussion revolves around the Cyber-Security Dilemma and Porter's Five Forces models; by combining these models and using hypothetical scenarios, the article proposes a categorisation scheme for strategic cyber-operations against commodities to influence international trade. The Tallinn Manuals on international law and cyber-operations (Schmitt 2013; Schmitt 2017) are used to provide a discussion on the legal considerations of the proposed framework.\nThis paper provides background on Information Warfare, Economic Information Warfare, the Cyber-Security Dilemma, and The Tallinn Manuals. The commodity value chain and relevant models are then introduced. The feasibility of disrupting commodity value chains through cyber-operations are discussed using analysis of hypothetical scenarios. The Tallinn Manuals are then used to provide a legal perspective for targeting the commodity chains. This is followed by a discussion and conclusion.\n## Background\n### Information Warfare\n'Information Warfare' (IW) is regarded as consisting of tactics, techniques, and procedures used in the information domain to gain an advantage over an adversary during a period of conflict or competition (Brazzoli 2007; Stupples 2015). The information domain can be comprised of physical, logical (or virtual), and cognitive components (Brazzoli 2007), and, therefore, can be comprised of cyber-operations as well as other forms of conflict, such as psychological operations (Brazzoli 2007; Stupples 2015). Defensive Information Warfare can be seen to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems to authorised entities. Information Warfare strategies to attack include destroying data, manipulating/corrupting data, stealing/exploiting data, denying or disrupting access to data, altering the perceptions of the target population towards the data, or changing the context in which the data is viewed (Hutchinson &amp; Warren 2001). Table 1, below, illustrates these Information Warfare concepts.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\n|   | Aspects of Secure Information  |   |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |   |  Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability  |\n|  Domains | Cognitive |  | Alter perception\nAlter context |   |\n|   |  Logical | Exploit | Manipulate\nCorrupt | Deny\nDisrupt  |\n|   |  Physical | Steal | Damage | Destroy  |\nTable 1: Offensive Information Warfare Techniques\n# Economic Information Warfare\nLambert (2017) contrasts two types of economic warfare:\n- the traditional blockade or bombing of factories, a slow attrition designed to degrade the economy and a nation's warfighting capacity; and\n- economic warfare that targets the societal psychology, as proposed by the British prior to the First World War, in which global sea communications would be disrupted.\nThe latter was attempted at the outbreak of World War I but failed after being abandoned a few months later due to resistance by the British's own businesses; the former blockade style was employed during World War II by the German U-boats and in the U.S. submarine campaign against the Japanese (Lambert 2017). Deakin (2003) considers a number of tactics that can be conducted as economic warfare, including\n- Affecting trade conditions;\n- Affecting market liquidity;\n- Denying market access (such as embargoes or blockades);\n- Degrading market efficiency (for example, resulting in slower delivery of goods or services);\n- Degrading supply chains;\n- Degrading foreign markets;\n- Exploiting, denying, or degrading supporting infrastructure;\n- Exploiting, denying, degrading, or corrupting economic information.\nThe descriptions by both Deakin (2003) and Lambert (2017) include measures that directly affect the ability to trade commodities and other materials; this concept is key to this paper. Lambert (2017) notes that globalisation has resulted in the almost-immediate fluctuation of commodity prices due to predictions of supply excess or deficiencies.\nAs reliance on information technologies and their role in globalisation increased, the concept of Economic Information Warfare as an aspect of Information Warfare closely related to cyber operations emerged. Economic Information Warfare is considered to be the activities to control, protect, and potentially disrupt economic activity through information and information systems (Chatterji 2008; Libicki 1995). Chatterji (2008) equates Economic Information Warfare with a version of economic blockade that would affect societies by restricting the flow of economic information.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nHowever, attacks on critical infrastructure can also have severe economic consequences (Caldeira et al. 2015).\nDeakin (2003) considers the relationship between protecting financial information systems from cyberattacks and national security. He concludes that there needs to be a redefinition of the term ‘national security’ (all that it means and encompasses) and that attacks resulting in the failure of critical financial systems could potentially be economically disastrous. Power grids are also potential targets that could have severe economic consequences if disrupted by cyber-operations. Lloyd’s and Centre for Risk Studies (2015) indicates that malware affecting 50 generators in the U.S. could potentially have an economic impact of $1 trillion. In 2015 and 2016, there were successful cyberattacks on the Ukrainian power grid, which caused a disruption in electricity supply (Patterson 2017). Power grids appear to attract more attacks: the U.S. ICS-CERT (c. 2017) shows that 17% of the investigated incidents affected the energy sector, 8% targeted the transportation sector, and 4% critical manufacturing.\nWheeler (2018) considers cyber warfare as having no rules; and with the growing prevalence of cyberattacks, there is an increased likelihood of strategic attacks against national economies. Cyber-operations that severely disrupt financial or power systems could be potentially devastating in terms of both the economic and societal implications. It is possible that such an attack would draw widespread condemnation and possibly military action in retaliation. Attacking commodity trade is ‘high-precision’ but more subtle, which would not be as broadly devastating. Such an attack is likely to fall short of sufficient grounds for military retaliation. Lambert (2017) cautions that the use of cyber-operations to cause economic effects could have the same result as the failed British economic warfare concept. (The parallel relies on the fact that sea communication was a developing concept at the time about which there was a lack of understanding, as is currently the case with cyber-security and cyber-operations.)\n## The Cyber-Security Dilemma\nThe Cyber-Security Dilemma is an evolution of the security dilemma or spiral model of international relations, which has been applied into the cyber-domain. Reuter (2011) considers the Cyber-Security Dilemma as measures taken by a nation to increase the security of its digital infrastructure, which then decreases the cyber-security of another country. He suggests that it is difficult to differentiate between offensive and defensive intentions in cyber-space, particularly because the techniques that are used are often very similar. Libicki (2016) suggests that the Cyber-Security Dilemma is not as prevalent as it appears to be; he considers most defensive actions in cyberspace are easily identified as such, except for the case of active defence. From an economics perspective, nations improving their cyber-security could benefit other states by reducing the number of staging points from which an attack may be launched.\nBuchanan (2017) provides an in-depth discussion of the Cyber-Security Dilemma. He indicates that there are legitimate defensive reasons to conduct network intrusions; at the same time, he concedes most nations would consider any intrusion into a sensitive network as threatening. While sensitive systems are considered, there is no explicit mention of cyber-physical systems, such as industrial control, in the considerations of the Cyber-Security Dilemma. In this context, the likelihood is that any penetration into these systems will be aggressive, as there is limited defensive val\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nue (in cyber-security terms) that an intruder can gain from affecting cyber-physical systems. There may, however, be economic reasons that make cyber-physical systems targets for intrusion, such as assessing the rate of manufacture or throughput of a product or attempting to discover industrial processes through cyber-espionage.\nFor the purposes of this paper, the concept that nations can take defensive actions which negatively affect the security of other nations is the one which will be considered. Later in the article, this concept will be modified and applied into an economic setting.\n## International cyber-operations and security frameworks\nInternational law has an important role regarding cyber-operations, especially when a cyber-operation is performed within the context of an international armed conflict (Boyle 2012). The Tallinn Manuals (Schmitt 2013; Schmitt 2017) provide in-depth non-binding analyses of applicability of existing international law to cyber-operations, including the areas of sovereignty, due diligence, jurisdiction, international responsibility, cyber-operations, and international human rights. These analyses were developed by international law experts to propose principles to govern cyber-warfare, including the elements of jus ad bellum (governing the use of force by a state as an instrument of its international policy), together with jus in bello (regulating the conduct of armed conflict). With the growing prevalence of cyberattacks, the concepts contained in The Tallinn Manuals have become of utmost interest.\nIn 2018, the Norm Package Singapore was developed by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) with the purpose of proposing best practices to safeguard a reliable Internet while recognising the interdependence of the global communities. It sought to prevent the consequences of any major disruption of the Internet and to promote ethical behaviour of all entities involved (GCSC 2018).\n## Commodity Value Chains\nThis section presents the basic principles that contribute towards the concept of commodity value chains, including Porter’s Five Forces Model.\n## The value chain\nThe value chain is considered to be a “system of interdependent activities, which are connected by linkages” (Porter &amp; Millar 1985). These activities can impact on each other’s effectiveness, and an optimised value-chain can be created by making trade-offs based on the various linkages.\nPorter and Millar (1985) consider the role of information and information technology in an organisation’s competitive advantage. In particular, the information and information technology impacts the linkages within the value chain. In addition to the greater speed at which traditionally information-related tasks can be performed, technology has improved the physical aspects of an organisation, particularly through improved automation, control, and monitoring of processes. In 1985, information technologies were considered to have increased rivalries, increased the threat of substitute products, and increased the power of buyers (Porter &amp; Millar 1985). This integration of information activities across businesses drove management information systems and enabled\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\ntraditional business processes and management activities (Laudon &amp; Laudon 2014), as is illustrated in Figure 1, below. For the purposes of this paper, the focus will be on concepts related to supply-chain management.\nFigure 1: Information activities in the value chain, adapted from Laudon &amp; Laudon (2014, p. 55)\nInformation technology continues to impact the value chains through greater connectivity and access to data in what has become known as the Digital Revolution (or the Fourth Industrial Revolution) based on hyper-connected devices or the Internet of Things that allows for unprecedented access to data and to control over processes.\n## Commodity value chains\nThe traditional value chains are designed for specific organisations within their competitive industries. However, with globalisation and mass exports and imports of various raw materials and manufactured goods, the concept of global commodity chains emerged, first coined by Gereffi in 1994 (Kaplinsky 2004). The global commodity chain is different from the traditional value chain model in that an international component is included, and organisations need to coordinate the information, business, and management activities (from Figure 1, above) across multiple countries or regions (Kaplinsky 2004).\nThe economies of some developing nations, such as in Africa, are based on raw material commodities (African Union [AU] 2017). In addition to the African economies' being dependent on commodities, it can be further detailed that these are agricultural commodities. For the development of value chains in this region, it was identified that competitive products need to be produced while reducing the transaction costs; efficiencies in the processing, marketing, and production functions are key to competitiveness (AU 2017).\nA European perspective of critical commodity value chains is based on raw minerals that support industrialisation and digitisation. In turn, the current digitisation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is key to developing and supporting these value chains. One of the key concerns for strategic mineral value chains is identified as the evolution and disruption brought about by this age of innovation, fuelled by rapid technological advancements (Faure-Schuyer, Egenhofer &amp; Elkerbout\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\n2018). Another key challenge that was identified is the ability to secure access to the necessary minerals, either through trade or by nations becoming self-sufficient (Faure-Schuyer, Egenhofer &amp; Elkerbout 2018). These challenges highlight important aspects of this paper: access to critical resources may not be as straightforward as it may seem, and the technological disruption may introduce vulnerabilities in the commodity chain that could be exploited by a competitor.\nFigure 2, below, illustrates a generalised commodity value chain. The material is mined or produced, transported to initial processing or refining, then loaded (often using conveyer belts or similar equipment) onto long-haul transport (road or rail) to be taken to the port, where it is loaded onto bulk carriers for export overseas. A corporate division controls or directs the various processes (denoted by the dashed arrows) and provides supportive processes.\nFigure 2: The commodity value chain\n# Porter's Five Forces Model\nPorter's Five Forces (also known as Competitive Forces) Model is a key model for strategic management, and describes external factors that affect an organisation's standing in its market environment (Grundy 2006; Laudon &amp; Laudon 2014):\n- Bargaining power of suppliers,\n- Bargaining power of customers,\n- Threat of new entrants,\n- Threat of substitute products,\n- Competitive rivalry.\nThese forces are illustrated in Figure 3, below. For the purposes of this paper, there is a focus on three of the forces: threat of new entrants, threat of substitute products, and competitive rivalry. The bargaining power of suppliers is implicit in some of the scenarios.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nFigure 3: Porter's Five Forces Model, adapted from Grundy (2006, p. 215) and Laudon &amp; Laudon (2014, p. 124)\n# Cyberattacks on the Commodity Value Chain\nAttacks can be leveraged against various points in the commodity value chain to achieve cascading effects. In particular, single points of failure in the value chain may prove to have greater impact on the commodity supply if they are successfully disrupted by cyberattacks. Industrial processes, transportation systems, and corporate decision making are all valid targets.\nThe industrial processes in a commodity value chain can include refineries or other processing of raw materials, mining equipment, and equipment to load and unload bulk cargo (such as conveyer belts) and containers onto trains, trucks, and ships. There have been a number of successful attacks on industrial control systems that have affected nuclear enrichment facilities (Stuxnet) or damaged a refinery, oil rigs, and chemical plants (Pretorius &amp; van Niekerk 2016). The transportation infrastructure has also seen successful cyberattacks affecting port scheduling and customs systems, sea-going vessels, tram and train ticketing systems; and vulnerabilities have been reported in many systems for rail and vessel navigation (van Niekerk 2017). These indicate that attacks against the industrial control systems and transportation systems are technically feasible.\nCorporate processes and decision making are also valid targets. This can be achieved through disrupting or corrupting the communications with clients and suppliers, thereby impacting the scheduling of trains, trucks, or vessels. By corrupting economic and business information, executives may make incorrect decisions, such as over-pricing material based on the incorrect information or ordering reduced production if they believe there is a surplus of materials. Corrupting main-\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\ntenance information can result in a lack of spare parts or critical equipment failures due to lack of maintenance. Corrupting individuals themselves through cyber-extortion of similar means can ensure poor decisions are made. These methods will be slower to perform than those that directly targeting the infrastructure. Figure 4, below, illustrates the attack points against the commodity value chain.\nFigure 4: Attacks on the commodity supply chain\nThe attacks described above are feasible; however, when considering large value chains, there may be a need to target multiple instances of systems across different organisations to be effective. Figure 5, below, provides an example in which there are two organisations, each with a headquarters controlling the mines (each with multiple pits and a refinery), with both rail and road transportation. Therefore, if one refinery fails due to a cyberattack, the others can carry a higher load. If trains are disrupted, trucks can be used as an alternative. This redundancy indicates that a cyberattack targeting a single point of failure will maximise the impact for less effort.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nFigure 5: Ports as a single point of failure\nAs is illustrated in Figure 5, above, the number of ports is usually limited, and only a few of those would handle a specific commodity. Therefore, targeting the ports will prove to be the most effective as this will impact on most of the land transportation and the mines' ability to supply material.\n## Scenarios\nThis section presents five hypothetical scenarios to illustrate possible situations leading to cyber-operations against aspects of the commodity value chain. The concept of defensive and offensive cyber-operations proposed in the Cyber-Security Dilemma are introduced in these scenarios.\n## Scenario 1\nCountry A discovers a deposit of strategic minerals, which has not previously been found in the country. Consequently, the unit price for the mineral has lowered; however, the country does not yet have the capacity to compete with more established exporters of the mineral that have standing trade agreements.\nThe main supplier of the mineral, Country B, has several co-located mines extracting the mineral, which is then transported to the coast mostly by train; transport by truck is possible, but is more expensive and slower. On the coast there is one port that has bulk-handling facilities to load the mineral onto the ships. There is also a multi-purpose terminal to allow for machinery spares to be imported for the port and the mines. The nearest city is approximately a two-hour drive from the port.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nCountry A decides that for it to be able to compete, it needs to secretly hinder Country B's ability to supply the mineral. To achieve this goal, a cyberattack against the control systems for the extraction process at the largest mine is undertaken, resulting in physical damage to key components in the process. As spares are difficult to procure, this action hinders production for months. Minor follow-up attacks affect the port's systems, randomly corrupting data on the loading of the vessel, necessitating manual confirmation of the recorded values thereby slowing down the turnaround time of vessels. This reduces the supply of the mineral from Country B, drives up prices, and leads some importers of the mineral to seek alternative sources—and ultimately turn to Country A.\nBy disrupting the regular supply of the major supplier of mineral, Country A has altered the status quo and has reduced the competitiveness of Country B due to the irregular supply. As the supply reduced, the price of the mineral increased, and Country A benefitted by providing the alternative supply. As Country A sought to increase its standing by altering the status quo, this can be considered an offensive operation in terms of Economic Information Warfare.\n## Scenario 2\nAs with Scenario 1, Country A discovers a deposit of strategic minerals, which has not previously been found in the country. Consequently, the unit price for the mineral has lowered; however, the country does not yet have the capacity to compete with more established exporters of the mineral that have standing trade agreements.\nThe main supplier of the mineral, Country B, becomes concerned that there is a new supplier and that its economic standing has been affected due to the discovery of the mineral deposit. A decision is made that, in order to maintain the status quo, Country A's ability to realise its potential as a supplier of the mineral needs to be disrupted. The main effort is to penetrate the project office's systems and alter the data and information, affecting the management activities related to the value chain. This results in delays in component deliveries, some design flaws requiring the re-manufacturing of components, and the gauge of the train tracks and the carriages to be mismatched. The project, therefore, faces major setbacks; and subtle design flaws in both hardware and firmware of the control systems cause erratic system behaviour and early component failure.\nAs the project is beset with apparent incompetence and glitches from the beginning, Country A is not considered a capable supplier, and importers of the mineral continued to favour Country B as the main exporter. Even though the deposit existed, Country A's inability to supply the commodity allowed the mineral price to almost return to its initial value. Country B's use of cyberattack can, therefore, be considered defensive as it maintained the status quo by protecting the country's standing and stabilising the cost of the mineral.\n## Scenario 3\nThere are two major exporters of oil into a contested region; both are established and are direct economic rivals. In order to assert dominance in the region, Exporter 1 launches cyberattacks against the pipelines of Exporter 2, reducing the flow of oil into the region. To make up for the shortfall, Exporter 1 supplies extra oil at a slightly cheaper rate, provided that there is a revised trade agreement which ultimately secures long-term export of oil into the region for Exporter 1.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nTo ensure this continues, Exporter 1 inserts a malicious remote access tool into the systems of Exporter 2's pipelines that will allow for future attacks that can cause an overpressure and rupture the pipelines.\nIn this scenario, a rival changes the economic status quo by affecting the main competitor's ability to supply oil. The cyber-operations are offensive in that the perpetrator actively seeks to gain long-term economic benefits from disrupting its competitors' operation.\n## Scenario 4\nIt is found that a strategic metal, Alloy A, can be replaced by another material, Alloy B. While Alloy B is not ideal, it is cheaper and easier to process and store. As a result, a number of major importers of Alloy A reduce their demand in favour of Alloy B. As with Scenario 2, a major exporter of Alloy B decides to disrupt the manufacture and export of the substitute alloy. This can be seen as defensive action as the original exporter is attempting to keep the status quo. Conversely, if the exporters of Alloy B attempted to disrupt the suppliers of the original material, as in Scenario 1, the effort would constitute offensive action as there is an attempt to change the status quo.\n## Scenario 5\nTwo new market entrants are vying for dominance. Using cyber-espionage, they seek to discover each other's processes in order to compete. This effort then turns to using cyber-operations to disrupt each other's ability to manufacture and supply. The economic and market information is corrupted in order to nudge the victim into making poor business decisions. In this case, the action is offensive, as both are seeking to gain an edge over the other and alter the status quo in the commodity market. This applies if one or both of the actors are providing substitute products.\n## Categorisation of cyber-operations on commodity value chains\nIt is technically feasible for cyber-operations to support or act as the primary weapon in Economic Information Warfare targeting specific commodity value chains. With the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the associated drives for hyper-connected systems, there are likely to be vulnerable systems at various points along the value chain. Table 2, below, aligns the various attack strategies to the stages of the value chain.\n|  Stage | Degrade | Deny | Disrupt | Exploit | Corrupt  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Source | X |  | X |  |   |\n|  Processing | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Loading | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Transport | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Port | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Commercial – decision making |  |  |  | X | X  |\n|  Commercial – access to economic information | X | X | X |  | X  |\nTable 2: Attack strategies per stage of the commodity value chain\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nTable 3, below, summarises the scenarios' categorisation in terms of the offensive or defensive nature of the cyber-operations based on the attacker and victim type (competitor, new entrant, or substitute) as per the Five Forces Model. Offensive actions can be considered as the cyber-operations aimed at changing the economic status in favour of the perpetrator, whereas defensive actions can be considered to be cyber-operations to maintain the perpetrator's current economic status.\n|   | Attacker  |   |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |   |  Competitor | New Entrant | Substitute  |\n|  Victim | Competitor | Offensive (S3) | Offensive (S1) | Offensive (S4b)  |\n|   |  New entrant | Defensive (S2) | Offensive (S5) | Offensive (S5)  |\n|   |  Substitute | Defensive (S4a) | Offensive (S5) | Offensive (S5)  |\nTable 3: Classification of attacks on a commodity value chain\nThe categorisations in Table 3 can play a part in deciding the legality of the actions and appropriate responses, based on the perceived intent of the actions. A defensive cyberattack can ultimately be interpreted as a response to other perceived economic attacks.\n# Legal Considerations for Cyber-Operations on Commodity Value Chains\nCan cyber-operations on commodity value chains be considered acts of war? Is there any legal recourse available, and can it be justified? The most difficult challenge is whether a cyberattack or cyber-operation invokes jus ad bellum. The Tallinn Manuals provide some explanation of the UN Charter in terms of cyber-operations and the key point of contention, the use of force. A cyber-operation will only invoke the UN Charter when its effects are similar or equivalent to that of a physical attack that would invoke the UN Charter. Goldsmith (2013) indicates that \"a cyber-attack that renders the electricity grid or air-traffic control system inoperable, and that as a result causes many deaths\" are cases that can be considered a use of force. However, there remains little clarity whether a slow, disruptive cyberattack on critical infrastructure that gradually renders it partially operable (such as Scenarios 1 and 2) can be deemed a use of force. In such scenarios, the question becomes how international law would apply when just one aspect of the value chain is attacked (such as Country B's corruption of Country A's project information to degrade the functioning of the value chain) and leads to an equivalent of a partial economic blockade. Therefore, a full economic shutdown (such as a power grid) can be considered an act of war, and armed retaliation may result; whereas targeting a value chain is not as severe, and the response needs to be proportional. However, The Singapore Norms, although not considered legislation, state as the first norm that \"State and non-state actors should not tamper with products and services in development and production, nor allow them to be tampered with, if doing so may substantially impair the stability of cyberspace\" (GCSC 2018). Norm six further states that, \"States should enact appropriate measures, including laws and regulations, to ensure basic cyber hygiene\" (GCSC 2018). Therefore, the Singapore Norms would consider cyber-operations targeting value chains as irresponsible, but the norms would also place responsibility on the nations to put measures in place to protect themselves.\nEconomic espionage and information theft (Scenario 5) are not considered to invoke the UN Char-\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nter, and Tallinn 2.0 (Rule 32) states that there remains no international law prohibiting the legalities of espionage (Schmitt 2017). On the one hand, there is the actual legality of the espionage itself, and on the other hand is the legality of the method of the espionage, once again becoming a grey area. Economic espionage is usually considered under criminal law, and not International Humanitarian Law (IHL). The Singapore Norms recognise the need for military and intelligence cyber-operations (GCSC 2018); therefore, a response to economic espionage is unlikely to include an attack.\nWith regards to sovereignty, Rule 21 of the Tallinn Manual states that a country under attack is permitted to conduct a cyber-operation that violates the sovereignty of the attacking country; furthermore, the illegality of the response is precluded and is, therefore, justified. However, Tallinn also states that any such recourse must preclude the use of force and should be proportionate (Schmitt 2013). There also remains the condition of attribution, where there needs to be reasonable certainty of perpetration prior to response. The protection of one's own economy may not be sufficient justification for employing cyber-operations to disrupt the development of another country's economy (Scenarios 2 and 4a).\n## Discussion\nFrom the description of the cyberattacks on industrial control systems and those affecting the transportation sector, it is technically feasible to disrupt various stages in a commodity supply chain. From a legal perspective, there are a number of challenges regarding cyber-operations on commodity value chains. Whilst a catastrophic attack against a national economy can be considered an act of war, the legalities of partial disruptions described by the scenarios remain somewhat of a grey area. The Singapore Norm against tampering with products and services indicates that cyber-operations against commodity value chains are irresponsible and that states should refrain from such activities. However, given the legal grey area, it is feasible that states could attempt to disrupt value chains and escape significant or meaningful reprisal.\nFrom Table 3, above, seven of the nine possibilities can be considered offensive, indicating that a cyber-operation against a commodity value chain is more likely to be offensive in nature than defensive. This may influence the victim's interpretation of a cyber-operation, resulting in a situation in which the Cyber-Security Dilemma comes into being as the situation escalates. The guidance provided by The Tallinn Manuals and the Singapore Norms Package on the applicability of international law to cyber-operations as economic attacks raises the questions of whether the action was offensive or defensive or if retaliation to an offensive cyberattack can be legally justified. As Rule 21 of The Tallinn Manuals allows a state under attack to retaliate via a cyber-operation provided it does not include the use of force, nations could respond to offensive economic attacks via cyber-operations. Disrupting the legitimate development of another economy through cyber-operations is not likely to be justifiable even if they protect the attacker's economy. Disrupting another county's economy in order to develop one's own is even less likely justifiable. As discussed above, these cyber-operations can result in some retaliation as per Rule 21; however, for a response to be justified, sufficient attribution is required. Therefore, the capability of the victim to detect a cyber-operation designed for stealth and slow degradation of value chains may become the key factor as to whether a nation could retaliate.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nTo summarise, cyber-operations targeting commodity value chains are technically feasible. There is a legal grey area as to whether these cyber-operations will be considered as a use of force due to their limited impact, or whether a cyberattack in response to offensive cyber-operations that disrupt economic activity will be legally justified. Difficulties in detection and attribution may further hinder a nation's ability to respond or to retaliate. The use of cyber-operations for economic espionage may, however, be allowable based on the guidance of the documents considered. The authors do not condone such operations; however, their viability needs to be assessed to discuss (and, if necessary, prepare) appropriate responses.\n## Conclusion\nCyber-operations are a possible tool to conduct Economic Information Warfare. International trade in raw materials is based on commodity value chains; targeting these can be analogous to a limited traditional blockade on the commodity. The Cyber-Security Dilemma and Porter’s Five Forces Model are used to illustrate possible scenarios employing cyber-operations to target the commodity value chain. While it is technically feasible to conduct these attacks, the legalities thereof remain a contentious area, with a current emphasis on interpretations of IHL, balanced by specific obligations. Based on The Tallinn Manuals, the law of armed conflict would apply to cyber-operations, both nationally and internationally under certain conditions. Leetaru (2017) notes that the focus on “cyber warfare” in Tallinn 1.0 changed to “cyber-operations” in Tallinn 2.0, reflecting the complexities of operations in cyber-space, where cyberattacks often fall below the threshold of formal acts of war based on IHL. The main contention, therefore, remains the definition of what can be construed as an act of war in cyber-space. In the case of cyberattacks on commodity value chains, the scope of the attack is limited, and therefore will likely fall below the threshold of an act of war and limit a victim’s response options. Future research could look at the main efforts to develop cyber-legislation that falls within the ambit of IHL and apply this legislation to critical infrastructure protection\n## Acknowledgements\nThe first author received funding by the South African National Research Foundation, Grant no. 115059.",

There is also a growing consideration of vulnerabilities in the physical transportation infrastructure, which is comprised of a number of interlinking components that enable international trade in raw materials and consumer goods, known as commodity value chains. Through the use of scenario analysis and document analysis, this article investigates the feasibility and legal considerations of cyberattacks to target commodity value chains in order to further or protect national interests.\nKeywords: Commodity Value Chain, Critical Infrastructure Protection, Cyber-Operations, Economic Information Warfare (EIW), International Humanitarian Law (IHL)\n# Introduction\nThe focus of the cyber-security efforts appears to be on the power and financial systems. However, the physical transport infrastructure is often not considered; and, if it is, the scope is limited. However, all trade of commodities and products is conducted via this infrastructure. In particular, commodities can be seen to have global value chains with specific trade corridors, allowing the commodity market to be affected by targeting the supporting transport infrastructure. Therefore, cyber-operations that disrupt the physical transport infrastructure can have significant economic consequences for the victim. One example is the impact the NotPetya ransomware had on the shipping company Maersk. Maersk's global operations were disrupted, and the company is estimated to have lost between $250 million to $300 million .\nJournal of Information Warfare (2019) 18.2: 31-48\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nThis article aims to investigate the feasibility of cyber-operations against the physical transport infrastructure as an aspect of Economic Information Warfare. The article is conceptual, using hypothetical examples, documents, and logical discussion to illustrate the technical and legal considerations for Economic Information Warfare (EIW) to gain or protect competitive economic advantage based on commodity trade. The basis of the discussion revolves around the Cyber-Security Dilemma and Porter's Five Forces models; by combining these models and using hypothetical scenarios, the article proposes a categorisation scheme for strategic cyber-operations against commodities to influence international trade. The Tallinn Manuals on international law and cyber-operations  are used to provide a discussion on the legal considerations of the proposed framework.\nThis paper provides background on Information Warfare, Economic Information Warfare, the Cyber-Security Dilemma, and The Tallinn Manuals. The commodity value chain and relevant models are then introduced. The feasibility of disrupting commodity value chains through cyber-operations are discussed using analysis of hypothetical scenarios. The Tallinn Manuals are then used to provide a legal perspective for targeting the commodity chains. This is followed by a discussion and conclusion.\n## Background\n### Information Warfare\n'Information Warfare' (IW) is regarded as consisting of tactics, techniques, and procedures used in the information domain to gain an advantage over an adversary during a period of conflict or competition . The information domain can be comprised of physical, logical (or virtual), and cognitive components , and, therefore, can be comprised of cyber-operations as well as other forms of conflict, such as psychological operations . Defensive Information Warfare can be seen to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems to authorised entities. Information Warfare strategies to attack include destroying data, manipulating/corrupting data, stealing/exploiting data, denying or disrupting access to data, altering the perceptions of the target population towards the data, or changing the context in which the data is viewed (Hutchinson &amp; Warren 2001). Table 1, below, illustrates these Information Warfare concepts.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\n|   | Aspects of Secure Information  |   |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |   |  Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability  |\n|  Domains | Cognitive |  | Alter perception\nAlter context |   |\n|   |  Logical | Exploit | Manipulate\nCorrupt | Deny\nDisrupt  |\n|   |  Physical | Steal | Damage | Destroy  |\nTable 1: Offensive Information Warfare Techniques\n# Economic Information Warfare\nLambert (2017) contrasts two types of economic warfare:\n- the traditional blockade or bombing of factories, a slow attrition designed to degrade the economy and a nation's warfighting capacity; and\n- economic warfare that targets the societal psychology, as proposed by the British prior to the First World War, in which global sea communications would be disrupted.\nThe latter was attempted at the outbreak of World War I but failed after being abandoned a few months later due to resistance by the British's own businesses; the former blockade style was employed during World War II by the German U-boats and in the U.S. submarine campaign against the Japanese . Deakin (2003) considers a number of tactics that can be conducted as economic warfare, including\n- Affecting trade conditions;\n- Affecting market liquidity;\n- Denying market access (such as embargoes or blockades);\n- Degrading market efficiency (for example, resulting in slower delivery of goods or services);\n- Degrading supply chains;\n- Degrading foreign markets;\n- Exploiting, denying, or degrading supporting infrastructure;\n- Exploiting, denying, degrading, or corrupting economic information.\nThe descriptions by both Deakin (2003) and Lambert (2017) include measures that directly affect the ability to trade commodities and other materials; this concept is key to this paper. Lambert (2017) notes that globalisation has resulted in the almost-immediate fluctuation of commodity prices due to predictions of supply excess or deficiencies.\nAs reliance on information technologies and their role in globalisation increased, the concept of Economic Information Warfare as an aspect of Information Warfare closely related to cyber operations emerged. Economic Information Warfare is considered to be the activities to control, protect, and potentially disrupt economic activity through information and information systems . Chatterji (2008) equates Economic Information Warfare with a version of economic blockade that would affect societies by restricting the flow of economic information.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nHowever, attacks on critical infrastructure can also have severe economic consequences .\nDeakin (2003) considers the relationship between protecting financial information systems from cyberattacks and national security. He concludes that there needs to be a redefinition of the term ‘national security’ (all that it means and encompasses) and that attacks resulting in the failure of critical financial systems could potentially be economically disastrous. Power grids are also potential targets that could have severe economic consequences if disrupted by cyber-operations. Lloyd’s and Centre for Risk Studies (2015) indicates that malware affecting 50 generators in the U.S. could potentially have an economic impact of $1 trillion. In 2015 and 2016, there were successful cyberattacks on the Ukrainian power grid, which caused a disruption in electricity supply . Power grids appear to attract more attacks: the U.S. ICS-CERT (c. 2017) shows that 17% of the investigated incidents affected the energy sector, 8% targeted the transportation sector, and 4% critical manufacturing.\nWheeler (2018) considers cyber warfare as having no rules; and with the growing prevalence of cyberattacks, there is an increased likelihood of strategic attacks against national economies. Cyber-operations that severely disrupt financial or power systems could be potentially devastating in terms of both the economic and societal implications. It is possible that such an attack would draw widespread condemnation and possibly military action in retaliation. Attacking commodity trade is ‘high-precision’ but more subtle, which would not be as broadly devastating. Such an attack is likely to fall short of sufficient grounds for military retaliation. Lambert (2017) cautions that the use of cyber-operations to cause economic effects could have the same result as the failed British economic warfare concept. (The parallel relies on the fact that sea communication was a developing concept at the time about which there was a lack of understanding, as is currently the case with cyber-security and cyber-operations.)\n## The Cyber-Security Dilemma\nThe Cyber-Security Dilemma is an evolution of the security dilemma or spiral model of international relations, which has been applied into the cyber-domain. Reuter (2011) considers the Cyber-Security Dilemma as measures taken by a nation to increase the security of its digital infrastructure, which then decreases the cyber-security of another country. He suggests that it is difficult to differentiate between offensive and defensive intentions in cyber-space, particularly because the techniques that are used are often very similar. Libicki (2016) suggests that the Cyber-Security Dilemma is not as prevalent as it appears to be; he considers most defensive actions in cyberspace are easily identified as such, except for the case of active defence. From an economics perspective, nations improving their cyber-security could benefit other states by reducing the number of staging points from which an attack may be launched.\nBuchanan (2017) provides an in-depth discussion of the Cyber-Security Dilemma. He indicates that there are legitimate defensive reasons to conduct network intrusions; at the same time, he concedes most nations would consider any intrusion into a sensitive network as threatening. While sensitive systems are considered, there is no explicit mention of cyber-physical systems, such as industrial control, in the considerations of the Cyber-Security Dilemma. In this context, the likelihood is that any penetration into these systems will be aggressive, as there is limited defensive val\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nue (in cyber-security terms) that an intruder can gain from affecting cyber-physical systems. There may, however, be economic reasons that make cyber-physical systems targets for intrusion, such as assessing the rate of manufacture or throughput of a product or attempting to discover industrial processes through cyber-espionage.\nFor the purposes of this paper, the concept that nations can take defensive actions which negatively affect the security of other nations is the one which will be considered. Later in the article, this concept will be modified and applied into an economic setting.\n## International cyber-operations and security frameworks\nInternational law has an important role regarding cyber-operations, especially when a cyber-operation is performed within the context of an international armed conflict . The Tallinn Manuals  provide in-depth non-binding analyses of applicability of existing international law to cyber-operations, including the areas of sovereignty, due diligence, jurisdiction, international responsibility, cyber-operations, and international human rights. These analyses were developed by international law experts to propose principles to govern cyber-warfare, including the elements of jus ad bellum (governing the use of force by a state as an instrument of its international policy), together with jus in bello (regulating the conduct of armed conflict). With the growing prevalence of cyberattacks, the concepts contained in The Tallinn Manuals have become of utmost interest.\nIn 2018, the Norm Package Singapore was developed by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) with the purpose of proposing best practices to safeguard a reliable Internet while recognising the interdependence of the global communities. It sought to prevent the consequences of any major disruption of the Internet and to promote ethical behaviour of all entities involved .\n## Commodity Value Chains\nThis section presents the basic principles that contribute towards the concept of commodity value chains, including Porter’s Five Forces Model.\n## The value chain\nThe value chain is considered to be a “system of interdependent activities, which are connected by linkages” (Porter &amp; Millar 1985). These activities can impact on each other’s effectiveness, and an optimised value-chain can be created by making trade-offs based on the various linkages.\nPorter and Millar (1985) consider the role of information and information technology in an organisation’s competitive advantage. In particular, the information and information technology impacts the linkages within the value chain. In addition to the greater speed at which traditionally information-related tasks can be performed, technology has improved the physical aspects of an organisation, particularly through improved automation, control, and monitoring of processes. In 1985, information technologies were considered to have increased rivalries, increased the threat of substitute products, and increased the power of buyers (Porter &amp; Millar 1985). This integration of information activities across businesses drove management information systems and enabled\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\ntraditional business processes and management activities (Laudon &amp; Laudon 2014), as is illustrated in Figure 1, below. For the purposes of this paper, the focus will be on concepts related to supply-chain management.\nFigure 1: Information activities in the value chain, adapted from Laudon &amp; Laudon (2014, p. 55)\nInformation technology continues to impact the value chains through greater connectivity and access to data in what has become known as the Digital Revolution (or the Fourth Industrial Revolution) based on hyper-connected devices or the Internet of Things that allows for unprecedented access to data and to control over processes.\n## Commodity value chains\nThe traditional value chains are designed for specific organisations within their competitive industries. However, with globalisation and mass exports and imports of various raw materials and manufactured goods, the concept of global commodity chains emerged, first coined by Gereffi in 1994 . The global commodity chain is different from the traditional value chain model in that an international component is included, and organisations need to coordinate the information, business, and management activities (from Figure 1, above) across multiple countries or regions .\nThe economies of some developing nations, such as in Africa, are based on raw material commodities (African Union [AU] 2017). In addition to the African economies' being dependent on commodities, it can be further detailed that these are agricultural commodities. For the development of value chains in this region, it was identified that competitive products need to be produced while reducing the transaction costs; efficiencies in the processing, marketing, and production functions are key to competitiveness .\nA European perspective of critical commodity value chains is based on raw minerals that support industrialisation and digitisation. In turn, the current digitisation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is key to developing and supporting these value chains. One of the key concerns for strategic mineral value chains is identified as the evolution and disruption brought about by this age of innovation, fuelled by rapid technological advancements (Faure-Schuyer, Egenhofer &amp; Elkerbout\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\n2018). Another key challenge that was identified is the ability to secure access to the necessary minerals, either through trade or by nations becoming self-sufficient (Faure-Schuyer, Egenhofer &amp; Elkerbout 2018). These challenges highlight important aspects of this paper: access to critical resources may not be as straightforward as it may seem, and the technological disruption may introduce vulnerabilities in the commodity chain that could be exploited by a competitor.\nFigure 2, below, illustrates a generalised commodity value chain. The material is mined or produced, transported to initial processing or refining, then loaded (often using conveyer belts or similar equipment) onto long-haul transport (road or rail) to be taken to the port, where it is loaded onto bulk carriers for export overseas. A corporate division controls or directs the various processes (denoted by the dashed arrows) and provides supportive processes.\nFigure 2: The commodity value chain\n# Porter's Five Forces Model\nPorter's Five Forces (also known as Competitive Forces) Model is a key model for strategic management, and describes external factors that affect an organisation's standing in its market environment :\n- Bargaining power of suppliers,\n- Bargaining power of customers,\n- Threat of new entrants,\n- Threat of substitute products,\n- Competitive rivalry.\nThese forces are illustrated in Figure 3, below. For the purposes of this paper, there is a focus on three of the forces: threat of new entrants, threat of substitute products, and competitive rivalry. The bargaining power of suppliers is implicit in some of the scenarios.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nFigure 3: Porter's Five Forces Model, adapted from Grundy (2006, p. 215) and Laudon &amp; Laudon (2014, p. 124)\n# Cyberattacks on the Commodity Value Chain\nAttacks can be leveraged against various points in the commodity value chain to achieve cascading effects. In particular, single points of failure in the value chain may prove to have greater impact on the commodity supply if they are successfully disrupted by cyberattacks. Industrial processes, transportation systems, and corporate decision making are all valid targets.\nThe industrial processes in a commodity value chain can include refineries or other processing of raw materials, mining equipment, and equipment to load and unload bulk cargo (such as conveyer belts) and containers onto trains, trucks, and ships. There have been a number of successful attacks on industrial control systems that have affected nuclear enrichment facilities (Stuxnet) or damaged a refinery, oil rigs, and chemical plants (Pretorius &amp; van Niekerk 2016). The transportation infrastructure has also seen successful cyberattacks affecting port scheduling and customs systems, sea-going vessels, tram and train ticketing systems; and vulnerabilities have been reported in many systems for rail and vessel navigation (van Niekerk 2017). These indicate that attacks against the industrial control systems and transportation systems are technically feasible.\nCorporate processes and decision making are also valid targets. This can be achieved through disrupting or corrupting the communications with clients and suppliers, thereby impacting the scheduling of trains, trucks, or vessels. By corrupting economic and business information, executives may make incorrect decisions, such as over-pricing material based on the incorrect information or ordering reduced production if they believe there is a surplus of materials. Corrupting main-\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\ntenance information can result in a lack of spare parts or critical equipment failures due to lack of maintenance. Corrupting individuals themselves through cyber-extortion of similar means can ensure poor decisions are made. These methods will be slower to perform than those that directly targeting the infrastructure. Figure 4, below, illustrates the attack points against the commodity value chain.\nFigure 4: Attacks on the commodity supply chain\nThe attacks described above are feasible; however, when considering large value chains, there may be a need to target multiple instances of systems across different organisations to be effective. Figure 5, below, provides an example in which there are two organisations, each with a headquarters controlling the mines (each with multiple pits and a refinery), with both rail and road transportation. Therefore, if one refinery fails due to a cyberattack, the others can carry a higher load. If trains are disrupted, trucks can be used as an alternative. This redundancy indicates that a cyberattack targeting a single point of failure will maximise the impact for less effort.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nFigure 5: Ports as a single point of failure\nAs is illustrated in Figure 5, above, the number of ports is usually limited, and only a few of those would handle a specific commodity. Therefore, targeting the ports will prove to be the most effective as this will impact on most of the land transportation and the mines' ability to supply material.\n## Scenarios\nThis section presents five hypothetical scenarios to illustrate possible situations leading to cyber-operations against aspects of the commodity value chain. The concept of defensive and offensive cyber-operations proposed in the Cyber-Security Dilemma are introduced in these scenarios.\n## Scenario 1\nCountry A discovers a deposit of strategic minerals, which has not previously been found in the country. Consequently, the unit price for the mineral has lowered; however, the country does not yet have the capacity to compete with more established exporters of the mineral that have standing trade agreements.\nThe main supplier of the mineral, Country B, has several co-located mines extracting the mineral, which is then transported to the coast mostly by train; transport by truck is possible, but is more expensive and slower. On the coast there is one port that has bulk-handling facilities to load the mineral onto the ships. There is also a multi-purpose terminal to allow for machinery spares to be imported for the port and the mines. The nearest city is approximately a two-hour drive from the port.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nCountry A decides that for it to be able to compete, it needs to secretly hinder Country B's ability to supply the mineral. To achieve this goal, a cyberattack against the control systems for the extraction process at the largest mine is undertaken, resulting in physical damage to key components in the process. As spares are difficult to procure, this action hinders production for months. Minor follow-up attacks affect the port's systems, randomly corrupting data on the loading of the vessel, necessitating manual confirmation of the recorded values thereby slowing down the turnaround time of vessels. This reduces the supply of the mineral from Country B, drives up prices, and leads some importers of the mineral to seek alternative sources—and ultimately turn to Country A.\nBy disrupting the regular supply of the major supplier of mineral, Country A has altered the status quo and has reduced the competitiveness of Country B due to the irregular supply. As the supply reduced, the price of the mineral increased, and Country A benefitted by providing the alternative supply. As Country A sought to increase its standing by altering the status quo, this can be considered an offensive operation in terms of Economic Information Warfare.\n## Scenario 2\nAs with Scenario 1, Country A discovers a deposit of strategic minerals, which has not previously been found in the country. Consequently, the unit price for the mineral has lowered; however, the country does not yet have the capacity to compete with more established exporters of the mineral that have standing trade agreements.\nThe main supplier of the mineral, Country B, becomes concerned that there is a new supplier and that its economic standing has been affected due to the discovery of the mineral deposit. A decision is made that, in order to maintain the status quo, Country A's ability to realise its potential as a supplier of the mineral needs to be disrupted. The main effort is to penetrate the project office's systems and alter the data and information, affecting the management activities related to the value chain. This results in delays in component deliveries, some design flaws requiring the re-manufacturing of components, and the gauge of the train tracks and the carriages to be mismatched. The project, therefore, faces major setbacks; and subtle design flaws in both hardware and firmware of the control systems cause erratic system behaviour and early component failure.\nAs the project is beset with apparent incompetence and glitches from the beginning, Country A is not considered a capable supplier, and importers of the mineral continued to favour Country B as the main exporter. Even though the deposit existed, Country A's inability to supply the commodity allowed the mineral price to almost return to its initial value. Country B's use of cyberattack can, therefore, be considered defensive as it maintained the status quo by protecting the country's standing and stabilising the cost of the mineral.\n## Scenario 3\nThere are two major exporters of oil into a contested region; both are established and are direct economic rivals. In order to assert dominance in the region, Exporter 1 launches cyberattacks against the pipelines of Exporter 2, reducing the flow of oil into the region. To make up for the shortfall, Exporter 1 supplies extra oil at a slightly cheaper rate, provided that there is a revised trade agreement which ultimately secures long-term export of oil into the region for Exporter 1.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nTo ensure this continues, Exporter 1 inserts a malicious remote access tool into the systems of Exporter 2's pipelines that will allow for future attacks that can cause an overpressure and rupture the pipelines.\nIn this scenario, a rival changes the economic status quo by affecting the main competitor's ability to supply oil. The cyber-operations are offensive in that the perpetrator actively seeks to gain long-term economic benefits from disrupting its competitors' operation.\n## Scenario 4\nIt is found that a strategic metal, Alloy A, can be replaced by another material, Alloy B. While Alloy B is not ideal, it is cheaper and easier to process and store. As a result, a number of major importers of Alloy A reduce their demand in favour of Alloy B. As with Scenario 2, a major exporter of Alloy B decides to disrupt the manufacture and export of the substitute alloy. This can be seen as defensive action as the original exporter is attempting to keep the status quo. Conversely, if the exporters of Alloy B attempted to disrupt the suppliers of the original material, as in Scenario 1, the effort would constitute offensive action as there is an attempt to change the status quo.\n## Scenario 5\nTwo new market entrants are vying for dominance. Using cyber-espionage, they seek to discover each other's processes in order to compete. This effort then turns to using cyber-operations to disrupt each other's ability to manufacture and supply. The economic and market information is corrupted in order to nudge the victim into making poor business decisions. In this case, the action is offensive, as both are seeking to gain an edge over the other and alter the status quo in the commodity market. This applies if one or both of the actors are providing substitute products.\n## Categorisation of cyber-operations on commodity value chains\nIt is technically feasible for cyber-operations to support or act as the primary weapon in Economic Information Warfare targeting specific commodity value chains. With the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the associated drives for hyper-connected systems, there are likely to be vulnerable systems at various points along the value chain. Table 2, below, aligns the various attack strategies to the stages of the value chain.\n|  Stage | Degrade | Deny | Disrupt | Exploit | Corrupt  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Source | X |  | X |  |   |\n|  Processing | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Loading | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Transport | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Port | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Commercial – decision making |  |  |  | X | X  |\n|  Commercial – access to economic information | X | X | X |  | X  |\nTable 2: Attack strategies per stage of the commodity value chain\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nTable 3, below, summarises the scenarios' categorisation in terms of the offensive or defensive nature of the cyber-operations based on the attacker and victim type (competitor, new entrant, or substitute) as per the Five Forces Model. Offensive actions can be considered as the cyber-operations aimed at changing the economic status in favour of the perpetrator, whereas defensive actions can be considered to be cyber-operations to maintain the perpetrator's current economic status.\n|   | Attacker  |   |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |   |  Competitor | New Entrant | Substitute  |\n|  Victim | Competitor | Offensive (S3) | Offensive (S1) | Offensive (S4b)  |\n|   |  New entrant | Defensive (S2) | Offensive (S5) | Offensive (S5)  |\n|   |  Substitute | Defensive (S4a) | Offensive (S5) | Offensive (S5)  |\nTable 3: Classification of attacks on a commodity value chain\nThe categorisations in Table 3 can play a part in deciding the legality of the actions and appropriate responses, based on the perceived intent of the actions. A defensive cyberattack can ultimately be interpreted as a response to other perceived economic attacks.\n# Legal Considerations for Cyber-Operations on Commodity Value Chains\nCan cyber-operations on commodity value chains be considered acts of war? Is there any legal recourse available, and can it be justified? The most difficult challenge is whether a cyberattack or cyber-operation invokes jus ad bellum. The Tallinn Manuals provide some explanation of the UN Charter in terms of cyber-operations and the key point of contention, the use of force. A cyber-operation will only invoke the UN Charter when its effects are similar or equivalent to that of a physical attack that would invoke the UN Charter. Goldsmith (2013) indicates that \"a cyber-attack that renders the electricity grid or air-traffic control system inoperable, and that as a result causes many deaths\" are cases that can be considered a use of force. However, there remains little clarity whether a slow, disruptive cyberattack on critical infrastructure that gradually renders it partially operable (such as Scenarios 1 and 2) can be deemed a use of force. In such scenarios, the question becomes how international law would apply when just one aspect of the value chain is attacked (such as Country B's corruption of Country A's project information to degrade the functioning of the value chain) and leads to an equivalent of a partial economic blockade. Therefore, a full economic shutdown (such as a power grid) can be considered an act of war, and armed retaliation may result; whereas targeting a value chain is not as severe, and the response needs to be proportional. However, The Singapore Norms, although not considered legislation, state as the first norm that \"State and non-state actors should not tamper with products and services in development and production, nor allow them to be tampered with, if doing so may substantially impair the stability of cyberspace\" . Norm six further states that, \"States should enact appropriate measures, including laws and regulations, to ensure basic cyber hygiene\" . Therefore, the Singapore Norms would consider cyber-operations targeting value chains as irresponsible, but the norms would also place responsibility on the nations to put measures in place to protect themselves.\nEconomic espionage and information theft (Scenario 5) are not considered to invoke the UN Char-\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nter, and Tallinn 2.0 (Rule 32) states that there remains no international law prohibiting the legalities of espionage . On the one hand, there is the actual legality of the espionage itself, and on the other hand is the legality of the method of the espionage, once again becoming a grey area. Economic espionage is usually considered under criminal law, and not International Humanitarian Law (IHL). The Singapore Norms recognise the need for military and intelligence cyber-operations ; therefore, a response to economic espionage is unlikely to include an attack.\nWith regards to sovereignty, Rule 21 of the Tallinn Manual states that a country under attack is permitted to conduct a cyber-operation that violates the sovereignty of the attacking country; furthermore, the illegality of the response is precluded and is, therefore, justified. However, Tallinn also states that any such recourse must preclude the use of force and should be proportionate . There also remains the condition of attribution, where there needs to be reasonable certainty of perpetration prior to response. The protection of one's own economy may not be sufficient justification for employing cyber-operations to disrupt the development of another country's economy (Scenarios 2 and 4a).\n## Discussion\nFrom the description of the cyberattacks on industrial control systems and those affecting the transportation sector, it is technically feasible to disrupt various stages in a commodity supply chain. From a legal perspective, there are a number of challenges regarding cyber-operations on commodity value chains. Whilst a catastrophic attack against a national economy can be considered an act of war, the legalities of partial disruptions described by the scenarios remain somewhat of a grey area. The Singapore Norm against tampering with products and services indicates that cyber-operations against commodity value chains are irresponsible and that states should refrain from such activities. However, given the legal grey area, it is feasible that states could attempt to disrupt value chains and escape significant or meaningful reprisal.\nFrom Table 3, above, seven of the nine possibilities can be considered offensive, indicating that a cyber-operation against a commodity value chain is more likely to be offensive in nature than defensive. This may influence the victim's interpretation of a cyber-operation, resulting in a situation in which the Cyber-Security Dilemma comes into being as the situation escalates. The guidance provided by The Tallinn Manuals and the Singapore Norms Package on the applicability of international law to cyber-operations as economic attacks raises the questions of whether the action was offensive or defensive or if retaliation to an offensive cyberattack can be legally justified. As Rule 21 of The Tallinn Manuals allows a state under attack to retaliate via a cyber-operation provided it does not include the use of force, nations could respond to offensive economic attacks via cyber-operations. Disrupting the legitimate development of another economy through cyber-operations is not likely to be justifiable even if they protect the attacker's economy. Disrupting another county's economy in order to develop one's own is even less likely justifiable. As discussed above, these cyber-operations can result in some retaliation as per Rule 21; however, for a response to be justified, sufficient attribution is required. Therefore, the capability of the victim to detect a cyber-operation designed for stealth and slow degradation of value chains may become the key factor as to whether a nation could retaliate.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nTo summarise, cyber-operations targeting commodity value chains are technically feasible. There is a legal grey area as to whether these cyber-operations will be considered as a use of force due to their limited impact, or whether a cyberattack in response to offensive cyber-operations that disrupt economic activity will be legally justified. Difficulties in detection and attribution may further hinder a nation's ability to respond or to retaliate. The use of cyber-operations for economic espionage may, however, be allowable based on the guidance of the documents considered. The authors do not condone such operations; however, their viability needs to be assessed to discuss (and, if necessary, prepare) appropriate responses.\n## Conclusion\nCyber-operations are a possible tool to conduct Economic Information Warfare. International trade in raw materials is based on commodity value chains; targeting these can be analogous to a limited traditional blockade on the commodity. The Cyber-Security Dilemma and Porter’s Five Forces Model are used to illustrate possible scenarios employing cyber-operations to target the commodity value chain. While it is technically feasible to conduct these attacks, the legalities thereof remain a contentious area, with a current emphasis on interpretations of IHL, balanced by specific obligations. Based on The Tallinn Manuals, the law of armed conflict would apply to cyber-operations, both nationally and internationally under certain conditions. Leetaru (2017) notes that the focus on “cyber warfare” in Tallinn 1.0 changed to “cyber-operations” in Tallinn 2.0, reflecting the complexities of operations in cyber-space, where cyberattacks often fall below the threshold of formal acts of war based on IHL. The main contention, therefore, remains the definition of what can be construed as an act of war in cyber-space. In the case of cyberattacks on commodity value chains, the scope of the attack is limited, and therefore will likely fall below the threshold of an act of war and limit a victim’s response options. Future research could look at the main efforts to develop cyber-legislation that falls within the ambit of IHL and apply this legislation to critical infrastructure protection\n## Acknowledgements\nThe first author received funding by the South African National Research Foundation, Grant no. 115059.",

There is also a growing consideration of vulnerabilities in the physical transportation infrastructure, which is comprised of a number of interlinking components that enable international trade in raw materials and consumer goods, known as commodity value chains. Through the use of scenario analysis and document analysis, this article investigates the feasibility and legal considerations of cyberattacks to target commodity value chains in order to further or protect national interests.\nKeywords: Commodity Value Chain, Critical Infrastructure Protection, Cyber-Operations, Economic Information Warfare (EIW), International Humanitarian Law (IHL)",
    "# Introduction": "The focus of the cyber-security efforts appears to be on the power and financial systems. However, the physical transport infrastructure is often not considered; and, if it is, the scope is limited. However, all trade of commodities and products is conducted via this infrastructure. In particular, commodities can be seen to have global value chains with specific trade corridors, allowing the commodity market to be affected by targeting the supporting transport infrastructure. Therefore, cyber-operations that disrupt the physical transport infrastructure can have significant economic consequences for the victim. One example is the impact the NotPetya ransomware had on the shipping company Maersk. Maersk's global operations were disrupted, and the company is estimated to have lost between $250 million to $300 million .\nJournal of Information Warfare (2019) 18.2: 31-48\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nThis article aims to investigate the feasibility of cyber-operations against the physical transport infrastructure as an aspect of Economic Information Warfare. The article is conceptual, using hypothetical examples, documents, and logical discussion to illustrate the technical and legal considerations for Economic Information Warfare (EIW) to gain or protect competitive economic advantage based on commodity trade. The basis of the discussion revolves around the Cyber-Security Dilemma and Porter's Five Forces models; by combining these models and using hypothetical scenarios, the article proposes a categorisation scheme for strategic cyber-operations against commodities to influence international trade. The Tallinn Manuals on international law and cyber-operations  are used to provide a discussion on the legal considerations of the proposed framework.\nThis paper provides background on Information Warfare, Economic Information Warfare, the Cyber-Security Dilemma, and The Tallinn Manuals. The commodity value chain and relevant models are then introduced. The feasibility of disrupting commodity value chains through cyber-operations are discussed using analysis of hypothetical scenarios. The Tallinn Manuals are then used to provide a legal perspective for targeting the commodity chains. This is followed by a discussion and conclusion.",
    "# Economic Information Warfare": "Lambert (2017) contrasts two types of economic warfare:\n- the traditional blockade or bombing of factories, a slow attrition designed to degrade the economy and a nation's warfighting capacity; and\n- economic warfare that targets the societal psychology, as proposed by the British prior to the First World War, in which global sea communications would be disrupted.\nThe latter was attempted at the outbreak of World War I but failed after being abandoned a few months later due to resistance by the British's own businesses; the former blockade style was employed during World War II by the German U-boats and in the U.S. submarine campaign against the Japanese . Deakin (2003) considers a number of tactics that can be conducted as economic warfare, including\n- Affecting trade conditions;\n- Affecting market liquidity;\n- Denying market access (such as embargoes or blockades);\n- Degrading market efficiency (for example, resulting in slower delivery of goods or services);\n- Degrading supply chains;\n- Degrading foreign markets;\n- Exploiting, denying, or degrading supporting infrastructure;\n- Exploiting, denying, degrading, or corrupting economic information.\nThe descriptions by both Deakin (2003) and Lambert (2017) include measures that directly affect the ability to trade commodities and other materials; this concept is key to this paper. Lambert (2017) notes that globalisation has resulted in the almost-immediate fluctuation of commodity prices due to predictions of supply excess or deficiencies.\nAs reliance on information technologies and their role in globalisation increased, the concept of Economic Information Warfare as an aspect of Information Warfare closely related to cyber operations emerged. Economic Information Warfare is considered to be the activities to control, protect, and potentially disrupt economic activity through information and information systems . Chatterji (2008) equates Economic Information Warfare with a version of economic blockade that would affect societies by restricting the flow of economic information.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nHowever, attacks on critical infrastructure can also have severe economic consequences .\nDeakin (2003) considers the relationship between protecting financial information systems from cyberattacks and national security. He concludes that there needs to be a redefinition of the term ‘national security’ (all that it means and encompasses) and that attacks resulting in the failure of critical financial systems could potentially be economically disastrous. Power grids are also potential targets that could have severe economic consequences if disrupted by cyber-operations. Lloyd’s and Centre for Risk Studies (2015) indicates that malware affecting 50 generators in the U.S. could potentially have an economic impact of $1 trillion. In 2015 and 2016, there were successful cyberattacks on the Ukrainian power grid, which caused a disruption in electricity supply . Power grids appear to attract more attacks: the U.S. ICS-CERT (c. 2017) shows that 17% of the investigated incidents affected the energy sector, 8% targeted the transportation sector, and 4% critical manufacturing.\nWheeler (2018) considers cyber warfare as having no rules; and with the growing prevalence of cyberattacks, there is an increased likelihood of strategic attacks against national economies. Cyber-operations that severely disrupt financial or power systems could be potentially devastating in terms of both the economic and societal implications. It is possible that such an attack would draw widespread condemnation and possibly military action in retaliation. Attacking commodity trade is ‘high-precision’ but more subtle, which would not be as broadly devastating. Such an attack is likely to fall short of sufficient grounds for military retaliation. Lambert (2017) cautions that the use of cyber-operations to cause economic effects could have the same result as the failed British economic warfare concept. (The parallel relies on the fact that sea communication was a developing concept at the time about which there was a lack of understanding, as is currently the case with cyber-security and cyber-operations.)\n## The Cyber-Security Dilemma\nThe Cyber-Security Dilemma is an evolution of the security dilemma or spiral model of international relations, which has been applied into the cyber-domain. Reuter (2011) considers the Cyber-Security Dilemma as measures taken by a nation to increase the security of its digital infrastructure, which then decreases the cyber-security of another country. He suggests that it is difficult to differentiate between offensive and defensive intentions in cyber-space, particularly because the techniques that are used are often very similar. Libicki (2016) suggests that the Cyber-Security Dilemma is not as prevalent as it appears to be; he considers most defensive actions in cyberspace are easily identified as such, except for the case of active defence. From an economics perspective, nations improving their cyber-security could benefit other states by reducing the number of staging points from which an attack may be launched.\nBuchanan (2017) provides an in-depth discussion of the Cyber-Security Dilemma. He indicates that there are legitimate defensive reasons to conduct network intrusions; at the same time, he concedes most nations would consider any intrusion into a sensitive network as threatening. While sensitive systems are considered, there is no explicit mention of cyber-physical systems, such as industrial control, in the considerations of the Cyber-Security Dilemma. In this context, the likelihood is that any penetration into these systems will be aggressive, as there is limited defensive val\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nue (in cyber-security terms) that an intruder can gain from affecting cyber-physical systems. There may, however, be economic reasons that make cyber-physical systems targets for intrusion, such as assessing the rate of manufacture or throughput of a product or attempting to discover industrial processes through cyber-espionage.\nFor the purposes of this paper, the concept that nations can take defensive actions which negatively affect the security of other nations is the one which will be considered. Later in the article, this concept will be modified and applied into an economic setting.\n## International cyber-operations and security frameworks\nInternational law has an important role regarding cyber-operations, especially when a cyber-operation is performed within the context of an international armed conflict . The Tallinn Manuals  provide in-depth non-binding analyses of applicability of existing international law to cyber-operations, including the areas of sovereignty, due diligence, jurisdiction, international responsibility, cyber-operations, and international human rights. These analyses were developed by international law experts to propose principles to govern cyber-warfare, including the elements of jus ad bellum (governing the use of force by a state as an instrument of its international policy), together with jus in bello (regulating the conduct of armed conflict). With the growing prevalence of cyberattacks, the concepts contained in The Tallinn Manuals have become of utmost interest.\nIn 2018, the Norm Package Singapore was developed by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) with the purpose of proposing best practices to safeguard a reliable Internet while recognising the interdependence of the global communities. It sought to prevent the consequences of any major disruption of the Internet and to promote ethical behaviour of all entities involved .\n## Commodity Value Chains\nThis section presents the basic principles that contribute towards the concept of commodity value chains, including Porter’s Five Forces Model.\n## The value chain\nThe value chain is considered to be a “system of interdependent activities, which are connected by linkages” (Porter &amp; Millar 1985). These activities can impact on each other’s effectiveness, and an optimised value-chain can be created by making trade-offs based on the various linkages.\nPorter and Millar (1985) consider the role of information and information technology in an organisation’s competitive advantage. In particular, the information and information technology impacts the linkages within the value chain. In addition to the greater speed at which traditionally information-related tasks can be performed, technology has improved the physical aspects of an organisation, particularly through improved automation, control, and monitoring of processes. In 1985, information technologies were considered to have increased rivalries, increased the threat of substitute products, and increased the power of buyers (Porter &amp; Millar 1985). This integration of information activities across businesses drove management information systems and enabled\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\ntraditional business processes and management activities (Laudon &amp; Laudon 2014), as is illustrated in Figure 1, below. For the purposes of this paper, the focus will be on concepts related to supply-chain management.\nFigure 1: Information activities in the value chain, adapted from Laudon &amp; Laudon (2014, p. 55)\nInformation technology continues to impact the value chains through greater connectivity and access to data in what has become known as the Digital Revolution (or the Fourth Industrial Revolution) based on hyper-connected devices or the Internet of Things that allows for unprecedented access to data and to control over processes.\n## Commodity value chains\nThe traditional value chains are designed for specific organisations within their competitive industries. However, with globalisation and mass exports and imports of various raw materials and manufactured goods, the concept of global commodity chains emerged, first coined by Gereffi in 1994 . The global commodity chain is different from the traditional value chain model in that an international component is included, and organisations need to coordinate the information, business, and management activities (from Figure 1, above) across multiple countries or regions .\nThe economies of some developing nations, such as in Africa, are based on raw material commodities (African Union [AU] 2017). In addition to the African economies' being dependent on commodities, it can be further detailed that these are agricultural commodities. For the development of value chains in this region, it was identified that competitive products need to be produced while reducing the transaction costs; efficiencies in the processing, marketing, and production functions are key to competitiveness .\nA European perspective of critical commodity value chains is based on raw minerals that support industrialisation and digitisation. In turn, the current digitisation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is key to developing and supporting these value chains. One of the key concerns for strategic mineral value chains is identified as the evolution and disruption brought about by this age of innovation, fuelled by rapid technological advancements (Faure-Schuyer, Egenhofer &amp; Elkerbout\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\n2018). Another key challenge that was identified is the ability to secure access to the necessary minerals, either through trade or by nations becoming self-sufficient (Faure-Schuyer, Egenhofer &amp; Elkerbout 2018). These challenges highlight important aspects of this paper: access to critical resources may not be as straightforward as it may seem, and the technological disruption may introduce vulnerabilities in the commodity chain that could be exploited by a competitor.\nFigure 2, below, illustrates a generalised commodity value chain. The material is mined or produced, transported to initial processing or refining, then loaded (often using conveyer belts or similar equipment) onto long-haul transport (road or rail) to be taken to the port, where it is loaded onto bulk carriers for export overseas. A corporate division controls or directs the various processes (denoted by the dashed arrows) and provides supportive processes.\nFigure 2: The commodity value chain",
    "# Porter's Five Forces Model": "Porter's Five Forces (also known as Competitive Forces) Model is a key model for strategic management, and describes external factors that affect an organisation's standing in its market environment :\n- Bargaining power of suppliers,\n- Bargaining power of customers,\n- Threat of new entrants,\n- Threat of substitute products,\n- Competitive rivalry.\nThese forces are illustrated in Figure 3, below. For the purposes of this paper, there is a focus on three of the forces: threat of new entrants, threat of substitute products, and competitive rivalry. The bargaining power of suppliers is implicit in some of the scenarios.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nFigure 3: Porter's Five Forces Model, adapted from Grundy (2006, p. 215) and Laudon &amp; Laudon (2014, p. 124)",
    "# Cyberattacks on the Commodity Value Chain": "Attacks can be leveraged against various points in the commodity value chain to achieve cascading effects. In particular, single points of failure in the value chain may prove to have greater impact on the commodity supply if they are successfully disrupted by cyberattacks. Industrial processes, transportation systems, and corporate decision making are all valid targets.\nThe industrial processes in a commodity value chain can include refineries or other processing of raw materials, mining equipment, and equipment to load and unload bulk cargo (such as conveyer belts) and containers onto trains, trucks, and ships. There have been a number of successful attacks on industrial control systems that have affected nuclear enrichment facilities (Stuxnet) or damaged a refinery, oil rigs, and chemical plants (Pretorius &amp; van Niekerk 2016). The transportation infrastructure has also seen successful cyberattacks affecting port scheduling and customs systems, sea-going vessels, tram and train ticketing systems; and vulnerabilities have been reported in many systems for rail and vessel navigation (van Niekerk 2017). These indicate that attacks against the industrial control systems and transportation systems are technically feasible.\nCorporate processes and decision making are also valid targets. This can be achieved through disrupting or corrupting the communications with clients and suppliers, thereby impacting the scheduling of trains, trucks, or vessels. By corrupting economic and business information, executives may make incorrect decisions, such as over-pricing material based on the incorrect information or ordering reduced production if they believe there is a surplus of materials. Corrupting main-\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\ntenance information can result in a lack of spare parts or critical equipment failures due to lack of maintenance. Corrupting individuals themselves through cyber-extortion of similar means can ensure poor decisions are made. These methods will be slower to perform than those that directly targeting the infrastructure. Figure 4, below, illustrates the attack points against the commodity value chain.\nFigure 4: Attacks on the commodity supply chain\nThe attacks described above are feasible; however, when considering large value chains, there may be a need to target multiple instances of systems across different organisations to be effective. Figure 5, below, provides an example in which there are two organisations, each with a headquarters controlling the mines (each with multiple pits and a refinery), with both rail and road transportation. Therefore, if one refinery fails due to a cyberattack, the others can carry a higher load. If trains are disrupted, trucks can be used as an alternative. This redundancy indicates that a cyberattack targeting a single point of failure will maximise the impact for less effort.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nFigure 5: Ports as a single point of failure\nAs is illustrated in Figure 5, above, the number of ports is usually limited, and only a few of those would handle a specific commodity. Therefore, targeting the ports will prove to be the most effective as this will impact on most of the land transportation and the mines' ability to supply material.\n## Scenarios\nThis section presents five hypothetical scenarios to illustrate possible situations leading to cyber-operations against aspects of the commodity value chain. The concept of defensive and offensive cyber-operations proposed in the Cyber-Security Dilemma are introduced in these scenarios.\n## Scenario 1\nCountry A discovers a deposit of strategic minerals, which has not previously been found in the country. Consequently, the unit price for the mineral has lowered; however, the country does not yet have the capacity to compete with more established exporters of the mineral that have standing trade agreements.\nThe main supplier of the mineral, Country B, has several co-located mines extracting the mineral, which is then transported to the coast mostly by train; transport by truck is possible, but is more expensive and slower. On the coast there is one port that has bulk-handling facilities to load the mineral onto the ships. There is also a multi-purpose terminal to allow for machinery spares to be imported for the port and the mines. The nearest city is approximately a two-hour drive from the port.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nCountry A decides that for it to be able to compete, it needs to secretly hinder Country B's ability to supply the mineral. To achieve this goal, a cyberattack against the control systems for the extraction process at the largest mine is undertaken, resulting in physical damage to key components in the process. As spares are difficult to procure, this action hinders production for months. Minor follow-up attacks affect the port's systems, randomly corrupting data on the loading of the vessel, necessitating manual confirmation of the recorded values thereby slowing down the turnaround time of vessels. This reduces the supply of the mineral from Country B, drives up prices, and leads some importers of the mineral to seek alternative sources—and ultimately turn to Country A.\nBy disrupting the regular supply of the major supplier of mineral, Country A has altered the status quo and has reduced the competitiveness of Country B due to the irregular supply. As the supply reduced, the price of the mineral increased, and Country A benefitted by providing the alternative supply. As Country A sought to increase its standing by altering the status quo, this can be considered an offensive operation in terms of Economic Information Warfare.\n## Scenario 2\nAs with Scenario 1, Country A discovers a deposit of strategic minerals, which has not previously been found in the country. Consequently, the unit price for the mineral has lowered; however, the country does not yet have the capacity to compete with more established exporters of the mineral that have standing trade agreements.\nThe main supplier of the mineral, Country B, becomes concerned that there is a new supplier and that its economic standing has been affected due to the discovery of the mineral deposit. A decision is made that, in order to maintain the status quo, Country A's ability to realise its potential as a supplier of the mineral needs to be disrupted. The main effort is to penetrate the project office's systems and alter the data and information, affecting the management activities related to the value chain. This results in delays in component deliveries, some design flaws requiring the re-manufacturing of components, and the gauge of the train tracks and the carriages to be mismatched. The project, therefore, faces major setbacks; and subtle design flaws in both hardware and firmware of the control systems cause erratic system behaviour and early component failure.\nAs the project is beset with apparent incompetence and glitches from the beginning, Country A is not considered a capable supplier, and importers of the mineral continued to favour Country B as the main exporter. Even though the deposit existed, Country A's inability to supply the commodity allowed the mineral price to almost return to its initial value. Country B's use of cyberattack can, therefore, be considered defensive as it maintained the status quo by protecting the country's standing and stabilising the cost of the mineral.\n## Scenario 3\nThere are two major exporters of oil into a contested region; both are established and are direct economic rivals. In order to assert dominance in the region, Exporter 1 launches cyberattacks against the pipelines of Exporter 2, reducing the flow of oil into the region. To make up for the shortfall, Exporter 1 supplies extra oil at a slightly cheaper rate, provided that there is a revised trade agreement which ultimately secures long-term export of oil into the region for Exporter 1.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nTo ensure this continues, Exporter 1 inserts a malicious remote access tool into the systems of Exporter 2's pipelines that will allow for future attacks that can cause an overpressure and rupture the pipelines.\nIn this scenario, a rival changes the economic status quo by affecting the main competitor's ability to supply oil. The cyber-operations are offensive in that the perpetrator actively seeks to gain long-term economic benefits from disrupting its competitors' operation.\n## Scenario 4\nIt is found that a strategic metal, Alloy A, can be replaced by another material, Alloy B. While Alloy B is not ideal, it is cheaper and easier to process and store. As a result, a number of major importers of Alloy A reduce their demand in favour of Alloy B. As with Scenario 2, a major exporter of Alloy B decides to disrupt the manufacture and export of the substitute alloy. This can be seen as defensive action as the original exporter is attempting to keep the status quo. Conversely, if the exporters of Alloy B attempted to disrupt the suppliers of the original material, as in Scenario 1, the effort would constitute offensive action as there is an attempt to change the status quo.\n## Scenario 5\nTwo new market entrants are vying for dominance. Using cyber-espionage, they seek to discover each other's processes in order to compete. This effort then turns to using cyber-operations to disrupt each other's ability to manufacture and supply. The economic and market information is corrupted in order to nudge the victim into making poor business decisions. In this case, the action is offensive, as both are seeking to gain an edge over the other and alter the status quo in the commodity market. This applies if one or both of the actors are providing substitute products.\n## Categorisation of cyber-operations on commodity value chains\nIt is technically feasible for cyber-operations to support or act as the primary weapon in Economic Information Warfare targeting specific commodity value chains. With the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the associated drives for hyper-connected systems, there are likely to be vulnerable systems at various points along the value chain. Table 2, below, aligns the various attack strategies to the stages of the value chain.\n|  Stage | Degrade | Deny | Disrupt | Exploit | Corrupt  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Source | X |  | X |  |   |\n|  Processing | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Loading | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Transport | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Port | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Commercial – decision making |  |  |  | X | X  |\n|  Commercial – access to economic information | X | X | X |  | X  |\nTable 2: Attack strategies per stage of the commodity value chain\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nTable 3, below, summarises the scenarios' categorisation in terms of the offensive or defensive nature of the cyber-operations based on the attacker and victim type (competitor, new entrant, or substitute) as per the Five Forces Model. Offensive actions can be considered as the cyber-operations aimed at changing the economic status in favour of the perpetrator, whereas defensive actions can be considered to be cyber-operations to maintain the perpetrator's current economic status.\n|   | Attacker  |   |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |   |  Competitor | New Entrant | Substitute  |\n|  Victim | Competitor | Offensive (S3) | Offensive (S1) | Offensive (S4b)  |\n|   |  New entrant | Defensive (S2) | Offensive (S5) | Offensive (S5)  |\n|   |  Substitute | Defensive (S4a) | Offensive (S5) | Offensive (S5)  |\nTable 3: Classification of attacks on a commodity value chain\nThe categorisations in Table 3 can play a part in deciding the legality of the actions and appropriate responses, based on the perceived intent of the actions. A defensive cyberattack can ultimately be interpreted as a response to other perceived economic attacks.",
    "# Legal Considerations for Cyber-Operations on Commodity Value Chains": "Can cyber-operations on commodity value chains be considered acts of war? Is there any legal recourse available, and can it be justified? The most difficult challenge is whether a cyberattack or cyber-operation invokes jus ad bellum. The Tallinn Manuals provide some explanation of the UN Charter in terms of cyber-operations and the key point of contention, the use of force. A cyber-operation will only invoke the UN Charter when its effects are similar or equivalent to that of a physical attack that would invoke the UN Charter. Goldsmith (2013) indicates that \"a cyber-attack that renders the electricity grid or air-traffic control system inoperable, and that as a result causes many deaths\" are cases that can be considered a use of force. However, there remains little clarity whether a slow, disruptive cyberattack on critical infrastructure that gradually renders it partially operable (such as Scenarios 1 and 2) can be deemed a use of force. In such scenarios, the question becomes how international law would apply when just one aspect of the value chain is attacked (such as Country B's corruption of Country A's project information to degrade the functioning of the value chain) and leads to an equivalent of a partial economic blockade. Therefore, a full economic shutdown (such as a power grid) can be considered an act of war, and armed retaliation may result; whereas targeting a value chain is not as severe, and the response needs to be proportional. However, The Singapore Norms, although not considered legislation, state as the first norm that \"State and non-state actors should not tamper with products and services in development and production, nor allow them to be tampered with, if doing so may substantially impair the stability of cyberspace\" . Norm six further states that, \"States should enact appropriate measures, including laws and regulations, to ensure basic cyber hygiene\" . Therefore, the Singapore Norms would consider cyber-operations targeting value chains as irresponsible, but the norms would also place responsibility on the nations to put measures in place to protect themselves.\nEconomic espionage and information theft (Scenario 5) are not considered to invoke the UN Char-\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nter, and Tallinn 2.0 (Rule 32) states that there remains no international law prohibiting the legalities of espionage . On the one hand, there is the actual legality of the espionage itself, and on the other hand is the legality of the method of the espionage, once again becoming a grey area. Economic espionage is usually considered under criminal law, and not International Humanitarian Law (IHL). The Singapore Norms recognise the need for military and intelligence cyber-operations ; therefore, a response to economic espionage is unlikely to include an attack.\nWith regards to sovereignty, Rule 21 of the Tallinn Manual states that a country under attack is permitted to conduct a cyber-operation that violates the sovereignty of the attacking country; furthermore, the illegality of the response is precluded and is, therefore, justified. However, Tallinn also states that any such recourse must preclude the use of force and should be proportionate . There also remains the condition of attribution, where there needs to be reasonable certainty of perpetration prior to response. The protection of one's own economy may not be sufficient justification for employing cyber-operations to disrupt the development of another country's economy (Scenarios 2 and 4a).\n## Discussion\nFrom the description of the cyberattacks on industrial control systems and those affecting the transportation sector, it is technically feasible to disrupt various stages in a commodity supply chain. From a legal perspective, there are a number of challenges regarding cyber-operations on commodity value chains. Whilst a catastrophic attack against a national economy can be considered an act of war, the legalities of partial disruptions described by the scenarios remain somewhat of a grey area. The Singapore Norm against tampering with products and services indicates that cyber-operations against commodity value chains are irresponsible and that states should refrain from such activities. However, given the legal grey area, it is feasible that states could attempt to disrupt value chains and escape significant or meaningful reprisal.\nFrom Table 3, above, seven of the nine possibilities can be considered offensive, indicating that a cyber-operation against a commodity value chain is more likely to be offensive in nature than defensive. This may influence the victim's interpretation of a cyber-operation, resulting in a situation in which the Cyber-Security Dilemma comes into being as the situation escalates. The guidance provided by The Tallinn Manuals and the Singapore Norms Package on the applicability of international law to cyber-operations as economic attacks raises the questions of whether the action was offensive or defensive or if retaliation to an offensive cyberattack can be legally justified. As Rule 21 of The Tallinn Manuals allows a state under attack to retaliate via a cyber-operation provided it does not include the use of force, nations could respond to offensive economic attacks via cyber-operations. Disrupting the legitimate development of another economy through cyber-operations is not likely to be justifiable even if they protect the attacker's economy. Disrupting another county's economy in order to develop one's own is even less likely justifiable. As discussed above, these cyber-operations can result in some retaliation as per Rule 21; however, for a response to be justified, sufficient attribution is required. Therefore, the capability of the victim to detect a cyber-operation designed for stealth and slow degradation of value chains may become the key factor as to whether a nation could retaliate.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nTo summarise, cyber-operations targeting commodity value chains are technically feasible. There is a legal grey area as to whether these cyber-operations will be considered as a use of force due to their limited impact, or whether a cyberattack in response to offensive cyber-operations that disrupt economic activity will be legally justified. Difficulties in detection and attribution may further hinder a nation's ability to respond or to retaliate. The use of cyber-operations for economic espionage may, however, be allowable based on the guidance of the documents considered. The authors do not condone such operations; however, their viability needs to be assessed to discuss (and, if necessary, prepare) appropriate responses.",
    "## Conclusion": "Cyber-operations are a possible tool to conduct Economic Information Warfare. International trade in raw materials is based on commodity value chains; targeting these can be analogous to a limited traditional blockade on the commodity. The Cyber-Security Dilemma and Porter’s Five Forces Model are used to illustrate possible scenarios employing cyber-operations to target the commodity value chain. While it is technically feasible to conduct these attacks, the legalities thereof remain a contentious area, with a current emphasis on interpretations of IHL, balanced by specific obligations. Based on The Tallinn Manuals, the law of armed conflict would apply to cyber-operations, both nationally and internationally under certain conditions. Leetaru (2017) notes that the focus on “cyber warfare” in Tallinn 1.0 changed to “cyber-operations” in Tallinn 2.0, reflecting the complexities of operations in cyber-space, where cyberattacks often fall below the threshold of formal acts of war based on IHL. The main contention, therefore, remains the definition of what can be construed as an act of war in cyber-space. In the case of cyberattacks on commodity value chains, the scope of the attack is limited, and therefore will likely fall below the threshold of an act of war and limit a victim’s response options. Future research could look at the main efforts to develop cyber-legislation that falls within the ambit of IHL and apply this legislation to critical infrastructure protection",

There is also a growing consideration of vulnerabilities in the physical transportation infrastructure, which is comprised of a number of interlinking components that enable international trade in raw materials and consumer goods, known as commodity value chains. Through the use of scenario analysis and document analysis, this article investigates the feasibility and legal considerations of cyberattacks to target commodity value chains in order to further or protect national interests.\nKeywords: Commodity Value Chain, Critical Infrastructure Protection, Cyber-Operations, Economic Information Warfare (EIW), International Humanitarian Law (IHL)\n# Introduction\nThe focus of the cyber-security efforts appears to be on the power and financial systems. However, the physical transport infrastructure is often not considered; and, if it is, the scope is limited. However, all trade of commodities and products is conducted via this infrastructure. In particular, commodities can be seen to have global value chains with specific trade corridors, allowing the commodity market to be affected by targeting the supporting transport infrastructure. Therefore, cyber-operations that disrupt the physical transport infrastructure can have significant economic consequences for the victim. One example is the impact the NotPetya ransomware had on the shipping company Maersk. Maersk's global operations were disrupted, and the company is estimated to have lost between $250 million to $300 million .\nJournal of Information Warfare (2019) 18.2: 31-48\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nThis article aims to investigate the feasibility of cyber-operations against the physical transport infrastructure as an aspect of Economic Information Warfare. The article is conceptual, using hypothetical examples, documents, and logical discussion to illustrate the technical and legal considerations for Economic Information Warfare (EIW) to gain or protect competitive economic advantage based on commodity trade. The basis of the discussion revolves around the Cyber-Security Dilemma and Porter's Five Forces models; by combining these models and using hypothetical scenarios, the article proposes a categorisation scheme for strategic cyber-operations against commodities to influence international trade. The Tallinn Manuals on international law and cyber-operations  are used to provide a discussion on the legal considerations of the proposed framework.\nThis paper provides background on Information Warfare, Economic Information Warfare, the Cyber-Security Dilemma, and The Tallinn Manuals. The commodity value chain and relevant models are then introduced. The feasibility of disrupting commodity value chains through cyber-operations are discussed using analysis of hypothetical scenarios. The Tallinn Manuals are then used to provide a legal perspective for targeting the commodity chains. This is followed by a discussion and conclusion.\n## Background\n### Information Warfare\n'Information Warfare' (IW) is regarded as consisting of tactics, techniques, and procedures used in the information domain to gain an advantage over an adversary during a period of conflict or competition . The information domain can be comprised of physical, logical (or virtual), and cognitive components , and, therefore, can be comprised of cyber-operations as well as other forms of conflict, such as psychological operations . Defensive Information Warfare can be seen to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems to authorised entities. Information Warfare strategies to attack include destroying data, manipulating/corrupting data, stealing/exploiting data, denying or disrupting access to data, altering the perceptions of the target population towards the data, or changing the context in which the data is viewed (Hutchinson &amp; Warren 2001). Table 1, below, illustrates these Information Warfare concepts.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\n|   | Aspects of Secure Information  |   |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |   |  Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability  |\n|  Domains | Cognitive |  | Alter perception\nAlter context |   |\n|   |  Logical | Exploit | Manipulate\nCorrupt | Deny\nDisrupt  |\n|   |  Physical | Steal | Damage | Destroy  |\nTable 1: Offensive Information Warfare Techniques\n# Economic Information Warfare\nLambert (2017) contrasts two types of economic warfare:\n- the traditional blockade or bombing of factories, a slow attrition designed to degrade the economy and a nation's warfighting capacity; and\n- economic warfare that targets the societal psychology, as proposed by the British prior to the First World War, in which global sea communications would be disrupted.\nThe latter was attempted at the outbreak of World War I but failed after being abandoned a few months later due to resistance by the British's own businesses; the former blockade style was employed during World War II by the German U-boats and in the U.S. submarine campaign against the Japanese . Deakin (2003) considers a number of tactics that can be conducted as economic warfare, including\n- Affecting trade conditions;\n- Affecting market liquidity;\n- Denying market access (such as embargoes or blockades);\n- Degrading market efficiency (for example, resulting in slower delivery of goods or services);\n- Degrading supply chains;\n- Degrading foreign markets;\n- Exploiting, denying, or degrading supporting infrastructure;\n- Exploiting, denying, degrading, or corrupting economic information.\nThe descriptions by both Deakin (2003) and Lambert (2017) include measures that directly affect the ability to trade commodities and other materials; this concept is key to this paper. Lambert (2017) notes that globalisation has resulted in the almost-immediate fluctuation of commodity prices due to predictions of supply excess or deficiencies.\nAs reliance on information technologies and their role in globalisation increased, the concept of Economic Information Warfare as an aspect of Information Warfare closely related to cyber operations emerged. Economic Information Warfare is considered to be the activities to control, protect, and potentially disrupt economic activity through information and information systems . Chatterji (2008) equates Economic Information Warfare with a version of economic blockade that would affect societies by restricting the flow of economic information.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nHowever, attacks on critical infrastructure can also have severe economic consequences .\nDeakin (2003) considers the relationship between protecting financial information systems from cyberattacks and national security. He concludes that there needs to be a redefinition of the term ‘national security’ (all that it means and encompasses) and that attacks resulting in the failure of critical financial systems could potentially be economically disastrous. Power grids are also potential targets that could have severe economic consequences if disrupted by cyber-operations. Lloyd’s and Centre for Risk Studies (2015) indicates that malware affecting 50 generators in the U.S. could potentially have an economic impact of $1 trillion. In 2015 and 2016, there were successful cyberattacks on the Ukrainian power grid, which caused a disruption in electricity supply . Power grids appear to attract more attacks: the U.S. ICS-CERT (c. 2017) shows that 17% of the investigated incidents affected the energy sector, 8% targeted the transportation sector, and 4% critical manufacturing.\nWheeler (2018) considers cyber warfare as having no rules; and with the growing prevalence of cyberattacks, there is an increased likelihood of strategic attacks against national economies. Cyber-operations that severely disrupt financial or power systems could be potentially devastating in terms of both the economic and societal implications. It is possible that such an attack would draw widespread condemnation and possibly military action in retaliation. Attacking commodity trade is ‘high-precision’ but more subtle, which would not be as broadly devastating. Such an attack is likely to fall short of sufficient grounds for military retaliation. Lambert (2017) cautions that the use of cyber-operations to cause economic effects could have the same result as the failed British economic warfare concept. (The parallel relies on the fact that sea communication was a developing concept at the time about which there was a lack of understanding, as is currently the case with cyber-security and cyber-operations.)\n## The Cyber-Security Dilemma\nThe Cyber-Security Dilemma is an evolution of the security dilemma or spiral model of international relations, which has been applied into the cyber-domain. Reuter (2011) considers the Cyber-Security Dilemma as measures taken by a nation to increase the security of its digital infrastructure, which then decreases the cyber-security of another country. He suggests that it is difficult to differentiate between offensive and defensive intentions in cyber-space, particularly because the techniques that are used are often very similar. Libicki (2016) suggests that the Cyber-Security Dilemma is not as prevalent as it appears to be; he considers most defensive actions in cyberspace are easily identified as such, except for the case of active defence. From an economics perspective, nations improving their cyber-security could benefit other states by reducing the number of staging points from which an attack may be launched.\nBuchanan (2017) provides an in-depth discussion of the Cyber-Security Dilemma. He indicates that there are legitimate defensive reasons to conduct network intrusions; at the same time, he concedes most nations would consider any intrusion into a sensitive network as threatening. While sensitive systems are considered, there is no explicit mention of cyber-physical systems, such as industrial control, in the considerations of the Cyber-Security Dilemma. In this context, the likelihood is that any penetration into these systems will be aggressive, as there is limited defensive val\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nue (in cyber-security terms) that an intruder can gain from affecting cyber-physical systems. There may, however, be economic reasons that make cyber-physical systems targets for intrusion, such as assessing the rate of manufacture or throughput of a product or attempting to discover industrial processes through cyber-espionage.\nFor the purposes of this paper, the concept that nations can take defensive actions which negatively affect the security of other nations is the one which will be considered. Later in the article, this concept will be modified and applied into an economic setting.\n## International cyber-operations and security frameworks\nInternational law has an important role regarding cyber-operations, especially when a cyber-operation is performed within the context of an international armed conflict . The Tallinn Manuals  provide in-depth non-binding analyses of applicability of existing international law to cyber-operations, including the areas of sovereignty, due diligence, jurisdiction, international responsibility, cyber-operations, and international human rights. These analyses were developed by international law experts to propose principles to govern cyber-warfare, including the elements of jus ad bellum (governing the use of force by a state as an instrument of its international policy), together with jus in bello (regulating the conduct of armed conflict). With the growing prevalence of cyberattacks, the concepts contained in The Tallinn Manuals have become of utmost interest.\nIn 2018, the Norm Package Singapore was developed by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) with the purpose of proposing best practices to safeguard a reliable Internet while recognising the interdependence of the global communities. It sought to prevent the consequences of any major disruption of the Internet and to promote ethical behaviour of all entities involved .\n## Commodity Value Chains\nThis section presents the basic principles that contribute towards the concept of commodity value chains, including Porter’s Five Forces Model.\n## The value chain\nThe value chain is considered to be a “system of interdependent activities, which are connected by linkages” (Porter &amp; Millar 1985). These activities can impact on each other’s effectiveness, and an optimised value-chain can be created by making trade-offs based on the various linkages.\nPorter and Millar (1985) consider the role of information and information technology in an organisation’s competitive advantage. In particular, the information and information technology impacts the linkages within the value chain. In addition to the greater speed at which traditionally information-related tasks can be performed, technology has improved the physical aspects of an organisation, particularly through improved automation, control, and monitoring of processes. In 1985, information technologies were considered to have increased rivalries, increased the threat of substitute products, and increased the power of buyers (Porter &amp; Millar 1985). This integration of information activities across businesses drove management information systems and enabled\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\ntraditional business processes and management activities (Laudon &amp; Laudon 2014), as is illustrated in Figure 1, below. For the purposes of this paper, the focus will be on concepts related to supply-chain management.\nFigure 1: Information activities in the value chain, adapted from Laudon &amp; Laudon (2014, p. 55)\nInformation technology continues to impact the value chains through greater connectivity and access to data in what has become known as the Digital Revolution (or the Fourth Industrial Revolution) based on hyper-connected devices or the Internet of Things that allows for unprecedented access to data and to control over processes.\n## Commodity value chains\nThe traditional value chains are designed for specific organisations within their competitive industries. However, with globalisation and mass exports and imports of various raw materials and manufactured goods, the concept of global commodity chains emerged, first coined by Gereffi in 1994 . The global commodity chain is different from the traditional value chain model in that an international component is included, and organisations need to coordinate the information, business, and management activities (from Figure 1, above) across multiple countries or regions .\nThe economies of some developing nations, such as in Africa, are based on raw material commodities (African Union [AU] 2017). In addition to the African economies' being dependent on commodities, it can be further detailed that these are agricultural commodities. For the development of value chains in this region, it was identified that competitive products need to be produced while reducing the transaction costs; efficiencies in the processing, marketing, and production functions are key to competitiveness .\nA European perspective of critical commodity value chains is based on raw minerals that support industrialisation and digitisation. In turn, the current digitisation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is key to developing and supporting these value chains. One of the key concerns for strategic mineral value chains is identified as the evolution and disruption brought about by this age of innovation, fuelled by rapid technological advancements (Faure-Schuyer, Egenhofer &amp; Elkerbout\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\n2018). Another key challenge that was identified is the ability to secure access to the necessary minerals, either through trade or by nations becoming self-sufficient (Faure-Schuyer, Egenhofer &amp; Elkerbout 2018). These challenges highlight important aspects of this paper: access to critical resources may not be as straightforward as it may seem, and the technological disruption may introduce vulnerabilities in the commodity chain that could be exploited by a competitor.\nFigure 2, below, illustrates a generalised commodity value chain. The material is mined or produced, transported to initial processing or refining, then loaded (often using conveyer belts or similar equipment) onto long-haul transport (road or rail) to be taken to the port, where it is loaded onto bulk carriers for export overseas. A corporate division controls or directs the various processes (denoted by the dashed arrows) and provides supportive processes.\nFigure 2: The commodity value chain\n# Porter's Five Forces Model\nPorter's Five Forces (also known as Competitive Forces) Model is a key model for strategic management, and describes external factors that affect an organisation's standing in its market environment :\n- Bargaining power of suppliers,\n- Bargaining power of customers,\n- Threat of new entrants,\n- Threat of substitute products,\n- Competitive rivalry.\nThese forces are illustrated in Figure 3, below. For the purposes of this paper, there is a focus on three of the forces: threat of new entrants, threat of substitute products, and competitive rivalry. The bargaining power of suppliers is implicit in some of the scenarios.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nFigure 3: Porter's Five Forces Model, adapted from Grundy (2006, p. 215) and Laudon &amp; Laudon (2014, p. 124)\n# Cyberattacks on the Commodity Value Chain\nAttacks can be leveraged against various points in the commodity value chain to achieve cascading effects. In particular, single points of failure in the value chain may prove to have greater impact on the commodity supply if they are successfully disrupted by cyberattacks. Industrial processes, transportation systems, and corporate decision making are all valid targets.\nThe industrial processes in a commodity value chain can include refineries or other processing of raw materials, mining equipment, and equipment to load and unload bulk cargo (such as conveyer belts) and containers onto trains, trucks, and ships. There have been a number of successful attacks on industrial control systems that have affected nuclear enrichment facilities (Stuxnet) or damaged a refinery, oil rigs, and chemical plants (Pretorius &amp; van Niekerk 2016). The transportation infrastructure has also seen successful cyberattacks affecting port scheduling and customs systems, sea-going vessels, tram and train ticketing systems; and vulnerabilities have been reported in many systems for rail and vessel navigation (van Niekerk 2017). These indicate that attacks against the industrial control systems and transportation systems are technically feasible.\nCorporate processes and decision making are also valid targets. This can be achieved through disrupting or corrupting the communications with clients and suppliers, thereby impacting the scheduling of trains, trucks, or vessels. By corrupting economic and business information, executives may make incorrect decisions, such as over-pricing material based on the incorrect information or ordering reduced production if they believe there is a surplus of materials. Corrupting main-\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\ntenance information can result in a lack of spare parts or critical equipment failures due to lack of maintenance. Corrupting individuals themselves through cyber-extortion of similar means can ensure poor decisions are made. These methods will be slower to perform than those that directly targeting the infrastructure. Figure 4, below, illustrates the attack points against the commodity value chain.\nFigure 4: Attacks on the commodity supply chain\nThe attacks described above are feasible; however, when considering large value chains, there may be a need to target multiple instances of systems across different organisations to be effective. Figure 5, below, provides an example in which there are two organisations, each with a headquarters controlling the mines (each with multiple pits and a refinery), with both rail and road transportation. Therefore, if one refinery fails due to a cyberattack, the others can carry a higher load. If trains are disrupted, trucks can be used as an alternative. This redundancy indicates that a cyberattack targeting a single point of failure will maximise the impact for less effort.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nFigure 5: Ports as a single point of failure\nAs is illustrated in Figure 5, above, the number of ports is usually limited, and only a few of those would handle a specific commodity. Therefore, targeting the ports will prove to be the most effective as this will impact on most of the land transportation and the mines' ability to supply material.\n## Scenarios\nThis section presents five hypothetical scenarios to illustrate possible situations leading to cyber-operations against aspects of the commodity value chain. The concept of defensive and offensive cyber-operations proposed in the Cyber-Security Dilemma are introduced in these scenarios.\n## Scenario 1\nCountry A discovers a deposit of strategic minerals, which has not previously been found in the country. Consequently, the unit price for the mineral has lowered; however, the country does not yet have the capacity to compete with more established exporters of the mineral that have standing trade agreements.\nThe main supplier of the mineral, Country B, has several co-located mines extracting the mineral, which is then transported to the coast mostly by train; transport by truck is possible, but is more expensive and slower. On the coast there is one port that has bulk-handling facilities to load the mineral onto the ships. There is also a multi-purpose terminal to allow for machinery spares to be imported for the port and the mines. The nearest city is approximately a two-hour drive from the port.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nCountry A decides that for it to be able to compete, it needs to secretly hinder Country B's ability to supply the mineral. To achieve this goal, a cyberattack against the control systems for the extraction process at the largest mine is undertaken, resulting in physical damage to key components in the process. As spares are difficult to procure, this action hinders production for months. Minor follow-up attacks affect the port's systems, randomly corrupting data on the loading of the vessel, necessitating manual confirmation of the recorded values thereby slowing down the turnaround time of vessels. This reduces the supply of the mineral from Country B, drives up prices, and leads some importers of the mineral to seek alternative sources—and ultimately turn to Country A.\nBy disrupting the regular supply of the major supplier of mineral, Country A has altered the status quo and has reduced the competitiveness of Country B due to the irregular supply. As the supply reduced, the price of the mineral increased, and Country A benefitted by providing the alternative supply. As Country A sought to increase its standing by altering the status quo, this can be considered an offensive operation in terms of Economic Information Warfare.\n## Scenario 2\nAs with Scenario 1, Country A discovers a deposit of strategic minerals, which has not previously been found in the country. Consequently, the unit price for the mineral has lowered; however, the country does not yet have the capacity to compete with more established exporters of the mineral that have standing trade agreements.\nThe main supplier of the mineral, Country B, becomes concerned that there is a new supplier and that its economic standing has been affected due to the discovery of the mineral deposit. A decision is made that, in order to maintain the status quo, Country A's ability to realise its potential as a supplier of the mineral needs to be disrupted. The main effort is to penetrate the project office's systems and alter the data and information, affecting the management activities related to the value chain. This results in delays in component deliveries, some design flaws requiring the re-manufacturing of components, and the gauge of the train tracks and the carriages to be mismatched. The project, therefore, faces major setbacks; and subtle design flaws in both hardware and firmware of the control systems cause erratic system behaviour and early component failure.\nAs the project is beset with apparent incompetence and glitches from the beginning, Country A is not considered a capable supplier, and importers of the mineral continued to favour Country B as the main exporter. Even though the deposit existed, Country A's inability to supply the commodity allowed the mineral price to almost return to its initial value. Country B's use of cyberattack can, therefore, be considered defensive as it maintained the status quo by protecting the country's standing and stabilising the cost of the mineral.\n## Scenario 3\nThere are two major exporters of oil into a contested region; both are established and are direct economic rivals. In order to assert dominance in the region, Exporter 1 launches cyberattacks against the pipelines of Exporter 2, reducing the flow of oil into the region. To make up for the shortfall, Exporter 1 supplies extra oil at a slightly cheaper rate, provided that there is a revised trade agreement which ultimately secures long-term export of oil into the region for Exporter 1.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nTo ensure this continues, Exporter 1 inserts a malicious remote access tool into the systems of Exporter 2's pipelines that will allow for future attacks that can cause an overpressure and rupture the pipelines.\nIn this scenario, a rival changes the economic status quo by affecting the main competitor's ability to supply oil. The cyber-operations are offensive in that the perpetrator actively seeks to gain long-term economic benefits from disrupting its competitors' operation.\n## Scenario 4\nIt is found that a strategic metal, Alloy A, can be replaced by another material, Alloy B. While Alloy B is not ideal, it is cheaper and easier to process and store. As a result, a number of major importers of Alloy A reduce their demand in favour of Alloy B. As with Scenario 2, a major exporter of Alloy B decides to disrupt the manufacture and export of the substitute alloy. This can be seen as defensive action as the original exporter is attempting to keep the status quo. Conversely, if the exporters of Alloy B attempted to disrupt the suppliers of the original material, as in Scenario 1, the effort would constitute offensive action as there is an attempt to change the status quo.\n## Scenario 5\nTwo new market entrants are vying for dominance. Using cyber-espionage, they seek to discover each other's processes in order to compete. This effort then turns to using cyber-operations to disrupt each other's ability to manufacture and supply. The economic and market information is corrupted in order to nudge the victim into making poor business decisions. In this case, the action is offensive, as both are seeking to gain an edge over the other and alter the status quo in the commodity market. This applies if one or both of the actors are providing substitute products.\n## Categorisation of cyber-operations on commodity value chains\nIt is technically feasible for cyber-operations to support or act as the primary weapon in Economic Information Warfare targeting specific commodity value chains. With the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the associated drives for hyper-connected systems, there are likely to be vulnerable systems at various points along the value chain. Table 2, below, aligns the various attack strategies to the stages of the value chain.\n|  Stage | Degrade | Deny | Disrupt | Exploit | Corrupt  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Source | X |  | X |  |   |\n|  Processing | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Loading | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Transport | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Port | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Commercial – decision making |  |  |  | X | X  |\n|  Commercial – access to economic information | X | X | X |  | X  |\nTable 2: Attack strategies per stage of the commodity value chain\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nTable 3, below, summarises the scenarios' categorisation in terms of the offensive or defensive nature of the cyber-operations based on the attacker and victim type (competitor, new entrant, or substitute) as per the Five Forces Model. Offensive actions can be considered as the cyber-operations aimed at changing the economic status in favour of the perpetrator, whereas defensive actions can be considered to be cyber-operations to maintain the perpetrator's current economic status.\n|   | Attacker  |   |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |   |  Competitor | New Entrant | Substitute  |\n|  Victim | Competitor | Offensive (S3) | Offensive (S1) | Offensive (S4b)  |\n|   |  New entrant | Defensive (S2) | Offensive (S5) | Offensive (S5)  |\n|   |  Substitute | Defensive (S4a) | Offensive (S5) | Offensive (S5)  |\nTable 3: Classification of attacks on a commodity value chain\nThe categorisations in Table 3 can play a part in deciding the legality of the actions and appropriate responses, based on the perceived intent of the actions. A defensive cyberattack can ultimately be interpreted as a response to other perceived economic attacks.\n# Legal Considerations for Cyber-Operations on Commodity Value Chains\nCan cyber-operations on commodity value chains be considered acts of war? Is there any legal recourse available, and can it be justified? The most difficult challenge is whether a cyberattack or cyber-operation invokes jus ad bellum. The Tallinn Manuals provide some explanation of the UN Charter in terms of cyber-operations and the key point of contention, the use of force. A cyber-operation will only invoke the UN Charter when its effects are similar or equivalent to that of a physical attack that would invoke the UN Charter. Goldsmith (2013) indicates that \"a cyber-attack that renders the electricity grid or air-traffic control system inoperable, and that as a result causes many deaths\" are cases that can be considered a use of force. However, there remains little clarity whether a slow, disruptive cyberattack on critical infrastructure that gradually renders it partially operable (such as Scenarios 1 and 2) can be deemed a use of force. In such scenarios, the question becomes how international law would apply when just one aspect of the value chain is attacked (such as Country B's corruption of Country A's project information to degrade the functioning of the value chain) and leads to an equivalent of a partial economic blockade. Therefore, a full economic shutdown (such as a power grid) can be considered an act of war, and armed retaliation may result; whereas targeting a value chain is not as severe, and the response needs to be proportional. However, The Singapore Norms, although not considered legislation, state as the first norm that \"State and non-state actors should not tamper with products and services in development and production, nor allow them to be tampered with, if doing so may substantially impair the stability of cyberspace\" . Norm six further states that, \"States should enact appropriate measures, including laws and regulations, to ensure basic cyber hygiene\" . Therefore, the Singapore Norms would consider cyber-operations targeting value chains as irresponsible, but the norms would also place responsibility on the nations to put measures in place to protect themselves.\nEconomic espionage and information theft (Scenario 5) are not considered to invoke the UN Char-\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nter, and Tallinn 2.0 (Rule 32) states that there remains no international law prohibiting the legalities of espionage . On the one hand, there is the actual legality of the espionage itself, and on the other hand is the legality of the method of the espionage, once again becoming a grey area. Economic espionage is usually considered under criminal law, and not International Humanitarian Law (IHL). The Singapore Norms recognise the need for military and intelligence cyber-operations ; therefore, a response to economic espionage is unlikely to include an attack.\nWith regards to sovereignty, Rule 21 of the Tallinn Manual states that a country under attack is permitted to conduct a cyber-operation that violates the sovereignty of the attacking country; furthermore, the illegality of the response is precluded and is, therefore, justified. However, Tallinn also states that any such recourse must preclude the use of force and should be proportionate . There also remains the condition of attribution, where there needs to be reasonable certainty of perpetration prior to response. The protection of one's own economy may not be sufficient justification for employing cyber-operations to disrupt the development of another country's economy (Scenarios 2 and 4a).\n## Discussion\nFrom the description of the cyberattacks on industrial control systems and those affecting the transportation sector, it is technically feasible to disrupt various stages in a commodity supply chain. From a legal perspective, there are a number of challenges regarding cyber-operations on commodity value chains. Whilst a catastrophic attack against a national economy can be considered an act of war, the legalities of partial disruptions described by the scenarios remain somewhat of a grey area. The Singapore Norm against tampering with products and services indicates that cyber-operations against commodity value chains are irresponsible and that states should refrain from such activities. However, given the legal grey area, it is feasible that states could attempt to disrupt value chains and escape significant or meaningful reprisal.\nFrom Table 3, above, seven of the nine possibilities can be considered offensive, indicating that a cyber-operation against a commodity value chain is more likely to be offensive in nature than defensive. This may influence the victim's interpretation of a cyber-operation, resulting in a situation in which the Cyber-Security Dilemma comes into being as the situation escalates. The guidance provided by The Tallinn Manuals and the Singapore Norms Package on the applicability of international law to cyber-operations as economic attacks raises the questions of whether the action was offensive or defensive or if retaliation to an offensive cyberattack can be legally justified. As Rule 21 of The Tallinn Manuals allows a state under attack to retaliate via a cyber-operation provided it does not include the use of force, nations could respond to offensive economic attacks via cyber-operations. Disrupting the legitimate development of another economy through cyber-operations is not likely to be justifiable even if they protect the attacker's economy. Disrupting another county's economy in order to develop one's own is even less likely justifiable. As discussed above, these cyber-operations can result in some retaliation as per Rule 21; however, for a response to be justified, sufficient attribution is required. Therefore, the capability of the victim to detect a cyber-operation designed for stealth and slow degradation of value chains may become the key factor as to whether a nation could retaliate.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nTo summarise, cyber-operations targeting commodity value chains are technically feasible. There is a legal grey area as to whether these cyber-operations will be considered as a use of force due to their limited impact, or whether a cyberattack in response to offensive cyber-operations that disrupt economic activity will be legally justified. Difficulties in detection and attribution may further hinder a nation's ability to respond or to retaliate. The use of cyber-operations for economic espionage may, however, be allowable based on the guidance of the documents considered. The authors do not condone such operations; however, their viability needs to be assessed to discuss (and, if necessary, prepare) appropriate responses.\n## Conclusion\nCyber-operations are a possible tool to conduct Economic Information Warfare. International trade in raw materials is based on commodity value chains; targeting these can be analogous to a limited traditional blockade on the commodity. The Cyber-Security Dilemma and Porter’s Five Forces Model are used to illustrate possible scenarios employing cyber-operations to target the commodity value chain. While it is technically feasible to conduct these attacks, the legalities thereof remain a contentious area, with a current emphasis on interpretations of IHL, balanced by specific obligations. Based on The Tallinn Manuals, the law of armed conflict would apply to cyber-operations, both nationally and internationally under certain conditions. Leetaru (2017) notes that the focus on “cyber warfare” in Tallinn 1.0 changed to “cyber-operations” in Tallinn 2.0, reflecting the complexities of operations in cyber-space, where cyberattacks often fall below the threshold of formal acts of war based on IHL. The main contention, therefore, remains the definition of what can be construed as an act of war in cyber-space. In the case of cyberattacks on commodity value chains, the scope of the attack is limited, and therefore will likely fall below the threshold of an act of war and limit a victim’s response options. Future research could look at the main efforts to develop cyber-legislation that falls within the ambit of IHL and apply this legislation to critical infrastructure protection\n## Acknowledgements\nThe first author received funding by the South African National Research Foundation, Grant no. 115059.",

There is also a growing consideration of vulnerabilities in the physical transportation infrastructure, which is comprised of a number of interlinking components that enable international trade in raw materials and consumer goods, known as commodity value chains. Through the use of scenario analysis and document analysis, this article investigates the feasibility and legal considerations of cyberattacks to target commodity value chains in order to further or protect national interests.\nKeywords: Commodity Value Chain, Critical Infrastructure Protection, Cyber-Operations, Economic Information Warfare (EIW), International Humanitarian Law (IHL)\n# Introduction\nThe focus of the cyber-security efforts appears to be on the power and financial systems. However, the physical transport infrastructure is often not considered; and, if it is, the scope is limited. However, all trade of commodities and products is conducted via this infrastructure. In particular, commodities can be seen to have global value chains with specific trade corridors, allowing the commodity market to be affected by targeting the supporting transport infrastructure. Therefore, cyber-operations that disrupt the physical transport infrastructure can have significant economic consequences for the victim. One example is the impact the NotPetya ransomware had on the shipping company Maersk. Maersk's global operations were disrupted, and the company is estimated to have lost between $250 million to $300 million (Cimpanu 2018).\nJournal of Information Warfare (2019) 18.2: 31-48\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nThis article aims to investigate the feasibility of cyber-operations against the physical transport infrastructure as an aspect of Economic Information Warfare. The article is conceptual, using hypothetical examples, documents, and logical discussion to illustrate the technical and legal considerations for Economic Information Warfare (EIW) to gain or protect competitive economic advantage based on commodity trade. The basis of the discussion revolves around the Cyber-Security Dilemma and Porter's Five Forces models; by combining these models and using hypothetical scenarios, the article proposes a categorisation scheme for strategic cyber-operations against commodities to influence international trade. The Tallinn Manuals on international law and cyber-operations (Schmitt 2013; Schmitt 2017) are used to provide a discussion on the legal considerations of the proposed framework.\nThis paper provides background on Information Warfare, Economic Information Warfare, the Cyber-Security Dilemma, and The Tallinn Manuals. The commodity value chain and relevant models are then introduced. The feasibility of disrupting commodity value chains through cyber-operations are discussed using analysis of hypothetical scenarios. The Tallinn Manuals are then used to provide a legal perspective for targeting the commodity chains. This is followed by a discussion and conclusion.\n## Background\n### Information Warfare\n'Information Warfare' (IW) is regarded as consisting of tactics, techniques, and procedures used in the information domain to gain an advantage over an adversary during a period of conflict or competition (Brazzoli 2007; Stupples 2015). The information domain can be comprised of physical, logical (or virtual), and cognitive components (Brazzoli 2007), and, therefore, can be comprised of cyber-operations as well as other forms of conflict, such as psychological operations (Brazzoli 2007; Stupples 2015). Defensive Information Warfare can be seen to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems to authorised entities. Information Warfare strategies to attack include destroying data, manipulating/corrupting data, stealing/exploiting data, denying or disrupting access to data, altering the perceptions of the target population towards the data, or changing the context in which the data is viewed (Hutchinson &amp; Warren 2001). Table 1, below, illustrates these Information Warfare concepts.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\n|   | Aspects of Secure Information  |   |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |   |  Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability  |\n|  Domains | Cognitive |  | Alter perception\nAlter context |   |\n|   |  Logical | Exploit | Manipulate\nCorrupt | Deny\nDisrupt  |\n|   |  Physical | Steal | Damage | Destroy  |\nTable 1: Offensive Information Warfare Techniques\n# Economic Information Warfare\nLambert (2017) contrasts two types of economic warfare:\n- the traditional blockade or bombing of factories, a slow attrition designed to degrade the economy and a nation's warfighting capacity; and\n- economic warfare that targets the societal psychology, as proposed by the British prior to the First World War, in which global sea communications would be disrupted.\nThe latter was attempted at the outbreak of World War I but failed after being abandoned a few months later due to resistance by the British's own businesses; the former blockade style was employed during World War II by the German U-boats and in the U.S. submarine campaign against the Japanese (Lambert 2017). Deakin (2003) considers a number of tactics that can be conducted as economic warfare, including\n- Affecting trade conditions;\n- Affecting market liquidity;\n- Denying market access (such as embargoes or blockades);\n- Degrading market efficiency (for example, resulting in slower delivery of goods or services);\n- Degrading supply chains;\n- Degrading foreign markets;\n- Exploiting, denying, or degrading supporting infrastructure;\n- Exploiting, denying, degrading, or corrupting economic information.\nThe descriptions by both Deakin (2003) and Lambert (2017) include measures that directly affect the ability to trade commodities and other materials; this concept is key to this paper. Lambert (2017) notes that globalisation has resulted in the almost-immediate fluctuation of commodity prices due to predictions of supply excess or deficiencies.\nAs reliance on information technologies and their role in globalisation increased, the concept of Economic Information Warfare as an aspect of Information Warfare closely related to cyber operations emerged. Economic Information Warfare is considered to be the activities to control, protect, and potentially disrupt economic activity through information and information systems (Chatterji 2008; Libicki 1995). Chatterji (2008) equates Economic Information Warfare with a version of economic blockade that would affect societies by restricting the flow of economic information.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nHowever, attacks on critical infrastructure can also have severe economic consequences (Caldeira et al. 2015).\nDeakin (2003) considers the relationship between protecting financial information systems from cyberattacks and national security. He concludes that there needs to be a redefinition of the term ‘national security’ (all that it means and encompasses) and that attacks resulting in the failure of critical financial systems could potentially be economically disastrous. Power grids are also potential targets that could have severe economic consequences if disrupted by cyber-operations. Lloyd’s and Centre for Risk Studies (2015) indicates that malware affecting 50 generators in the U.S. could potentially have an economic impact of $1 trillion. In 2015 and 2016, there were successful cyberattacks on the Ukrainian power grid, which caused a disruption in electricity supply (Patterson 2017). Power grids appear to attract more attacks: the U.S. ICS-CERT (c. 2017) shows that 17% of the investigated incidents affected the energy sector, 8% targeted the transportation sector, and 4% critical manufacturing.\nWheeler (2018) considers cyber warfare as having no rules; and with the growing prevalence of cyberattacks, there is an increased likelihood of strategic attacks against national economies. Cyber-operations that severely disrupt financial or power systems could be potentially devastating in terms of both the economic and societal implications. It is possible that such an attack would draw widespread condemnation and possibly military action in retaliation. Attacking commodity trade is ‘high-precision’ but more subtle, which would not be as broadly devastating. Such an attack is likely to fall short of sufficient grounds for military retaliation. Lambert (2017) cautions that the use of cyber-operations to cause economic effects could have the same result as the failed British economic warfare concept. (The parallel relies on the fact that sea communication was a developing concept at the time about which there was a lack of understanding, as is currently the case with cyber-security and cyber-operations.)\n## The Cyber-Security Dilemma\nThe Cyber-Security Dilemma is an evolution of the security dilemma or spiral model of international relations, which has been applied into the cyber-domain. Reuter (2011) considers the Cyber-Security Dilemma as measures taken by a nation to increase the security of its digital infrastructure, which then decreases the cyber-security of another country. He suggests that it is difficult to differentiate between offensive and defensive intentions in cyber-space, particularly because the techniques that are used are often very similar. Libicki (2016) suggests that the Cyber-Security Dilemma is not as prevalent as it appears to be; he considers most defensive actions in cyberspace are easily identified as such, except for the case of active defence. From an economics perspective, nations improving their cyber-security could benefit other states by reducing the number of staging points from which an attack may be launched.\nBuchanan (2017) provides an in-depth discussion of the Cyber-Security Dilemma. He indicates that there are legitimate defensive reasons to conduct network intrusions; at the same time, he concedes most nations would consider any intrusion into a sensitive network as threatening. While sensitive systems are considered, there is no explicit mention of cyber-physical systems, such as industrial control, in the considerations of the Cyber-Security Dilemma. In this context, the likelihood is that any penetration into these systems will be aggressive, as there is limited defensive val\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nue (in cyber-security terms) that an intruder can gain from affecting cyber-physical systems. There may, however, be economic reasons that make cyber-physical systems targets for intrusion, such as assessing the rate of manufacture or throughput of a product or attempting to discover industrial processes through cyber-espionage.\nFor the purposes of this paper, the concept that nations can take defensive actions which negatively affect the security of other nations is the one which will be considered. Later in the article, this concept will be modified and applied into an economic setting.\n## International cyber-operations and security frameworks\nInternational law has an important role regarding cyber-operations, especially when a cyber-operation is performed within the context of an international armed conflict (Boyle 2012). The Tallinn Manuals (Schmitt 2013; Schmitt 2017) provide in-depth non-binding analyses of applicability of existing international law to cyber-operations, including the areas of sovereignty, due diligence, jurisdiction, international responsibility, cyber-operations, and international human rights. These analyses were developed by international law experts to propose principles to govern cyber-warfare, including the elements of jus ad bellum (governing the use of force by a state as an instrument of its international policy), together with jus in bello (regulating the conduct of armed conflict). With the growing prevalence of cyberattacks, the concepts contained in The Tallinn Manuals have become of utmost interest.\nIn 2018, the Norm Package Singapore was developed by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) with the purpose of proposing best practices to safeguard a reliable Internet while recognising the interdependence of the global communities. It sought to prevent the consequences of any major disruption of the Internet and to promote ethical behaviour of all entities involved (GCSC 2018).\n## Commodity Value Chains\nThis section presents the basic principles that contribute towards the concept of commodity value chains, including Porter’s Five Forces Model.\n## The value chain\nThe value chain is considered to be a “system of interdependent activities, which are connected by linkages” (Porter &amp; Millar 1985). These activities can impact on each other’s effectiveness, and an optimised value-chain can be created by making trade-offs based on the various linkages.\nPorter and Millar (1985) consider the role of information and information technology in an organisation’s competitive advantage. In particular, the information and information technology impacts the linkages within the value chain. In addition to the greater speed at which traditionally information-related tasks can be performed, technology has improved the physical aspects of an organisation, particularly through improved automation, control, and monitoring of processes. In 1985, information technologies were considered to have increased rivalries, increased the threat of substitute products, and increased the power of buyers (Porter &amp; Millar 1985). This integration of information activities across businesses drove management information systems and enabled\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\ntraditional business processes and management activities (Laudon &amp; Laudon 2014), as is illustrated in Figure 1, below. For the purposes of this paper, the focus will be on concepts related to supply-chain management.\nFigure 1: Information activities in the value chain, adapted from Laudon &amp; Laudon (2014, p. 55)\nInformation technology continues to impact the value chains through greater connectivity and access to data in what has become known as the Digital Revolution (or the Fourth Industrial Revolution) based on hyper-connected devices or the Internet of Things that allows for unprecedented access to data and to control over processes.\n## Commodity value chains\nThe traditional value chains are designed for specific organisations within their competitive industries. However, with globalisation and mass exports and imports of various raw materials and manufactured goods, the concept of global commodity chains emerged, first coined by Gereffi in 1994 (Kaplinsky 2004). The global commodity chain is different from the traditional value chain model in that an international component is included, and organisations need to coordinate the information, business, and management activities (from Figure 1, above) across multiple countries or regions (Kaplinsky 2004).\nThe economies of some developing nations, such as in Africa, are based on raw material commodities (African Union [AU] 2017). In addition to the African economies' being dependent on commodities, it can be further detailed that these are agricultural commodities. For the development of value chains in this region, it was identified that competitive products need to be produced while reducing the transaction costs; efficiencies in the processing, marketing, and production functions are key to competitiveness (AU 2017).\nA European perspective of critical commodity value chains is based on raw minerals that support industrialisation and digitisation. In turn, the current digitisation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is key to developing and supporting these value chains. One of the key concerns for strategic mineral value chains is identified as the evolution and disruption brought about by this age of innovation, fuelled by rapid technological advancements (Faure-Schuyer, Egenhofer &amp; Elkerbout\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\n2018). Another key challenge that was identified is the ability to secure access to the necessary minerals, either through trade or by nations becoming self-sufficient (Faure-Schuyer, Egenhofer &amp; Elkerbout 2018). These challenges highlight important aspects of this paper: access to critical resources may not be as straightforward as it may seem, and the technological disruption may introduce vulnerabilities in the commodity chain that could be exploited by a competitor.\nFigure 2, below, illustrates a generalised commodity value chain. The material is mined or produced, transported to initial processing or refining, then loaded (often using conveyer belts or similar equipment) onto long-haul transport (road or rail) to be taken to the port, where it is loaded onto bulk carriers for export overseas. A corporate division controls or directs the various processes (denoted by the dashed arrows) and provides supportive processes.\nFigure 2: The commodity value chain\n# Porter's Five Forces Model\nPorter's Five Forces (also known as Competitive Forces) Model is a key model for strategic management, and describes external factors that affect an organisation's standing in its market environment (Grundy 2006; Laudon &amp; Laudon 2014):\n- Bargaining power of suppliers,\n- Bargaining power of customers,\n- Threat of new entrants,\n- Threat of substitute products,\n- Competitive rivalry.\nThese forces are illustrated in Figure 3, below. For the purposes of this paper, there is a focus on three of the forces: threat of new entrants, threat of substitute products, and competitive rivalry. The bargaining power of suppliers is implicit in some of the scenarios.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nFigure 3: Porter's Five Forces Model, adapted from Grundy (2006, p. 215) and Laudon &amp; Laudon (2014, p. 124)\n# Cyberattacks on the Commodity Value Chain\nAttacks can be leveraged against various points in the commodity value chain to achieve cascading effects. In particular, single points of failure in the value chain may prove to have greater impact on the commodity supply if they are successfully disrupted by cyberattacks. Industrial processes, transportation systems, and corporate decision making are all valid targets.\nThe industrial processes in a commodity value chain can include refineries or other processing of raw materials, mining equipment, and equipment to load and unload bulk cargo (such as conveyer belts) and containers onto trains, trucks, and ships. There have been a number of successful attacks on industrial control systems that have affected nuclear enrichment facilities (Stuxnet) or damaged a refinery, oil rigs, and chemical plants (Pretorius &amp; van Niekerk 2016). The transportation infrastructure has also seen successful cyberattacks affecting port scheduling and customs systems, sea-going vessels, tram and train ticketing systems; and vulnerabilities have been reported in many systems for rail and vessel navigation (van Niekerk 2017). These indicate that attacks against the industrial control systems and transportation systems are technically feasible.\nCorporate processes and decision making are also valid targets. This can be achieved through disrupting or corrupting the communications with clients and suppliers, thereby impacting the scheduling of trains, trucks, or vessels. By corrupting economic and business information, executives may make incorrect decisions, such as over-pricing material based on the incorrect information or ordering reduced production if they believe there is a surplus of materials. Corrupting main-\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\ntenance information can result in a lack of spare parts or critical equipment failures due to lack of maintenance. Corrupting individuals themselves through cyber-extortion of similar means can ensure poor decisions are made. These methods will be slower to perform than those that directly targeting the infrastructure. Figure 4, below, illustrates the attack points against the commodity value chain.\nFigure 4: Attacks on the commodity supply chain\nThe attacks described above are feasible; however, when considering large value chains, there may be a need to target multiple instances of systems across different organisations to be effective. Figure 5, below, provides an example in which there are two organisations, each with a headquarters controlling the mines (each with multiple pits and a refinery), with both rail and road transportation. Therefore, if one refinery fails due to a cyberattack, the others can carry a higher load. If trains are disrupted, trucks can be used as an alternative. This redundancy indicates that a cyberattack targeting a single point of failure will maximise the impact for less effort.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nFigure 5: Ports as a single point of failure\nAs is illustrated in Figure 5, above, the number of ports is usually limited, and only a few of those would handle a specific commodity. Therefore, targeting the ports will prove to be the most effective as this will impact on most of the land transportation and the mines' ability to supply material.\n## Scenarios\nThis section presents five hypothetical scenarios to illustrate possible situations leading to cyber-operations against aspects of the commodity value chain. The concept of defensive and offensive cyber-operations proposed in the Cyber-Security Dilemma are introduced in these scenarios.\n## Scenario 1\nCountry A discovers a deposit of strategic minerals, which has not previously been found in the country. Consequently, the unit price for the mineral has lowered; however, the country does not yet have the capacity to compete with more established exporters of the mineral that have standing trade agreements.\nThe main supplier of the mineral, Country B, has several co-located mines extracting the mineral, which is then transported to the coast mostly by train; transport by truck is possible, but is more expensive and slower. On the coast there is one port that has bulk-handling facilities to load the mineral onto the ships. There is also a multi-purpose terminal to allow for machinery spares to be imported for the port and the mines. The nearest city is approximately a two-hour drive from the port.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nCountry A decides that for it to be able to compete, it needs to secretly hinder Country B's ability to supply the mineral. To achieve this goal, a cyberattack against the control systems for the extraction process at the largest mine is undertaken, resulting in physical damage to key components in the process. As spares are difficult to procure, this action hinders production for months. Minor follow-up attacks affect the port's systems, randomly corrupting data on the loading of the vessel, necessitating manual confirmation of the recorded values thereby slowing down the turnaround time of vessels. This reduces the supply of the mineral from Country B, drives up prices, and leads some importers of the mineral to seek alternative sources—and ultimately turn to Country A.\nBy disrupting the regular supply of the major supplier of mineral, Country A has altered the status quo and has reduced the competitiveness of Country B due to the irregular supply. As the supply reduced, the price of the mineral increased, and Country A benefitted by providing the alternative supply. As Country A sought to increase its standing by altering the status quo, this can be considered an offensive operation in terms of Economic Information Warfare.\n## Scenario 2\nAs with Scenario 1, Country A discovers a deposit of strategic minerals, which has not previously been found in the country. Consequently, the unit price for the mineral has lowered; however, the country does not yet have the capacity to compete with more established exporters of the mineral that have standing trade agreements.\nThe main supplier of the mineral, Country B, becomes concerned that there is a new supplier and that its economic standing has been affected due to the discovery of the mineral deposit. A decision is made that, in order to maintain the status quo, Country A's ability to realise its potential as a supplier of the mineral needs to be disrupted. The main effort is to penetrate the project office's systems and alter the data and information, affecting the management activities related to the value chain. This results in delays in component deliveries, some design flaws requiring the re-manufacturing of components, and the gauge of the train tracks and the carriages to be mismatched. The project, therefore, faces major setbacks; and subtle design flaws in both hardware and firmware of the control systems cause erratic system behaviour and early component failure.\nAs the project is beset with apparent incompetence and glitches from the beginning, Country A is not considered a capable supplier, and importers of the mineral continued to favour Country B as the main exporter. Even though the deposit existed, Country A's inability to supply the commodity allowed the mineral price to almost return to its initial value. Country B's use of cyberattack can, therefore, be considered defensive as it maintained the status quo by protecting the country's standing and stabilising the cost of the mineral.\n## Scenario 3\nThere are two major exporters of oil into a contested region; both are established and are direct economic rivals. In order to assert dominance in the region, Exporter 1 launches cyberattacks against the pipelines of Exporter 2, reducing the flow of oil into the region. To make up for the shortfall, Exporter 1 supplies extra oil at a slightly cheaper rate, provided that there is a revised trade agreement which ultimately secures long-term export of oil into the region for Exporter 1.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nTo ensure this continues, Exporter 1 inserts a malicious remote access tool into the systems of Exporter 2's pipelines that will allow for future attacks that can cause an overpressure and rupture the pipelines.\nIn this scenario, a rival changes the economic status quo by affecting the main competitor's ability to supply oil. The cyber-operations are offensive in that the perpetrator actively seeks to gain long-term economic benefits from disrupting its competitors' operation.\n## Scenario 4\nIt is found that a strategic metal, Alloy A, can be replaced by another material, Alloy B. While Alloy B is not ideal, it is cheaper and easier to process and store. As a result, a number of major importers of Alloy A reduce their demand in favour of Alloy B. As with Scenario 2, a major exporter of Alloy B decides to disrupt the manufacture and export of the substitute alloy. This can be seen as defensive action as the original exporter is attempting to keep the status quo. Conversely, if the exporters of Alloy B attempted to disrupt the suppliers of the original material, as in Scenario 1, the effort would constitute offensive action as there is an attempt to change the status quo.\n## Scenario 5\nTwo new market entrants are vying for dominance. Using cyber-espionage, they seek to discover each other's processes in order to compete. This effort then turns to using cyber-operations to disrupt each other's ability to manufacture and supply. The economic and market information is corrupted in order to nudge the victim into making poor business decisions. In this case, the action is offensive, as both are seeking to gain an edge over the other and alter the status quo in the commodity market. This applies if one or both of the actors are providing substitute products.\n## Categorisation of cyber-operations on commodity value chains\nIt is technically feasible for cyber-operations to support or act as the primary weapon in Economic Information Warfare targeting specific commodity value chains. With the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the associated drives for hyper-connected systems, there are likely to be vulnerable systems at various points along the value chain. Table 2, below, aligns the various attack strategies to the stages of the value chain.\n|  Stage | Degrade | Deny | Disrupt | Exploit | Corrupt  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Source | X |  | X |  |   |\n|  Processing | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Loading | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Transport | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Port | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Commercial – decision making |  |  |  | X | X  |\n|  Commercial – access to economic information | X | X | X |  | X  |\nTable 2: Attack strategies per stage of the commodity value chain\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nTable 3, below, summarises the scenarios' categorisation in terms of the offensive or defensive nature of the cyber-operations based on the attacker and victim type (competitor, new entrant, or substitute) as per the Five Forces Model. Offensive actions can be considered as the cyber-operations aimed at changing the economic status in favour of the perpetrator, whereas defensive actions can be considered to be cyber-operations to maintain the perpetrator's current economic status.\n|   | Attacker  |   |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |   |  Competitor | New Entrant | Substitute  |\n|  Victim | Competitor | Offensive (S3) | Offensive (S1) | Offensive (S4b)  |\n|   |  New entrant | Defensive (S2) | Offensive (S5) | Offensive (S5)  |\n|   |  Substitute | Defensive (S4a) | Offensive (S5) | Offensive (S5)  |\nTable 3: Classification of attacks on a commodity value chain\nThe categorisations in Table 3 can play a part in deciding the legality of the actions and appropriate responses, based on the perceived intent of the actions. A defensive cyberattack can ultimately be interpreted as a response to other perceived economic attacks.\n# Legal Considerations for Cyber-Operations on Commodity Value Chains\nCan cyber-operations on commodity value chains be considered acts of war? Is there any legal recourse available, and can it be justified? The most difficult challenge is whether a cyberattack or cyber-operation invokes jus ad bellum. The Tallinn Manuals provide some explanation of the UN Charter in terms of cyber-operations and the key point of contention, the use of force. A cyber-operation will only invoke the UN Charter when its effects are similar or equivalent to that of a physical attack that would invoke the UN Charter. Goldsmith (2013) indicates that \"a cyber-attack that renders the electricity grid or air-traffic control system inoperable, and that as a result causes many deaths\" are cases that can be considered a use of force. However, there remains little clarity whether a slow, disruptive cyberattack on critical infrastructure that gradually renders it partially operable (such as Scenarios 1 and 2) can be deemed a use of force. In such scenarios, the question becomes how international law would apply when just one aspect of the value chain is attacked (such as Country B's corruption of Country A's project information to degrade the functioning of the value chain) and leads to an equivalent of a partial economic blockade. Therefore, a full economic shutdown (such as a power grid) can be considered an act of war, and armed retaliation may result; whereas targeting a value chain is not as severe, and the response needs to be proportional. However, The Singapore Norms, although not considered legislation, state as the first norm that \"State and non-state actors should not tamper with products and services in development and production, nor allow them to be tampered with, if doing so may substantially impair the stability of cyberspace\" (GCSC 2018). Norm six further states that, \"States should enact appropriate measures, including laws and regulations, to ensure basic cyber hygiene\" (GCSC 2018). Therefore, the Singapore Norms would consider cyber-operations targeting value chains as irresponsible, but the norms would also place responsibility on the nations to put measures in place to protect themselves.\nEconomic espionage and information theft (Scenario 5) are not considered to invoke the UN Char-\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nter, and Tallinn 2.0 (Rule 32) states that there remains no international law prohibiting the legalities of espionage (Schmitt 2017). On the one hand, there is the actual legality of the espionage itself, and on the other hand is the legality of the method of the espionage, once again becoming a grey area. Economic espionage is usually considered under criminal law, and not International Humanitarian Law (IHL). The Singapore Norms recognise the need for military and intelligence cyber-operations (GCSC 2018); therefore, a response to economic espionage is unlikely to include an attack.\nWith regards to sovereignty, Rule 21 of the Tallinn Manual states that a country under attack is permitted to conduct a cyber-operation that violates the sovereignty of the attacking country; furthermore, the illegality of the response is precluded and is, therefore, justified. However, Tallinn also states that any such recourse must preclude the use of force and should be proportionate (Schmitt 2013). There also remains the condition of attribution, where there needs to be reasonable certainty of perpetration prior to response. The protection of one's own economy may not be sufficient justification for employing cyber-operations to disrupt the development of another country's economy (Scenarios 2 and 4a).\n## Discussion\nFrom the description of the cyberattacks on industrial control systems and those affecting the transportation sector, it is technically feasible to disrupt various stages in a commodity supply chain. From a legal perspective, there are a number of challenges regarding cyber-operations on commodity value chains. Whilst a catastrophic attack against a national economy can be considered an act of war, the legalities of partial disruptions described by the scenarios remain somewhat of a grey area. The Singapore Norm against tampering with products and services indicates that cyber-operations against commodity value chains are irresponsible and that states should refrain from such activities. However, given the legal grey area, it is feasible that states could attempt to disrupt value chains and escape significant or meaningful reprisal.\nFrom Table 3, above, seven of the nine possibilities can be considered offensive, indicating that a cyber-operation against a commodity value chain is more likely to be offensive in nature than defensive. This may influence the victim's interpretation of a cyber-operation, resulting in a situation in which the Cyber-Security Dilemma comes into being as the situation escalates. The guidance provided by The Tallinn Manuals and the Singapore Norms Package on the applicability of international law to cyber-operations as economic attacks raises the questions of whether the action was offensive or defensive or if retaliation to an offensive cyberattack can be legally justified. As Rule 21 of The Tallinn Manuals allows a state under attack to retaliate via a cyber-operation provided it does not include the use of force, nations could respond to offensive economic attacks via cyber-operations. Disrupting the legitimate development of another economy through cyber-operations is not likely to be justifiable even if they protect the attacker's economy. Disrupting another county's economy in order to develop one's own is even less likely justifiable. As discussed above, these cyber-operations can result in some retaliation as per Rule 21; however, for a response to be justified, sufficient attribution is required. Therefore, the capability of the victim to detect a cyber-operation designed for stealth and slow degradation of value chains may become the key factor as to whether a nation could retaliate.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nTo summarise, cyber-operations targeting commodity value chains are technically feasible. There is a legal grey area as to whether these cyber-operations will be considered as a use of force due to their limited impact, or whether a cyberattack in response to offensive cyber-operations that disrupt economic activity will be legally justified. Difficulties in detection and attribution may further hinder a nation's ability to respond or to retaliate. The use of cyber-operations for economic espionage may, however, be allowable based on the guidance of the documents considered. The authors do not condone such operations; however, their viability needs to be assessed to discuss (and, if necessary, prepare) appropriate responses.\n## Conclusion\nCyber-operations are a possible tool to conduct Economic Information Warfare. International trade in raw materials is based on commodity value chains; targeting these can be analogous to a limited traditional blockade on the commodity. The Cyber-Security Dilemma and Porter’s Five Forces Model are used to illustrate possible scenarios employing cyber-operations to target the commodity value chain. While it is technically feasible to conduct these attacks, the legalities thereof remain a contentious area, with a current emphasis on interpretations of IHL, balanced by specific obligations. Based on The Tallinn Manuals, the law of armed conflict would apply to cyber-operations, both nationally and internationally under certain conditions. Leetaru (2017) notes that the focus on “cyber warfare” in Tallinn 1.0 changed to “cyber-operations” in Tallinn 2.0, reflecting the complexities of operations in cyber-space, where cyberattacks often fall below the threshold of formal acts of war based on IHL. The main contention, therefore, remains the definition of what can be construed as an act of war in cyber-space. In the case of cyberattacks on commodity value chains, the scope of the attack is limited, and therefore will likely fall below the threshold of an act of war and limit a victim’s response options. Future research could look at the main efforts to develop cyber-legislation that falls within the ambit of IHL and apply this legislation to critical infrastructure protection\n## Acknowledgements\nThe first author received funding by the South African National Research Foundation, Grant no. 115059."

There is also a growing consideration of vulnerabilities in the physical transportation infrastructure, which is comprised of a number of interlinking components that enable international trade in raw materials and consumer goods, known as commodity value chains. Through the use of scenario analysis and document analysis, this article investigates the feasibility and legal considerations of cyberattacks to target commodity value chains in order to further or protect national interests.\nKeywords: Commodity Value Chain, Critical Infrastructure Protection, Cyber-Operations, Economic Information Warfare (EIW), International Humanitarian Law (IHL)\n# Introduction\nThe focus of the cyber-security efforts appears to be on the power and financial systems. However, the physical transport infrastructure is often not considered; and, if it is, the scope is limited. However, all trade of commodities and products is conducted via this infrastructure. In particular, commodities can be seen to have global value chains with specific trade corridors, allowing the commodity market to be affected by targeting the supporting transport infrastructure. Therefore, cyber-operations that disrupt the physical transport infrastructure can have significant economic consequences for the victim. One example is the impact the NotPetya ransomware had on the shipping company Maersk. Maersk's global operations were disrupted, and the company is estimated to have lost between $250 million to $300 million (Cimpanu 2018).\nJournal of Information Warfare (2019) 18.2: 31-48\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nThis article aims to investigate the feasibility of cyber-operations against the physical transport infrastructure as an aspect of Economic Information Warfare. The article is conceptual, using hypothetical examples, documents, and logical discussion to illustrate the technical and legal considerations for Economic Information Warfare (EIW) to gain or protect competitive economic advantage based on commodity trade. The basis of the discussion revolves around the Cyber-Security Dilemma and Porter's Five Forces models; by combining these models and using hypothetical scenarios, the article proposes a categorisation scheme for strategic cyber-operations against commodities to influence international trade. The Tallinn Manuals on international law and cyber-operations (Schmitt 2013; Schmitt 2017) are used to provide a discussion on the legal considerations of the proposed framework.\nThis paper provides background on Information Warfare, Economic Information Warfare, the Cyber-Security Dilemma, and The Tallinn Manuals. The commodity value chain and relevant models are then introduced. The feasibility of disrupting commodity value chains through cyber-operations are discussed using analysis of hypothetical scenarios. The Tallinn Manuals are then used to provide a legal perspective for targeting the commodity chains. This is followed by a discussion and conclusion.\n## Background\n### Information Warfare\n'Information Warfare' (IW) is regarded as consisting of tactics, techniques, and procedures used in the information domain to gain an advantage over an adversary during a period of conflict or competition (Brazzoli 2007; Stupples 2015). The information domain can be comprised of physical, logical (or virtual), and cognitive components (Brazzoli 2007), and, therefore, can be comprised of cyber-operations as well as other forms of conflict, such as psychological operations (Brazzoli 2007; Stupples 2015). Defensive Information Warfare can be seen to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems to authorised entities. Information Warfare strategies to attack include destroying data, manipulating/corrupting data, stealing/exploiting data, denying or disrupting access to data, altering the perceptions of the target population towards the data, or changing the context in which the data is viewed (Hutchinson &amp; Warren 2001). Table 1, below, illustrates these Information Warfare concepts.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\n|   | Aspects of Secure Information  |   |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |   |  Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability  |\n|  Domains | Cognitive |  | Alter perception\nAlter context |   |\n|   |  Logical | Exploit | Manipulate\nCorrupt | Deny\nDisrupt  |\n|   |  Physical | Steal | Damage | Destroy  |\nTable 1: Offensive Information Warfare Techniques\n# Economic Information Warfare\nLambert (2017) contrasts two types of economic warfare:\n- the traditional blockade or bombing of factories, a slow attrition designed to degrade the economy and a nation's warfighting capacity; and\n- economic warfare that targets the societal psychology, as proposed by the British prior to the First World War, in which global sea communications would be disrupted.\nThe latter was attempted at the outbreak of World War I but failed after being abandoned a few months later due to resistance by the British's own businesses; the former blockade style was employed during World War II by the German U-boats and in the U.S. submarine campaign against the Japanese (Lambert 2017). Deakin (2003) considers a number of tactics that can be conducted as economic warfare, including\n- Affecting trade conditions;\n- Affecting market liquidity;\n- Denying market access (such as embargoes or blockades);\n- Degrading market efficiency (for example, resulting in slower delivery of goods or services);\n- Degrading supply chains;\n- Degrading foreign markets;\n- Exploiting, denying, or degrading supporting infrastructure;\n- Exploiting, denying, degrading, or corrupting economic information.\nThe descriptions by both Deakin (2003) and Lambert (2017) include measures that directly affect the ability to trade commodities and other materials; this concept is key to this paper. Lambert (2017) notes that globalisation has resulted in the almost-immediate fluctuation of commodity prices due to predictions of supply excess or deficiencies.\nAs reliance on information technologies and their role in globalisation increased, the concept of Economic Information Warfare as an aspect of Information Warfare closely related to cyber operations emerged. Economic Information Warfare is considered to be the activities to control, protect, and potentially disrupt economic activity through information and information systems (Chatterji 2008; Libicki 1995). Chatterji (2008) equates Economic Information Warfare with a version of economic blockade that would affect societies by restricting the flow of economic information.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nHowever, attacks on critical infrastructure can also have severe economic consequences (Caldeira et al. 2015).\nDeakin (2003) considers the relationship between protecting financial information systems from cyberattacks and national security. He concludes that there needs to be a redefinition of the term ‘national security’ (all that it means and encompasses) and that attacks resulting in the failure of critical financial systems could potentially be economically disastrous. Power grids are also potential targets that could have severe economic consequences if disrupted by cyber-operations. Lloyd’s and Centre for Risk Studies (2015) indicates that malware affecting 50 generators in the U.S. could potentially have an economic impact of $1 trillion. In 2015 and 2016, there were successful cyberattacks on the Ukrainian power grid, which caused a disruption in electricity supply (Patterson 2017). Power grids appear to attract more attacks: the U.S. ICS-CERT (c. 2017) shows that 17% of the investigated incidents affected the energy sector, 8% targeted the transportation sector, and 4% critical manufacturing.\nWheeler (2018) considers cyber warfare as having no rules; and with the growing prevalence of cyberattacks, there is an increased likelihood of strategic attacks against national economies. Cyber-operations that severely disrupt financial or power systems could be potentially devastating in terms of both the economic and societal implications. It is possible that such an attack would draw widespread condemnation and possibly military action in retaliation. Attacking commodity trade is ‘high-precision’ but more subtle, which would not be as broadly devastating. Such an attack is likely to fall short of sufficient grounds for military retaliation. Lambert (2017) cautions that the use of cyber-operations to cause economic effects could have the same result as the failed British economic warfare concept. (The parallel relies on the fact that sea communication was a developing concept at the time about which there was a lack of understanding, as is currently the case with cyber-security and cyber-operations.)\n## The Cyber-Security Dilemma\nThe Cyber-Security Dilemma is an evolution of the security dilemma or spiral model of international relations, which has been applied into the cyber-domain. Reuter (2011) considers the Cyber-Security Dilemma as measures taken by a nation to increase the security of its digital infrastructure, which then decreases the cyber-security of another country. He suggests that it is difficult to differentiate between offensive and defensive intentions in cyber-space, particularly because the techniques that are used are often very similar. Libicki (2016) suggests that the Cyber-Security Dilemma is not as prevalent as it appears to be; he considers most defensive actions in cyberspace are easily identified as such, except for the case of active defence. From an economics perspective, nations improving their cyber-security could benefit other states by reducing the number of staging points from which an attack may be launched.\nBuchanan (2017) provides an in-depth discussion of the Cyber-Security Dilemma. He indicates that there are legitimate defensive reasons to conduct network intrusions; at the same time, he concedes most nations would consider any intrusion into a sensitive network as threatening. While sensitive systems are considered, there is no explicit mention of cyber-physical systems, such as industrial control, in the considerations of the Cyber-Security Dilemma. In this context, the likelihood is that any penetration into these systems will be aggressive, as there is limited defensive val\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nue (in cyber-security terms) that an intruder can gain from affecting cyber-physical systems. There may, however, be economic reasons that make cyber-physical systems targets for intrusion, such as assessing the rate of manufacture or throughput of a product or attempting to discover industrial processes through cyber-espionage.\nFor the purposes of this paper, the concept that nations can take defensive actions which negatively affect the security of other nations is the one which will be considered. Later in the article, this concept will be modified and applied into an economic setting.\n## International cyber-operations and security frameworks\nInternational law has an important role regarding cyber-operations, especially when a cyber-operation is performed within the context of an international armed conflict (Boyle 2012). The Tallinn Manuals (Schmitt 2013; Schmitt 2017) provide in-depth non-binding analyses of applicability of existing international law to cyber-operations, including the areas of sovereignty, due diligence, jurisdiction, international responsibility, cyber-operations, and international human rights. These analyses were developed by international law experts to propose principles to govern cyber-warfare, including the elements of jus ad bellum (governing the use of force by a state as an instrument of its international policy), together with jus in bello (regulating the conduct of armed conflict). With the growing prevalence of cyberattacks, the concepts contained in The Tallinn Manuals have become of utmost interest.\nIn 2018, the Norm Package Singapore was developed by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) with the purpose of proposing best practices to safeguard a reliable Internet while recognising the interdependence of the global communities. It sought to prevent the consequences of any major disruption of the Internet and to promote ethical behaviour of all entities involved (GCSC 2018).\n## Commodity Value Chains\nThis section presents the basic principles that contribute towards the concept of commodity value chains, including Porter’s Five Forces Model.\n## The value chain\nThe value chain is considered to be a “system of interdependent activities, which are connected by linkages” (Porter &amp; Millar 1985). These activities can impact on each other’s effectiveness, and an optimised value-chain can be created by making trade-offs based on the various linkages.\nPorter and Millar (1985) consider the role of information and information technology in an organisation’s competitive advantage. In particular, the information and information technology impacts the linkages within the value chain. In addition to the greater speed at which traditionally information-related tasks can be performed, technology has improved the physical aspects of an organisation, particularly through improved automation, control, and monitoring of processes. In 1985, information technologies were considered to have increased rivalries, increased the threat of substitute products, and increased the power of buyers (Porter &amp; Millar 1985). This integration of information activities across businesses drove management information systems and enabled\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\ntraditional business processes and management activities (Laudon &amp; Laudon 2014), as is illustrated in Figure 1, below. For the purposes of this paper, the focus will be on concepts related to supply-chain management.\nFigure 1: Information activities in the value chain, adapted from Laudon &amp; Laudon (2014, p. 55)\nInformation technology continues to impact the value chains through greater connectivity and access to data in what has become known as the Digital Revolution (or the Fourth Industrial Revolution) based on hyper-connected devices or the Internet of Things that allows for unprecedented access to data and to control over processes.\n## Commodity value chains\nThe traditional value chains are designed for specific organisations within their competitive industries. However, with globalisation and mass exports and imports of various raw materials and manufactured goods, the concept of global commodity chains emerged, first coined by Gereffi in 1994 (Kaplinsky 2004). The global commodity chain is different from the traditional value chain model in that an international component is included, and organisations need to coordinate the information, business, and management activities (from Figure 1, above) across multiple countries or regions (Kaplinsky 2004).\nThe economies of some developing nations, such as in Africa, are based on raw material commodities (African Union [AU] 2017). In addition to the African economies' being dependent on commodities, it can be further detailed that these are agricultural commodities. For the development of value chains in this region, it was identified that competitive products need to be produced while reducing the transaction costs; efficiencies in the processing, marketing, and production functions are key to competitiveness (AU 2017).\nA European perspective of critical commodity value chains is based on raw minerals that support industrialisation and digitisation. In turn, the current digitisation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is key to developing and supporting these value chains. One of the key concerns for strategic mineral value chains is identified as the evolution and disruption brought about by this age of innovation, fuelled by rapid technological advancements (Faure-Schuyer, Egenhofer &amp; Elkerbout\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\n2018). Another key challenge that was identified is the ability to secure access to the necessary minerals, either through trade or by nations becoming self-sufficient (Faure-Schuyer, Egenhofer &amp; Elkerbout 2018). These challenges highlight important aspects of this paper: access to critical resources may not be as straightforward as it may seem, and the technological disruption may introduce vulnerabilities in the commodity chain that could be exploited by a competitor.\nFigure 2, below, illustrates a generalised commodity value chain. The material is mined or produced, transported to initial processing or refining, then loaded (often using conveyer belts or similar equipment) onto long-haul transport (road or rail) to be taken to the port, where it is loaded onto bulk carriers for export overseas. A corporate division controls or directs the various processes (denoted by the dashed arrows) and provides supportive processes.\nFigure 2: The commodity value chain\n# Porter's Five Forces Model\nPorter's Five Forces (also known as Competitive Forces) Model is a key model for strategic management, and describes external factors that affect an organisation's standing in its market environment (Grundy 2006; Laudon &amp; Laudon 2014):\n- Bargaining power of suppliers,\n- Bargaining power of customers,\n- Threat of new entrants,\n- Threat of substitute products,\n- Competitive rivalry.\nThese forces are illustrated in Figure 3, below. For the purposes of this paper, there is a focus on three of the forces: threat of new entrants, threat of substitute products, and competitive rivalry. The bargaining power of suppliers is implicit in some of the scenarios.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nFigure 3: Porter's Five Forces Model, adapted from Grundy (2006, p. 215) and Laudon &amp; Laudon (2014, p. 124)\n# Cyberattacks on the Commodity Value Chain\nAttacks can be leveraged against various points in the commodity value chain to achieve cascading effects. In particular, single points of failure in the value chain may prove to have greater impact on the commodity supply if they are successfully disrupted by cyberattacks. Industrial processes, transportation systems, and corporate decision making are all valid targets.\nThe industrial processes in a commodity value chain can include refineries or other processing of raw materials, mining equipment, and equipment to load and unload bulk cargo (such as conveyer belts) and containers onto trains, trucks, and ships. There have been a number of successful attacks on industrial control systems that have affected nuclear enrichment facilities (Stuxnet) or damaged a refinery, oil rigs, and chemical plants (Pretorius &amp; van Niekerk 2016). The transportation infrastructure has also seen successful cyberattacks affecting port scheduling and customs systems, sea-going vessels, tram and train ticketing systems; and vulnerabilities have been reported in many systems for rail and vessel navigation (van Niekerk 2017). These indicate that attacks against the industrial control systems and transportation systems are technically feasible.\nCorporate processes and decision making are also valid targets. This can be achieved through disrupting or corrupting the communications with clients and suppliers, thereby impacting the scheduling of trains, trucks, or vessels. By corrupting economic and business information, executives may make incorrect decisions, such as over-pricing material based on the incorrect information or ordering reduced production if they believe there is a surplus of materials. Corrupting main-\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\ntenance information can result in a lack of spare parts or critical equipment failures due to lack of maintenance. Corrupting individuals themselves through cyber-extortion of similar means can ensure poor decisions are made. These methods will be slower to perform than those that directly targeting the infrastructure. Figure 4, below, illustrates the attack points against the commodity value chain.\nFigure 4: Attacks on the commodity supply chain\nThe attacks described above are feasible; however, when considering large value chains, there may be a need to target multiple instances of systems across different organisations to be effective. Figure 5, below, provides an example in which there are two organisations, each with a headquarters controlling the mines (each with multiple pits and a refinery), with both rail and road transportation. Therefore, if one refinery fails due to a cyberattack, the others can carry a higher load. If trains are disrupted, trucks can be used as an alternative. This redundancy indicates that a cyberattack targeting a single point of failure will maximise the impact for less effort.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nFigure 5: Ports as a single point of failure\nAs is illustrated in Figure 5, above, the number of ports is usually limited, and only a few of those would handle a specific commodity. Therefore, targeting the ports will prove to be the most effective as this will impact on most of the land transportation and the mines' ability to supply material.\n## Scenarios\nThis section presents five hypothetical scenarios to illustrate possible situations leading to cyber-operations against aspects of the commodity value chain. The concept of defensive and offensive cyber-operations proposed in the Cyber-Security Dilemma are introduced in these scenarios.\n## Scenario 1\nCountry A discovers a deposit of strategic minerals, which has not previously been found in the country. Consequently, the unit price for the mineral has lowered; however, the country does not yet have the capacity to compete with more established exporters of the mineral that have standing trade agreements.\nThe main supplier of the mineral, Country B, has several co-located mines extracting the mineral, which is then transported to the coast mostly by train; transport by truck is possible, but is more expensive and slower. On the coast there is one port that has bulk-handling facilities to load the mineral onto the ships. There is also a multi-purpose terminal to allow for machinery spares to be imported for the port and the mines. The nearest city is approximately a two-hour drive from the port.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nCountry A decides that for it to be able to compete, it needs to secretly hinder Country B's ability to supply the mineral. To achieve this goal, a cyberattack against the control systems for the extraction process at the largest mine is undertaken, resulting in physical damage to key components in the process. As spares are difficult to procure, this action hinders production for months. Minor follow-up attacks affect the port's systems, randomly corrupting data on the loading of the vessel, necessitating manual confirmation of the recorded values thereby slowing down the turnaround time of vessels. This reduces the supply of the mineral from Country B, drives up prices, and leads some importers of the mineral to seek alternative sources—and ultimately turn to Country A.\nBy disrupting the regular supply of the major supplier of mineral, Country A has altered the status quo and has reduced the competitiveness of Country B due to the irregular supply. As the supply reduced, the price of the mineral increased, and Country A benefitted by providing the alternative supply. As Country A sought to increase its standing by altering the status quo, this can be considered an offensive operation in terms of Economic Information Warfare.\n## Scenario 2\nAs with Scenario 1, Country A discovers a deposit of strategic minerals, which has not previously been found in the country. Consequently, the unit price for the mineral has lowered; however, the country does not yet have the capacity to compete with more established exporters of the mineral that have standing trade agreements.\nThe main supplier of the mineral, Country B, becomes concerned that there is a new supplier and that its economic standing has been affected due to the discovery of the mineral deposit. A decision is made that, in order to maintain the status quo, Country A's ability to realise its potential as a supplier of the mineral needs to be disrupted. The main effort is to penetrate the project office's systems and alter the data and information, affecting the management activities related to the value chain. This results in delays in component deliveries, some design flaws requiring the re-manufacturing of components, and the gauge of the train tracks and the carriages to be mismatched. The project, therefore, faces major setbacks; and subtle design flaws in both hardware and firmware of the control systems cause erratic system behaviour and early component failure.\nAs the project is beset with apparent incompetence and glitches from the beginning, Country A is not considered a capable supplier, and importers of the mineral continued to favour Country B as the main exporter. Even though the deposit existed, Country A's inability to supply the commodity allowed the mineral price to almost return to its initial value. Country B's use of cyberattack can, therefore, be considered defensive as it maintained the status quo by protecting the country's standing and stabilising the cost of the mineral.\n## Scenario 3\nThere are two major exporters of oil into a contested region; both are established and are direct economic rivals. In order to assert dominance in the region, Exporter 1 launches cyberattacks against the pipelines of Exporter 2, reducing the flow of oil into the region. To make up for the shortfall, Exporter 1 supplies extra oil at a slightly cheaper rate, provided that there is a revised trade agreement which ultimately secures long-term export of oil into the region for Exporter 1.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nTo ensure this continues, Exporter 1 inserts a malicious remote access tool into the systems of Exporter 2's pipelines that will allow for future attacks that can cause an overpressure and rupture the pipelines.\nIn this scenario, a rival changes the economic status quo by affecting the main competitor's ability to supply oil. The cyber-operations are offensive in that the perpetrator actively seeks to gain long-term economic benefits from disrupting its competitors' operation.\n## Scenario 4\nIt is found that a strategic metal, Alloy A, can be replaced by another material, Alloy B. While Alloy B is not ideal, it is cheaper and easier to process and store. As a result, a number of major importers of Alloy A reduce their demand in favour of Alloy B. As with Scenario 2, a major exporter of Alloy B decides to disrupt the manufacture and export of the substitute alloy. This can be seen as defensive action as the original exporter is attempting to keep the status quo. Conversely, if the exporters of Alloy B attempted to disrupt the suppliers of the original material, as in Scenario 1, the effort would constitute offensive action as there is an attempt to change the status quo.\n## Scenario 5\nTwo new market entrants are vying for dominance. Using cyber-espionage, they seek to discover each other's processes in order to compete. This effort then turns to using cyber-operations to disrupt each other's ability to manufacture and supply. The economic and market information is corrupted in order to nudge the victim into making poor business decisions. In this case, the action is offensive, as both are seeking to gain an edge over the other and alter the status quo in the commodity market. This applies if one or both of the actors are providing substitute products.\n## Categorisation of cyber-operations on commodity value chains\nIt is technically feasible for cyber-operations to support or act as the primary weapon in Economic Information Warfare targeting specific commodity value chains. With the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the associated drives for hyper-connected systems, there are likely to be vulnerable systems at various points along the value chain. Table 2, below, aligns the various attack strategies to the stages of the value chain.\n|  Stage | Degrade | Deny | Disrupt | Exploit | Corrupt  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Source | X |  | X |  |   |\n|  Processing | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Loading | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Transport | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Port | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Commercial – decision making |  |  |  | X | X  |\n|  Commercial – access to economic information | X | X | X |  | X  |\nTable 2: Attack strategies per stage of the commodity value chain\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nTable 3, below, summarises the scenarios' categorisation in terms of the offensive or defensive nature of the cyber-operations based on the attacker and victim type (competitor, new entrant, or substitute) as per the Five Forces Model. Offensive actions can be considered as the cyber-operations aimed at changing the economic status in favour of the perpetrator, whereas defensive actions can be considered to be cyber-operations to maintain the perpetrator's current economic status.\n|   | Attacker  |   |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |   |  Competitor | New Entrant | Substitute  |\n|  Victim | Competitor | Offensive (S3) | Offensive (S1) | Offensive (S4b)  |\n|   |  New entrant | Defensive (S2) | Offensive (S5) | Offensive (S5)  |\n|   |  Substitute | Defensive (S4a) | Offensive (S5) | Offensive (S5)  |\nTable 3: Classification of attacks on a commodity value chain\nThe categorisations in Table 3 can play a part in deciding the legality of the actions and appropriate responses, based on the perceived intent of the actions. A defensive cyberattack can ultimately be interpreted as a response to other perceived economic attacks.\n# Legal Considerations for Cyber-Operations on Commodity Value Chains\nCan cyber-operations on commodity value chains be considered acts of war? Is there any legal recourse available, and can it be justified? The most difficult challenge is whether a cyberattack or cyber-operation invokes jus ad bellum. The Tallinn Manuals provide some explanation of the UN Charter in terms of cyber-operations and the key point of contention, the use of force. A cyber-operation will only invoke the UN Charter when its effects are similar or equivalent to that of a physical attack that would invoke the UN Charter. Goldsmith (2013) indicates that \"a cyber-attack that renders the electricity grid or air-traffic control system inoperable, and that as a result causes many deaths\" are cases that can be considered a use of force. However, there remains little clarity whether a slow, disruptive cyberattack on critical infrastructure that gradually renders it partially operable (such as Scenarios 1 and 2) can be deemed a use of force. In such scenarios, the question becomes how international law would apply when just one aspect of the value chain is attacked (such as Country B's corruption of Country A's project information to degrade the functioning of the value chain) and leads to an equivalent of a partial economic blockade. Therefore, a full economic shutdown (such as a power grid) can be considered an act of war, and armed retaliation may result; whereas targeting a value chain is not as severe, and the response needs to be proportional. However, The Singapore Norms, although not considered legislation, state as the first norm that \"State and non-state actors should not tamper with products and services in development and production, nor allow them to be tampered with, if doing so may substantially impair the stability of cyberspace\" (GCSC 2018). Norm six further states that, \"States should enact appropriate measures, including laws and regulations, to ensure basic cyber hygiene\" (GCSC 2018). Therefore, the Singapore Norms would consider cyber-operations targeting value chains as irresponsible, but the norms would also place responsibility on the nations to put measures in place to protect themselves.\nEconomic espionage and information theft (Scenario 5) are not considered to invoke the UN Char-\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nter, and Tallinn 2.0 (Rule 32) states that there remains no international law prohibiting the legalities of espionage (Schmitt 2017). On the one hand, there is the actual legality of the espionage itself, and on the other hand is the legality of the method of the espionage, once again becoming a grey area. Economic espionage is usually considered under criminal law, and not International Humanitarian Law (IHL). The Singapore Norms recognise the need for military and intelligence cyber-operations (GCSC 2018); therefore, a response to economic espionage is unlikely to include an attack.\nWith regards to sovereignty, Rule 21 of the Tallinn Manual states that a country under attack is permitted to conduct a cyber-operation that violates the sovereignty of the attacking country; furthermore, the illegality of the response is precluded and is, therefore, justified. However, Tallinn also states that any such recourse must preclude the use of force and should be proportionate (Schmitt 2013). There also remains the condition of attribution, where there needs to be reasonable certainty of perpetration prior to response. The protection of one's own economy may not be sufficient justification for employing cyber-operations to disrupt the development of another country's economy (Scenarios 2 and 4a).\n## Discussion\nFrom the description of the cyberattacks on industrial control systems and those affecting the transportation sector, it is technically feasible to disrupt various stages in a commodity supply chain. From a legal perspective, there are a number of challenges regarding cyber-operations on commodity value chains. Whilst a catastrophic attack against a national economy can be considered an act of war, the legalities of partial disruptions described by the scenarios remain somewhat of a grey area. The Singapore Norm against tampering with products and services indicates that cyber-operations against commodity value chains are irresponsible and that states should refrain from such activities. However, given the legal grey area, it is feasible that states could attempt to disrupt value chains and escape significant or meaningful reprisal.\nFrom Table 3, above, seven of the nine possibilities can be considered offensive, indicating that a cyber-operation against a commodity value chain is more likely to be offensive in nature than defensive. This may influence the victim's interpretation of a cyber-operation, resulting in a situation in which the Cyber-Security Dilemma comes into being as the situation escalates. The guidance provided by The Tallinn Manuals and the Singapore Norms Package on the applicability of international law to cyber-operations as economic attacks raises the questions of whether the action was offensive or defensive or if retaliation to an offensive cyberattack can be legally justified. As Rule 21 of The Tallinn Manuals allows a state under attack to retaliate via a cyber-operation provided it does not include the use of force, nations could respond to offensive economic attacks via cyber-operations. Disrupting the legitimate development of another economy through cyber-operations is not likely to be justifiable even if they protect the attacker's economy. Disrupting another county's economy in order to develop one's own is even less likely justifiable. As discussed above, these cyber-operations can result in some retaliation as per Rule 21; however, for a response to be justified, sufficient attribution is required. Therefore, the capability of the victim to detect a cyber-operation designed for stealth and slow degradation of value chains may become the key factor as to whether a nation could retaliate.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nTo summarise, cyber-operations targeting commodity value chains are technically feasible. There is a legal grey area as to whether these cyber-operations will be considered as a use of force due to their limited impact, or whether a cyberattack in response to offensive cyber-operations that disrupt economic activity will be legally justified. Difficulties in detection and attribution may further hinder a nation's ability to respond or to retaliate. The use of cyber-operations for economic espionage may, however, be allowable based on the guidance of the documents considered. The authors do not condone such operations; however, their viability needs to be assessed to discuss (and, if necessary, prepare) appropriate responses.\n## Conclusion\nCyber-operations are a possible tool to conduct Economic Information Warfare. International trade in raw materials is based on commodity value chains; targeting these can be analogous to a limited traditional blockade on the commodity. The Cyber-Security Dilemma and Porter’s Five Forces Model are used to illustrate possible scenarios employing cyber-operations to target the commodity value chain. While it is technically feasible to conduct these attacks, the legalities thereof remain a contentious area, with a current emphasis on interpretations of IHL, balanced by specific obligations. Based on The Tallinn Manuals, the law of armed conflict would apply to cyber-operations, both nationally and internationally under certain conditions. Leetaru (2017) notes that the focus on “cyber warfare” in Tallinn 1.0 changed to “cyber-operations” in Tallinn 2.0, reflecting the complexities of operations in cyber-space, where cyberattacks often fall below the threshold of formal acts of war based on IHL. The main contention, therefore, remains the definition of what can be construed as an act of war in cyber-space. In the case of cyberattacks on commodity value chains, the scope of the attack is limited, and therefore will likely fall below the threshold of an act of war and limit a victim’s response options. Future research could look at the main efforts to develop cyber-legislation that falls within the ambit of IHL and apply this legislation to critical infrastructure protection\n## Acknowledgements\nThe first author received funding by the South African National Research Foundation, Grant no. 115059."

There is also a growing consideration of vulnerabilities in the physical transportation infrastructure, which is comprised of a number of interlinking components that enable international trade in raw materials and consumer goods, known as commodity value chains. Through the use of scenario analysis and document analysis, this article investigates the feasibility and legal considerations of cyberattacks to target commodity value chains in order to further or protect national interests.\nKeywords: Commodity Value Chain, Critical Infrastructure Protection, Cyber-Operations, Economic Information Warfare (EIW), International Humanitarian Law (IHL)\n# Introduction\nThe focus of the cyber-security efforts appears to be on the power and financial systems. However, the physical transport infrastructure is often not considered; and, if it is, the scope is limited. However, all trade of commodities and products is conducted via this infrastructure. In particular, commodities can be seen to have global value chains with specific trade corridors, allowing the commodity market to be affected by targeting the supporting transport infrastructure. Therefore, cyber-operations that disrupt the physical transport infrastructure can have significant economic consequences for the victim. One example is the impact the NotPetya ransomware had on the shipping company Maersk. Maersk's global operations were disrupted, and the company is estimated to have lost between $250 million to $300 million .\nJournal of Information Warfare (2019) 18.2: 31-48\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nThis article aims to investigate the feasibility of cyber-operations against the physical transport infrastructure as an aspect of Economic Information Warfare. The article is conceptual, using hypothetical examples, documents, and logical discussion to illustrate the technical and legal considerations for Economic Information Warfare (EIW) to gain or protect competitive economic advantage based on commodity trade. The basis of the discussion revolves around the Cyber-Security Dilemma and Porter's Five Forces models; by combining these models and using hypothetical scenarios, the article proposes a categorisation scheme for strategic cyber-operations against commodities to influence international trade. The Tallinn Manuals on international law and cyber-operations  are used to provide a discussion on the legal considerations of the proposed framework.\nThis paper provides background on Information Warfare, Economic Information Warfare, the Cyber-Security Dilemma, and The Tallinn Manuals. The commodity value chain and relevant models are then introduced. The feasibility of disrupting commodity value chains through cyber-operations are discussed using analysis of hypothetical scenarios. The Tallinn Manuals are then used to provide a legal perspective for targeting the commodity chains. This is followed by a discussion and conclusion.\n## Background\n### Information Warfare\n'Information Warfare' (IW) is regarded as consisting of tactics, techniques, and procedures used in the information domain to gain an advantage over an adversary during a period of conflict or competition . The information domain can be comprised of physical, logical (or virtual), and cognitive components , and, therefore, can be comprised of cyber-operations as well as other forms of conflict, such as psychological operations . Defensive Information Warfare can be seen to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems to authorised entities. Information Warfare strategies to attack include destroying data, manipulating/corrupting data, stealing/exploiting data, denying or disrupting access to data, altering the perceptions of the target population towards the data, or changing the context in which the data is viewed (Hutchinson &amp; Warren 2001). Table 1, below, illustrates these Information Warfare concepts.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\n|   | Aspects of Secure Information  |   |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |   |  Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability  |\n|  Domains | Cognitive |  | Alter perception\nAlter context |   |\n|   |  Logical | Exploit | Manipulate\nCorrupt | Deny\nDisrupt  |\n|   |  Physical | Steal | Damage | Destroy  |\nTable 1: Offensive Information Warfare Techniques\n# Economic Information Warfare\nLambert (2017) contrasts two types of economic warfare:\n- the traditional blockade or bombing of factories, a slow attrition designed to degrade the economy and a nation's warfighting capacity; and\n- economic warfare that targets the societal psychology, as proposed by the British prior to the First World War, in which global sea communications would be disrupted.\nThe latter was attempted at the outbreak of World War I but failed after being abandoned a few months later due to resistance by the British's own businesses; the former blockade style was employed during World War II by the German U-boats and in the U.S. submarine campaign against the Japanese . Deakin (2003) considers a number of tactics that can be conducted as economic warfare, including\n- Affecting trade conditions;\n- Affecting market liquidity;\n- Denying market access (such as embargoes or blockades);\n- Degrading market efficiency (for example, resulting in slower delivery of goods or services);\n- Degrading supply chains;\n- Degrading foreign markets;\n- Exploiting, denying, or degrading supporting infrastructure;\n- Exploiting, denying, degrading, or corrupting economic information.\nThe descriptions by both Deakin (2003) and Lambert (2017) include measures that directly affect the ability to trade commodities and other materials; this concept is key to this paper. Lambert (2017) notes that globalisation has resulted in the almost-immediate fluctuation of commodity prices due to predictions of supply excess or deficiencies.\nAs reliance on information technologies and their role in globalisation increased, the concept of Economic Information Warfare as an aspect of Information Warfare closely related to cyber operations emerged. Economic Information Warfare is considered to be the activities to control, protect, and potentially disrupt economic activity through information and information systems . Chatterji (2008) equates Economic Information Warfare with a version of economic blockade that would affect societies by restricting the flow of economic information.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nHowever, attacks on critical infrastructure can also have severe economic consequences .\nDeakin (2003) considers the relationship between protecting financial information systems from cyberattacks and national security. He concludes that there needs to be a redefinition of the term ‘national security’ (all that it means and encompasses) and that attacks resulting in the failure of critical financial systems could potentially be economically disastrous. Power grids are also potential targets that could have severe economic consequences if disrupted by cyber-operations. Lloyd’s and Centre for Risk Studies (2015) indicates that malware affecting 50 generators in the U.S. could potentially have an economic impact of $1 trillion. In 2015 and 2016, there were successful cyberattacks on the Ukrainian power grid, which caused a disruption in electricity supply . Power grids appear to attract more attacks: the U.S. ICS-CERT (c. 2017) shows that 17% of the investigated incidents affected the energy sector, 8% targeted the transportation sector, and 4% critical manufacturing.\nWheeler (2018) considers cyber warfare as having no rules; and with the growing prevalence of cyberattacks, there is an increased likelihood of strategic attacks against national economies. Cyber-operations that severely disrupt financial or power systems could be potentially devastating in terms of both the economic and societal implications. It is possible that such an attack would draw widespread condemnation and possibly military action in retaliation. Attacking commodity trade is ‘high-precision’ but more subtle, which would not be as broadly devastating. Such an attack is likely to fall short of sufficient grounds for military retaliation. Lambert (2017) cautions that the use of cyber-operations to cause economic effects could have the same result as the failed British economic warfare concept. (The parallel relies on the fact that sea communication was a developing concept at the time about which there was a lack of understanding, as is currently the case with cyber-security and cyber-operations.)\n## The Cyber-Security Dilemma\nThe Cyber-Security Dilemma is an evolution of the security dilemma or spiral model of international relations, which has been applied into the cyber-domain. Reuter (2011) considers the Cyber-Security Dilemma as measures taken by a nation to increase the security of its digital infrastructure, which then decreases the cyber-security of another country. He suggests that it is difficult to differentiate between offensive and defensive intentions in cyber-space, particularly because the techniques that are used are often very similar. Libicki (2016) suggests that the Cyber-Security Dilemma is not as prevalent as it appears to be; he considers most defensive actions in cyberspace are easily identified as such, except for the case of active defence. From an economics perspective, nations improving their cyber-security could benefit other states by reducing the number of staging points from which an attack may be launched.\nBuchanan (2017) provides an in-depth discussion of the Cyber-Security Dilemma. He indicates that there are legitimate defensive reasons to conduct network intrusions; at the same time, he concedes most nations would consider any intrusion into a sensitive network as threatening. While sensitive systems are considered, there is no explicit mention of cyber-physical systems, such as industrial control, in the considerations of the Cyber-Security Dilemma. In this context, the likelihood is that any penetration into these systems will be aggressive, as there is limited defensive val\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nue (in cyber-security terms) that an intruder can gain from affecting cyber-physical systems. There may, however, be economic reasons that make cyber-physical systems targets for intrusion, such as assessing the rate of manufacture or throughput of a product or attempting to discover industrial processes through cyber-espionage.\nFor the purposes of this paper, the concept that nations can take defensive actions which negatively affect the security of other nations is the one which will be considered. Later in the article, this concept will be modified and applied into an economic setting.\n## International cyber-operations and security frameworks\nInternational law has an important role regarding cyber-operations, especially when a cyber-operation is performed within the context of an international armed conflict . The Tallinn Manuals  provide in-depth non-binding analyses of applicability of existing international law to cyber-operations, including the areas of sovereignty, due diligence, jurisdiction, international responsibility, cyber-operations, and international human rights. These analyses were developed by international law experts to propose principles to govern cyber-warfare, including the elements of jus ad bellum (governing the use of force by a state as an instrument of its international policy), together with jus in bello (regulating the conduct of armed conflict). With the growing prevalence of cyberattacks, the concepts contained in The Tallinn Manuals have become of utmost interest.\nIn 2018, the Norm Package Singapore was developed by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) with the purpose of proposing best practices to safeguard a reliable Internet while recognising the interdependence of the global communities. It sought to prevent the consequences of any major disruption of the Internet and to promote ethical behaviour of all entities involved .\n## Commodity Value Chains\nThis section presents the basic principles that contribute towards the concept of commodity value chains, including Porter’s Five Forces Model.\n## The value chain\nThe value chain is considered to be a “system of interdependent activities, which are connected by linkages” (Porter &amp; Millar 1985). These activities can impact on each other’s effectiveness, and an optimised value-chain can be created by making trade-offs based on the various linkages.\nPorter and Millar (1985) consider the role of information and information technology in an organisation’s competitive advantage. In particular, the information and information technology impacts the linkages within the value chain. In addition to the greater speed at which traditionally information-related tasks can be performed, technology has improved the physical aspects of an organisation, particularly through improved automation, control, and monitoring of processes. In 1985, information technologies were considered to have increased rivalries, increased the threat of substitute products, and increased the power of buyers (Porter &amp; Millar 1985). This integration of information activities across businesses drove management information systems and enabled\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\ntraditional business processes and management activities (Laudon &amp; Laudon 2014), as is illustrated in Figure 1, below. For the purposes of this paper, the focus will be on concepts related to supply-chain management.\nFigure 1: Information activities in the value chain, adapted from Laudon &amp; Laudon (2014, p. 55)\nInformation technology continues to impact the value chains through greater connectivity and access to data in what has become known as the Digital Revolution (or the Fourth Industrial Revolution) based on hyper-connected devices or the Internet of Things that allows for unprecedented access to data and to control over processes.\n## Commodity value chains\nThe traditional value chains are designed for specific organisations within their competitive industries. However, with globalisation and mass exports and imports of various raw materials and manufactured goods, the concept of global commodity chains emerged, first coined by Gereffi in 1994 . The global commodity chain is different from the traditional value chain model in that an international component is included, and organisations need to coordinate the information, business, and management activities (from Figure 1, above) across multiple countries or regions .\nThe economies of some developing nations, such as in Africa, are based on raw material commodities (African Union [AU] 2017). In addition to the African economies' being dependent on commodities, it can be further detailed that these are agricultural commodities. For the development of value chains in this region, it was identified that competitive products need to be produced while reducing the transaction costs; efficiencies in the processing, marketing, and production functions are key to competitiveness .\nA European perspective of critical commodity value chains is based on raw minerals that support industrialisation and digitisation. In turn, the current digitisation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is key to developing and supporting these value chains. One of the key concerns for strategic mineral value chains is identified as the evolution and disruption brought about by this age of innovation, fuelled by rapid technological advancements (Faure-Schuyer, Egenhofer &amp; Elkerbout\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\n2018). Another key challenge that was identified is the ability to secure access to the necessary minerals, either through trade or by nations becoming self-sufficient (Faure-Schuyer, Egenhofer &amp; Elkerbout 2018). These challenges highlight important aspects of this paper: access to critical resources may not be as straightforward as it may seem, and the technological disruption may introduce vulnerabilities in the commodity chain that could be exploited by a competitor.\nFigure 2, below, illustrates a generalised commodity value chain. The material is mined or produced, transported to initial processing or refining, then loaded (often using conveyer belts or similar equipment) onto long-haul transport (road or rail) to be taken to the port, where it is loaded onto bulk carriers for export overseas. A corporate division controls or directs the various processes (denoted by the dashed arrows) and provides supportive processes.\nFigure 2: The commodity value chain\n# Porter's Five Forces Model\nPorter's Five Forces (also known as Competitive Forces) Model is a key model for strategic management, and describes external factors that affect an organisation's standing in its market environment :\n- Bargaining power of suppliers,\n- Bargaining power of customers,\n- Threat of new entrants,\n- Threat of substitute products,\n- Competitive rivalry.\nThese forces are illustrated in Figure 3, below. For the purposes of this paper, there is a focus on three of the forces: threat of new entrants, threat of substitute products, and competitive rivalry. The bargaining power of suppliers is implicit in some of the scenarios.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nFigure 3: Porter's Five Forces Model, adapted from Grundy (2006, p. 215) and Laudon &amp; Laudon (2014, p. 124)\n# Cyberattacks on the Commodity Value Chain\nAttacks can be leveraged against various points in the commodity value chain to achieve cascading effects. In particular, single points of failure in the value chain may prove to have greater impact on the commodity supply if they are successfully disrupted by cyberattacks. Industrial processes, transportation systems, and corporate decision making are all valid targets.\nThe industrial processes in a commodity value chain can include refineries or other processing of raw materials, mining equipment, and equipment to load and unload bulk cargo (such as conveyer belts) and containers onto trains, trucks, and ships. There have been a number of successful attacks on industrial control systems that have affected nuclear enrichment facilities (Stuxnet) or damaged a refinery, oil rigs, and chemical plants (Pretorius &amp; van Niekerk 2016). The transportation infrastructure has also seen successful cyberattacks affecting port scheduling and customs systems, sea-going vessels, tram and train ticketing systems; and vulnerabilities have been reported in many systems for rail and vessel navigation (van Niekerk 2017). These indicate that attacks against the industrial control systems and transportation systems are technically feasible.\nCorporate processes and decision making are also valid targets. This can be achieved through disrupting or corrupting the communications with clients and suppliers, thereby impacting the scheduling of trains, trucks, or vessels. By corrupting economic and business information, executives may make incorrect decisions, such as over-pricing material based on the incorrect information or ordering reduced production if they believe there is a surplus of materials. Corrupting main-\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\ntenance information can result in a lack of spare parts or critical equipment failures due to lack of maintenance. Corrupting individuals themselves through cyber-extortion of similar means can ensure poor decisions are made. These methods will be slower to perform than those that directly targeting the infrastructure. Figure 4, below, illustrates the attack points against the commodity value chain.\nFigure 4: Attacks on the commodity supply chain\nThe attacks described above are feasible; however, when considering large value chains, there may be a need to target multiple instances of systems across different organisations to be effective. Figure 5, below, provides an example in which there are two organisations, each with a headquarters controlling the mines (each with multiple pits and a refinery), with both rail and road transportation. Therefore, if one refinery fails due to a cyberattack, the others can carry a higher load. If trains are disrupted, trucks can be used as an alternative. This redundancy indicates that a cyberattack targeting a single point of failure will maximise the impact for less effort.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nFigure 5: Ports as a single point of failure\nAs is illustrated in Figure 5, above, the number of ports is usually limited, and only a few of those would handle a specific commodity. Therefore, targeting the ports will prove to be the most effective as this will impact on most of the land transportation and the mines' ability to supply material.\n## Scenarios\nThis section presents five hypothetical scenarios to illustrate possible situations leading to cyber-operations against aspects of the commodity value chain. The concept of defensive and offensive cyber-operations proposed in the Cyber-Security Dilemma are introduced in these scenarios.\n## Scenario 1\nCountry A discovers a deposit of strategic minerals, which has not previously been found in the country. Consequently, the unit price for the mineral has lowered; however, the country does not yet have the capacity to compete with more established exporters of the mineral that have standing trade agreements.\nThe main supplier of the mineral, Country B, has several co-located mines extracting the mineral, which is then transported to the coast mostly by train; transport by truck is possible, but is more expensive and slower. On the coast there is one port that has bulk-handling facilities to load the mineral onto the ships. There is also a multi-purpose terminal to allow for machinery spares to be imported for the port and the mines. The nearest city is approximately a two-hour drive from the port.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nCountry A decides that for it to be able to compete, it needs to secretly hinder Country B's ability to supply the mineral. To achieve this goal, a cyberattack against the control systems for the extraction process at the largest mine is undertaken, resulting in physical damage to key components in the process. As spares are difficult to procure, this action hinders production for months. Minor follow-up attacks affect the port's systems, randomly corrupting data on the loading of the vessel, necessitating manual confirmation of the recorded values thereby slowing down the turnaround time of vessels. This reduces the supply of the mineral from Country B, drives up prices, and leads some importers of the mineral to seek alternative sources—and ultimately turn to Country A.\nBy disrupting the regular supply of the major supplier of mineral, Country A has altered the status quo and has reduced the competitiveness of Country B due to the irregular supply. As the supply reduced, the price of the mineral increased, and Country A benefitted by providing the alternative supply. As Country A sought to increase its standing by altering the status quo, this can be considered an offensive operation in terms of Economic Information Warfare.\n## Scenario 2\nAs with Scenario 1, Country A discovers a deposit of strategic minerals, which has not previously been found in the country. Consequently, the unit price for the mineral has lowered; however, the country does not yet have the capacity to compete with more established exporters of the mineral that have standing trade agreements.\nThe main supplier of the mineral, Country B, becomes concerned that there is a new supplier and that its economic standing has been affected due to the discovery of the mineral deposit. A decision is made that, in order to maintain the status quo, Country A's ability to realise its potential as a supplier of the mineral needs to be disrupted. The main effort is to penetrate the project office's systems and alter the data and information, affecting the management activities related to the value chain. This results in delays in component deliveries, some design flaws requiring the re-manufacturing of components, and the gauge of the train tracks and the carriages to be mismatched. The project, therefore, faces major setbacks; and subtle design flaws in both hardware and firmware of the control systems cause erratic system behaviour and early component failure.\nAs the project is beset with apparent incompetence and glitches from the beginning, Country A is not considered a capable supplier, and importers of the mineral continued to favour Country B as the main exporter. Even though the deposit existed, Country A's inability to supply the commodity allowed the mineral price to almost return to its initial value. Country B's use of cyberattack can, therefore, be considered defensive as it maintained the status quo by protecting the country's standing and stabilising the cost of the mineral.\n## Scenario 3\nThere are two major exporters of oil into a contested region; both are established and are direct economic rivals. In order to assert dominance in the region, Exporter 1 launches cyberattacks against the pipelines of Exporter 2, reducing the flow of oil into the region. To make up for the shortfall, Exporter 1 supplies extra oil at a slightly cheaper rate, provided that there is a revised trade agreement which ultimately secures long-term export of oil into the region for Exporter 1.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nTo ensure this continues, Exporter 1 inserts a malicious remote access tool into the systems of Exporter 2's pipelines that will allow for future attacks that can cause an overpressure and rupture the pipelines.\nIn this scenario, a rival changes the economic status quo by affecting the main competitor's ability to supply oil. The cyber-operations are offensive in that the perpetrator actively seeks to gain long-term economic benefits from disrupting its competitors' operation.\n## Scenario 4\nIt is found that a strategic metal, Alloy A, can be replaced by another material, Alloy B. While Alloy B is not ideal, it is cheaper and easier to process and store. As a result, a number of major importers of Alloy A reduce their demand in favour of Alloy B. As with Scenario 2, a major exporter of Alloy B decides to disrupt the manufacture and export of the substitute alloy. This can be seen as defensive action as the original exporter is attempting to keep the status quo. Conversely, if the exporters of Alloy B attempted to disrupt the suppliers of the original material, as in Scenario 1, the effort would constitute offensive action as there is an attempt to change the status quo.\n## Scenario 5\nTwo new market entrants are vying for dominance. Using cyber-espionage, they seek to discover each other's processes in order to compete. This effort then turns to using cyber-operations to disrupt each other's ability to manufacture and supply. The economic and market information is corrupted in order to nudge the victim into making poor business decisions. In this case, the action is offensive, as both are seeking to gain an edge over the other and alter the status quo in the commodity market. This applies if one or both of the actors are providing substitute products.\n## Categorisation of cyber-operations on commodity value chains\nIt is technically feasible for cyber-operations to support or act as the primary weapon in Economic Information Warfare targeting specific commodity value chains. With the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the associated drives for hyper-connected systems, there are likely to be vulnerable systems at various points along the value chain. Table 2, below, aligns the various attack strategies to the stages of the value chain.\n|  Stage | Degrade | Deny | Disrupt | Exploit | Corrupt  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Source | X |  | X |  |   |\n|  Processing | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Loading | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Transport | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Port | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Commercial – decision making |  |  |  | X | X  |\n|  Commercial – access to economic information | X | X | X |  | X  |\nTable 2: Attack strategies per stage of the commodity value chain\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nTable 3, below, summarises the scenarios' categorisation in terms of the offensive or defensive nature of the cyber-operations based on the attacker and victim type (competitor, new entrant, or substitute) as per the Five Forces Model. Offensive actions can be considered as the cyber-operations aimed at changing the economic status in favour of the perpetrator, whereas defensive actions can be considered to be cyber-operations to maintain the perpetrator's current economic status.\n|   | Attacker  |   |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |   |  Competitor | New Entrant | Substitute  |\n|  Victim | Competitor | Offensive (S3) | Offensive (S1) | Offensive (S4b)  |\n|   |  New entrant | Defensive (S2) | Offensive (S5) | Offensive (S5)  |\n|   |  Substitute | Defensive (S4a) | Offensive (S5) | Offensive (S5)  |\nTable 3: Classification of attacks on a commodity value chain\nThe categorisations in Table 3 can play a part in deciding the legality of the actions and appropriate responses, based on the perceived intent of the actions. A defensive cyberattack can ultimately be interpreted as a response to other perceived economic attacks.\n# Legal Considerations for Cyber-Operations on Commodity Value Chains\nCan cyber-operations on commodity value chains be considered acts of war? Is there any legal recourse available, and can it be justified? The most difficult challenge is whether a cyberattack or cyber-operation invokes jus ad bellum. The Tallinn Manuals provide some explanation of the UN Charter in terms of cyber-operations and the key point of contention, the use of force. A cyber-operation will only invoke the UN Charter when its effects are similar or equivalent to that of a physical attack that would invoke the UN Charter. Goldsmith (2013) indicates that \"a cyber-attack that renders the electricity grid or air-traffic control system inoperable, and that as a result causes many deaths\" are cases that can be considered a use of force. However, there remains little clarity whether a slow, disruptive cyberattack on critical infrastructure that gradually renders it partially operable (such as Scenarios 1 and 2) can be deemed a use of force. In such scenarios, the question becomes how international law would apply when just one aspect of the value chain is attacked (such as Country B's corruption of Country A's project information to degrade the functioning of the value chain) and leads to an equivalent of a partial economic blockade. Therefore, a full economic shutdown (such as a power grid) can be considered an act of war, and armed retaliation may result; whereas targeting a value chain is not as severe, and the response needs to be proportional. However, The Singapore Norms, although not considered legislation, state as the first norm that \"State and non-state actors should not tamper with products and services in development and production, nor allow them to be tampered with, if doing so may substantially impair the stability of cyberspace\" . Norm six further states that, \"States should enact appropriate measures, including laws and regulations, to ensure basic cyber hygiene\" . Therefore, the Singapore Norms would consider cyber-operations targeting value chains as irresponsible, but the norms would also place responsibility on the nations to put measures in place to protect themselves.\nEconomic espionage and information theft (Scenario 5) are not considered to invoke the UN Char-\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nter, and Tallinn 2.0 (Rule 32) states that there remains no international law prohibiting the legalities of espionage . On the one hand, there is the actual legality of the espionage itself, and on the other hand is the legality of the method of the espionage, once again becoming a grey area. Economic espionage is usually considered under criminal law, and not International Humanitarian Law (IHL). The Singapore Norms recognise the need for military and intelligence cyber-operations ; therefore, a response to economic espionage is unlikely to include an attack.\nWith regards to sovereignty, Rule 21 of the Tallinn Manual states that a country under attack is permitted to conduct a cyber-operation that violates the sovereignty of the attacking country; furthermore, the illegality of the response is precluded and is, therefore, justified. However, Tallinn also states that any such recourse must preclude the use of force and should be proportionate . There also remains the condition of attribution, where there needs to be reasonable certainty of perpetration prior to response. The protection of one's own economy may not be sufficient justification for employing cyber-operations to disrupt the development of another country's economy (Scenarios 2 and 4a).\n## Discussion\nFrom the description of the cyberattacks on industrial control systems and those affecting the transportation sector, it is technically feasible to disrupt various stages in a commodity supply chain. From a legal perspective, there are a number of challenges regarding cyber-operations on commodity value chains. Whilst a catastrophic attack against a national economy can be considered an act of war, the legalities of partial disruptions described by the scenarios remain somewhat of a grey area. The Singapore Norm against tampering with products and services indicates that cyber-operations against commodity value chains are irresponsible and that states should refrain from such activities. However, given the legal grey area, it is feasible that states could attempt to disrupt value chains and escape significant or meaningful reprisal.\nFrom Table 3, above, seven of the nine possibilities can be considered offensive, indicating that a cyber-operation against a commodity value chain is more likely to be offensive in nature than defensive. This may influence the victim's interpretation of a cyber-operation, resulting in a situation in which the Cyber-Security Dilemma comes into being as the situation escalates. The guidance provided by The Tallinn Manuals and the Singapore Norms Package on the applicability of international law to cyber-operations as economic attacks raises the questions of whether the action was offensive or defensive or if retaliation to an offensive cyberattack can be legally justified. As Rule 21 of The Tallinn Manuals allows a state under attack to retaliate via a cyber-operation provided it does not include the use of force, nations could respond to offensive economic attacks via cyber-operations. Disrupting the legitimate development of another economy through cyber-operations is not likely to be justifiable even if they protect the attacker's economy. Disrupting another county's economy in order to develop one's own is even less likely justifiable. As discussed above, these cyber-operations can result in some retaliation as per Rule 21; however, for a response to be justified, sufficient attribution is required. Therefore, the capability of the victim to detect a cyber-operation designed for stealth and slow degradation of value chains may become the key factor as to whether a nation could retaliate.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nEconomic Information Warfare ...\nTo summarise, cyber-operations targeting commodity value chains are technically feasible. There is a legal grey area as to whether these cyber-operations will be considered as a use of force due to their limited impact, or whether a cyberattack in response to offensive cyber-operations that disrupt economic activity will be legally justified. Difficulties in detection and attribution may further hinder a nation's ability to respond or to retaliate. The use of cyber-operations for economic espionage may, however, be allowable based on the guidance of the documents considered. The authors do not condone such operations; however, their viability needs to be assessed to discuss (and, if necessary, prepare) appropriate responses.\n## Conclusion\nCyber-operations are a possible tool to conduct Economic Information Warfare. International trade in raw materials is based on commodity value chains; targeting these can be analogous to a limited traditional blockade on the commodity. The Cyber-Security Dilemma and Porter’s Five Forces Model are used to illustrate possible scenarios employing cyber-operations to target the commodity value chain. While it is technically feasible to conduct these attacks, the legalities thereof remain a contentious area, with a current emphasis on interpretations of IHL, balanced by specific obligations. Based on The Tallinn Manuals, the law of armed conflict would apply to cyber-operations, both nationally and internationally under certain conditions. Leetaru (2017) notes that the focus on “cyber warfare” in Tallinn 1.0 changed to “cyber-operations” in Tallinn 2.0, reflecting the complexities of operations in cyber-space, where cyberattacks often fall below the threshold of formal acts of war based on IHL. The main contention, therefore, remains the definition of what can be construed as an act of war in cyber-space. In the case of cyberattacks on commodity value chains, the scope of the attack is limited, and therefore will likely fall below the threshold of an act of war and limit a victim’s response options. Future research could look at the main efforts to develop cyber-legislation that falls within the ambit of IHL and apply this legislation to critical infrastructure protection\n## Acknowledgements\nThe first author received funding by the South African National Research Foundation, Grant no. 115059."

    "Economic Information Warfare ...\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nThis article aims to investigate the feasibility of cyber-operations against the physical transport infrastructure as an aspect of Economic Information Warfare. The article is conceptual, using hypothetical examples, documents, and logical discussion to illustrate the technical and legal considerations for Economic Information Warfare (EIW) to gain or protect competitive economic advantage based on commodity trade. The basis of the discussion revolves around the Cyber-Security Dilemma and Porter's Five Forces models; by combining these models and using hypothetical scenarios, the article proposes a categorisation scheme for strategic cyber-operations against commodities to influence international trade. The Tallinn Manuals on international law and cyber-operations (Schmitt 2013; Schmitt 2017) are used to provide a discussion on the legal considerations of the proposed framework.\n\nThis paper provides background on Information Warfare, Economic Information Warfare, the Cyber-Security Dilemma, and The Tallinn Manuals. The commodity value chain and relevant models are then introduced. The feasibility of disrupting commodity value chains through cyber-operations are discussed using analysis of hypothetical scenarios. The Tallinn Manuals are then used to provide a legal perspective for targeting the commodity chains. This is followed by a discussion and conclusion.\n\n## Background\n\n### Information Warfare\n\n'Information Warfare' (IW) is regarded as consisting of tactics, techniques, and procedures used in the information domain to gain an advantage over an adversary during a period of conflict or competition (Brazzoli 2007; Stupples 2015). The information domain can be comprised of physical, logical (or virtual), and cognitive components (Brazzoli 2007), and, therefore, can be comprised of cyber-operations as well as other forms of conflict, such as psychological operations (Brazzoli 2007; Stupples 2015). Defensive Information Warfare can be seen to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems to authorised entities. Information Warfare strategies to attack include destroying data, manipulating/corrupting data, stealing/exploiting data, denying or disrupting access to data, altering the perceptions of the target population towards the data, or changing the context in which the data is viewed (Hutchinson &amp; Warren 2001). Table 1, below, illustrates these Information Warfare concepts.\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",
    "Economic Information Warfare ...\n\n|   | Aspects of Secure Information  |   |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |   |  Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability  |\n|  Domains | Cognitive |  | Alter perception\nAlter context |   |\n|   |  Logical | Exploit | Manipulate\nCorrupt | Deny\nDisrupt  |\n|   |  Physical | Steal | Damage | Destroy  |\n\nTable 1: Offensive Information Warfare Techniques\n\n# Economic Information Warfare\n\nLambert (2017) contrasts two types of economic warfare:\n\n- the traditional blockade or bombing of factories, a slow attrition designed to degrade the economy and a nation's warfighting capacity; and\n- economic warfare that targets the societal psychology, as proposed by the British prior to the First World War, in which global sea communications would be disrupted.\n\nThe latter was attempted at the outbreak of World War I but failed after being abandoned a few months later due to resistance by the British's own businesses; the former blockade style was employed during World War II by the German U-boats and in the U.S. submarine campaign against the Japanese (Lambert 2017). Deakin (2003) considers a number of tactics that can be conducted as economic warfare, including\n\n- Affecting trade conditions;\n- Affecting market liquidity;\n- Denying market access (such as embargoes or blockades);\n- Degrading market efficiency (for example, resulting in slower delivery of goods or services);\n- Degrading supply chains;\n- Degrading foreign markets;\n- Exploiting, denying, or degrading supporting infrastructure;\n- Exploiting, denying, degrading, or corrupting economic information.\n\nThe descriptions by both Deakin (2003) and Lambert (2017) include measures that directly affect the ability to trade commodities and other materials; this concept is key to this paper. Lambert (2017) notes that globalisation has resulted in the almost-immediate fluctuation of commodity prices due to predictions of supply excess or deficiencies.\n\nAs reliance on information technologies and their role in globalisation increased, the concept of Economic Information Warfare as an aspect of Information Warfare closely related to cyber operations emerged. Economic Information Warfare is considered to be the activities to control, protect, and potentially disrupt economic activity through information and information systems (Chatterji 2008; Libicki 1995). Chatterji (2008) equates Economic Information Warfare with a version of economic blockade that would affect societies by restricting the flow of economic information.\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",
    "Economic Information Warfare ...\n\nHowever, attacks on critical infrastructure can also have severe economic consequences (Caldeira et al. 2015).\n\nDeakin (2003) considers the relationship between protecting financial information systems from cyberattacks and national security. He concludes that there needs to be a redefinition of the term ‘national security’ (all that it means and encompasses) and that attacks resulting in the failure of critical financial systems could potentially be economically disastrous. Power grids are also potential targets that could have severe economic consequences if disrupted by cyber-operations. Lloyd’s and Centre for Risk Studies (2015) indicates that malware affecting 50 generators in the U.S. could potentially have an economic impact of $1 trillion. In 2015 and 2016, there were successful cyberattacks on the Ukrainian power grid, which caused a disruption in electricity supply (Patterson 2017). Power grids appear to attract more attacks: the U.S. ICS-CERT (c. 2017) shows that 17% of the investigated incidents affected the energy sector, 8% targeted the transportation sector, and 4% critical manufacturing.\n\nWheeler (2018) considers cyber warfare as having no rules; and with the growing prevalence of cyberattacks, there is an increased likelihood of strategic attacks against national economies. Cyber-operations that severely disrupt financial or power systems could be potentially devastating in terms of both the economic and societal implications. It is possible that such an attack would draw widespread condemnation and possibly military action in retaliation. Attacking commodity trade is ‘high-precision’ but more subtle, which would not be as broadly devastating. Such an attack is likely to fall short of sufficient grounds for military retaliation. Lambert (2017) cautions that the use of cyber-operations to cause economic effects could have the same result as the failed British economic warfare concept. (The parallel relies on the fact that sea communication was a developing concept at the time about which there was a lack of understanding, as is currently the case with cyber-security and cyber-operations.)\n\n## The Cyber-Security Dilemma\n\nThe Cyber-Security Dilemma is an evolution of the security dilemma or spiral model of international relations, which has been applied into the cyber-domain. Reuter (2011) considers the Cyber-Security Dilemma as measures taken by a nation to increase the security of its digital infrastructure, which then decreases the cyber-security of another country. He suggests that it is difficult to differentiate between offensive and defensive intentions in cyber-space, particularly because the techniques that are used are often very similar. Libicki (2016) suggests that the Cyber-Security Dilemma is not as prevalent as it appears to be; he considers most defensive actions in cyberspace are easily identified as such, except for the case of active defence. From an economics perspective, nations improving their cyber-security could benefit other states by reducing the number of staging points from which an attack may be launched.\n\nBuchanan (2017) provides an in-depth discussion of the Cyber-Security Dilemma. He indicates that there are legitimate defensive reasons to conduct network intrusions; at the same time, he concedes most nations would consider any intrusion into a sensitive network as threatening. While sensitive systems are considered, there is no explicit mention of cyber-physical systems, such as industrial control, in the considerations of the Cyber-Security Dilemma. In this context, the likelihood is that any penetration into these systems will be aggressive, as there is limited defensive val\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",
    "Economic Information Warfare ...\n\nue (in cyber-security terms) that an intruder can gain from affecting cyber-physical systems. There may, however, be economic reasons that make cyber-physical systems targets for intrusion, such as assessing the rate of manufacture or throughput of a product or attempting to discover industrial processes through cyber-espionage.\n\nFor the purposes of this paper, the concept that nations can take defensive actions which negatively affect the security of other nations is the one which will be considered. Later in the article, this concept will be modified and applied into an economic setting.\n\n## International cyber-operations and security frameworks\n\nInternational law has an important role regarding cyber-operations, especially when a cyber-operation is performed within the context of an international armed conflict (Boyle 2012). The Tallinn Manuals (Schmitt 2013; Schmitt 2017) provide in-depth non-binding analyses of applicability of existing international law to cyber-operations, including the areas of sovereignty, due diligence, jurisdiction, international responsibility, cyber-operations, and international human rights. These analyses were developed by international law experts to propose principles to govern cyber-warfare, including the elements of jus ad bellum (governing the use of force by a state as an instrument of its international policy), together with jus in bello (regulating the conduct of armed conflict). With the growing prevalence of cyberattacks, the concepts contained in The Tallinn Manuals have become of utmost interest.\n\nIn 2018, the Norm Package Singapore was developed by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) with the purpose of proposing best practices to safeguard a reliable Internet while recognising the interdependence of the global communities. It sought to prevent the consequences of any major disruption of the Internet and to promote ethical behaviour of all entities involved (GCSC 2018).\n\n## Commodity Value Chains\n\nThis section presents the basic principles that contribute towards the concept of commodity value chains, including Porter’s Five Forces Model.\n\n## The value chain\n\nThe value chain is considered to be a “system of interdependent activities, which are connected by linkages” (Porter &amp; Millar 1985). These activities can impact on each other’s effectiveness, and an optimised value-chain can be created by making trade-offs based on the various linkages.\n\nPorter and Millar (1985) consider the role of information and information technology in an organisation’s competitive advantage. In particular, the information and information technology impacts the linkages within the value chain. In addition to the greater speed at which traditionally information-related tasks can be performed, technology has improved the physical aspects of an organisation, particularly through improved automation, control, and monitoring of processes. In 1985, information technologies were considered to have increased rivalries, increased the threat of substitute products, and increased the power of buyers (Porter &amp; Millar 1985). This integration of information activities across businesses drove management information systems and enabled\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",
    "Economic Information Warfare ...\n\ntraditional business processes and management activities (Laudon &amp; Laudon 2014), as is illustrated in Figure 1, below. For the purposes of this paper, the focus will be on concepts related to supply-chain management.\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\nFigure 1: Information activities in the value chain, adapted from Laudon &amp; Laudon (2014, p. 55)\n\nInformation technology continues to impact the value chains through greater connectivity and access to data in what has become known as the Digital Revolution (or the Fourth Industrial Revolution) based on hyper-connected devices or the Internet of Things that allows for unprecedented access to data and to control over processes.\n\n## Commodity value chains\n\nThe traditional value chains are designed for specific organisations within their competitive industries. However, with globalisation and mass exports and imports of various raw materials and manufactured goods, the concept of global commodity chains emerged, first coined by Gereffi in 1994 (Kaplinsky 2004). The global commodity chain is different from the traditional value chain model in that an international component is included, and organisations need to coordinate the information, business, and management activities (from Figure 1, above) across multiple countries or regions (Kaplinsky 2004).\n\nThe economies of some developing nations, such as in Africa, are based on raw material commodities (African Union [AU] 2017). In addition to the African economies' being dependent on commodities, it can be further detailed that these are agricultural commodities. For the development of value chains in this region, it was identified that competitive products need to be produced while reducing the transaction costs; efficiencies in the processing, marketing, and production functions are key to competitiveness (AU 2017).\n\nA European perspective of critical commodity value chains is based on raw minerals that support industrialisation and digitisation. In turn, the current digitisation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is key to developing and supporting these value chains. One of the key concerns for strategic mineral value chains is identified as the evolution and disruption brought about by this age of innovation, fuelled by rapid technological advancements (Faure-Schuyer, Egenhofer &amp; Elkerbout\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",
    "Economic Information Warfare ...\n\n2018). Another key challenge that was identified is the ability to secure access to the necessary minerals, either through trade or by nations becoming self-sufficient (Faure-Schuyer, Egenhofer &amp; Elkerbout 2018). These challenges highlight important aspects of this paper: access to critical resources may not be as straightforward as it may seem, and the technological disruption may introduce vulnerabilities in the commodity chain that could be exploited by a competitor.\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\nFigure 2, below, illustrates a generalised commodity value chain. The material is mined or produced, transported to initial processing or refining, then loaded (often using conveyer belts or similar equipment) onto long-haul transport (road or rail) to be taken to the port, where it is loaded onto bulk carriers for export overseas. A corporate division controls or directs the various processes (denoted by the dashed arrows) and provides supportive processes.\nFigure 2: The commodity value chain\n\n# Porter's Five Forces Model\n\nPorter's Five Forces (also known as Competitive Forces) Model is a key model for strategic management, and describes external factors that affect an organisation's standing in its market environment (Grundy 2006; Laudon &amp; Laudon 2014):\n\n- Bargaining power of suppliers,\n- Bargaining power of customers,\n- Threat of new entrants,\n- Threat of substitute products,\n- Competitive rivalry.\n\nThese forces are illustrated in Figure 3, below. For the purposes of this paper, there is a focus on three of the forces: threat of new entrants, threat of substitute products, and competitive rivalry. The bargaining power of suppliers is implicit in some of the scenarios.\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",
    "Economic Information Warfare ...\n\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\nFigure 3: Porter's Five Forces Model, adapted from Grundy (2006, p. 215) and Laudon &amp; Laudon (2014, p. 124)\n\n# Cyberattacks on the Commodity Value Chain\n\nAttacks can be leveraged against various points in the commodity value chain to achieve cascading effects. In particular, single points of failure in the value chain may prove to have greater impact on the commodity supply if they are successfully disrupted by cyberattacks. Industrial processes, transportation systems, and corporate decision making are all valid targets.\n\nThe industrial processes in a commodity value chain can include refineries or other processing of raw materials, mining equipment, and equipment to load and unload bulk cargo (such as conveyer belts) and containers onto trains, trucks, and ships. There have been a number of successful attacks on industrial control systems that have affected nuclear enrichment facilities (Stuxnet) or damaged a refinery, oil rigs, and chemical plants (Pretorius &amp; van Niekerk 2016). The transportation infrastructure has also seen successful cyberattacks affecting port scheduling and customs systems, sea-going vessels, tram and train ticketing systems; and vulnerabilities have been reported in many systems for rail and vessel navigation (van Niekerk 2017). These indicate that attacks against the industrial control systems and transportation systems are technically feasible.\n\nCorporate processes and decision making are also valid targets. This can be achieved through disrupting or corrupting the communications with clients and suppliers, thereby impacting the scheduling of trains, trucks, or vessels. By corrupting economic and business information, executives may make incorrect decisions, such as over-pricing material based on the incorrect information or ordering reduced production if they believe there is a surplus of materials. Corrupting main-\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",
    "Economic Information Warfare ...\n\ntenance information can result in a lack of spare parts or critical equipment failures due to lack of maintenance. Corrupting individuals themselves through cyber-extortion of similar means can ensure poor decisions are made. These methods will be slower to perform than those that directly targeting the infrastructure. Figure 4, below, illustrates the attack points against the commodity value chain.\n\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\nFigure 4: Attacks on the commodity supply chain\n\nThe attacks described above are feasible; however, when considering large value chains, there may be a need to target multiple instances of systems across different organisations to be effective. Figure 5, below, provides an example in which there are two organisations, each with a headquarters controlling the mines (each with multiple pits and a refinery), with both rail and road transportation. Therefore, if one refinery fails due to a cyberattack, the others can carry a higher load. If trains are disrupted, trucks can be used as an alternative. This redundancy indicates that a cyberattack targeting a single point of failure will maximise the impact for less effort.\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",
    "Economic Information Warfare ...\n\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\nFigure 5: Ports as a single point of failure\n\nAs is illustrated in Figure 5, above, the number of ports is usually limited, and only a few of those would handle a specific commodity. Therefore, targeting the ports will prove to be the most effective as this will impact on most of the land transportation and the mines' ability to supply material.\n\n## Scenarios\n\nThis section presents five hypothetical scenarios to illustrate possible situations leading to cyber-operations against aspects of the commodity value chain. The concept of defensive and offensive cyber-operations proposed in the Cyber-Security Dilemma are introduced in these scenarios.\n\n## Scenario 1\n\nCountry A discovers a deposit of strategic minerals, which has not previously been found in the country. Consequently, the unit price for the mineral has lowered; however, the country does not yet have the capacity to compete with more established exporters of the mineral that have standing trade agreements.\n\nThe main supplier of the mineral, Country B, has several co-located mines extracting the mineral, which is then transported to the coast mostly by train; transport by truck is possible, but is more expensive and slower. On the coast there is one port that has bulk-handling facilities to load the mineral onto the ships. There is also a multi-purpose terminal to allow for machinery spares to be imported for the port and the mines. The nearest city is approximately a two-hour drive from the port.\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",
    "Economic Information Warfare ...\n\nCountry A decides that for it to be able to compete, it needs to secretly hinder Country B's ability to supply the mineral. To achieve this goal, a cyberattack against the control systems for the extraction process at the largest mine is undertaken, resulting in physical damage to key components in the process. As spares are difficult to procure, this action hinders production for months. Minor follow-up attacks affect the port's systems, randomly corrupting data on the loading of the vessel, necessitating manual confirmation of the recorded values thereby slowing down the turnaround time of vessels. This reduces the supply of the mineral from Country B, drives up prices, and leads some importers of the mineral to seek alternative sources—and ultimately turn to Country A.\n\nBy disrupting the regular supply of the major supplier of mineral, Country A has altered the status quo and has reduced the competitiveness of Country B due to the irregular supply. As the supply reduced, the price of the mineral increased, and Country A benefitted by providing the alternative supply. As Country A sought to increase its standing by altering the status quo, this can be considered an offensive operation in terms of Economic Information Warfare.\n\n## Scenario 2\n\nAs with Scenario 1, Country A discovers a deposit of strategic minerals, which has not previously been found in the country. Consequently, the unit price for the mineral has lowered; however, the country does not yet have the capacity to compete with more established exporters of the mineral that have standing trade agreements.\n\nThe main supplier of the mineral, Country B, becomes concerned that there is a new supplier and that its economic standing has been affected due to the discovery of the mineral deposit. A decision is made that, in order to maintain the status quo, Country A's ability to realise its potential as a supplier of the mineral needs to be disrupted. The main effort is to penetrate the project office's systems and alter the data and information, affecting the management activities related to the value chain. This results in delays in component deliveries, some design flaws requiring the re-manufacturing of components, and the gauge of the train tracks and the carriages to be mismatched. The project, therefore, faces major setbacks; and subtle design flaws in both hardware and firmware of the control systems cause erratic system behaviour and early component failure.\n\nAs the project is beset with apparent incompetence and glitches from the beginning, Country A is not considered a capable supplier, and importers of the mineral continued to favour Country B as the main exporter. Even though the deposit existed, Country A's inability to supply the commodity allowed the mineral price to almost return to its initial value. Country B's use of cyberattack can, therefore, be considered defensive as it maintained the status quo by protecting the country's standing and stabilising the cost of the mineral.\n\n## Scenario 3\n\nThere are two major exporters of oil into a contested region; both are established and are direct economic rivals. In order to assert dominance in the region, Exporter 1 launches cyberattacks against the pipelines of Exporter 2, reducing the flow of oil into the region. To make up for the shortfall, Exporter 1 supplies extra oil at a slightly cheaper rate, provided that there is a revised trade agreement which ultimately secures long-term export of oil into the region for Exporter 1.\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",
    "Economic Information Warfare ...\n\nTo ensure this continues, Exporter 1 inserts a malicious remote access tool into the systems of Exporter 2's pipelines that will allow for future attacks that can cause an overpressure and rupture the pipelines.\n\nIn this scenario, a rival changes the economic status quo by affecting the main competitor's ability to supply oil. The cyber-operations are offensive in that the perpetrator actively seeks to gain long-term economic benefits from disrupting its competitors' operation.\n\n## Scenario 4\n\nIt is found that a strategic metal, Alloy A, can be replaced by another material, Alloy B. While Alloy B is not ideal, it is cheaper and easier to process and store. As a result, a number of major importers of Alloy A reduce their demand in favour of Alloy B. As with Scenario 2, a major exporter of Alloy B decides to disrupt the manufacture and export of the substitute alloy. This can be seen as defensive action as the original exporter is attempting to keep the status quo. Conversely, if the exporters of Alloy B attempted to disrupt the suppliers of the original material, as in Scenario 1, the effort would constitute offensive action as there is an attempt to change the status quo.\n\n## Scenario 5\n\nTwo new market entrants are vying for dominance. Using cyber-espionage, they seek to discover each other's processes in order to compete. This effort then turns to using cyber-operations to disrupt each other's ability to manufacture and supply. The economic and market information is corrupted in order to nudge the victim into making poor business decisions. In this case, the action is offensive, as both are seeking to gain an edge over the other and alter the status quo in the commodity market. This applies if one or both of the actors are providing substitute products.\n\n## Categorisation of cyber-operations on commodity value chains\n\nIt is technically feasible for cyber-operations to support or act as the primary weapon in Economic Information Warfare targeting specific commodity value chains. With the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the associated drives for hyper-connected systems, there are likely to be vulnerable systems at various points along the value chain. Table 2, below, aligns the various attack strategies to the stages of the value chain.\n\n|  Stage | Degrade | Deny | Disrupt | Exploit | Corrupt  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Source | X |  | X |  |   |\n|  Processing | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Loading | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Transport | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Port | X | X | X |  |   |\n|  Commercial – decision making |  |  |  | X | X  |\n|  Commercial – access to economic information | X | X | X |  | X  |\n\nTable 2: Attack strategies per stage of the commodity value chain\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",
    "Economic Information Warfare ...\n\nTable 3, below, summarises the scenarios' categorisation in terms of the offensive or defensive nature of the cyber-operations based on the attacker and victim type (competitor, new entrant, or substitute) as per the Five Forces Model. Offensive actions can be considered as the cyber-operations aimed at changing the economic status in favour of the perpetrator, whereas defensive actions can be considered to be cyber-operations to maintain the perpetrator's current economic status.\n\n|   | Attacker  |   |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |   |  Competitor | New Entrant | Substitute  |\n|  Victim | Competitor | Offensive (S3) | Offensive (S1) | Offensive (S4b)  |\n|   |  New entrant | Defensive (S2) | Offensive (S5) | Offensive (S5)  |\n|   |  Substitute | Defensive (S4a) | Offensive (S5) | Offensive (S5)  |\n\nTable 3: Classification of attacks on a commodity value chain\n\nThe categorisations in Table 3 can play a part in deciding the legality of the actions and appropriate responses, based on the perceived intent of the actions. A defensive cyberattack can ultimately be interpreted as a response to other perceived economic attacks.\n\n# Legal Considerations for Cyber-Operations on Commodity Value Chains\n\nCan cyber-operations on commodity value chains be considered acts of war? Is there any legal recourse available, and can it be justified? The most difficult challenge is whether a cyberattack or cyber-operation invokes jus ad bellum. The Tallinn Manuals provide some explanation of the UN Charter in terms of cyber-operations and the key point of contention, the use of force. A cyber-operation will only invoke the UN Charter when its effects are similar or equivalent to that of a physical attack that would invoke the UN Charter. Goldsmith (2013) indicates that \"a cyber-attack that renders the electricity grid or air-traffic control system inoperable, and that as a result causes many deaths\" are cases that can be considered a use of force. However, there remains little clarity whether a slow, disruptive cyberattack on critical infrastructure that gradually renders it partially operable (such as Scenarios 1 and 2) can be deemed a use of force. In such scenarios, the question becomes how international law would apply when just one aspect of the value chain is attacked (such as Country B's corruption of Country A's project information to degrade the functioning of the value chain) and leads to an equivalent of a partial economic blockade. Therefore, a full economic shutdown (such as a power grid) can be considered an act of war, and armed retaliation may result; whereas targeting a value chain is not as severe, and the response needs to be proportional. However, The Singapore Norms, although not considered legislation, state as the first norm that \"State and non-state actors should not tamper with products and services in development and production, nor allow them to be tampered with, if doing so may substantially impair the stability of cyberspace\" (GCSC 2018). Norm six further states that, \"States should enact appropriate measures, including laws and regulations, to ensure basic cyber hygiene\" (GCSC 2018). Therefore, the Singapore Norms would consider cyber-operations targeting value chains as irresponsible, but the norms would also place responsibility on the nations to put measures in place to protect themselves.\n\nEconomic espionage and information theft (Scenario 5) are not considered to invoke the UN Char-\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",
    "Economic Information Warfare ...\n\nter, and Tallinn 2.0 (Rule 32) states that there remains no international law prohibiting the legalities of espionage (Schmitt 2017). On the one hand, there is the actual legality of the espionage itself, and on the other hand is the legality of the method of the espionage, once again becoming a grey area. Economic espionage is usually considered under criminal law, and not International Humanitarian Law (IHL). The Singapore Norms recognise the need for military and intelligence cyber-operations (GCSC 2018); therefore, a response to economic espionage is unlikely to include an attack.\n\nWith regards to sovereignty, Rule 21 of the Tallinn Manual states that a country under attack is permitted to conduct a cyber-operation that violates the sovereignty of the attacking country; furthermore, the illegality of the response is precluded and is, therefore, justified. However, Tallinn also states that any such recourse must preclude the use of force and should be proportionate (Schmitt 2013). There also remains the condition of attribution, where there needs to be reasonable certainty of perpetration prior to response. The protection of one's own economy may not be sufficient justification for employing cyber-operations to disrupt the development of another country's economy (Scenarios 2 and 4a).\n\n## Discussion\n\nFrom the description of the cyberattacks on industrial control systems and those affecting the transportation sector, it is technically feasible to disrupt various stages in a commodity supply chain. From a legal perspective, there are a number of challenges regarding cyber-operations on commodity value chains. Whilst a catastrophic attack against a national economy can be considered an act of war, the legalities of partial disruptions described by the scenarios remain somewhat of a grey area. The Singapore Norm against tampering with products and services indicates that cyber-operations against commodity value chains are irresponsible and that states should refrain from such activities. However, given the legal grey area, it is feasible that states could attempt to disrupt value chains and escape significant or meaningful reprisal.\n\nFrom Table 3, above, seven of the nine possibilities can be considered offensive, indicating that a cyber-operation against a commodity value chain is more likely to be offensive in nature than defensive. This may influence the victim's interpretation of a cyber-operation, resulting in a situation in which the Cyber-Security Dilemma comes into being as the situation escalates. The guidance provided by The Tallinn Manuals and the Singapore Norms Package on the applicability of international law to cyber-operations as economic attacks raises the questions of whether the action was offensive or defensive or if retaliation to an offensive cyberattack can be legally justified. As Rule 21 of The Tallinn Manuals allows a state under attack to retaliate via a cyber-operation provided it does not include the use of force, nations could respond to offensive economic attacks via cyber-operations. Disrupting the legitimate development of another economy through cyber-operations is not likely to be justifiable even if they protect the attacker's economy. Disrupting another county's economy in order to develop one's own is even less likely justifiable. As discussed above, these cyber-operations can result in some retaliation as per Rule 21; however, for a response to be justified, sufficient attribution is required. Therefore, the capability of the victim to detect a cyber-operation designed for stealth and slow degradation of value chains may become the key factor as to whether a nation could retaliate.\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",
    "Economic Information Warfare ...\n\nTo summarise, cyber-operations targeting commodity value chains are technically feasible. There is a legal grey area as to whether these cyber-operations will be considered as a use of force due to their limited impact, or whether a cyberattack in response to offensive cyber-operations that disrupt economic activity will be legally justified. Difficulties in detection and attribution may further hinder a nation's ability to respond or to retaliate. The use of cyber-operations for economic espionage may, however, be allowable based on the guidance of the documents considered. The authors do not condone such operations; however, their viability needs to be assessed to discuss (and, if necessary, prepare) appropriate responses.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCyber-operations are a possible tool to conduct Economic Information Warfare. International trade in raw materials is based on commodity value chains; targeting these can be analogous to a limited traditional blockade on the commodity. The Cyber-Security Dilemma and Porter’s Five Forces Model are used to illustrate possible scenarios employing cyber-operations to target the commodity value chain. While it is technically feasible to conduct these attacks, the legalities thereof remain a contentious area, with a current emphasis on interpretations of IHL, balanced by specific obligations. Based on The Tallinn Manuals, the law of armed conflict would apply to cyber-operations, both nationally and internationally under certain conditions. Leetaru (2017) notes that the focus on “cyber warfare” in Tallinn 1.0 changed to “cyber-operations” in Tallinn 2.0, reflecting the complexities of operations in cyber-space, where cyberattacks often fall below the threshold of formal acts of war based on IHL. The main contention, therefore, remains the definition of what can be construed as an act of war in cyber-space. In the case of cyberattacks on commodity value chains, the scope of the attack is limited, and therefore will likely fall below the threshold of an act of war and limit a victim’s response options. Future research could look at the main efforts to develop cyber-legislation that falls within the ambit of IHL and apply this legislation to critical infrastructure protection\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe first author received funding by the South African National Research Foundation, Grant no. 115059.\n\n## References\n\nAfrican Union (AU) 2017, ‘Challenges of commodity value chain development towards improving the competitiveness of agricultural commodity in Africa’, 2nd Conference of the STC on Agriculture, Rural Development, Water and Environment, viewed 14 June 2019, <https: 33005-doc-challenges_of_commodity_value_chain_development-eng.pdf=\"\" au.int=\"\" default=\"\" documents=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\">.\n\nBoyle, AS 2012, Moving towards Tallinn: Drafting the shape of cyber warfare, viewed 21 March 2019, <https: ASP%20reports=\"\" ref%200086%20-%20moving%20towards%20tallinn.pdf=\"\" www.americansecurityproject.org=\"\">.\n\nJournal of Information Warfare</https:></https:>",
