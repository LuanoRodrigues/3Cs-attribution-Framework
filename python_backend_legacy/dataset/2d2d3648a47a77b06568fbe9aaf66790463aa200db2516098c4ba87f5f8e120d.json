INTRODUCTION\n\nThe advent of the Information Age was sudden and abrupt, changing the world in ways Gutenberg could not have possibly imagined even in his wildest dreams.² Cyberspace is the veritable Wild West of the modern age; a largely untamed infinite wilderness of possibilities and opportunities.\n\nThis paper will explore why the Internet³ and cyberspace are so different from traditional notions of real property, and what challenges that difference presents to players on the international stage, and will rectify whether cyberspace is a new landscape deserving of its own unique law, or whether existing law is equipped to deal with the challenges of cyberspace as written. Next is a thorough exploration of what a cyber attack might be, could be, should be, and should not be, along with a discussion of why cyber attacks are not only a matter of international importance but why, in some respects, only the international community might be equipped to foster dialogue about how to deal with cyber attacks. There is also a call to action for the United Nations, with the perhaps premature admonishment that the United Nations is in the habit of addressing new and different challenges to international law. The third and final part of this\n\n¹ M.

Then the definition and the framework it provides is put to the test by applying it to two possible instances of cyber attacks: Stuxnet, and Operation Shady RAT.\n\n## II. CYBERSPACE:⁴ THE NEW FRONTIER?\n\nThe United States Department of Defense defines cyberspace broadly: A global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.⁵ Webopedia condenses the definition into something a bit more palatable: Cyberspace is, at its simplest, a metaphor for describing the non-physical terrain created by computer systems.⁶\n\nPrior to considering the impact of cyberspace on international law at large, it should be noted that there are differences in levels of nefarious cyber activities, including cyber crime, cyber espionage,⁷ cyber terrorism, cyber attacks, and (the very hotly debated⁸) cyber warfare.⁹\n\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n\n⁴ Scott Thill, *March 17, 1948: William Gibson, Father of Cyberspace* (17 March 2009) WIRED, available at http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2009/03/dayintech_0317 (Attributing the term “cyberspace” to William Gibson; a term Gibson would later describe in *No Maps for These Territories* as an “evocative and essentially meaningless” buzzword that could serve as a cipher for all of his cybernetic musings).\n\n⁵ CJCS CM-0363-08, available at www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/index.html.\n\n⁶ Webopedia, “Cyberspace,” (last accessed 19 Nov. 2012) available at http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/cyberspace.html.\n\n⁷ Espionage is the world’s second oldest profession.

But, for introductory purposes, scholars appear to agree that a cyber crime is not a cyber attack, and thus a cyber attack can at least be loosely defined by what it is not.¹⁷\n\nHowever, even once defined, there are lingering questions: should a cyber attack be considered an act of war? How would a state defend itself against such an attack? How can a state defend itself against an attack with attribution is in some cases impossible.

[...] I think that is a terrible metaphor and I think that is a terrible concept. There are no winners in that environment.\"¹⁹ However, Schmidt’s stance is in direct disagreement with that of Michael McConnell, the former director of national intelligence, who testified to Congress earlier in 2010 that the country was already in the midst of losing a cyber war.²⁰ Meanwhile, still others argue that cyber warfare is just a new version of three activities states know all too well, and practiced for millennia: sabotage, espionage, and subversion.²¹\n\nThe ramifications of considering cyber attacks an act of warfare are astronomical.²² As Schmidt stated, there are certainly reasons for considering it a terrible metaphor, and a terrible concept. But then, is an attack on a state’s cyberspace really that different from any other extraterritorial breach of sovereignty?\n\nThese issues lead to a threshold question: do computer networks pose something unique enough to require the international community to formulate new bodies of law to deal with the novel issues cyberspace and cyber attacks pose? Or, should cyber attacks be addressed in the same way as any other act of aggression and through existing international law, with no differentiation between a state’s cyberspace and real territory?\n\nB.

According to Easterbrook’s theory, states should take their existing tort, contract, property law, etc., and use the broad rules encompassed in those areas of law to address cyberspace instead of fabricating new law to address cyberspace specifically, based on the presumption that creating a Law of the Horse for cyberspace will be shallow, disjointed and ultimately, futile.²⁶\n\nEasterbrook makes three core suggestions for making this work in cyberspace: (1) Rules should be clearly defined; (2) Property rights should be created where there are none; and (3) The law should facilitate the formation of bargaining institutions.²⁷ Thus, Easterbrook argues for a laissez-faire view of the internet, that we have cyberspace as it is, we should let it evolve, and we should sit back and enjoy it.²⁸ The basic assumption is that if states have well-defined rights\n\n5 | Page\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n\n23 Frank H.

The architecture of physical space is generally unmalleable; that is to say, a state cannot just unilaterally say “Let’s move this ocean,” and then do so. Likewise, customary international law recognizes defined territory as a qualification for statehood,³⁷ and with battles over land punctuating the history of mankind since 2700 B.C.E., it is evident that defining and changing territorial lines is anything but easy.³⁸\n\nCyberspace is different; the architecture of it is malleable, and thus, cyberspace requires its own set of rules since cyberspace essentially allows states in a sense to move mountains³⁹ and to do so quickly; a notion that is difficult to analogize to the physical world. Thus, the policy behind cyberspace and cyber warfare should reflect the malleable architecture of cyberspace, meaning that cyberspace and attacks upon it should be addressed with their own separate area of law.\n\nLessig’s argument that cyberspace requires its own proverbial Law of the Horse⁴⁰ is far more compelling than Easterbrook’s position that there is not and should be no Law of the Horse,⁴¹ because cyberspace demands flexibility and different standards to address the unique nature of the challenges faced in cyber warfare, instead of denying their existence and essentially forcing a square peg to fit in a round hole, which is what Easterbrook seems to propose.

WHAT IS A CYBER ATTACK AND WHY SHOULD WE CARE?\n\nIn an interview with the BBC about the threat of cyber warfare, Dr. Hamadoun Toure, the head of the United Nations telecommunications agency said the “best way to win a war is to avoid it in the first place.”42 The United Nations has called on member states to talk to each other, and to pull back from the threat of cyber war.43 That sounds facially simple, but as it stands, states cannot agree even on what a cyber warfare incident is.44 Suffice it to say, states would find it difficult to agree to enter into an agreement avoiding a threat their brightest experts cannot even clearly define. However, it is clear that despite differing opinions on what cyber warfare really is, cyber security, and the breaches of cyber security are issues of the utmost importance and international law has yet to truly react to the threat cyber security poses for the international community.45\n\nIn February 2011, then-Central Intelligence Agency Director Leon Panetta warned, “The next Pearl Harbor could very well be a cyber attack.”46 William Lynn, America’s Deputy Secretary of Defense wrote, “Although cyberspace is a man-made domain, [it is] just as critical to military operations as land, sea, air and space.”47\n\n## A.

A PROPOSED DEFINITION AND ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\n### A. DEFINING A CYBER ATTACK: A NARROWLY TAILORED APPROACH\n\nBefore international law can even remotely begin to address the threat cyber attacks and to prosecute their perpetrators, what a cyber attack is must first be succinctly defined. In an article co-authored with multiple other minds, Oona Hathaway suggested the adoption of a narrow definition of what a cyber attack is, in order to focus attention on the niche cyber warfare fills in the international community: “A cyber-attack consists of any action taken to undermine the functions of a computer network for a political or national security purpose.”⁸² This definition breaks down into easily manageable elements that properly address the specific threat posed by cyber aggression, it echoes Clausewitz’s elemental breakdown of an act of war, and it addresses the intent of the perpetrator called for in The Economist and by Solce. This definition appears to satisfy the vast majority of concerns voiced by scholars on the issue. Implicit in the term “cyber attack” is the idea that the conduct must be active to constitute an attack, whether it is active offensively or defensively.⁸³ Thus, passive conduct like scanning for viruses is filtered out of the definition at the threshold.⁸⁴\n\n### 1.

To undermine the function;\n\nThe objective of a cyber attack must be to undermine the function of a computer network; otherwise, the definition encompasses more than it should.⁹⁰ The concept revolves around some kind of compromise or disruption of a computer system instead of simply the use of a computer system in a security breach or an information leak.⁹¹ Note that passive observance of activity or copying of information, no matter how illicit, is not enough to constitute a cyber attack or an act of cyber warfare, thus eliminating some of the aforementioned cyber crimes from the definition, and leaving them to each individual state to deal with domestically.⁹²\n\n3.

For a political or national security purpose.\n\nActions driven by national security or political purposes properly distinguish cyber attacks from ordinary crime.97 A cyber malfeasance that is not carried out for political or national security purposes, such as Internet fraud, identity theft, piracy, etc., while perhaps interesting for examination for questions of, inter alia, international jurisdiction, is, as previously mentioned, a cyber crime best left to the domain of each individual state to regulate.98 Thus, the definition of cyber warfare is limited by focusing on the purpose of the action as opposed to the intent of the actor to best address the vast ramifications of cyber attacks without limiting possible actors to state actors, only.99\n\n## B.

Although we will refrain from explicitly identifying most of the victims, describing only their general industry, we feel that naming names is warranted in certain cases, not with the goal of attracting attention to a specific victim organization, but to reinforce the fact that virtually everyone is falling prey to these intrusions, regardless of whether they are\n\n¹¹³ Jim Finkle, “State Actor” behind slew of cyber attacks (3 Aug. 2011) REUTERS, available at http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/03/us-cyberattacks-idUSTRE7720HU20110803.\n¹¹⁴ See Finkle (Several other security experts said the evidence points to China).\n¹¹⁵ Roger Grimes, Danger: Remote Access Trojans (Sept. 2002) Security Administrator, available at http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd632947.aspx(“A remote access tool (RAT) is a piece of software that allows a remote \"operator\" to control a system as if he has physical access to that system.”)\n¹¹⁶ Dmitri Alperovitch, Revealed: Operation Shady RAT McAfee, 3-4 (2011) available at http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-operation-shady-rat.pdf.\n¹¹⁷ Daniel Emery, Governments, IOC and UN hit by massive cyber-attack (3 Aug. 2011) BBC NEWS, available at http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14387559.\n¹¹⁸ See Finkle.\n\n19 | Page\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590",

Next is a thorough exploration of what a cyber attack might be, could be, should be, and should not be, along with a discussion of why cyber attacks are not only a matter of international importance but why, in some respects, only the international community might be equipped to foster dialogue about how to deal with cyber attacks.

Then the definition and the framework it provides is put to the test by applying it to two possible instances of cyber attacks: Stuxnet, and Operation Shady RAT.\n## II. CYBERSPACE:⁴ THE NEW FRONTIER?\nThe United States Department of Defense defines cyberspace broadly: A global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.⁵ Webopedia condenses the definition into something a bit more palatable: Cyberspace is, at its simplest, a metaphor for describing the non-physical terrain created by computer systems.⁶\nPrior to considering the impact of cyberspace on international law at large, it should be noted that there are differences in levels of nefarious cyber activities, including cyber crime, cyber espionage,⁷ cyber terrorism, cyber attacks, and (the very hotly debated⁸) cyber warfare.⁹\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n⁴ Scott Thill, *March 17, 1948: William Gibson, Father of Cyberspace* (17 March 2009) WIRED, available at http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2009/03/dayintech_0317 (Attributing the term “cyberspace” to William Gibson; a term Gibson would later describe in *No Maps for These Territories* as an “evocative and essentially meaningless” buzzword that could serve as a cipher for all of his cybernetic musings).\n⁵ CJCS CM-0363-08, available at www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/index.html.\n⁶ Webopedia, “Cyberspace,” (last accessed 19 Nov. 2012) available at http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/cyberspace.html.\n⁷ Espionage is the world’s second oldest profession. Thus, there is a wealth of material written regarding international law and espionage that would be applicable to espionage in all forms, all of which far exceeds the scope of this paper. See R. M.

But, for introductory purposes, scholars appear to agree that a cyber crime is not a cyber attack, and thus a cyber attack can at least be loosely defined by what it is not.¹⁷\nHowever, even once defined, there are lingering questions: should a cyber attack be considered an act of war? How would a state defend itself against such an attack? How can a state defend itself against an attack with attribution is in some cases impossible. And, at what point does a cyber attack escalate into cyber warfare?\n## A.

[...] I think that is a terrible metaphor and I think that is a terrible concept. There are no winners in that environment.\"¹⁹ However, Schmidt’s stance is in direct disagreement with that of Michael McConnell, the former director of national intelligence, who testified to Congress earlier in 2010 that the country was already in the midst of losing a cyber war.²⁰ Meanwhile, still others argue that cyber warfare is just a new version of three activities states know all too well, and practiced for millennia: sabotage, espionage, and subversion.²¹\nThe ramifications of considering cyber attacks an act of warfare are astronomical.²² As Schmidt stated, there are certainly reasons for considering it a terrible metaphor, and a terrible concept. But then, is an attack on a state’s cyberspace really that different from any other extraterritorial breach of sovereignty?\nThese issues lead to a threshold question: do computer networks pose something unique enough to require the international community to formulate new bodies of law to deal with the novel issues cyberspace and cyber attacks pose? Or, should cyber attacks be addressed in the same way as any other act of aggression and through existing international law, with no differentiation between a state’s cyberspace and real territory?\nB. THE LAW OF THE HORSE: THE WORLD IS FAR BEYOND CHARIOTS AND CHAINMAIL\n¹⁸ For the purposes of this paper, “cyber attack” will be used as the generic term for politically motivated computer crimes, with “cyber warfare” representing a subset of cyber attacks that could be considered actual acts of war.\n¹⁹ Singel.\n²⁰ Id.\n²¹ Thomas Rid, *Cyber War Will Not Take Place*, 35 JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES 1, 5-32 (2012).\n²² A discussion of just how astronomical those ramifications would be far exceeds the scope of this paper, but the classification of such acts as “warfare” certainly invokes a militaristic response.\n4 | Page\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nThe Honorable Frank H. Easterbrook said, “[C]ourses should be limited to subjects that could illuminate the entire law.”²³ The basic concept is that there is no Law of the Horse; that is to say, efforts to collect all laws involving horses²⁴ and to aggregate them into one comprehensive Law of the Horse are, “doomed to be shallow and to miss unifying principles.”²⁵ Thus, Easterbrook suggests the study of general rules when dealing with cyberspace and simply basic existing law to cyberspace as it is. According to Easterbrook’s theory, states should take their existing tort, contract, property law, etc., and use the broad rules encompassed in those areas of law to address cyberspace instead of fabricating new law to address cyberspace specifically, based on the presumption that creating a Law of the Horse for cyberspace will be shallow, disjointed and ultimately, futile.²⁶\nEasterbrook makes three core suggestions for making this work in cyberspace: (1) Rules should be clearly defined; (2) Property rights should be created where there are none; and (3) The law should facilitate the formation of bargaining institutions.²⁷ Thus, Easterbrook argues for a laissez-faire view of the internet, that we have cyberspace as it is, we should let it evolve, and we should sit back and enjoy it.²⁸ The basic assumption is that if states have well-defined rights\n5 | Page\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n23 Frank H.

Far better for most students--better, even, for those who plan to go into the horse trade--to take courses in property, torts, commercial transactions, and the like, adding to the diet of horse cases a smattering of transactions in cucumbers, cats, coal, and cribs. Only by putting the law of the horse in the context of broader rules about commercial endeavors could one really understand the law about horses.”)\n26 Id.

The architecture of physical space is generally unmalleable; that is to say, a state cannot just unilaterally say “Let’s move this ocean,” and then do so. Likewise, customary international law recognizes defined territory as a qualification for statehood,³⁷ and with battles over land punctuating the history of mankind since 2700 B.C.E., it is evident that defining and changing territorial lines is anything but easy.³⁸\nCyberspace is different; the architecture of it is malleable, and thus, cyberspace requires its own set of rules since cyberspace essentially allows states in a sense to move mountains³⁹ and to do so quickly; a notion that is difficult to analogize to the physical world. Thus, the policy behind cyberspace and cyber warfare should reflect the malleable architecture of cyberspace, meaning that cyberspace and attacks upon it should be addressed with their own separate area of law.\nLessig’s argument that cyberspace requires its own proverbial Law of the Horse⁴⁰ is far more compelling than Easterbrook’s position that there is not and should be no Law of the Horse,⁴¹ because cyberspace demands flexibility and different standards to address the unique nature of the challenges faced in cyber warfare, instead of denying their existence and essentially forcing a square peg to fit in a round hole, which is what Easterbrook seems to propose. The international legal community must evolve and embrace the challenges presented by cyberspace, regardless of how baffling they might be, and recognize that though attempts to deal such an alien landscape will be imperfect at best, such attempts will be vital to breathe life into the\n³⁷ Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, Art. 1, 165 LNTS 19; 49 Stat 3097 (1934).\n³⁸ John Keegan, War and Our World, note 2, at 29 (2001) (Stating Gilgamesh, who ruled the Mesopotamian city of Uruk, undertook one of history’s first offensive military campaigns in 2700 B.C.).\n³⁹ At least, mountains of data.\n⁴⁰ Lessig at 501.\n⁴¹ See Easterbrook at 207 (“The best way to learn the law applicable to specialized endeavors is to study general rules”).\n7 | Page\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\ninternational community’s ability to maintain relative order and peace in a rapidly changing world.\n## II. WHAT IS A CYBER ATTACK AND WHY SHOULD WE CARE?\nIn an interview with the BBC about the threat of cyber warfare, Dr. Hamadoun Toure, the head of the United Nations telecommunications agency said the “best way to win a war is to avoid it in the first place.”42 The United Nations has called on member states to talk to each other, and to pull back from the threat of cyber war.43 That sounds facially simple, but as it stands, states cannot agree even on what a cyber warfare incident is.44 Suffice it to say, states would find it difficult to agree to enter into an agreement avoiding a threat their brightest experts cannot even clearly define. However, it is clear that despite differing opinions on what cyber warfare really is, cyber security, and the breaches of cyber security are issues of the utmost importance and international law has yet to truly react to the threat cyber security poses for the international community.45\nIn February 2011, then-Central Intelligence Agency Director Leon Panetta warned, “The next Pearl Harbor could very well be a cyber attack.”46 William Lynn, America’s Deputy Secretary of Defense wrote, “Although cyberspace is a man-made domain, [it is] just as critical to military operations as land, sea, air and space.”47\n## A. DOES THIS MEAN WAR?\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nGenerally speaking, international law permits three situations as legal causes for war: (1) Self defense; (2) Defense of an ally under a mutual defense pact; and (3) via a UN sanction.⁴⁸ An offensive act has to meet certain criteria to qualify as an act of war.⁴⁹ The United States Army’s Cyber Operations and Cyber Terrorism Handbook defines a cyber attack as: “The premeditated use of disruptive activities, or the threat thereof, against computers and/or networks, with the intention to cause harm or to further social, ideological, religious, political, or similar objectives. Or to intimidate any person in furtherance of such objectives.”⁵⁰ A cyber attack, unlike a cyber crime, involves “an aggressive act on the part of one adversary—whether an individual, a competing organization or a rival government—against another in an ongoing struggle for hegemony in the marketplace or the political arena.”⁵¹\nCarl von Clausewitz, a Prussian military theorist, penned a succinct, elemental breakdown of what is needed to constitute an act of war.⁵² First, there must be an act of force to compel the enemy to do something.⁵³ Second, that act must be instrumental; i.e., there must be both a means and an end with force being the means and the acceptance of the aggressor’s will as the end.⁵⁴ Third, the act must be political.⁵⁵ As Clausewitz famously said, “War is a mere continuation of politics by other means.”⁵⁶ While Clausewitz’s framework is simple and concise, there is of course plentiful room to debate the interpretation of each element, and thus whether or\n⁴⁸ United Nations, Charter of the United Nations, 1 U.N.T.S.

WHY ARE CYBER ATTACKS AN ISSUE OF INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE?\nThere is little debate that modern states increasingly rely on both global and domestic information structures.58 Information gathering and the disruption of communication channels have always been tools of war, and arguably, the destruction of an enemy’s communication networks could reap greater benefits for an aggressor than the destruction of weapons arsenals or supply chains.59 The more heavily a nation state relies on the Internet, especially for military and governmental infrastructures, the more tempting it becomes for states in conflict to exploit those vulnerabilities through cyber attacks.60\nPerhaps the most compelling and confusing reason cyber attacks are of international concern is in the nature of how information is sent over the Internet; that is to say that when a computer sends information over the Internet that information is divided into “packets,” and those packets adopt their routes to network congestion, opting for the path of least resistance.61 Since the Internet was specifically designed to send information through the fastest route\n10 | Page\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n57 See Rid for a thorough discussion of why cyber attacks may not qualify as acts of war. But see Commander Todd C. Huntley, Controlling the Use of Force in Cyber Space: The Application of the Law of Armed Conflict During a Time of Fundamental Change in the Nature of Warfare 60 NAVAL L.

Consider the following: (1) Outer space and the inception of “space law”69 following the launch of Sputnik in 1958;70 (2) The evolution of international maritime law, regulating regions once seen as mysterious, difficult to navigate, and possibly infinite;71 and, (3) The regulation of Antarctica.72 Further, the United Nations is no stranger to new paradigms when it becomes apparent that the area of law at issue is a matter of international concern.73 Cyberspace is certainly an issue of global concern due to its very nature, and is thusly compatible with Article 2 of the United Nations Charter.74\n## C. CICERO ON CYBERSPACE: EXISTING LAW IS SILENT\nTo be quite blunt, international law falls short in terms of securing cyberspace and addressing cyber attacks. To date, there are no treaties in existence dealing directly with cyber\n12 | Page\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nattacks or cyber warfare.75 The United Nations called on nations to “talk to each other,” and “pull back from the threat of cyber war,”76 but such a plea is woefully inadequate at best.\nHowever, as discussed previously, there is plentiful existing international law in various forms dealing with and governing inter alia, the vastness of outer space and the depths of the oceans that could be adapted to address the complexities presented by cyberspace and attacks on and in it.77 Additionally, the commentaries to the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols suggest that “armed conflict” may be considered an expansive term, would could subject cyber attacks to the expansive body of existing international humanitarian law.78\nThe Tallinn Manual, written by group of experts working with the Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (“CCDCOE”), an institute based in Tallinn, Estonia, specifically contemplates how international law should apply to conflict in cyberspace, keeping in mind the problem that laws of conventional warfare are difficult to apply to such an amorphous space.79\n\"One of the challenges states face in the cyber environment is that the scope and manner of international law's applicability to cyber operations where in offense or defense has remained unsettled since their advent,\" wrote Michael N. Schmitt, project director and chairman of the International Law Department at the U.S. Naval War College, in the manual's introduction. \"The threshold questions are whether the existing law applies to cyber issues at all, and, if so, how.\"80\nHowever, the Tallinn Manual is not an official document and is instead the summation of opinions of a group of experts acting solely in their personal capacity, and the CCDCOE cautions\n13 | Page\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n75 Eric Jensen, Sovereignty and Neutrality in Cyber Conflict, 35 FORDHAM INT'L L.J. 815 (2012).\n76 See Rundle article.\n77 For an in-depth discussion of existing international law and possible analogies to cyber attacks see generally Shackelford, Nuclear War to Net War.\n78 Swanson at 313.\n79 See Kirk article.\n80 Id.

A PROPOSED DEFINITION AND ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n### A. DEFINING A CYBER ATTACK: A NARROWLY TAILORED APPROACH\nBefore international law can even remotely begin to address the threat cyber attacks and to prosecute their perpetrators, what a cyber attack is must first be succinctly defined. In an article co-authored with multiple other minds, Oona Hathaway suggested the adoption of a narrow definition of what a cyber attack is, in order to focus attention on the niche cyber warfare fills in the international community: “A cyber-attack consists of any action taken to undermine the functions of a computer network for a political or national security purpose.”⁸² This definition breaks down into easily manageable elements that properly address the specific threat posed by cyber aggression, it echoes Clausewitz’s elemental breakdown of an act of war, and it addresses the intent of the perpetrator called for in The Economist and by Solce. This definition appears to satisfy the vast majority of concerns voiced by scholars on the issue. Implicit in the term “cyber attack” is the idea that the conduct must be active to constitute an attack, whether it is active offensively or defensively.⁸³ Thus, passive conduct like scanning for viruses is filtered out of the definition at the threshold.⁸⁴\n### 1. Any action taken;\n14 | Page\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n⁸¹ CCDCOE Introduction to The Tallinn Manual, available at https://www.ccdcoe.org/249.html.\n⁸² Oona A. Hathaway, et al., *The Law of Cyber-Attack* 100 CAL. L. REV. 817, 826 (2012).\n⁸³ *Id.*\n⁸⁴ *Id.* at fn. 29\nAny action can be used as the means with which to carry out a cyber attack.⁸⁵ Thus, cyber warfare could be waged through hacking⁸⁶ or any number of other technological strategies as long as the goal of the attack is to undermine or disrupt a computer network.⁸⁷ The idea of classifying warfare based on the objective of the attack (for example, the objective of a cyber attack is to undermine the functions of a computer network) as opposed to the means (for example, nuclear warfare, chemical warfare, guerilla warfare) is intuitive, logical, and avoids accidental and unnecessary limitations on internet speech⁸⁸, which could be an issue under a means-based classification.⁸⁹\n2. To undermine the function;\nThe objective of a cyber attack must be to undermine the function of a computer network; otherwise, the definition encompasses more than it should.⁹⁰ The concept revolves around some kind of compromise or disruption of a computer system instead of simply the use of a computer system in a security breach or an information leak.⁹¹ Note that passive observance of activity or copying of information, no matter how illicit, is not enough to constitute a cyber attack or an act of cyber warfare, thus eliminating some of the aforementioned cyber crimes from the definition, and leaving them to each individual state to deal with domestically.⁹²\n3. Of a computer network;\n⁸⁵ Id. at 826.\n⁸⁶ Hacking is a general term for finding weaknesses in a computer or network and exploiting them.\n⁸⁷ Hathaway at 826.\n⁸⁸ Louis Charbonneau, Iran rejects UN criticism of its cyber security rules (25 Oct. 2012) Reuters, available at http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/25/net-us-iran-security-un-idUSBRE89O19420121025 (“In his latest report, U.N. special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Iran, Ahmed Shaheed, said he was concerned about reports of government activities ‘that seemingly infringe on freedom of expression and the right to information.’”)\n⁸⁹ Hathaway at 827.\n⁹⁰ Id. at 828.\n⁹¹ See Hathaway at 829 for a further discussion.\n⁹² Id.\n15 | Page\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nAt the most basic level, a computer network is a collection of computers connected to each other to facilitate the sharing of information and resources.93 While a common connection exists over the Internet, there is also an array of closed networks, like those used by various government agencies.94 Further, the prevalence of computers is crucial to striking at the core of the issue with cyber attacks and cyber warfare: Computers control elevators, stoplights, regulate water pressure, the power grid, etc.95 Thus it bears repeating: The potential for damage from cyber warfare increases as quickly as society's reliance on computer-driven technology.96\n## 4. For a political or national security purpose.\nActions driven by national security or political purposes properly distinguish cyber attacks from ordinary crime.97 A cyber malfeasance that is not carried out for political or national security purposes, such as Internet fraud, identity theft, piracy, etc., while perhaps interesting for examination for questions of, inter alia, international jurisdiction, is, as previously mentioned, a cyber crime best left to the domain of each individual state to regulate.98 Thus, the definition of cyber warfare is limited by focusing on the purpose of the action as opposed to the intent of the actor to best address the vast ramifications of cyber attacks without limiting possible actors to state actors, only.99\n## B. THE NEXT STEP: APPLYING THE DEFINITION TO INSTANCES OF CYBER ATTACKS\n### 1. Stuxnet\n16 | Page\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nStuxnet is a type of malware called a “worm,” which is a computer program that replicates itself to spread to other computers, usually using a network to spread itself.¹⁰⁰ The worm does not need to attach itself to an existing program on any of the computers, like other kinds of malware like a computer virus¹⁰¹ does. Typically a person installs a worm by inadvertently opening an email attachment or message that contains executable scripts.¹⁰²\nAccording to Symantec, Stuxnet infected Windows in its search for industrial control systems, which, in short, can be used to control the automation of industrial processes.¹⁰³ Thus, Stuxnet could potentially control or alter how such a system operates.¹⁰⁴ More specifically, Stuxnet included a special payload designed to target Siemens systems that were configured to control and monitor specific industrial processes, and different variants of the worm targeted organizations mainly in Iran between June 2009 and April 2010.¹⁰⁵\nInitial analysis revealed Stuxnet was likely written by a state to target Iran’s growing nuclear program, including uranium enrichment centrifuges at the Natanz facility in Iran.¹⁰⁶ Iranian officials admitted the worm infected staff computers but denied any major delays to the nuclear power program.¹⁰⁷\n¹⁰⁰ Bradley Mitchell, *Worm – Computer Worm* (last accessed on 19 Nov. 2012) About.com, *available at* http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/worldwideweb/g/bldef_worm.htm.

If the allegations set forth in the New York Times were true, and Stuxnet made its way to Iran at the hands of the United States, then does Stuxnet fit within the definition of a cyber attack? Absolutely. An offensive action was taken. It was certainly intended to undermine the function of a computer network; as it was intended to undermine the capabilities of the computer networks used to run Iran’s nuclear facilities. Presuming the United States was behind the attack, the objective was at the least political,¹¹¹, if it was not also perhaps an attempt to fortify national security. Given the historically cloudy relations between the United States and Iran,¹¹² if Iran was developing nuclear weapons as opposed to harnessing nuclear power, then it is certainly logical to consider nuclear weapons in the hands of Iranians a threat to national security in the United\n¹⁰⁸ David E.

Thus, under the proposed definition, Stuxnet is a clear example of what should be encompassed by were international law to adopt this definition of a cyber attack.\n## 2. Operation Shady RAT\nOperation Shady RAT perhaps better illustrates the challenges international law must face when dealing with cyber attacks. News reports and journal articles fall short of articulating what exactly happened in Operation Shady RAT, but a report issued by McAfee, the IT security firm giant who unearthed the attacks,¹¹³ revealed the following: (1) It is widely believed that there was one “state actor” behind the attacks, but McAfee declined to name it;¹¹⁴ (2) The attacks, named partially for a common acronym in the IT industry that stands for “remote access tool,”¹¹⁵ compromised no less than 71 identified parties, with more parties present in the activity logs where sufficient information was unavailable to accurately identify them;¹¹⁶ (3) The attacks lasted over five years;¹¹⁷ and, (4) Nobody knows what happened to the stolen data.¹¹⁸ Dmitri Alperovitch, Vice President of Threat Research at McAfee, discussed the breadth of the attacks in a report issued through McAfee:\nAfter painstaking analysis of the logs, even we were surprised by the enormous diversity of the victim organizations and were taken aback by the audacity of the perpetrators. Although we will refrain from explicitly identifying most of the victims, describing only their general industry, we feel that naming names is warranted in certain cases, not with the goal of attracting attention to a specific victim organization, but to reinforce the fact that virtually everyone is falling prey to these intrusions, regardless of whether they are\n¹¹³ Jim Finkle, “State Actor” behind slew of cyber attacks (3 Aug. 2011) REUTERS, available at http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/03/us-cyberattacks-idUSTRE7720HU20110803.\n¹¹⁴ See Finkle (Several other security experts said the evidence points to China).\n¹¹⁵ Roger Grimes, Danger: Remote Access Trojans (Sept. 2002) Security Administrator, available at http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd632947.aspx(“A remote access tool (RAT) is a piece of software that allows a remote \"operator\" to control a system as if he has physical access to that system.”)\n¹¹⁶ Dmitri Alperovitch, Revealed: Operation Shady RAT McAfee, 3-4 (2011) available at http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-operation-shady-rat.pdf.\n¹¹⁷ Daniel Emery, Governments, IOC and UN hit by massive cyber-attack (3 Aug. 2011) BBC NEWS, available at http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14387559.\n¹¹⁸ See Finkle.\n19 | Page\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nthe United Nations, a multinational Fortune 100 company, a small, non-profit think tank, a national Olympic team, or even an unfortunate computer security firm.¹¹⁹\nThe identity of the state actor behind the attacks was widely assumed to be China, however, Beijing proclaimed the accusations were “groundless.”¹²⁰ Frankly, whether China was behind the attack or not matters little when determining where Operation Shady RAT falls in regards to Hathaway’s cyber attack definition.\nThere is little doubt there was an action of some sort; even though research fails to really identify what the action was. It seems almost like the international cyber law version of *res ipsa loquitor*,¹²¹ a doctrine sounding in tort theory where the nature of an outcome speaks for itself and negligence¹²² may be inferred even absent of direct evidence of how the aggressor behaved.\nBut, was the attack intended to undermine the function of a computer network? The analysis becomes more convoluted because it seems the attack was intended to purloin information and not specifically to undermine the function of a computer network. Thus, Hathaway’s definition may very well exclude things like Operation Shady RAT from the definition of what a cyber attack is. Is that the correct outcome? It would certainly seem so given the lack of information that would be needed to come to any other conclusions. Were the definition widened it would defeat the entire purpose of the narrow tailoring of each element to comply with the plethora of concerns voiced by numerous scholars in the field.\nWould that analysis change if it was discovered Operation Shady RAT was politically motivated? Perhaps so, however, since no party has come forward with what happened to the\n¹¹⁹ Alperovitch at 3.\n¹²⁰ See Emery.\n¹²¹ Byrne v. Boadle, 2 Hurl. &amp; Colt. 722, 159 Eng.

Absent any further details, Operation Shady RAT simply is not what international law needs to spend time guarding against in the same way it does attacks similar to Stuxnet.\nFurther, the general purpose of public international law should not be forgotten, and that is that it serves as the framework for the practice of stable and organized international relations and stands in contrast to the remedial nature of dispute resolution commonly seen in civil domestic law.¹²³ Thus, while Operation Shady RAT may fall short of the suggested definition of a cyber attack, that is not to say domestic law would be incapable of restoring the parties if more information about the incident were available.\n## IV. Conclusion\nIn sum, the international legal community not only should task itself with drafting the Law of the Horse, but should also welcome the challenge. While Lessig may be more correct in his analogy of the current technological landscape than Easterbrook is wrong, that does not mean that the ideas of both men cannot be reconciled. There is no reason not to take the existing international public law concerning the seas or outer space and use that as a platform on which international law could evolve and improve. There is no reason to re-invent the wheel when there is plenty of law in existence that could be tailored to fit the unique needs required by this nebulous \"thing\" called cyberspace.\nThe potential for damage from cyber attacks increases as quickly as society's reliance on computer-driven technology.¹²⁴ It would do the globe a gross disservice to ignore the possible harm cyber attacks could cause, and to risk cyber security on an international level by failing to address a looming threat to the infrastructure of a vast number of states.

INTRODUCTION\nThe advent of the Information Age was sudden and abrupt, changing the world in ways Gutenberg could not have possibly imagined even in his wildest dreams. Cyberspace is the veritable Wild West of the modern age; a largely untamed infinite wilderness of possibilities and opportunities.\nThis paper will explore why the Internet and cyberspace are so different from traditional notions of real property, and what challenges that difference presents to players on the international stage, and will rectify whether cyberspace is a new landscape deserving of its own unique law, or whether existing law is equipped to deal with the challenges of cyberspace as written. Next is a thorough exploration of what a cyber attack might be, could be, should be, and should not be, along with a discussion of why cyber attacks are not only a matter of international importance but why, in some respects, only the international community might be equipped to foster dialogue about how to deal with cyber attacks. There is also a call to action for the United Nations, with the perhaps premature admonishment that the United Nations is in the habit of addressing new and different challenges to international law. The third and final part of this\n M. Tullius Cicero, *For Milo*, 11 (52 B.C.E.), translated version available at http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0020%3Atext%3DMil.%3Asection%3D11.\n Hal Abelson et al., *Blown to Bits: Your life, liberty, and happiness after the digital explosion*, 2-3 (2008).\n Id. 303 (“Fundamentally, the internet consists of computers sending bit packets that request services, and other computers sending packets back in response.

Then the definition and the framework it provides is put to the test by applying it to two possible instances of cyber attacks: Stuxnet, and Operation Shady RAT.\n## II. CYBERSPACE: THE NEW FRONTIER?\nThe United States Department of Defense defines cyberspace broadly: A global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers. Webopedia condenses the definition into something a bit more palatable: Cyberspace is, at its simplest, a metaphor for describing the non-physical terrain created by computer systems.\nPrior to considering the impact of cyberspace on international law at large, it should be noted that there are differences in levels of nefarious cyber activities, including cyber crime, cyber espionage, cyber terrorism, cyber attacks, and (the very hotly debated) cyber warfare.\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n Scott Thill, *March 17, 1948: William Gibson, Father of Cyberspace* (17 March 2009) WIRED, available at http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2009/03/dayintech_0317 (Attributing the term “cyberspace” to William Gibson; a term Gibson would later describe in *No Maps for These Territories* as an “evocative and essentially meaningless” buzzword that could serve as a cipher for all of his cybernetic musings).\n CJCS CM-0363-08, available at www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/index.html.\n Webopedia, “Cyberspace,” (last accessed 19 Nov. 2012) available at http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/cyberspace.html.\n Espionage is the world’s second oldest profession. Thus, there is a wealth of material written regarding international law and espionage that would be applicable to espionage in all forms, all of which far exceeds the scope of this paper. See R. M. Sheldon, *Espionage in the Ancient World: An Annotated Bibliography of Books and Articles in Western Languages* (2008).\n Ryan Singel, *White House Cyber Czar: “There Is No Cyber War”* (4 Mar. 2010) WIRED, available at http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/03/schmidt-cyberwar.\nClassification of malicious cyber activity might derive from the intent of the perpetrator and the effects of the act. For example, cyber crime typically involves the distribution of malware, child pornography, and other crimes conducted for profit and primarily motivated by financial gain or notoriety. Cyber espionage is motivated by the desire to unearth sensitive information, and could be conducted by an individual or a group, with the goal being a pecuniary gain or a strategic advantage. Cyber terrorism is intended to influence or motivate either an audience or a government or both through threats and violence, not unlike any other act of terrorism. A cyber terrorist uses tools available in cyberspace as weapons against both cyber and physical targets.\nThe definition of a cyber attack is still largely inconsistent, and something this paper will attempt to define. But, for introductory purposes, scholars appear to agree that a cyber crime is not a cyber attack, and thus a cyber attack can at least be loosely defined by what it is not.\nHowever, even once defined, there are lingering questions: should a cyber attack be considered an act of war? How would a state defend itself against such an attack? How can a state defend itself against an attack with attribution is in some cases impossible. And, at what point does a cyber attack escalate into cyber warfare?\n## A. CONCERNING TERMINOLOGY\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n\nThe term “cyber warfare” is controversial in and of itself. Howard Schmidt, the cybersecurity czar for the Obama administration, argued in March 2010 that \"There is no cyber war. [...] I think that is a terrible metaphor and I think that is a terrible concept. There are no winners in that environment.\" However, Schmidt’s stance is in direct disagreement with that of Michael McConnell, the former director of national intelligence, who testified to Congress earlier in 2010 that the country was already in the midst of losing a cyber war. Meanwhile, still others argue that cyber warfare is just a new version of three activities states know all too well, and practiced for millennia: sabotage, espionage, and subversion.\nThe ramifications of considering cyber attacks an act of warfare are astronomical. As Schmidt stated, there are certainly reasons for considering it a terrible metaphor, and a terrible concept. But then, is an attack on a state’s cyberspace really that different from any other extraterritorial breach of sovereignty?\nThese issues lead to a threshold question: do computer networks pose something unique enough to require the international community to formulate new bodies of law to deal with the novel issues cyberspace and cyber attacks pose? Or, should cyber attacks be addressed in the same way as any other act of aggression and through existing international law, with no differentiation between a state’s cyberspace and real territory?\nB. THE LAW OF THE HORSE: THE WORLD IS FAR BEYOND CHARIOTS AND CHAINMAIL\n For the purposes of this paper, “cyber attack” will be used as the generic term for politically motivated computer crimes, with “cyber warfare” representing a subset of cyber attacks that could be considered actual acts of war.\n Singel.\n Id.\n Thomas Rid, *Cyber War Will Not Take Place*, 35 JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES 1, 5-32 (2012).\n A discussion of just how astronomical those ramifications would be far exceeds the scope of this paper, but the classification of such acts as “warfare” certainly invokes a militaristic response.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nThe Honorable Frank H. Easterbrook said, “[C]ourses should be limited to subjects that could illuminate the entire law.” The basic concept is that there is no Law of the Horse; that is to say, efforts to collect all laws involving horses and to aggregate them into one comprehensive Law of the Horse are, “doomed to be shallow and to miss unifying principles.” Thus, Easterbrook suggests the study of general rules when dealing with cyberspace and simply basic existing law to cyberspace as it is. According to Easterbrook’s theory, states should take their existing tort, contract, property law, etc., and use the broad rules encompassed in those areas of law to address cyberspace instead of fabricating new law to address cyberspace specifically, based on the presumption that creating a Law of the Horse for cyberspace will be shallow, disjointed and ultimately, futile.\nEasterbrook makes three core suggestions for making this work in cyberspace: (1) Rules should be clearly defined; (2) Property rights should be created where there are none; and (3) The law should facilitate the formation of bargaining institutions. Thus, Easterbrook argues for a laissez-faire view of the internet, that we have cyberspace as it is, we should let it evolve, and we should sit back and enjoy it. The basic assumption is that if states have well-defined rights\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n\nand we know what those mean, we can assume individuals will make predictable choices and behave in the most efficient way possible.\nHowever, there is no doubt that the world has evolved beyond chariots and chainmail when it comes to warfare, and the mere existence of cyber attacks show that the laissez-faire method may not be the most effective approach, because as evidenced by some ethically and morally challenged actors, the most beneficial choice was the one that completely undermined a state’s rights over their cyber territory. The age-old adage about permission and forgiveness is proven quite true with cyber warfare: It is always easier to beg forgiveness than to ask permission, and when it comes to cyberspace and sovereignty it seems states and other actors would much prefer to put the cart before the horse.\nAlternatively, Lawrence Lessig argues that cyberspace is not the sum of its parts and cannot be dealt with through existing tort, contract, and property law. Lessig discusses behavioral constraints in cyberspace in terms of four different modalities and enforcement mechanisms: (1) Law, which is enforced by states; (2) Social norms, which are enforced by society; (3) Markets, which are enforced by price; and (4) The architecture of cyberspace itself, which is enforced by code. Essentially, Lessig argues the modalities of regulations are the prisms through which regulation of cyberspace need to be considered, and that cyberspace must be addressed holistically because if not, there is absolutely no way to regulate it.\n Id.\n For a list of the “major” cyber attacks through September of 2011, see Julian Ryall, *A history of major cyber attacks* (20 Sept. 2011) TELEGRAPH, available at http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/8775632/A-history-of-major-cyber-attacks.html.\n Lawrence Lessig, *The Law of the Horse: What Cyberlaw Might Teach*, 113 HARV. L. REV. 501 (1999).\n Id. at 506.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nLessig’s arguments hinge on the fact that analogies to physical spaces fail when applied to cyberspace and technology. The architecture of physical space is generally unmalleable; that is to say, a state cannot just unilaterally say “Let’s move this ocean,” and then do so. Likewise, customary international law recognizes defined territory as a qualification for statehood, and with battles over land punctuating the history of mankind since 2700 B.C.E., it is evident that defining and changing territorial lines is anything but easy.\nCyberspace is different; the architecture of it is malleable, and thus, cyberspace requires its own set of rules since cyberspace essentially allows states in a sense to move mountains and to do so quickly; a notion that is difficult to analogize to the physical world. Thus, the policy behind cyberspace and cyber warfare should reflect the malleable architecture of cyberspace, meaning that cyberspace and attacks upon it should be addressed with their own separate area of law.\nLessig’s argument that cyberspace requires its own proverbial Law of the Horse is far more compelling than Easterbrook’s position that there is not and should be no Law of the Horse, because cyberspace demands flexibility and different standards to address the unique nature of the challenges faced in cyber warfare, instead of denying their existence and essentially forcing a square peg to fit in a round hole, which is what Easterbrook seems to propose. The international legal community must evolve and embrace the challenges presented by cyberspace, regardless of how baffling they might be, and recognize that though attempts to deal such an alien landscape will be imperfect at best, such attempts will be vital to breathe life into the\n Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, Art. 1, 165 LNTS 19; 49 Stat 3097 (1934).\n John Keegan, War and Our World, note 2, at 29 (2001) (Stating Gilgamesh, who ruled the Mesopotamian city of Uruk, undertook one of history’s first offensive military campaigns in 2700 B.C.).\n At least, mountains of data.\n Lessig at 501.\n See Easterbrook at 207 (“The best way to learn the law applicable to specialized endeavors is to study general rules”).\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\ninternational community’s ability to maintain relative order and peace in a rapidly changing world.\n## II. WHAT IS A CYBER ATTACK AND WHY SHOULD WE CARE?\nIn an interview with the BBC about the threat of cyber warfare, Dr. Hamadoun Toure, the head of the United Nations telecommunications agency said the “best way to win a war is to avoid it in the first place.”42 The United Nations has called on member states to talk to each other, and to pull back from the threat of cyber war.43 That sounds facially simple, but as it stands, states cannot agree even on what a cyber warfare incident is.44 Suffice it to say, states would find it difficult to agree to enter into an agreement avoiding a threat their brightest experts cannot even clearly define. However, it is clear that despite differing opinions on what cyber warfare really is, cyber security, and the breaches of cyber security are issues of the utmost importance and international law has yet to truly react to the threat cyber security poses for the international community.45\nIn February 2011, then-Central Intelligence Agency Director Leon Panetta warned, “The next Pearl Harbor could very well be a cyber attack.”46 William Lynn, America’s Deputy Secretary of Defense wrote, “Although cyberspace is a man-made domain, [it is] just as critical to military operations as land, sea, air and space.”47\n## A. DOES THIS MEAN WAR?\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nGenerally speaking, international law permits three situations as legal causes for war: (1) Self defense; (2) Defense of an ally under a mutual defense pact; and (3) via a UN sanction. An offensive act has to meet certain criteria to qualify as an act of war. The United States Army’s Cyber Operations and Cyber Terrorism Handbook defines a cyber attack as: “The premeditated use of disruptive activities, or the threat thereof, against computers and/or networks, with the intention to cause harm or to further social, ideological, religious, political, or similar objectives. Or to intimidate any person in furtherance of such objectives.” A cyber attack, unlike a cyber crime, involves “an aggressive act on the part of one adversary—whether an individual, a competing organization or a rival government—against another in an ongoing struggle for hegemony in the marketplace or the political arena.”\nCarl von Clausewitz, a Prussian military theorist, penned a succinct, elemental breakdown of what is needed to constitute an act of war. First, there must be an act of force to compel the enemy to do something. Second, that act must be instrumental; i.e., there must be both a means and an end with force being the means and the acceptance of the aggressor’s will as the end. Third, the act must be political. As Clausewitz famously said, “War is a mere continuation of politics by other means.” While Clausewitz’s framework is simple and concise, there is of course plentiful room to debate the interpretation of each element, and thus whether or\n United Nations, Charter of the United Nations, 1 U.N.T.S.

WHY ARE CYBER ATTACKS AN ISSUE OF INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE?\nThere is little debate that modern states increasingly rely on both global and domestic information structures.58 Information gathering and the disruption of communication channels have always been tools of war, and arguably, the destruction of an enemy’s communication networks could reap greater benefits for an aggressor than the destruction of weapons arsenals or supply chains.59 The more heavily a nation state relies on the Internet, especially for military and governmental infrastructures, the more tempting it becomes for states in conflict to exploit those vulnerabilities through cyber attacks.60\nPerhaps the most compelling and confusing reason cyber attacks are of international concern is in the nature of how information is sent over the Internet; that is to say that when a computer sends information over the Internet that information is divided into “packets,” and those packets adopt their routes to network congestion, opting for the path of least resistance.61 Since the Internet was specifically designed to send information through the fastest route\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n\npossible, the route information takes to get from Computer A to Computer B may be far different from the route between Computers A and B as the crow flies.\nThis fact, while fabulously convenient for the casual Internet user wanting to check e-mail or moving listings, creates an incredible challenge to one of the most fundamental aspects of international law: territory. Attribution of cyber attacks is also difficult in light of the nature of the Internet. “[G]iven that the internet is intended to be open and anonymous, the attribution of cyber attacks can be very difficult to achieve and should not be taken lightly,” said David Wu, Subcommittee Chairman of the Committee on Science and Technology’s Subcommittee on Technology and Innovation during a 2010 hearing about cyber attack attribution technology. A cyber attacker in the domain of cyberspace can “shed ties of citizenship and cross sovereign boundaries without a trace,” cloaked in veritable anonymity. Though there is the physical presence of hardware in different sovereign states, the information contained in them and the software controlling their servers lacks roots to the physical realm.\n## 1. A Desperate Plea for U.N. Action\nInternational law must concern itself with what goes on in cyberspace. Regardless of whether cyberspace is considered an international commons of sorts or space subject to more traditional notions of sovereignty, the fact of the matter is that international law must attempt\n Ophardt at 24.\n “As the crow flies” is an idiom for the shortest distance between two points.\n Ophardt at 24.\n Molly Mulrain, *Cyber Attack Attribution Important to Cybersecurity*, *Says Committee* (16 July 2012)\nExecutiveGov.com, *available at* http://www.executivegov.com/2010/07/cyber-attack-attribution-important-to-cybersecurity-says-committee.\n Scott J.

Consider the following: (1) Outer space and the inception of “space law”69 following the launch of Sputnik in 1958;70 (2) The evolution of international maritime law, regulating regions once seen as mysterious, difficult to navigate, and possibly infinite;71 and, (3) The regulation of Antarctica.72 Further, the United Nations is no stranger to new paradigms when it becomes apparent that the area of law at issue is a matter of international concern.73 Cyberspace is certainly an issue of global concern due to its very nature, and is thusly compatible with Article 2 of the United Nations Charter.74\n## C. CICERO ON CYBERSPACE: EXISTING LAW IS SILENT\nTo be quite blunt, international law falls short in terms of securing cyberspace and addressing cyber attacks. To date, there are no treaties in existence dealing directly with cyber\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nattacks or cyber warfare.75 The United Nations called on nations to “talk to each other,” and “pull back from the threat of cyber war,”76 but such a plea is woefully inadequate at best.\nHowever, as discussed previously, there is plentiful existing international law in various forms dealing with and governing inter alia, the vastness of outer space and the depths of the oceans that could be adapted to address the complexities presented by cyberspace and attacks on and in it.77 Additionally, the commentaries to the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols suggest that “armed conflict” may be considered an expansive term, would could subject cyber attacks to the expansive body of existing international humanitarian law.78\nThe Tallinn Manual, written by group of experts working with the Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (“CCDCOE”), an institute based in Tallinn, Estonia, specifically contemplates how international law should apply to conflict in cyberspace, keeping in mind the problem that laws of conventional warfare are difficult to apply to such an amorphous space.79\n\"One of the challenges states face in the cyber environment is that the scope and manner of international law's applicability to cyber operations where in offense or defense has remained unsettled since their advent,\" wrote Michael N. Schmitt, project director and chairman of the International Law Department at the U.S. Naval War College, in the manual's introduction. \"The threshold questions are whether the existing law applies to cyber issues at all, and, if so, how.\"80\nHowever, the Tallinn Manual is not an official document and is instead the summation of opinions of a group of experts acting solely in their personal capacity, and the CCDCOE cautions\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n\nreaders that it is not meant to reflect NATO doctrine, and nor does it reflect the position of any organization or State represented by observers. While on the one hand, current international law essentially consists of abstinence-only education from the United Nations, on the other hand, there is hardly a shortage of law that could be retrofitted to address those short-comings.\n## III. A PROPOSED DEFINITION AND ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n### A. DEFINING A CYBER ATTACK: A NARROWLY TAILORED APPROACH\nBefore international law can even remotely begin to address the threat cyber attacks and to prosecute their perpetrators, what a cyber attack is must first be succinctly defined. In an article co-authored with multiple other minds, Oona Hathaway suggested the adoption of a narrow definition of what a cyber attack is, in order to focus attention on the niche cyber warfare fills in the international community: “A cyber-attack consists of any action taken to undermine the functions of a computer network for a political or national security purpose.” This definition breaks down into easily manageable elements that properly address the specific threat posed by cyber aggression, it echoes Clausewitz’s elemental breakdown of an act of war, and it addresses the intent of the perpetrator called for in The Economist and by Solce. This definition appears to satisfy the vast majority of concerns voiced by scholars on the issue. Implicit in the term “cyber attack” is the idea that the conduct must be active to constitute an attack, whether it is active offensively or defensively. Thus, passive conduct like scanning for viruses is filtered out of the definition at the threshold.\n### 1. Any action taken;\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n CCDCOE Introduction to The Tallinn Manual, available at https://www.ccdcoe.org/249.html.\n Oona A. Hathaway, et al., *The Law of Cyber-Attack* 100 CAL. L. REV. 817, 826 (2012).\n *Id.*\n *Id.* at fn. 29\nAny action can be used as the means with which to carry out a cyber attack. Thus, cyber warfare could be waged through hacking or any number of other technological strategies as long as the goal of the attack is to undermine or disrupt a computer network. The idea of classifying warfare based on the objective of the attack (for example, the objective of a cyber attack is to undermine the functions of a computer network) as opposed to the means (for example, nuclear warfare, chemical warfare, guerilla warfare) is intuitive, logical, and avoids accidental and unnecessary limitations on internet speech, which could be an issue under a means-based classification.\n2. To undermine the function;\nThe objective of a cyber attack must be to undermine the function of a computer network; otherwise, the definition encompasses more than it should. The concept revolves around some kind of compromise or disruption of a computer system instead of simply the use of a computer system in a security breach or an information leak. Note that passive observance of activity or copying of information, no matter how illicit, is not enough to constitute a cyber attack or an act of cyber warfare, thus eliminating some of the aforementioned cyber crimes from the definition, and leaving them to each individual state to deal with domestically.\n3. Of a computer network;\n Id. at 826.\n Hacking is a general term for finding weaknesses in a computer or network and exploiting them.\n Hathaway at 826.\n Louis Charbonneau, Iran rejects UN criticism of its cyber security rules (25 Oct. 2012) Reuters, available at http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/25/net-us-iran-security-un-idUSBRE89O19420121025 (“In his latest report, U.N. special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Iran, Ahmed Shaheed, said he was concerned about reports of government activities ‘that seemingly infringe on freedom of expression and the right to information.’”)\n Hathaway at 827.\n Id. at 828.\n See Hathaway at 829 for a further discussion.\n Id.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nAt the most basic level, a computer network is a collection of computers connected to each other to facilitate the sharing of information and resources.93 While a common connection exists over the Internet, there is also an array of closed networks, like those used by various government agencies.94 Further, the prevalence of computers is crucial to striking at the core of the issue with cyber attacks and cyber warfare: Computers control elevators, stoplights, regulate water pressure, the power grid, etc.95 Thus it bears repeating: The potential for damage from cyber warfare increases as quickly as society's reliance on computer-driven technology.96\n## 4. For a political or national security purpose.\nActions driven by national security or political purposes properly distinguish cyber attacks from ordinary crime.97 A cyber malfeasance that is not carried out for political or national security purposes, such as Internet fraud, identity theft, piracy, etc., while perhaps interesting for examination for questions of, inter alia, international jurisdiction, is, as previously mentioned, a cyber crime best left to the domain of each individual state to regulate.98 Thus, the definition of cyber warfare is limited by focusing on the purpose of the action as opposed to the intent of the actor to best address the vast ramifications of cyber attacks without limiting possible actors to state actors, only.99\n## B. THE NEXT STEP: APPLYING THE DEFINITION TO INSTANCES OF CYBER ATTACKS\n### 1. Stuxnet\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nStuxnet is a type of malware called a “worm,” which is a computer program that replicates itself to spread to other computers, usually using a network to spread itself. The worm does not need to attach itself to an existing program on any of the computers, like other kinds of malware like a computer virus does. Typically a person installs a worm by inadvertently opening an email attachment or message that contains executable scripts.\nAccording to Symantec, Stuxnet infected Windows in its search for industrial control systems, which, in short, can be used to control the automation of industrial processes. Thus, Stuxnet could potentially control or alter how such a system operates. More specifically, Stuxnet included a special payload designed to target Siemens systems that were configured to control and monitor specific industrial processes, and different variants of the worm targeted organizations mainly in Iran between June 2009 and April 2010.\nInitial analysis revealed Stuxnet was likely written by a state to target Iran’s growing nuclear program, including uranium enrichment centrifuges at the Natanz facility in Iran. Iranian officials admitted the worm infected staff computers but denied any major delays to the nuclear power program.\n Bradley Mitchell, *Worm – Computer Worm* (last accessed on 19 Nov. 2012) About.com, *available at* http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/worldwideweb/g/bldef_worm.htm.

The article dubbed the attacks “America’s first sustained use of cyberweapons,” and stated President Obama accelerated the attacks, which began during the Bush administration after an element of the program accidentally became public in the summer of 2010; an action that ultimately allowed Stuxnet to arrive at Iran’s Natanz plant. The article goes further to state that top officials had to consider whether America’s “most ambitious attempt to slow the progress of Iran’s nuclear efforts had been fatally compromised.”\nThe elements set forth by Hathaway were: (1) Any action taken; (2) To undermine the function; (3) Of a computer network; (4) For a political or national security purpose. If the allegations set forth in the New York Times were true, and Stuxnet made its way to Iran at the hands of the United States, then does Stuxnet fit within the definition of a cyber attack? Absolutely. An offensive action was taken. It was certainly intended to undermine the function of a computer network; as it was intended to undermine the capabilities of the computer networks used to run Iran’s nuclear facilities. Presuming the United States was behind the attack, the objective was at the least political,, if it was not also perhaps an attempt to fortify national security. Given the historically cloudy relations between the United States and Iran, if Iran was developing nuclear weapons as opposed to harnessing nuclear power, then it is certainly logical to consider nuclear weapons in the hands of Iranians a threat to national security in the United\n David E.

Thus, under the proposed definition, Stuxnet is a clear example of what should be encompassed by were international law to adopt this definition of a cyber attack.\n## 2. Operation Shady RAT\nOperation Shady RAT perhaps better illustrates the challenges international law must face when dealing with cyber attacks. News reports and journal articles fall short of articulating what exactly happened in Operation Shady RAT, but a report issued by McAfee, the IT security firm giant who unearthed the attacks, revealed the following: (1) It is widely believed that there was one “state actor” behind the attacks, but McAfee declined to name it; (2) The attacks, named partially for a common acronym in the IT industry that stands for “remote access tool,” compromised no less than 71 identified parties, with more parties present in the activity logs where sufficient information was unavailable to accurately identify them; (3) The attacks lasted over five years; and, (4) Nobody knows what happened to the stolen data. Dmitri Alperovitch, Vice President of Threat Research at McAfee, discussed the breadth of the attacks in a report issued through McAfee:\nAfter painstaking analysis of the logs, even we were surprised by the enormous diversity of the victim organizations and were taken aback by the audacity of the perpetrators. Although we will refrain from explicitly identifying most of the victims, describing only their general industry, we feel that naming names is warranted in certain cases, not with the goal of attracting attention to a specific victim organization, but to reinforce the fact that virtually everyone is falling prey to these intrusions, regardless of whether they are\n Jim Finkle, “State Actor” behind slew of cyber attacks (3 Aug. 2011) REUTERS, available at http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/03/us-cyberattacks-idUSTRE7720HU20110803.\n See Finkle (Several other security experts said the evidence points to China).\n Roger Grimes, Danger: Remote Access Trojans (Sept. 2002) Security Administrator, available at http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd632947.aspx(“A remote access tool (RAT) is a piece of software that allows a remote \"operator\" to control a system as if he has physical access to that system.”)\n Dmitri Alperovitch, Revealed: Operation Shady RAT McAfee, 3-4 (2011) available at http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-operation-shady-rat.pdf.\n Daniel Emery, Governments, IOC and UN hit by massive cyber-attack (3 Aug. 2011) BBC NEWS, available at http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14387559.\n See Finkle.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nthe United Nations, a multinational Fortune 100 company, a small, non-profit think tank, a national Olympic team, or even an unfortunate computer security firm.\nThe identity of the state actor behind the attacks was widely assumed to be China, however, Beijing proclaimed the accusations were “groundless.” Frankly, whether China was behind the attack or not matters little when determining where Operation Shady RAT falls in regards to Hathaway’s cyber attack definition.\nThere is little doubt there was an action of some sort; even though research fails to really identify what the action was. It seems almost like the international cyber law version of *res ipsa loquitor*, a doctrine sounding in tort theory where the nature of an outcome speaks for itself and negligence may be inferred even absent of direct evidence of how the aggressor behaved.\nBut, was the attack intended to undermine the function of a computer network? The analysis becomes more convoluted because it seems the attack was intended to purloin information and not specifically to undermine the function of a computer network. Thus, Hathaway’s definition may very well exclude things like Operation Shady RAT from the definition of what a cyber attack is. Is that the correct outcome? It would certainly seem so given the lack of information that would be needed to come to any other conclusions. Were the definition widened it would defeat the entire purpose of the narrow tailoring of each element to comply with the plethora of concerns voiced by numerous scholars in the field.\nWould that analysis change if it was discovered Operation Shady RAT was politically motivated? Perhaps so, however, since no party has come forward with what happened to the\n Alperovitch at 3.\n See Emery.\n Byrne v. Boadle, 2 Hurl. &amp; Colt. 722, 159 Eng. Rep. 299 (1863) (Establishing that tort elements of duty of care and breach can be sometimes inferred from the very nature of an accident or other outcome, even without direct evidence of how any defendant behaved).\n For the sake of clarity, this is by no means meant to suggest that cyber attacks could be committed negligently; the requirement of the objective is crucial.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\ninformation taken in Operation Shady RAT and what it was used for, any analysis here is purely speculative. Absent any further details, Operation Shady RAT simply is not what international law needs to spend time guarding against in the same way it does attacks similar to Stuxnet.\nFurther, the general purpose of public international law should not be forgotten, and that is that it serves as the framework for the practice of stable and organized international relations and stands in contrast to the remedial nature of dispute resolution commonly seen in civil domestic law. Thus, while Operation Shady RAT may fall short of the suggested definition of a cyber attack, that is not to say domestic law would be incapable of restoring the parties if more information about the incident were available.\n## IV. Conclusion\nIn sum, the international legal community not only should task itself with drafting the Law of the Horse, but should also welcome the challenge. While Lessig may be more correct in his analogy of the current technological landscape than Easterbrook is wrong, that does not mean that the ideas of both men cannot be reconciled. There is no reason not to take the existing international public law concerning the seas or outer space and use that as a platform on which international law could evolve and improve. There is no reason to re-invent the wheel when there is plenty of law in existence that could be tailored to fit the unique needs required by this nebulous \"thing\" called cyberspace.\nThe potential for damage from cyber attacks increases as quickly as society's reliance on computer-driven technology. It would do the globe a gross disservice to ignore the possible harm cyber attacks could cause, and to risk cyber security on an international level by failing to address a looming threat to the infrastructure of a vast number of states.

INTRODUCTION\nThe advent of the Information Age was sudden and abrupt, changing the world in ways Gutenberg could not have possibly imagined even in his wildest dreams. Cyberspace is the veritable Wild West of the modern age; a largely untamed infinite wilderness of possibilities and opportunities.\nThis paper will explore why the Internet and cyberspace are so different from traditional notions of real property, and what challenges that difference presents to players on the international stage, and will rectify whether cyberspace is a new landscape deserving of its own unique law, or whether existing law is equipped to deal with the challenges of cyberspace as written. Next is a thorough exploration of what a cyber attack might be, could be, should be, and should not be, along with a discussion of why cyber attacks are not only a matter of international importance but why, in some respects, only the international community might be equipped to foster dialogue about how to deal with cyber attacks. There is also a call to action for the United Nations, with the perhaps premature admonishment that the United Nations is in the habit of addressing new and different challenges to international law. The third and final part of this\n M.

Then the definition and the framework it provides is put to the test by applying it to two possible instances of cyber attacks: Stuxnet, and Operation Shady RAT.\n## II. CYBERSPACE: THE NEW FRONTIER?\nThe United States Department of Defense defines cyberspace broadly: A global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers. Webopedia condenses the definition into something a bit more palatable: Cyberspace is, at its simplest, a metaphor for describing the non-physical terrain created by computer systems.\nPrior to considering the impact of cyberspace on international law at large, it should be noted that there are differences in levels of nefarious cyber activities, including cyber crime, cyber espionage, cyber terrorism, cyber attacks, and (the very hotly debated) cyber warfare.\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n Scott Thill, *March 17, 1948: William Gibson, Father of Cyberspace* (17 March 2009) WIRED, available at http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2009/03/dayintech_0317 (Attributing the term “cyberspace” to William Gibson; a term Gibson would later describe in *No Maps for These Territories* as an “evocative and essentially meaningless” buzzword that could serve as a cipher for all of his cybernetic musings).\n CJCS CM-0363-08, available at www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/index.html.\n Webopedia, “Cyberspace,” (last accessed 19 Nov. 2012) available at http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/cyberspace.html.\n Espionage is the world’s second oldest profession. Thus, there is a wealth of material written regarding international law and espionage that would be applicable to espionage in all forms, all of which far exceeds the scope of this paper. See R. M. Sheldon, *Espionage in the Ancient World: An Annotated Bibliography of Books and Articles in Western Languages* (2008).\n Ryan Singel, *White House Cyber Czar: “There Is No Cyber War”* (4 Mar. 2010) WIRED, available at http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/03/schmidt-cyberwar.\nClassification of malicious cyber activity might derive from the intent of the perpetrator and the effects of the act. For example, cyber crime typically involves the distribution of malware, child pornography, and other crimes conducted for profit and primarily motivated by financial gain or notoriety. Cyber espionage is motivated by the desire to unearth sensitive information, and could be conducted by an individual or a group, with the goal being a pecuniary gain or a strategic advantage. Cyber terrorism is intended to influence or motivate either an audience or a government or both through threats and violence, not unlike any other act of terrorism. A cyber terrorist uses tools available in cyberspace as weapons against both cyber and physical targets.\nThe definition of a cyber attack is still largely inconsistent, and something this paper will attempt to define. But, for introductory purposes, scholars appear to agree that a cyber crime is not a cyber attack, and thus a cyber attack can at least be loosely defined by what it is not.\nHowever, even once defined, there are lingering questions: should a cyber attack be considered an act of war? How would a state defend itself against such an attack? How can a state defend itself against an attack with attribution is in some cases impossible. And, at what point does a cyber attack escalate into cyber warfare?\n## A. CONCERNING TERMINOLOGY\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n\nThe term “cyber warfare” is controversial in and of itself. Howard Schmidt, the cybersecurity czar for the Obama administration, argued in March 2010 that \"There is no cyber war. [...] I think that is a terrible metaphor and I think that is a terrible concept. There are no winners in that environment.\" However, Schmidt’s stance is in direct disagreement with that of Michael McConnell, the former director of national intelligence, who testified to Congress earlier in 2010 that the country was already in the midst of losing a cyber war. Meanwhile, still others argue that cyber warfare is just a new version of three activities states know all too well, and practiced for millennia: sabotage, espionage, and subversion.\nThe ramifications of considering cyber attacks an act of warfare are astronomical. As Schmidt stated, there are certainly reasons for considering it a terrible metaphor, and a terrible concept. But then, is an attack on a state’s cyberspace really that different from any other extraterritorial breach of sovereignty?\nThese issues lead to a threshold question: do computer networks pose something unique enough to require the international community to formulate new bodies of law to deal with the novel issues cyberspace and cyber attacks pose? Or, should cyber attacks be addressed in the same way as any other act of aggression and through existing international law, with no differentiation between a state’s cyberspace and real territory?\nB. THE LAW OF THE HORSE: THE WORLD IS FAR BEYOND CHARIOTS AND CHAINMAIL\n For the purposes of this paper, “cyber attack” will be used as the generic term for politically motivated computer crimes, with “cyber warfare” representing a subset of cyber attacks that could be considered actual acts of war.\n Singel.\n Id.\n Thomas Rid, *Cyber War Will Not Take Place*, 35 JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES 1, 5-32 (2012).\n A discussion of just how astronomical those ramifications would be far exceeds the scope of this paper, but the classification of such acts as “warfare” certainly invokes a militaristic response.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nThe Honorable Frank H. Easterbrook said, “[C]ourses should be limited to subjects that could illuminate the entire law.” The basic concept is that there is no Law of the Horse; that is to say, efforts to collect all laws involving horses and to aggregate them into one comprehensive Law of the Horse are, “doomed to be shallow and to miss unifying principles.” Thus, Easterbrook suggests the study of general rules when dealing with cyberspace and simply basic existing law to cyberspace as it is. According to Easterbrook’s theory, states should take their existing tort, contract, property law, etc., and use the broad rules encompassed in those areas of law to address cyberspace instead of fabricating new law to address cyberspace specifically, based on the presumption that creating a Law of the Horse for cyberspace will be shallow, disjointed and ultimately, futile.\nEasterbrook makes three core suggestions for making this work in cyberspace: (1) Rules should be clearly defined; (2) Property rights should be created where there are none; and (3) The law should facilitate the formation of bargaining institutions. Thus, Easterbrook argues for a laissez-faire view of the internet, that we have cyberspace as it is, we should let it evolve, and we should sit back and enjoy it. The basic assumption is that if states have well-defined rights\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n\nand we know what those mean, we can assume individuals will make predictable choices and behave in the most efficient way possible.\nHowever, there is no doubt that the world has evolved beyond chariots and chainmail when it comes to warfare, and the mere existence of cyber attacks show that the laissez-faire method may not be the most effective approach, because as evidenced by some ethically and morally challenged actors, the most beneficial choice was the one that completely undermined a state’s rights over their cyber territory. The age-old adage about permission and forgiveness is proven quite true with cyber warfare: It is always easier to beg forgiveness than to ask permission, and when it comes to cyberspace and sovereignty it seems states and other actors would much prefer to put the cart before the horse.\nAlternatively, Lawrence Lessig argues that cyberspace is not the sum of its parts and cannot be dealt with through existing tort, contract, and property law. Lessig discusses behavioral constraints in cyberspace in terms of four different modalities and enforcement mechanisms: (1) Law, which is enforced by states; (2) Social norms, which are enforced by society; (3) Markets, which are enforced by price; and (4) The architecture of cyberspace itself, which is enforced by code. Essentially, Lessig argues the modalities of regulations are the prisms through which regulation of cyberspace need to be considered, and that cyberspace must be addressed holistically because if not, there is absolutely no way to regulate it.\n Id.\n For a list of the “major” cyber attacks through September of 2011, see Julian Ryall, *A history of major cyber attacks* (20 Sept. 2011) TELEGRAPH, available at http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/8775632/A-history-of-major-cyber-attacks.html.\n Lawrence Lessig, *The Law of the Horse: What Cyberlaw Might Teach*, 113 HARV. L. REV. 501 (1999).\n Id. at 506.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nLessig’s arguments hinge on the fact that analogies to physical spaces fail when applied to cyberspace and technology. The architecture of physical space is generally unmalleable; that is to say, a state cannot just unilaterally say “Let’s move this ocean,” and then do so. Likewise, customary international law recognizes defined territory as a qualification for statehood, and with battles over land punctuating the history of mankind since 2700 B.C.E., it is evident that defining and changing territorial lines is anything but easy.\nCyberspace is different; the architecture of it is malleable, and thus, cyberspace requires its own set of rules since cyberspace essentially allows states in a sense to move mountains and to do so quickly; a notion that is difficult to analogize to the physical world. Thus, the policy behind cyberspace and cyber warfare should reflect the malleable architecture of cyberspace, meaning that cyberspace and attacks upon it should be addressed with their own separate area of law.\nLessig’s argument that cyberspace requires its own proverbial Law of the Horse is far more compelling than Easterbrook’s position that there is not and should be no Law of the Horse, because cyberspace demands flexibility and different standards to address the unique nature of the challenges faced in cyber warfare, instead of denying their existence and essentially forcing a square peg to fit in a round hole, which is what Easterbrook seems to propose. The international legal community must evolve and embrace the challenges presented by cyberspace, regardless of how baffling they might be, and recognize that though attempts to deal such an alien landscape will be imperfect at best, such attempts will be vital to breathe life into the\n Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, Art. 1, 165 LNTS 19; 49 Stat 3097 (1934).\n John Keegan, War and Our World, note 2, at 29 (2001) (Stating Gilgamesh, who ruled the Mesopotamian city of Uruk, undertook one of history’s first offensive military campaigns in 2700 B.C.).\n At least, mountains of data.\n Lessig at 501.\n See Easterbrook at 207 (“The best way to learn the law applicable to specialized endeavors is to study general rules”).\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\ninternational community’s ability to maintain relative order and peace in a rapidly changing world.\n## II. WHAT IS A CYBER ATTACK AND WHY SHOULD WE CARE?\nIn an interview with the BBC about the threat of cyber warfare, Dr. Hamadoun Toure, the head of the United Nations telecommunications agency said the “best way to win a war is to avoid it in the first place.”42 The United Nations has called on member states to talk to each other, and to pull back from the threat of cyber war.43 That sounds facially simple, but as it stands, states cannot agree even on what a cyber warfare incident is.44 Suffice it to say, states would find it difficult to agree to enter into an agreement avoiding a threat their brightest experts cannot even clearly define. However, it is clear that despite differing opinions on what cyber warfare really is, cyber security, and the breaches of cyber security are issues of the utmost importance and international law has yet to truly react to the threat cyber security poses for the international community.45\nIn February 2011, then-Central Intelligence Agency Director Leon Panetta warned, “The next Pearl Harbor could very well be a cyber attack.”46 William Lynn, America’s Deputy Secretary of Defense wrote, “Although cyberspace is a man-made domain, [it is] just as critical to military operations as land, sea, air and space.”47\n## A. DOES THIS MEAN WAR?\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nGenerally speaking, international law permits three situations as legal causes for war: (1) Self defense; (2) Defense of an ally under a mutual defense pact; and (3) via a UN sanction. An offensive act has to meet certain criteria to qualify as an act of war. The United States Army’s Cyber Operations and Cyber Terrorism Handbook defines a cyber attack as: “The premeditated use of disruptive activities, or the threat thereof, against computers and/or networks, with the intention to cause harm or to further social, ideological, religious, political, or similar objectives. Or to intimidate any person in furtherance of such objectives.” A cyber attack, unlike a cyber crime, involves “an aggressive act on the part of one adversary—whether an individual, a competing organization or a rival government—against another in an ongoing struggle for hegemony in the marketplace or the political arena.”\nCarl von Clausewitz, a Prussian military theorist, penned a succinct, elemental breakdown of what is needed to constitute an act of war. First, there must be an act of force to compel the enemy to do something. Second, that act must be instrumental; i.e., there must be both a means and an end with force being the means and the acceptance of the aggressor’s will as the end. Third, the act must be political. As Clausewitz famously said, “War is a mere continuation of politics by other means.” While Clausewitz’s framework is simple and concise, there is of course plentiful room to debate the interpretation of each element, and thus whether or\n United Nations, Charter of the United Nations, 1 U.N.T.S.

WHY ARE CYBER ATTACKS AN ISSUE OF INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE?\nThere is little debate that modern states increasingly rely on both global and domestic information structures.58 Information gathering and the disruption of communication channels have always been tools of war, and arguably, the destruction of an enemy’s communication networks could reap greater benefits for an aggressor than the destruction of weapons arsenals or supply chains.59 The more heavily a nation state relies on the Internet, especially for military and governmental infrastructures, the more tempting it becomes for states in conflict to exploit those vulnerabilities through cyber attacks.60\nPerhaps the most compelling and confusing reason cyber attacks are of international concern is in the nature of how information is sent over the Internet; that is to say that when a computer sends information over the Internet that information is divided into “packets,” and those packets adopt their routes to network congestion, opting for the path of least resistance.61 Since the Internet was specifically designed to send information through the fastest route\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n\npossible, the route information takes to get from Computer A to Computer B may be far different from the route between Computers A and B as the crow flies.\nThis fact, while fabulously convenient for the casual Internet user wanting to check e-mail or moving listings, creates an incredible challenge to one of the most fundamental aspects of international law: territory. Attribution of cyber attacks is also difficult in light of the nature of the Internet. “[G]iven that the internet is intended to be open and anonymous, the attribution of cyber attacks can be very difficult to achieve and should not be taken lightly,” said David Wu, Subcommittee Chairman of the Committee on Science and Technology’s Subcommittee on Technology and Innovation during a 2010 hearing about cyber attack attribution technology. A cyber attacker in the domain of cyberspace can “shed ties of citizenship and cross sovereign boundaries without a trace,” cloaked in veritable anonymity. Though there is the physical presence of hardware in different sovereign states, the information contained in them and the software controlling their servers lacks roots to the physical realm.\n## 1. A Desperate Plea for U.N. Action\nInternational law must concern itself with what goes on in cyberspace. Regardless of whether cyberspace is considered an international commons of sorts or space subject to more traditional notions of sovereignty, the fact of the matter is that international law must attempt\n Ophardt at 24.\n “As the crow flies” is an idiom for the shortest distance between two points.\n Ophardt at 24.\n Molly Mulrain, *Cyber Attack Attribution Important to Cybersecurity*, *Says Committee* (16 July 2012)\nExecutiveGov.com, *available at* http://www.executivegov.com/2010/07/cyber-attack-attribution-important-to-cybersecurity-says-committee.\n Scott J.

Consider the following: (1) Outer space and the inception of “space law”69 following the launch of Sputnik in 1958;70 (2) The evolution of international maritime law, regulating regions once seen as mysterious, difficult to navigate, and possibly infinite;71 and, (3) The regulation of Antarctica.72 Further, the United Nations is no stranger to new paradigms when it becomes apparent that the area of law at issue is a matter of international concern.73 Cyberspace is certainly an issue of global concern due to its very nature, and is thusly compatible with Article 2 of the United Nations Charter.74\n## C. CICERO ON CYBERSPACE: EXISTING LAW IS SILENT\nTo be quite blunt, international law falls short in terms of securing cyberspace and addressing cyber attacks. To date, there are no treaties in existence dealing directly with cyber\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nattacks or cyber warfare.75 The United Nations called on nations to “talk to each other,” and “pull back from the threat of cyber war,”76 but such a plea is woefully inadequate at best.\nHowever, as discussed previously, there is plentiful existing international law in various forms dealing with and governing inter alia, the vastness of outer space and the depths of the oceans that could be adapted to address the complexities presented by cyberspace and attacks on and in it.77 Additionally, the commentaries to the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols suggest that “armed conflict” may be considered an expansive term, would could subject cyber attacks to the expansive body of existing international humanitarian law.78\nThe Tallinn Manual, written by group of experts working with the Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (“CCDCOE”), an institute based in Tallinn, Estonia, specifically contemplates how international law should apply to conflict in cyberspace, keeping in mind the problem that laws of conventional warfare are difficult to apply to such an amorphous space.79\n\"One of the challenges states face in the cyber environment is that the scope and manner of international law's applicability to cyber operations where in offense or defense has remained unsettled since their advent,\" wrote Michael N. Schmitt, project director and chairman of the International Law Department at the U.S. Naval War College, in the manual's introduction. \"The threshold questions are whether the existing law applies to cyber issues at all, and, if so, how.\"80\nHowever, the Tallinn Manual is not an official document and is instead the summation of opinions of a group of experts acting solely in their personal capacity, and the CCDCOE cautions\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n\nreaders that it is not meant to reflect NATO doctrine, and nor does it reflect the position of any organization or State represented by observers. While on the one hand, current international law essentially consists of abstinence-only education from the United Nations, on the other hand, there is hardly a shortage of law that could be retrofitted to address those short-comings.\n## III. A PROPOSED DEFINITION AND ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n### A. DEFINING A CYBER ATTACK: A NARROWLY TAILORED APPROACH\nBefore international law can even remotely begin to address the threat cyber attacks and to prosecute their perpetrators, what a cyber attack is must first be succinctly defined. In an article co-authored with multiple other minds, Oona Hathaway suggested the adoption of a narrow definition of what a cyber attack is, in order to focus attention on the niche cyber warfare fills in the international community: “A cyber-attack consists of any action taken to undermine the functions of a computer network for a political or national security purpose.” This definition breaks down into easily manageable elements that properly address the specific threat posed by cyber aggression, it echoes Clausewitz’s elemental breakdown of an act of war, and it addresses the intent of the perpetrator called for in The Economist and by Solce. This definition appears to satisfy the vast majority of concerns voiced by scholars on the issue. Implicit in the term “cyber attack” is the idea that the conduct must be active to constitute an attack, whether it is active offensively or defensively. Thus, passive conduct like scanning for viruses is filtered out of the definition at the threshold.\n### 1. Any action taken;\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n CCDCOE Introduction to The Tallinn Manual, available at https://www.ccdcoe.org/249.html.\n Oona A. Hathaway, et al., *The Law of Cyber-Attack* 100 CAL. L. REV. 817, 826 (2012).\n *Id.*\n *Id.* at fn. 29\nAny action can be used as the means with which to carry out a cyber attack. Thus, cyber warfare could be waged through hacking or any number of other technological strategies as long as the goal of the attack is to undermine or disrupt a computer network. The idea of classifying warfare based on the objective of the attack (for example, the objective of a cyber attack is to undermine the functions of a computer network) as opposed to the means (for example, nuclear warfare, chemical warfare, guerilla warfare) is intuitive, logical, and avoids accidental and unnecessary limitations on internet speech, which could be an issue under a means-based classification.\n2. To undermine the function;\nThe objective of a cyber attack must be to undermine the function of a computer network; otherwise, the definition encompasses more than it should. The concept revolves around some kind of compromise or disruption of a computer system instead of simply the use of a computer system in a security breach or an information leak. Note that passive observance of activity or copying of information, no matter how illicit, is not enough to constitute a cyber attack or an act of cyber warfare, thus eliminating some of the aforementioned cyber crimes from the definition, and leaving them to each individual state to deal with domestically.\n3. Of a computer network;\n Id. at 826.\n Hacking is a general term for finding weaknesses in a computer or network and exploiting them.\n Hathaway at 826.\n Louis Charbonneau, Iran rejects UN criticism of its cyber security rules (25 Oct. 2012) Reuters, available at http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/25/net-us-iran-security-un-idUSBRE89O19420121025 (“In his latest report, U.N. special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Iran, Ahmed Shaheed, said he was concerned about reports of government activities ‘that seemingly infringe on freedom of expression and the right to information.’”)\n Hathaway at 827.\n Id. at 828.\n See Hathaway at 829 for a further discussion.\n Id.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nAt the most basic level, a computer network is a collection of computers connected to each other to facilitate the sharing of information and resources.93 While a common connection exists over the Internet, there is also an array of closed networks, like those used by various government agencies.94 Further, the prevalence of computers is crucial to striking at the core of the issue with cyber attacks and cyber warfare: Computers control elevators, stoplights, regulate water pressure, the power grid, etc.95 Thus it bears repeating: The potential for damage from cyber warfare increases as quickly as society's reliance on computer-driven technology.96\n## 4. For a political or national security purpose.\nActions driven by national security or political purposes properly distinguish cyber attacks from ordinary crime.97 A cyber malfeasance that is not carried out for political or national security purposes, such as Internet fraud, identity theft, piracy, etc., while perhaps interesting for examination for questions of, inter alia, international jurisdiction, is, as previously mentioned, a cyber crime best left to the domain of each individual state to regulate.98 Thus, the definition of cyber warfare is limited by focusing on the purpose of the action as opposed to the intent of the actor to best address the vast ramifications of cyber attacks without limiting possible actors to state actors, only.99\n## B. THE NEXT STEP: APPLYING THE DEFINITION TO INSTANCES OF CYBER ATTACKS\n### 1. Stuxnet\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nStuxnet is a type of malware called a “worm,” which is a computer program that replicates itself to spread to other computers, usually using a network to spread itself. The worm does not need to attach itself to an existing program on any of the computers, like other kinds of malware like a computer virus does. Typically a person installs a worm by inadvertently opening an email attachment or message that contains executable scripts.\nAccording to Symantec, Stuxnet infected Windows in its search for industrial control systems, which, in short, can be used to control the automation of industrial processes. Thus, Stuxnet could potentially control or alter how such a system operates. More specifically, Stuxnet included a special payload designed to target Siemens systems that were configured to control and monitor specific industrial processes, and different variants of the worm targeted organizations mainly in Iran between June 2009 and April 2010.\nInitial analysis revealed Stuxnet was likely written by a state to target Iran’s growing nuclear program, including uranium enrichment centrifuges at the Natanz facility in Iran. Iranian officials admitted the worm infected staff computers but denied any major delays to the nuclear power program.\n Bradley Mitchell, *Worm – Computer Worm* (last accessed on 19 Nov. 2012) About.com, *available at* http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/worldwideweb/g/bldef_worm.htm.

The article dubbed the attacks “America’s first sustained use of cyberweapons,” and stated President Obama accelerated the attacks, which began during the Bush administration after an element of the program accidentally became public in the summer of 2010; an action that ultimately allowed Stuxnet to arrive at Iran’s Natanz plant. The article goes further to state that top officials had to consider whether America’s “most ambitious attempt to slow the progress of Iran’s nuclear efforts had been fatally compromised.”\nThe elements set forth by Hathaway were: (1) Any action taken; (2) To undermine the function; (3) Of a computer network; (4) For a political or national security purpose. If the allegations set forth in the New York Times were true, and Stuxnet made its way to Iran at the hands of the United States, then does Stuxnet fit within the definition of a cyber attack? Absolutely. An offensive action was taken. It was certainly intended to undermine the function of a computer network; as it was intended to undermine the capabilities of the computer networks used to run Iran’s nuclear facilities. Presuming the United States was behind the attack, the objective was at the least political,, if it was not also perhaps an attempt to fortify national security. Given the historically cloudy relations between the United States and Iran, if Iran was developing nuclear weapons as opposed to harnessing nuclear power, then it is certainly logical to consider nuclear weapons in the hands of Iranians a threat to national security in the United\n David E. Sanger, Obama Order Sped Up Wave of Cyber Attacks Against Iran, THE NEW YORK TIMES, June 1, 2012, available at http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/world/middleeast/obama-ordered-wave-of-cyberattacks-against-iran.html\n Id.\n Id.\n Recall the prevalence of Iran in the 2012 Presidential Debates.

Thus, under the proposed definition, Stuxnet is a clear example of what should be encompassed by were international law to adopt this definition of a cyber attack.\n## 2. Operation Shady RAT\nOperation Shady RAT perhaps better illustrates the challenges international law must face when dealing with cyber attacks. News reports and journal articles fall short of articulating what exactly happened in Operation Shady RAT, but a report issued by McAfee, the IT security firm giant who unearthed the attacks, revealed the following: (1) It is widely believed that there was one “state actor” behind the attacks, but McAfee declined to name it; (2) The attacks, named partially for a common acronym in the IT industry that stands for “remote access tool,” compromised no less than 71 identified parties, with more parties present in the activity logs where sufficient information was unavailable to accurately identify them; (3) The attacks lasted over five years; and, (4) Nobody knows what happened to the stolen data. Dmitri Alperovitch, Vice President of Threat Research at McAfee, discussed the breadth of the attacks in a report issued through McAfee:\nAfter painstaking analysis of the logs, even we were surprised by the enormous diversity of the victim organizations and were taken aback by the audacity of the perpetrators. Although we will refrain from explicitly identifying most of the victims, describing only their general industry, we feel that naming names is warranted in certain cases, not with the goal of attracting attention to a specific victim organization, but to reinforce the fact that virtually everyone is falling prey to these intrusions, regardless of whether they are\n Jim Finkle, “State Actor” behind slew of cyber attacks (3 Aug. 2011) REUTERS, available at http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/03/us-cyberattacks-idUSTRE7720HU20110803.\n See Finkle (Several other security experts said the evidence points to China).\n Roger Grimes, Danger: Remote Access Trojans (Sept. 2002) Security Administrator, available at http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd632947.aspx(“A remote access tool (RAT) is a piece of software that allows a remote \"operator\" to control a system as if he has physical access to that system.”)\n Dmitri Alperovitch, Revealed: Operation Shady RAT McAfee, 3-4 (2011) available at http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-operation-shady-rat.pdf.\n Daniel Emery, Governments, IOC and UN hit by massive cyber-attack (3 Aug. 2011) BBC NEWS, available at http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14387559.\n See Finkle.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nthe United Nations, a multinational Fortune 100 company, a small, non-profit think tank, a national Olympic team, or even an unfortunate computer security firm.\nThe identity of the state actor behind the attacks was widely assumed to be China, however, Beijing proclaimed the accusations were “groundless.” Frankly, whether China was behind the attack or not matters little when determining where Operation Shady RAT falls in regards to Hathaway’s cyber attack definition.\nThere is little doubt there was an action of some sort; even though research fails to really identify what the action was. It seems almost like the international cyber law version of *res ipsa loquitor*, a doctrine sounding in tort theory where the nature of an outcome speaks for itself and negligence may be inferred even absent of direct evidence of how the aggressor behaved.\nBut, was the attack intended to undermine the function of a computer network? The analysis becomes more convoluted because it seems the attack was intended to purloin information and not specifically to undermine the function of a computer network. Thus, Hathaway’s definition may very well exclude things like Operation Shady RAT from the definition of what a cyber attack is. Is that the correct outcome? It would certainly seem so given the lack of information that would be needed to come to any other conclusions. Were the definition widened it would defeat the entire purpose of the narrow tailoring of each element to comply with the plethora of concerns voiced by numerous scholars in the field.\nWould that analysis change if it was discovered Operation Shady RAT was politically motivated? Perhaps so, however, since no party has come forward with what happened to the\n Alperovitch at 3.\n See Emery.\n Byrne v. Boadle, 2 Hurl. &amp; Colt. 722, 159 Eng. Rep. 299 (1863) (Establishing that tort elements of duty of care and breach can be sometimes inferred from the very nature of an accident or other outcome, even without direct evidence of how any defendant behaved).\n For the sake of clarity, this is by no means meant to suggest that cyber attacks could be committed negligently; the requirement of the objective is crucial.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\ninformation taken in Operation Shady RAT and what it was used for, any analysis here is purely speculative. Absent any further details, Operation Shady RAT simply is not what international law needs to spend time guarding against in the same way it does attacks similar to Stuxnet.\nFurther, the general purpose of public international law should not be forgotten, and that is that it serves as the framework for the practice of stable and organized international relations and stands in contrast to the remedial nature of dispute resolution commonly seen in civil domestic law. Thus, while Operation Shady RAT may fall short of the suggested definition of a cyber attack, that is not to say domestic law would be incapable of restoring the parties if more information about the incident were available.\n## IV. Conclusion\nIn sum, the international legal community not only should task itself with drafting the Law of the Horse, but should also welcome the challenge. While Lessig may be more correct in his analogy of the current technological landscape than Easterbrook is wrong, that does not mean that the ideas of both men cannot be reconciled. There is no reason not to take the existing international public law concerning the seas or outer space and use that as a platform on which international law could evolve and improve. There is no reason to re-invent the wheel when there is plenty of law in existence that could be tailored to fit the unique needs required by this nebulous \"thing\" called cyberspace.\nThe potential for damage from cyber attacks increases as quickly as society's reliance on computer-driven technology. It would do the globe a gross disservice to ignore the possible harm cyber attacks could cause, and to risk cyber security on an international level by failing to address a looming threat to the infrastructure of a vast number of states.

INTRODUCTION\nThe advent of the Information Age was sudden and abrupt, changing the world in ways Gutenberg could not have possibly imagined even in his wildest dreams. Cyberspace is the veritable Wild West of the modern age; a largely untamed infinite wilderness of possibilities and opportunities.\nThis paper will explore why the Internet and cyberspace are so different from traditional notions of real property, and what challenges that difference presents to players on the international stage, and will rectify whether cyberspace is a new landscape deserving of its own unique law, or whether existing law is equipped to deal with the challenges of cyberspace as written. Next is a thorough exploration of what a cyber attack might be, could be, should be, and should not be, along with a discussion of why cyber attacks are not only a matter of international importance but why, in some respects, only the international community might be equipped to foster dialogue about how to deal with cyber attacks. There is also a call to action for the United Nations, with the perhaps premature admonishment that the United Nations is in the habit of addressing new and different challenges to international law. The third and final part of this\n M. Tullius Cicero, *For Milo*, 11 (52 B.C.E.), translated version available at http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0020%3Atext%3DMil.%3Asection%3D11.\n Hal Abelson et al., *Blown to Bits: Your life, liberty, and happiness after the digital explosion*, 2-3 (2008).\n Id. 303 (“Fundamentally, the internet consists of computers sending bit packets that request services, and other computers sending packets back in response. For example, you don’t really “visit” the web page of a store, like a voyeuristic tourist peeking through the store window. Your computer makes a very specific request of the store’s web server, and the store’s web server responds to it”).\nsection will explore the current state of international law regarding cyber attacks, analyzing what the existing law is, how it might be retrofitted to deal with cyber attacks, and other possible ways the international theater might attempt to regulate nefarious conduct within cyberspace.\nThe next section proposes a workable definition of a cyber attack for the international community that is also mindful of the numerous concerns voiced by various scholars in the area. Then the definition and the framework it provides is put to the test by applying it to two possible instances of cyber attacks: Stuxnet, and Operation Shady RAT.\n## II. CYBERSPACE: THE NEW FRONTIER?\nThe United States Department of Defense defines cyberspace broadly: A global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers. Webopedia condenses the definition into something a bit more palatable: Cyberspace is, at its simplest, a metaphor for describing the non-physical terrain created by computer systems.\nPrior to considering the impact of cyberspace on international law at large, it should be noted that there are differences in levels of nefarious cyber activities, including cyber crime, cyber espionage, cyber terrorism, cyber attacks, and (the very hotly debated) cyber warfare.\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n Scott Thill, *March 17, 1948: William Gibson, Father of Cyberspace* (17 March 2009) WIRED, available at http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2009/03/dayintech_0317 (Attributing the term “cyberspace” to William Gibson; a term Gibson would later describe in *No Maps for These Territories* as an “evocative and essentially meaningless” buzzword that could serve as a cipher for all of his cybernetic musings).\n CJCS CM-0363-08, available at www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/index.html.\n Webopedia, “Cyberspace,” (last accessed 19 Nov. 2012) available at http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/cyberspace.html.\n Espionage is the world’s second oldest profession. Thus, there is a wealth of material written regarding international law and espionage that would be applicable to espionage in all forms, all of which far exceeds the scope of this paper. See R. M. Sheldon, *Espionage in the Ancient World: An Annotated Bibliography of Books and Articles in Western Languages* (2008).\n Ryan Singel, *White House Cyber Czar: “There Is No Cyber War”* (4 Mar. 2010) WIRED, available at http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/03/schmidt-cyberwar.\nClassification of malicious cyber activity might derive from the intent of the perpetrator and the effects of the act. For example, cyber crime typically involves the distribution of malware, child pornography, and other crimes conducted for profit and primarily motivated by financial gain or notoriety. Cyber espionage is motivated by the desire to unearth sensitive information, and could be conducted by an individual or a group, with the goal being a pecuniary gain or a strategic advantage. Cyber terrorism is intended to influence or motivate either an audience or a government or both through threats and violence, not unlike any other act of terrorism. A cyber terrorist uses tools available in cyberspace as weapons against both cyber and physical targets.\nThe definition of a cyber attack is still largely inconsistent, and something this paper will attempt to define. But, for introductory purposes, scholars appear to agree that a cyber crime is not a cyber attack, and thus a cyber attack can at least be loosely defined by what it is not.\nHowever, even once defined, there are lingering questions: should a cyber attack be considered an act of war? How would a state defend itself against such an attack? How can a state defend itself against an attack with attribution is in some cases impossible. And, at what point does a cyber attack escalate into cyber warfare?\n## A. CONCERNING TERMINOLOGY\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n\nThe term “cyber warfare” is controversial in and of itself. Howard Schmidt, the cybersecurity czar for the Obama administration, argued in March 2010 that \"There is no cyber war. [...] I think that is a terrible metaphor and I think that is a terrible concept. There are no winners in that environment.\" However, Schmidt’s stance is in direct disagreement with that of Michael McConnell, the former director of national intelligence, who testified to Congress earlier in 2010 that the country was already in the midst of losing a cyber war. Meanwhile, still others argue that cyber warfare is just a new version of three activities states know all too well, and practiced for millennia: sabotage, espionage, and subversion.\nThe ramifications of considering cyber attacks an act of warfare are astronomical. As Schmidt stated, there are certainly reasons for considering it a terrible metaphor, and a terrible concept. But then, is an attack on a state’s cyberspace really that different from any other extraterritorial breach of sovereignty?\nThese issues lead to a threshold question: do computer networks pose something unique enough to require the international community to formulate new bodies of law to deal with the novel issues cyberspace and cyber attacks pose? Or, should cyber attacks be addressed in the same way as any other act of aggression and through existing international law, with no differentiation between a state’s cyberspace and real territory?\nB. THE LAW OF THE HORSE: THE WORLD IS FAR BEYOND CHARIOTS AND CHAINMAIL\n For the purposes of this paper, “cyber attack” will be used as the generic term for politically motivated computer crimes, with “cyber warfare” representing a subset of cyber attacks that could be considered actual acts of war.\n Singel.\n Id.\n Thomas Rid, *Cyber War Will Not Take Place*, 35 JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES 1, 5-32 (2012).\n A discussion of just how astronomical those ramifications would be far exceeds the scope of this paper, but the classification of such acts as “warfare” certainly invokes a militaristic response.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nThe Honorable Frank H. Easterbrook said, “[C]ourses should be limited to subjects that could illuminate the entire law.” The basic concept is that there is no Law of the Horse; that is to say, efforts to collect all laws involving horses and to aggregate them into one comprehensive Law of the Horse are, “doomed to be shallow and to miss unifying principles.” Thus, Easterbrook suggests the study of general rules when dealing with cyberspace and simply basic existing law to cyberspace as it is. According to Easterbrook’s theory, states should take their existing tort, contract, property law, etc., and use the broad rules encompassed in those areas of law to address cyberspace instead of fabricating new law to address cyberspace specifically, based on the presumption that creating a Law of the Horse for cyberspace will be shallow, disjointed and ultimately, futile.\nEasterbrook makes three core suggestions for making this work in cyberspace: (1) Rules should be clearly defined; (2) Property rights should be created where there are none; and (3) The law should facilitate the formation of bargaining institutions. Thus, Easterbrook argues for a laissez-faire view of the internet, that we have cyberspace as it is, we should let it evolve, and we should sit back and enjoy it. The basic assumption is that if states have well-defined rights\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n\nand we know what those mean, we can assume individuals will make predictable choices and behave in the most efficient way possible.\nHowever, there is no doubt that the world has evolved beyond chariots and chainmail when it comes to warfare, and the mere existence of cyber attacks show that the laissez-faire method may not be the most effective approach, because as evidenced by some ethically and morally challenged actors, the most beneficial choice was the one that completely undermined a state’s rights over their cyber territory. The age-old adage about permission and forgiveness is proven quite true with cyber warfare: It is always easier to beg forgiveness than to ask permission, and when it comes to cyberspace and sovereignty it seems states and other actors would much prefer to put the cart before the horse.\nAlternatively, Lawrence Lessig argues that cyberspace is not the sum of its parts and cannot be dealt with through existing tort, contract, and property law. Lessig discusses behavioral constraints in cyberspace in terms of four different modalities and enforcement mechanisms: (1) Law, which is enforced by states; (2) Social norms, which are enforced by society; (3) Markets, which are enforced by price; and (4) The architecture of cyberspace itself, which is enforced by code. Essentially, Lessig argues the modalities of regulations are the prisms through which regulation of cyberspace need to be considered, and that cyberspace must be addressed holistically because if not, there is absolutely no way to regulate it.\n Id.\n For a list of the “major” cyber attacks through September of 2011, see Julian Ryall, *A history of major cyber attacks* (20 Sept. 2011) TELEGRAPH, available at http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/8775632/A-history-of-major-cyber-attacks.html.\n Lawrence Lessig, *The Law of the Horse: What Cyberlaw Might Teach*, 113 HARV. L. REV. 501 (1999).\n Id. at 506.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nLessig’s arguments hinge on the fact that analogies to physical spaces fail when applied to cyberspace and technology. The architecture of physical space is generally unmalleable; that is to say, a state cannot just unilaterally say “Let’s move this ocean,” and then do so. Likewise, customary international law recognizes defined territory as a qualification for statehood, and with battles over land punctuating the history of mankind since 2700 B.C.E., it is evident that defining and changing territorial lines is anything but easy.\nCyberspace is different; the architecture of it is malleable, and thus, cyberspace requires its own set of rules since cyberspace essentially allows states in a sense to move mountains and to do so quickly; a notion that is difficult to analogize to the physical world. Thus, the policy behind cyberspace and cyber warfare should reflect the malleable architecture of cyberspace, meaning that cyberspace and attacks upon it should be addressed with their own separate area of law.\nLessig’s argument that cyberspace requires its own proverbial Law of the Horse is far more compelling than Easterbrook’s position that there is not and should be no Law of the Horse, because cyberspace demands flexibility and different standards to address the unique nature of the challenges faced in cyber warfare, instead of denying their existence and essentially forcing a square peg to fit in a round hole, which is what Easterbrook seems to propose. The international legal community must evolve and embrace the challenges presented by cyberspace, regardless of how baffling they might be, and recognize that though attempts to deal such an alien landscape will be imperfect at best, such attempts will be vital to breathe life into the\n Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, Art. 1, 165 LNTS 19; 49 Stat 3097 (1934).\n John Keegan, War and Our World, note 2, at 29 (2001) (Stating Gilgamesh, who ruled the Mesopotamian city of Uruk, undertook one of history’s first offensive military campaigns in 2700 B.C.).\n At least, mountains of data.\n Lessig at 501.\n See Easterbrook at 207 (“The best way to learn the law applicable to specialized endeavors is to study general rules”).\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\ninternational community’s ability to maintain relative order and peace in a rapidly changing world.\n## II. WHAT IS A CYBER ATTACK AND WHY SHOULD WE CARE?\nIn an interview with the BBC about the threat of cyber warfare, Dr. Hamadoun Toure, the head of the United Nations telecommunications agency said the “best way to win a war is to avoid it in the first place.”42 The United Nations has called on member states to talk to each other, and to pull back from the threat of cyber war.43 That sounds facially simple, but as it stands, states cannot agree even on what a cyber warfare incident is.44 Suffice it to say, states would find it difficult to agree to enter into an agreement avoiding a threat their brightest experts cannot even clearly define. However, it is clear that despite differing opinions on what cyber warfare really is, cyber security, and the breaches of cyber security are issues of the utmost importance and international law has yet to truly react to the threat cyber security poses for the international community.45\nIn February 2011, then-Central Intelligence Agency Director Leon Panetta warned, “The next Pearl Harbor could very well be a cyber attack.”46 William Lynn, America’s Deputy Secretary of Defense wrote, “Although cyberspace is a man-made domain, [it is] just as critical to military operations as land, sea, air and space.”47\n## A. DOES THIS MEAN WAR?\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nGenerally speaking, international law permits three situations as legal causes for war: (1) Self defense; (2) Defense of an ally under a mutual defense pact; and (3) via a UN sanction. An offensive act has to meet certain criteria to qualify as an act of war. The United States Army’s Cyber Operations and Cyber Terrorism Handbook defines a cyber attack as: “The premeditated use of disruptive activities, or the threat thereof, against computers and/or networks, with the intention to cause harm or to further social, ideological, religious, political, or similar objectives. Or to intimidate any person in furtherance of such objectives.” A cyber attack, unlike a cyber crime, involves “an aggressive act on the part of one adversary—whether an individual, a competing organization or a rival government—against another in an ongoing struggle for hegemony in the marketplace or the political arena.”\nCarl von Clausewitz, a Prussian military theorist, penned a succinct, elemental breakdown of what is needed to constitute an act of war. First, there must be an act of force to compel the enemy to do something. Second, that act must be instrumental; i.e., there must be both a means and an end with force being the means and the acceptance of the aggressor’s will as the end. Third, the act must be political. As Clausewitz famously said, “War is a mere continuation of politics by other means.” While Clausewitz’s framework is simple and concise, there is of course plentiful room to debate the interpretation of each element, and thus whether or\n United Nations, Charter of the United Nations, 1 U.N.T.S.

WHY ARE CYBER ATTACKS AN ISSUE OF INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE?\nThere is little debate that modern states increasingly rely on both global and domestic information structures.58 Information gathering and the disruption of communication channels have always been tools of war, and arguably, the destruction of an enemy’s communication networks could reap greater benefits for an aggressor than the destruction of weapons arsenals or supply chains.59 The more heavily a nation state relies on the Internet, especially for military and governmental infrastructures, the more tempting it becomes for states in conflict to exploit those vulnerabilities through cyber attacks.60\nPerhaps the most compelling and confusing reason cyber attacks are of international concern is in the nature of how information is sent over the Internet; that is to say that when a computer sends information over the Internet that information is divided into “packets,” and those packets adopt their routes to network congestion, opting for the path of least resistance.61 Since the Internet was specifically designed to send information through the fastest route\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n\npossible, the route information takes to get from Computer A to Computer B may be far different from the route between Computers A and B as the crow flies.\nThis fact, while fabulously convenient for the casual Internet user wanting to check e-mail or moving listings, creates an incredible challenge to one of the most fundamental aspects of international law: territory. Attribution of cyber attacks is also difficult in light of the nature of the Internet. “[G]iven that the internet is intended to be open and anonymous, the attribution of cyber attacks can be very difficult to achieve and should not be taken lightly,” said David Wu, Subcommittee Chairman of the Committee on Science and Technology’s Subcommittee on Technology and Innovation during a 2010 hearing about cyber attack attribution technology. A cyber attacker in the domain of cyberspace can “shed ties of citizenship and cross sovereign boundaries without a trace,” cloaked in veritable anonymity. Though there is the physical presence of hardware in different sovereign states, the information contained in them and the software controlling their servers lacks roots to the physical realm.\n## 1. A Desperate Plea for U.N. Action\nInternational law must concern itself with what goes on in cyberspace. Regardless of whether cyberspace is considered an international commons of sorts or space subject to more traditional notions of sovereignty, the fact of the matter is that international law must attempt\n Ophardt at 24.\n “As the crow flies” is an idiom for the shortest distance between two points.\n Ophardt at 24.\n Molly Mulrain, *Cyber Attack Attribution Important to Cybersecurity*, *Says Committee* (16 July 2012)\nExecutiveGov.com, *available at* http://www.executivegov.com/2010/07/cyber-attack-attribution-important-to-cybersecurity-says-committee.\n Scott J.

Consider the following: (1) Outer space and the inception of “space law”69 following the launch of Sputnik in 1958;70 (2) The evolution of international maritime law, regulating regions once seen as mysterious, difficult to navigate, and possibly infinite;71 and, (3) The regulation of Antarctica.72 Further, the United Nations is no stranger to new paradigms when it becomes apparent that the area of law at issue is a matter of international concern.73 Cyberspace is certainly an issue of global concern due to its very nature, and is thusly compatible with Article 2 of the United Nations Charter.74\n## C. CICERO ON CYBERSPACE: EXISTING LAW IS SILENT\nTo be quite blunt, international law falls short in terms of securing cyberspace and addressing cyber attacks. To date, there are no treaties in existence dealing directly with cyber\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nattacks or cyber warfare.75 The United Nations called on nations to “talk to each other,” and “pull back from the threat of cyber war,”76 but such a plea is woefully inadequate at best.\nHowever, as discussed previously, there is plentiful existing international law in various forms dealing with and governing inter alia, the vastness of outer space and the depths of the oceans that could be adapted to address the complexities presented by cyberspace and attacks on and in it.77 Additionally, the commentaries to the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols suggest that “armed conflict” may be considered an expansive term, would could subject cyber attacks to the expansive body of existing international humanitarian law.78\nThe Tallinn Manual, written by group of experts working with the Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (“CCDCOE”), an institute based in Tallinn, Estonia, specifically contemplates how international law should apply to conflict in cyberspace, keeping in mind the problem that laws of conventional warfare are difficult to apply to such an amorphous space.79\n\"One of the challenges states face in the cyber environment is that the scope and manner of international law's applicability to cyber operations where in offense or defense has remained unsettled since their advent,\" wrote Michael N. Schmitt, project director and chairman of the International Law Department at the U.S. Naval War College, in the manual's introduction. \"The threshold questions are whether the existing law applies to cyber issues at all, and, if so, how.\"80\nHowever, the Tallinn Manual is not an official document and is instead the summation of opinions of a group of experts acting solely in their personal capacity, and the CCDCOE cautions\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n\nreaders that it is not meant to reflect NATO doctrine, and nor does it reflect the position of any organization or State represented by observers. While on the one hand, current international law essentially consists of abstinence-only education from the United Nations, on the other hand, there is hardly a shortage of law that could be retrofitted to address those short-comings.\n## III. A PROPOSED DEFINITION AND ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n### A. DEFINING A CYBER ATTACK: A NARROWLY TAILORED APPROACH\nBefore international law can even remotely begin to address the threat cyber attacks and to prosecute their perpetrators, what a cyber attack is must first be succinctly defined. In an article co-authored with multiple other minds, Oona Hathaway suggested the adoption of a narrow definition of what a cyber attack is, in order to focus attention on the niche cyber warfare fills in the international community: “A cyber-attack consists of any action taken to undermine the functions of a computer network for a political or national security purpose.” This definition breaks down into easily manageable elements that properly address the specific threat posed by cyber aggression, it echoes Clausewitz’s elemental breakdown of an act of war, and it addresses the intent of the perpetrator called for in The Economist and by Solce. This definition appears to satisfy the vast majority of concerns voiced by scholars on the issue. Implicit in the term “cyber attack” is the idea that the conduct must be active to constitute an attack, whether it is active offensively or defensively. Thus, passive conduct like scanning for viruses is filtered out of the definition at the threshold.\n### 1. Any action taken;\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n CCDCOE Introduction to The Tallinn Manual, available at https://www.ccdcoe.org/249.html.\n Oona A. Hathaway, et al., *The Law of Cyber-Attack* 100 CAL. L. REV. 817, 826 (2012).\n *Id.*\n *Id.* at fn. 29\nAny action can be used as the means with which to carry out a cyber attack. Thus, cyber warfare could be waged through hacking or any number of other technological strategies as long as the goal of the attack is to undermine or disrupt a computer network. The idea of classifying warfare based on the objective of the attack (for example, the objective of a cyber attack is to undermine the functions of a computer network) as opposed to the means (for example, nuclear warfare, chemical warfare, guerilla warfare) is intuitive, logical, and avoids accidental and unnecessary limitations on internet speech, which could be an issue under a means-based classification.\n2. To undermine the function;\nThe objective of a cyber attack must be to undermine the function of a computer network; otherwise, the definition encompasses more than it should. The concept revolves around some kind of compromise or disruption of a computer system instead of simply the use of a computer system in a security breach or an information leak. Note that passive observance of activity or copying of information, no matter how illicit, is not enough to constitute a cyber attack or an act of cyber warfare, thus eliminating some of the aforementioned cyber crimes from the definition, and leaving them to each individual state to deal with domestically.\n3. Of a computer network;\n Id. at 826.\n Hacking is a general term for finding weaknesses in a computer or network and exploiting them.\n Hathaway at 826.\n Louis Charbonneau, Iran rejects UN criticism of its cyber security rules (25 Oct. 2012) Reuters, available at http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/25/net-us-iran-security-un-idUSBRE89O19420121025 (“In his latest report, U.N. special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Iran, Ahmed Shaheed, said he was concerned about reports of government activities ‘that seemingly infringe on freedom of expression and the right to information.’”)\n Hathaway at 827.\n Id. at 828.\n See Hathaway at 829 for a further discussion.\n Id.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nAt the most basic level, a computer network is a collection of computers connected to each other to facilitate the sharing of information and resources.93 While a common connection exists over the Internet, there is also an array of closed networks, like those used by various government agencies.94 Further, the prevalence of computers is crucial to striking at the core of the issue with cyber attacks and cyber warfare: Computers control elevators, stoplights, regulate water pressure, the power grid, etc.95 Thus it bears repeating: The potential for damage from cyber warfare increases as quickly as society's reliance on computer-driven technology.96\n## 4. For a political or national security purpose.\nActions driven by national security or political purposes properly distinguish cyber attacks from ordinary crime.97 A cyber malfeasance that is not carried out for political or national security purposes, such as Internet fraud, identity theft, piracy, etc., while perhaps interesting for examination for questions of, inter alia, international jurisdiction, is, as previously mentioned, a cyber crime best left to the domain of each individual state to regulate.98 Thus, the definition of cyber warfare is limited by focusing on the purpose of the action as opposed to the intent of the actor to best address the vast ramifications of cyber attacks without limiting possible actors to state actors, only.99\n## B. THE NEXT STEP: APPLYING THE DEFINITION TO INSTANCES OF CYBER ATTACKS\n### 1. Stuxnet\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nStuxnet is a type of malware called a “worm,” which is a computer program that replicates itself to spread to other computers, usually using a network to spread itself. The worm does not need to attach itself to an existing program on any of the computers, like other kinds of malware like a computer virus does. Typically a person installs a worm by inadvertently opening an email attachment or message that contains executable scripts.\nAccording to Symantec, Stuxnet infected Windows in its search for industrial control systems, which, in short, can be used to control the automation of industrial processes. Thus, Stuxnet could potentially control or alter how such a system operates. More specifically, Stuxnet included a special payload designed to target Siemens systems that were configured to control and monitor specific industrial processes, and different variants of the worm targeted organizations mainly in Iran between June 2009 and April 2010.\nInitial analysis revealed Stuxnet was likely written by a state to target Iran’s growing nuclear program, including uranium enrichment centrifuges at the Natanz facility in Iran. Iranian officials admitted the worm infected staff computers but denied any major delays to the nuclear power program.\n Bradley Mitchell, *Worm – Computer Worm* (last accessed on 19 Nov. 2012) About.com, *available at* http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/worldwideweb/g/bldef_worm.htm.

The article dubbed the attacks “America’s first sustained use of cyberweapons,” and stated President Obama accelerated the attacks, which began during the Bush administration after an element of the program accidentally became public in the summer of 2010; an action that ultimately allowed Stuxnet to arrive at Iran’s Natanz plant. The article goes further to state that top officials had to consider whether America’s “most ambitious attempt to slow the progress of Iran’s nuclear efforts had been fatally compromised.”\nThe elements set forth by Hathaway were: (1) Any action taken; (2) To undermine the function; (3) Of a computer network; (4) For a political or national security purpose. If the allegations set forth in the New York Times were true, and Stuxnet made its way to Iran at the hands of the United States, then does Stuxnet fit within the definition of a cyber attack? Absolutely. An offensive action was taken. It was certainly intended to undermine the function of a computer network; as it was intended to undermine the capabilities of the computer networks used to run Iran’s nuclear facilities. Presuming the United States was behind the attack, the objective was at the least political,, if it was not also perhaps an attempt to fortify national security. Given the historically cloudy relations between the United States and Iran, if Iran was developing nuclear weapons as opposed to harnessing nuclear power, then it is certainly logical to consider nuclear weapons in the hands of Iranians a threat to national security in the United\n David E.

Thus, under the proposed definition, Stuxnet is a clear example of what should be encompassed by were international law to adopt this definition of a cyber attack.\n## 2. Operation Shady RAT\nOperation Shady RAT perhaps better illustrates the challenges international law must face when dealing with cyber attacks. News reports and journal articles fall short of articulating what exactly happened in Operation Shady RAT, but a report issued by McAfee, the IT security firm giant who unearthed the attacks, revealed the following: (1) It is widely believed that there was one “state actor” behind the attacks, but McAfee declined to name it; (2) The attacks, named partially for a common acronym in the IT industry that stands for “remote access tool,” compromised no less than 71 identified parties, with more parties present in the activity logs where sufficient information was unavailable to accurately identify them; (3) The attacks lasted over five years; and, (4) Nobody knows what happened to the stolen data. Dmitri Alperovitch, Vice President of Threat Research at McAfee, discussed the breadth of the attacks in a report issued through McAfee:\nAfter painstaking analysis of the logs, even we were surprised by the enormous diversity of the victim organizations and were taken aback by the audacity of the perpetrators. Although we will refrain from explicitly identifying most of the victims, describing only their general industry, we feel that naming names is warranted in certain cases, not with the goal of attracting attention to a specific victim organization, but to reinforce the fact that virtually everyone is falling prey to these intrusions, regardless of whether they are\n Jim Finkle, “State Actor” behind slew of cyber attacks (3 Aug. 2011) REUTERS, available at http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/03/us-cyberattacks-idUSTRE7720HU20110803.\n See Finkle (Several other security experts said the evidence points to China).\n Roger Grimes, Danger: Remote Access Trojans (Sept. 2002) Security Administrator, available at http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd632947.aspx(“A remote access tool (RAT) is a piece of software that allows a remote \"operator\" to control a system as if he has physical access to that system.”)\n Dmitri Alperovitch, Revealed: Operation Shady RAT McAfee, 3-4 (2011) available at http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-operation-shady-rat.pdf.\n Daniel Emery, Governments, IOC and UN hit by massive cyber-attack (3 Aug. 2011) BBC NEWS, available at http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14387559.\n See Finkle.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nthe United Nations, a multinational Fortune 100 company, a small, non-profit think tank, a national Olympic team, or even an unfortunate computer security firm.\nThe identity of the state actor behind the attacks was widely assumed to be China, however, Beijing proclaimed the accusations were “groundless.” Frankly, whether China was behind the attack or not matters little when determining where Operation Shady RAT falls in regards to Hathaway’s cyber attack definition.\nThere is little doubt there was an action of some sort; even though research fails to really identify what the action was. It seems almost like the international cyber law version of *res ipsa loquitor*, a doctrine sounding in tort theory where the nature of an outcome speaks for itself and negligence may be inferred even absent of direct evidence of how the aggressor behaved.\nBut, was the attack intended to undermine the function of a computer network? The analysis becomes more convoluted because it seems the attack was intended to purloin information and not specifically to undermine the function of a computer network. Thus, Hathaway’s definition may very well exclude things like Operation Shady RAT from the definition of what a cyber attack is. Is that the correct outcome? It would certainly seem so given the lack of information that would be needed to come to any other conclusions. Were the definition widened it would defeat the entire purpose of the narrow tailoring of each element to comply with the plethora of concerns voiced by numerous scholars in the field.\nWould that analysis change if it was discovered Operation Shady RAT was politically motivated?

Absent any further details, Operation Shady RAT simply is not what international law needs to spend time guarding against in the same way it does attacks similar to Stuxnet.\nFurther, the general purpose of public international law should not be forgotten, and that is that it serves as the framework for the practice of stable and organized international relations and stands in contrast to the remedial nature of dispute resolution commonly seen in civil domestic law. Thus, while Operation Shady RAT may fall short of the suggested definition of a cyber attack, that is not to say domestic law would be incapable of restoring the parties if more information about the incident were available.\n## IV. Conclusion\nIn sum, the international legal community not only should task itself with drafting the Law of the Horse, but should also welcome the challenge. While Lessig may be more correct in his analogy of the current technological landscape than Easterbrook is wrong, that does not mean that the ideas of both men cannot be reconciled. There is no reason not to take the existing international public law concerning the seas or outer space and use that as a platform on which international law could evolve and improve. There is no reason to re-invent the wheel when there is plenty of law in existence that could be tailored to fit the unique needs required by this nebulous \"thing\" called cyberspace.\nThe potential for damage from cyber attacks increases as quickly as society's reliance on computer-driven technology. It would do the globe a gross disservice to ignore the possible harm cyber attacks could cause, and to risk cyber security on an international level by failing to address a looming threat to the infrastructure of a vast number of states.

INTRODUCTION\nThe advent of the Information Age was sudden and abrupt, changing the world in ways Gutenberg could not have possibly imagined even in his wildest dreams.² Cyberspace is the veritable Wild West of the modern age; a largely untamed infinite wilderness of possibilities and opportunities.\nThis paper will explore why the Internet³ and cyberspace are so different from traditional notions of real property, and what challenges that difference presents to players on the international stage, and will rectify whether cyberspace is a new landscape deserving of its own unique law, or whether existing law is equipped to deal with the challenges of cyberspace as written. Next is a thorough exploration of what a cyber attack might be, could be, should be, and should not be, along with a discussion of why cyber attacks are not only a matter of international importance but why, in some respects, only the international community might be equipped to foster dialogue about how to deal with cyber attacks. There is also a call to action for the United Nations, with the perhaps premature admonishment that the United Nations is in the habit of addressing new and different challenges to international law. The third and final part of this\n¹ M. Tullius Cicero, *For Milo*, 11 (52 B.C.E.), translated version available at http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0020%3Atext%3DMil.%3Asection%3D11.\n² Hal Abelson et al., *Blown to Bits: Your life, liberty, and happiness after the digital explosion*, 2-3 (2008).\n³ Id. 303 (“Fundamentally, the internet consists of computers sending bit packets that request services, and other computers sending packets back in response. For example, you don’t really “visit” the web page of a store, like a voyeuristic tourist peeking through the store window. Your computer makes a very specific request of the store’s web server, and the store’s web server responds to it”).\nsection will explore the current state of international law regarding cyber attacks, analyzing what the existing law is, how it might be retrofitted to deal with cyber attacks, and other possible ways the international theater might attempt to regulate nefarious conduct within cyberspace.\nThe next section proposes a workable definition of a cyber attack for the international community that is also mindful of the numerous concerns voiced by various scholars in the area. Then the definition and the framework it provides is put to the test by applying it to two possible instances of cyber attacks: Stuxnet, and Operation Shady RAT.\n## II. CYBERSPACE:⁴ THE NEW FRONTIER?\nThe United States Department of Defense defines cyberspace broadly: A global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.⁵ Webopedia condenses the definition into something a bit more palatable: Cyberspace is, at its simplest, a metaphor for describing the non-physical terrain created by computer systems.⁶\nPrior to considering the impact of cyberspace on international law at large, it should be noted that there are differences in levels of nefarious cyber activities, including cyber crime, cyber espionage,⁷ cyber terrorism, cyber attacks, and (the very hotly debated⁸) cyber warfare.⁹\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n⁴ Scott Thill, *March 17, 1948: William Gibson, Father of Cyberspace* (17 March 2009) WIRED, available at http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2009/03/dayintech_0317 (Attributing the term “cyberspace” to William Gibson; a term Gibson would later describe in *No Maps for These Territories* as an “evocative and essentially meaningless” buzzword that could serve as a cipher for all of his cybernetic musings).\n⁵ CJCS CM-0363-08, available at www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/index.html.\n⁶ Webopedia, “Cyberspace,” (last accessed 19 Nov. 2012) available at http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/cyberspace.html.\n⁷ Espionage is the world’s second oldest profession. Thus, there is a wealth of material written regarding international law and espionage that would be applicable to espionage in all forms, all of which far exceeds the scope of this paper. See R. M. Sheldon, *Espionage in the Ancient World: An Annotated Bibliography of Books and Articles in Western Languages* (2008).\n⁸ Ryan Singel, *White House Cyber Czar: “There Is No Cyber War”* (4 Mar. 2010) WIRED, available at http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/03/schmidt-cyberwar.\nClassification of malicious cyber activity might derive from the intent of the perpetrator and the effects of the act.¹⁰ For example, cyber crime typically involves the distribution of malware,¹¹ child pornography, and other crimes conducted for profit and primarily motivated by financial gain or notoriety.¹² Cyber espionage is motivated by the desire to unearth sensitive information, and could be conducted by an individual or a group, with the goal being a pecuniary gain or a strategic advantage.¹³ Cyber terrorism is intended to influence or motivate either an audience or a government or both through threats and violence, not unlike any other act of terrorism.¹⁴ A cyber terrorist uses tools available in cyberspace as weapons against both cyber and physical targets.¹⁵\nThe definition of a cyber attack is still largely inconsistent,¹⁶ and something this paper will attempt to define. But, for introductory purposes, scholars appear to agree that a cyber crime is not a cyber attack, and thus a cyber attack can at least be loosely defined by what it is not.¹⁷\nHowever, even once defined, there are lingering questions: should a cyber attack be considered an act of war? How would a state defend itself against such an attack? How can a state defend itself against an attack with attribution is in some cases impossible. And, at what point does a cyber attack escalate into cyber warfare?\n## A. CONCERNING TERMINOLOGY\n3 | Page\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n9 Technology Quarterly-Cyber Warfare: Marching Off to Cyberwar, THE ECONOMIST, Dec. 6, 2008, at 71, available at 2008 WLNR 23421990.\n10 Natasha Solce, The Battlefield of Cyberspace: The Inevitable New Military Branch - The Cyber Force, 18 ALB. L.J. SCI. &amp; TECH. 293, 301 (2008). [Hereinafter “Cyber Force”].\n11 Malware is short for malicious/malevolent software, and is a general term used to refer to a variety of hostile or intrusive software. See Robert Moir, Defining Malware: FAQ, MICROSOFT.COM (1 Oct. 2003) available at http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd632948.aspx.\n12 Cyber Force at 301.\n13 Id.\n14 Id.\n15 Id.\n16 Jonathan A.

REV. 3, 7 (2010).\n17 See Cyber Force at 300.\nThe term “cyber warfare” is controversial in and of itself.¹⁸ Howard Schmidt, the cybersecurity czar for the Obama administration, argued in March 2010 that \"There is no cyber war. [...] I think that is a terrible metaphor and I think that is a terrible concept. There are no winners in that environment.\"¹⁹ However, Schmidt’s stance is in direct disagreement with that of Michael McConnell, the former director of national intelligence, who testified to Congress earlier in 2010 that the country was already in the midst of losing a cyber war.²⁰ Meanwhile, still others argue that cyber warfare is just a new version of three activities states know all too well, and practiced for millennia: sabotage, espionage, and subversion.²¹\nThe ramifications of considering cyber attacks an act of warfare are astronomical.²² As Schmidt stated, there are certainly reasons for considering it a terrible metaphor, and a terrible concept. But then, is an attack on a state’s cyberspace really that different from any other extraterritorial breach of sovereignty?\nThese issues lead to a threshold question: do computer networks pose something unique enough to require the international community to formulate new bodies of law to deal with the novel issues cyberspace and cyber attacks pose? Or, should cyber attacks be addressed in the same way as any other act of aggression and through existing international law, with no differentiation between a state’s cyberspace and real territory?\nB. THE LAW OF THE HORSE: THE WORLD IS FAR BEYOND CHARIOTS AND CHAINMAIL\n¹⁸ For the purposes of this paper, “cyber attack” will be used as the generic term for politically motivated computer crimes, with “cyber warfare” representing a subset of cyber attacks that could be considered actual acts of war.\n¹⁹ Singel.\n²⁰ Id.\n²¹ Thomas Rid, *Cyber War Will Not Take Place*, 35 JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES 1, 5-32 (2012).\n²² A discussion of just how astronomical those ramifications would be far exceeds the scope of this paper, but the classification of such acts as “warfare” certainly invokes a militaristic response.\n4 | Page\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nThe Honorable Frank H. Easterbrook said, “[C]ourses should be limited to subjects that could illuminate the entire law.”²³ The basic concept is that there is no Law of the Horse; that is to say, efforts to collect all laws involving horses²⁴ and to aggregate them into one comprehensive Law of the Horse are, “doomed to be shallow and to miss unifying principles.”²⁵ Thus, Easterbrook suggests the study of general rules when dealing with cyberspace and simply basic existing law to cyberspace as it is. According to Easterbrook’s theory, states should take their existing tort, contract, property law, etc., and use the broad rules encompassed in those areas of law to address cyberspace instead of fabricating new law to address cyberspace specifically, based on the presumption that creating a Law of the Horse for cyberspace will be shallow, disjointed and ultimately, futile.²⁶\nEasterbrook makes three core suggestions for making this work in cyberspace: (1) Rules should be clearly defined; (2) Property rights should be created where there are none; and (3) The law should facilitate the formation of bargaining institutions.²⁷ Thus, Easterbrook argues for a laissez-faire view of the internet, that we have cyberspace as it is, we should let it evolve, and we should sit back and enjoy it.²⁸ The basic assumption is that if states have well-defined rights\n5 | Page\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n23 Frank H. Easterbrook, Cyberspace and the Law of the Horse, 1996 U. CHI. LEGAL F. 207, 207 (1996).\n24 Id. (“Lots of cases deal with sales of horses; others deal with people kicked by horses; still more deal with the licensing and racing of horses, or with the care veterinarians give to horses, or with prizes at horse shows.”)\n25 Id. at 207-208 (“Teaching 100 percent of the cases on people kicked by horses will not convey the law of torts very well. Far better for most students--better, even, for those who plan to go into the horse trade--to take courses in property, torts, commercial transactions, and the like, adding to the diet of horse cases a smattering of transactions in cucumbers, cats, coal, and cribs. Only by putting the law of the horse in the context of broader rules about commercial endeavors could one really understand the law about horses.”)\n26 Id. (“I don’t know much about cyberspace; what I do know will be outdated in five years (if not five months!); and my predictions about the direction of change are worthless, making any effort to tailor the law to the subject futile.”)\n27 Id. at 210-214.\n28 Id.\nand we know what those mean, we can assume individuals will make predictable choices and behave in the most efficient way possible.²⁹\nHowever, there is no doubt that the world has evolved beyond chariots and chainmail when it comes to warfare, and the mere existence of cyber attacks show that the laissez-faire method may not be the most effective approach, because as evidenced by some ethically and morally challenged actors, the most beneficial choice was the one that completely undermined a state’s rights over their cyber territory.³⁰ The age-old adage about permission and forgiveness is proven quite true with cyber warfare: It is always easier to beg forgiveness than to ask permission, and when it comes to cyberspace and sovereignty it seems states and other actors would much prefer to put the cart before the horse.\nAlternatively, Lawrence Lessig argues that cyberspace is not the sum of its parts and cannot be dealt with through existing tort, contract, and property law.³¹ Lessig discusses behavioral constraints in cyberspace in terms of four different modalities and enforcement mechanisms: (1) Law, which is enforced by states³²; (2) Social norms, which are enforced by society³³; (3) Markets, which are enforced by price³⁴; and (4) The architecture of cyberspace itself, which is enforced by code.³⁵ Essentially, Lessig argues the modalities of regulations are the prisms through which regulation of cyberspace need to be considered, and that cyberspace must be addressed holistically because if not, there is absolutely no way to regulate it.³⁶\n²⁹ Id.\n³⁰ For a list of the “major” cyber attacks through September of 2011, see Julian Ryall, *A history of major cyber attacks* (20 Sept. 2011) TELEGRAPH, available at http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/8775632/A-history-of-major-cyber-attacks.html.\n³¹ Lawrence Lessig, *The Law of the Horse: What Cyberlaw Might Teach*, 113 HARV.

The architecture of physical space is generally unmalleable; that is to say, a state cannot just unilaterally say “Let’s move this ocean,” and then do so. Likewise, customary international law recognizes defined territory as a qualification for statehood,³⁷ and with battles over land punctuating the history of mankind since 2700 B.C.E., it is evident that defining and changing territorial lines is anything but easy.³⁸\nCyberspace is different; the architecture of it is malleable, and thus, cyberspace requires its own set of rules since cyberspace essentially allows states in a sense to move mountains³⁹ and to do so quickly; a notion that is difficult to analogize to the physical world. Thus, the policy behind cyberspace and cyber warfare should reflect the malleable architecture of cyberspace, meaning that cyberspace and attacks upon it should be addressed with their own separate area of law.\nLessig’s argument that cyberspace requires its own proverbial Law of the Horse⁴⁰ is far more compelling than Easterbrook’s position that there is not and should be no Law of the Horse,⁴¹ because cyberspace demands flexibility and different standards to address the unique nature of the challenges faced in cyber warfare, instead of denying their existence and essentially forcing a square peg to fit in a round hole, which is what Easterbrook seems to propose. The international legal community must evolve and embrace the challenges presented by cyberspace, regardless of how baffling they might be, and recognize that though attempts to deal such an alien landscape will be imperfect at best, such attempts will be vital to breathe life into the\n³⁷ Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, Art. 1, 165 LNTS 19; 49 Stat 3097 (1934).\n³⁸ John Keegan, War and Our World, note 2, at 29 (2001) (Stating Gilgamesh, who ruled the Mesopotamian city of Uruk, undertook one of history’s first offensive military campaigns in 2700 B.C.).\n³⁹ At least, mountains of data.\n⁴⁰ Lessig at 501.\n⁴¹ See Easterbrook at 207 (“The best way to learn the law applicable to specialized endeavors is to study general rules”).\n7 | Page\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\ninternational community’s ability to maintain relative order and peace in a rapidly changing world.\n## II. WHAT IS A CYBER ATTACK AND WHY SHOULD WE CARE?\nIn an interview with the BBC about the threat of cyber warfare, Dr. Hamadoun Toure, the head of the United Nations telecommunications agency said the “best way to win a war is to avoid it in the first place.”42 The United Nations has called on member states to talk to each other, and to pull back from the threat of cyber war.43 That sounds facially simple, but as it stands, states cannot agree even on what a cyber warfare incident is.44 Suffice it to say, states would find it difficult to agree to enter into an agreement avoiding a threat their brightest experts cannot even clearly define. However, it is clear that despite differing opinions on what cyber warfare really is, cyber security, and the breaches of cyber security are issues of the utmost importance and international law has yet to truly react to the threat cyber security poses for the international community.45\nIn February 2011, then-Central Intelligence Agency Director Leon Panetta warned, “The next Pearl Harbor could very well be a cyber attack.”46 William Lynn, America’s Deputy Secretary of Defense wrote, “Although cyberspace is a man-made domain, [it is] just as critical to military operations as land, sea, air and space.”47\n## A. DOES THIS MEAN WAR?\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nGenerally speaking, international law permits three situations as legal causes for war: (1) Self defense; (2) Defense of an ally under a mutual defense pact; and (3) via a UN sanction.⁴⁸ An offensive act has to meet certain criteria to qualify as an act of war.⁴⁹ The United States Army’s Cyber Operations and Cyber Terrorism Handbook defines a cyber attack as: “The premeditated use of disruptive activities, or the threat thereof, against computers and/or networks, with the intention to cause harm or to further social, ideological, religious, political, or similar objectives. Or to intimidate any person in furtherance of such objectives.”⁵⁰ A cyber attack, unlike a cyber crime, involves “an aggressive act on the part of one adversary—whether an individual, a competing organization or a rival government—against another in an ongoing struggle for hegemony in the marketplace or the political arena.”⁵¹\nCarl von Clausewitz, a Prussian military theorist, penned a succinct, elemental breakdown of what is needed to constitute an act of war.⁵² First, there must be an act of force to compel the enemy to do something.⁵³ Second, that act must be instrumental; i.e., there must be both a means and an end with force being the means and the acceptance of the aggressor’s will as the end.⁵⁴ Third, the act must be political.⁵⁵ As Clausewitz famously said, “War is a mere continuation of politics by other means.”⁵⁶ While Clausewitz’s framework is simple and concise, there is of course plentiful room to debate the interpretation of each element, and thus whether or\n⁴⁸ United Nations, Charter of the United Nations, 1 U.N.T.S.

WHY ARE CYBER ATTACKS AN ISSUE OF INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE?\nThere is little debate that modern states increasingly rely on both global and domestic information structures.58 Information gathering and the disruption of communication channels have always been tools of war, and arguably, the destruction of an enemy’s communication networks could reap greater benefits for an aggressor than the destruction of weapons arsenals or supply chains.59 The more heavily a nation state relies on the Internet, especially for military and governmental infrastructures, the more tempting it becomes for states in conflict to exploit those vulnerabilities through cyber attacks.60\nPerhaps the most compelling and confusing reason cyber attacks are of international concern is in the nature of how information is sent over the Internet; that is to say that when a computer sends information over the Internet that information is divided into “packets,” and those packets adopt their routes to network congestion, opting for the path of least resistance.61 Since the Internet was specifically designed to send information through the fastest route\n10 | Page\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n57 See Rid for a thorough discussion of why cyber attacks may not qualify as acts of war. But see Commander Todd C. Huntley, Controlling the Use of Force in Cyber Space: The Application of the Law of Armed Conflict During a Time of Fundamental Change in the Nature of Warfare 60 NAVAL L. REV. 1 (2010) for an equally thorough discussion of types of cyber attacks that may qualify as acts of war.\n58 Lesley Swanson, The Era of Cyber Warfare: Applying International Humanitarian to the Russian-Georgian 2008 Cyber Conflict, 32 LOY.

A Desperate Plea for U.N. Action\nInternational law must concern itself with what goes on in cyberspace. Regardless of whether cyberspace is considered an international commons of sorts⁶⁸ or space subject to more traditional notions of sovereignty, the fact of the matter is that international law must attempt\n⁶² Ophardt at 24.\n⁶³ “As the crow flies” is an idiom for the shortest distance between two points.\n⁶⁴ Ophardt at 24.\n⁶⁵ Molly Mulrain, *Cyber Attack Attribution Important to Cybersecurity*, *Says Committee* (16 July 2012)\nExecutiveGov.com, *available at* http://www.executivegov.com/2010/07/cyber-attack-attribution-important-to-cybersecurity-says-committee.\n⁶⁶ Scott J.

Consider the following: (1) Outer space and the inception of “space law”69 following the launch of Sputnik in 1958;70 (2) The evolution of international maritime law, regulating regions once seen as mysterious, difficult to navigate, and possibly infinite;71 and, (3) The regulation of Antarctica.72 Further, the United Nations is no stranger to new paradigms when it becomes apparent that the area of law at issue is a matter of international concern.73 Cyberspace is certainly an issue of global concern due to its very nature, and is thusly compatible with Article 2 of the United Nations Charter.74\n## C. CICERO ON CYBERSPACE: EXISTING LAW IS SILENT\nTo be quite blunt, international law falls short in terms of securing cyberspace and addressing cyber attacks. To date, there are no treaties in existence dealing directly with cyber\n12 | Page\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nattacks or cyber warfare.75 The United Nations called on nations to “talk to each other,” and “pull back from the threat of cyber war,”76 but such a plea is woefully inadequate at best.\nHowever, as discussed previously, there is plentiful existing international law in various forms dealing with and governing inter alia, the vastness of outer space and the depths of the oceans that could be adapted to address the complexities presented by cyberspace and attacks on and in it.77 Additionally, the commentaries to the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols suggest that “armed conflict” may be considered an expansive term, would could subject cyber attacks to the expansive body of existing international humanitarian law.78\nThe Tallinn Manual, written by group of experts working with the Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (“CCDCOE”), an institute based in Tallinn, Estonia, specifically contemplates how international law should apply to conflict in cyberspace, keeping in mind the problem that laws of conventional warfare are difficult to apply to such an amorphous space.79\n\"One of the challenges states face in the cyber environment is that the scope and manner of international law's applicability to cyber operations where in offense or defense has remained unsettled since their advent,\" wrote Michael N. Schmitt, project director and chairman of the International Law Department at the U.S. Naval War College, in the manual's introduction. \"The threshold questions are whether the existing law applies to cyber issues at all, and, if so, how.\"80\nHowever, the Tallinn Manual is not an official document and is instead the summation of opinions of a group of experts acting solely in their personal capacity, and the CCDCOE cautions\n13 | Page\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n75 Eric Jensen, Sovereignty and Neutrality in Cyber Conflict, 35 FORDHAM INT'L L.J. 815 (2012).\n76 See Rundle article.\n77 For an in-depth discussion of existing international law and possible analogies to cyber attacks see generally Shackelford, Nuclear War to Net War.\n78 Swanson at 313.\n79 See Kirk article.\n80 Id.

A PROPOSED DEFINITION AND ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n### A. DEFINING A CYBER ATTACK: A NARROWLY TAILORED APPROACH\nBefore international law can even remotely begin to address the threat cyber attacks and to prosecute their perpetrators, what a cyber attack is must first be succinctly defined. In an article co-authored with multiple other minds, Oona Hathaway suggested the adoption of a narrow definition of what a cyber attack is, in order to focus attention on the niche cyber warfare fills in the international community: “A cyber-attack consists of any action taken to undermine the functions of a computer network for a political or national security purpose.”⁸² This definition breaks down into easily manageable elements that properly address the specific threat posed by cyber aggression, it echoes Clausewitz’s elemental breakdown of an act of war, and it addresses the intent of the perpetrator called for in The Economist and by Solce. This definition appears to satisfy the vast majority of concerns voiced by scholars on the issue. Implicit in the term “cyber attack” is the idea that the conduct must be active to constitute an attack, whether it is active offensively or defensively.⁸³ Thus, passive conduct like scanning for viruses is filtered out of the definition at the threshold.⁸⁴\n### 1. Any action taken;\n14 | Page\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\n⁸¹ CCDCOE Introduction to The Tallinn Manual, available at https://www.ccdcoe.org/249.html.\n⁸² Oona A. Hathaway, et al., *The Law of Cyber-Attack* 100 CAL. L. REV. 817, 826 (2012).\n⁸³ *Id.*\n⁸⁴ *Id.* at fn. 29\nAny action can be used as the means with which to carry out a cyber attack.⁸⁵ Thus, cyber warfare could be waged through hacking⁸⁶ or any number of other technological strategies as long as the goal of the attack is to undermine or disrupt a computer network.⁸⁷ The idea of classifying warfare based on the objective of the attack (for example, the objective of a cyber attack is to undermine the functions of a computer network) as opposed to the means (for example, nuclear warfare, chemical warfare, guerilla warfare) is intuitive, logical, and avoids accidental and unnecessary limitations on internet speech⁸⁸, which could be an issue under a means-based classification.⁸⁹\n2. To undermine the function;\nThe objective of a cyber attack must be to undermine the function of a computer network; otherwise, the definition encompasses more than it should.⁹⁰ The concept revolves around some kind of compromise or disruption of a computer system instead of simply the use of a computer system in a security breach or an information leak.⁹¹ Note that passive observance of activity or copying of information, no matter how illicit, is not enough to constitute a cyber attack or an act of cyber warfare, thus eliminating some of the aforementioned cyber crimes from the definition, and leaving them to each individual state to deal with domestically.⁹²\n3. Of a computer network;\n⁸⁵ Id. at 826.\n⁸⁶ Hacking is a general term for finding weaknesses in a computer or network and exploiting them.\n⁸⁷ Hathaway at 826.\n⁸⁸ Louis Charbonneau, Iran rejects UN criticism of its cyber security rules (25 Oct. 2012) Reuters, available at http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/25/net-us-iran-security-un-idUSBRE89O19420121025 (“In his latest report, U.N. special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Iran, Ahmed Shaheed, said he was concerned about reports of government activities ‘that seemingly infringe on freedom of expression and the right to information.’”)\n⁸⁹ Hathaway at 827.\n⁹⁰ Id. at 828.\n⁹¹ See Hathaway at 829 for a further discussion.\n⁹² Id.\n15 | Page\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nAt the most basic level, a computer network is a collection of computers connected to each other to facilitate the sharing of information and resources.93 While a common connection exists over the Internet, there is also an array of closed networks, like those used by various government agencies.94 Further, the prevalence of computers is crucial to striking at the core of the issue with cyber attacks and cyber warfare: Computers control elevators, stoplights, regulate water pressure, the power grid, etc.95 Thus it bears repeating: The potential for damage from cyber warfare increases as quickly as society's reliance on computer-driven technology.96\n## 4. For a political or national security purpose.\nActions driven by national security or political purposes properly distinguish cyber attacks from ordinary crime.97 A cyber malfeasance that is not carried out for political or national security purposes, such as Internet fraud, identity theft, piracy, etc., while perhaps interesting for examination for questions of, inter alia, international jurisdiction, is, as previously mentioned, a cyber crime best left to the domain of each individual state to regulate.98 Thus, the definition of cyber warfare is limited by focusing on the purpose of the action as opposed to the intent of the actor to best address the vast ramifications of cyber attacks without limiting possible actors to state actors, only.99\n## B. THE NEXT STEP: APPLYING THE DEFINITION TO INSTANCES OF CYBER ATTACKS\n### 1. Stuxnet\n16 | Page\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nStuxnet is a type of malware called a “worm,” which is a computer program that replicates itself to spread to other computers, usually using a network to spread itself.¹⁰⁰ The worm does not need to attach itself to an existing program on any of the computers, like other kinds of malware like a computer virus¹⁰¹ does. Typically a person installs a worm by inadvertently opening an email attachment or message that contains executable scripts.¹⁰²\nAccording to Symantec, Stuxnet infected Windows in its search for industrial control systems, which, in short, can be used to control the automation of industrial processes.¹⁰³ Thus, Stuxnet could potentially control or alter how such a system operates.¹⁰⁴ More specifically, Stuxnet included a special payload designed to target Siemens systems that were configured to control and monitor specific industrial processes, and different variants of the worm targeted organizations mainly in Iran between June 2009 and April 2010.¹⁰⁵\nInitial analysis revealed Stuxnet was likely written by a state to target Iran’s growing nuclear program, including uranium enrichment centrifuges at the Natanz facility in Iran.¹⁰⁶ Iranian officials admitted the worm infected staff computers but denied any major delays to the nuclear power program.¹⁰⁷\n¹⁰⁰ Bradley Mitchell, *Worm – Computer Worm* (last accessed on 19 Nov. 2012) About.com, *available at* http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/worldwideweb/g/bldef_worm.htm.

If the allegations set forth in the New York Times were true, and Stuxnet made its way to Iran at the hands of the United States, then does Stuxnet fit within the definition of a cyber attack? Absolutely. An offensive action was taken. It was certainly intended to undermine the function of a computer network; as it was intended to undermine the capabilities of the computer networks used to run Iran’s nuclear facilities. Presuming the United States was behind the attack, the objective was at the least political,¹¹¹, if it was not also perhaps an attempt to fortify national security. Given the historically cloudy relations between the United States and Iran,¹¹² if Iran was developing nuclear weapons as opposed to harnessing nuclear power, then it is certainly logical to consider nuclear weapons in the hands of Iranians a threat to national security in the United\n¹⁰⁸ David E. Sanger, Obama Order Sped Up Wave of Cyber Attacks Against Iran, THE NEW YORK TIMES, June 1, 2012, available at http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/world/middleeast/obama-ordered-wave-of-cyberattacks-against-iran.html\n¹⁰⁹ Id.\n¹¹⁰ Id.\n¹¹¹ Recall the prevalence of Iran in the 2012 Presidential Debates.

Thus, under the proposed definition, Stuxnet is a clear example of what should be encompassed by were international law to adopt this definition of a cyber attack.\n## 2. Operation Shady RAT\nOperation Shady RAT perhaps better illustrates the challenges international law must face when dealing with cyber attacks. News reports and journal articles fall short of articulating what exactly happened in Operation Shady RAT, but a report issued by McAfee, the IT security firm giant who unearthed the attacks,¹¹³ revealed the following: (1) It is widely believed that there was one “state actor” behind the attacks, but McAfee declined to name it;¹¹⁴ (2) The attacks, named partially for a common acronym in the IT industry that stands for “remote access tool,”¹¹⁵ compromised no less than 71 identified parties, with more parties present in the activity logs where sufficient information was unavailable to accurately identify them;¹¹⁶ (3) The attacks lasted over five years;¹¹⁷ and, (4) Nobody knows what happened to the stolen data.¹¹⁸ Dmitri Alperovitch, Vice President of Threat Research at McAfee, discussed the breadth of the attacks in a report issued through McAfee:\nAfter painstaking analysis of the logs, even we were surprised by the enormous diversity of the victim organizations and were taken aback by the audacity of the perpetrators. Although we will refrain from explicitly identifying most of the victims, describing only their general industry, we feel that naming names is warranted in certain cases, not with the goal of attracting attention to a specific victim organization, but to reinforce the fact that virtually everyone is falling prey to these intrusions, regardless of whether they are\n¹¹³ Jim Finkle, “State Actor” behind slew of cyber attacks (3 Aug. 2011) REUTERS, available at http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/03/us-cyberattacks-idUSTRE7720HU20110803.\n¹¹⁴ See Finkle (Several other security experts said the evidence points to China).\n¹¹⁵ Roger Grimes, Danger: Remote Access Trojans (Sept. 2002) Security Administrator, available at http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd632947.aspx(“A remote access tool (RAT) is a piece of software that allows a remote \"operator\" to control a system as if he has physical access to that system.”)\n¹¹⁶ Dmitri Alperovitch, Revealed: Operation Shady RAT McAfee, 3-4 (2011) available at http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-operation-shady-rat.pdf.\n¹¹⁷ Daniel Emery, Governments, IOC and UN hit by massive cyber-attack (3 Aug. 2011) BBC NEWS, available at http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14387559.\n¹¹⁸ See Finkle.\n19 | Page\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nthe United Nations, a multinational Fortune 100 company, a small, non-profit think tank, a national Olympic team, or even an unfortunate computer security firm.¹¹⁹\nThe identity of the state actor behind the attacks was widely assumed to be China, however, Beijing proclaimed the accusations were “groundless.”¹²⁰ Frankly, whether China was behind the attack or not matters little when determining where Operation Shady RAT falls in regards to Hathaway’s cyber attack definition.\nThere is little doubt there was an action of some sort; even though research fails to really identify what the action was. It seems almost like the international cyber law version of *res ipsa loquitor*,¹²¹ a doctrine sounding in tort theory where the nature of an outcome speaks for itself and negligence¹²² may be inferred even absent of direct evidence of how the aggressor behaved.\nBut, was the attack intended to undermine the function of a computer network? The analysis becomes more convoluted because it seems the attack was intended to purloin information and not specifically to undermine the function of a computer network. Thus, Hathaway’s definition may very well exclude things like Operation Shady RAT from the definition of what a cyber attack is. Is that the correct outcome? It would certainly seem so given the lack of information that would be needed to come to any other conclusions. Were the definition widened it would defeat the entire purpose of the narrow tailoring of each element to comply with the plethora of concerns voiced by numerous scholars in the field.\nWould that analysis change if it was discovered Operation Shady RAT was politically motivated? Perhaps so, however, since no party has come forward with what happened to the\n¹¹⁹ Alperovitch at 3.\n¹²⁰ See Emery.\n¹²¹ Byrne v. Boadle, 2 Hurl. &amp; Colt. 722, 159 Eng. Rep. 299 (1863) (Establishing that tort elements of duty of care and breach can be sometimes inferred from the very nature of an accident or other outcome, even without direct evidence of how any defendant behaved).\n¹²² For the sake of clarity, this is by no means meant to suggest that cyber attacks could be committed negligently; the requirement of the objective is crucial.\n20 | Page\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\ninformation taken in Operation Shady RAT and what it was used for, any analysis here is purely speculative. Absent any further details, Operation Shady RAT simply is not what international law needs to spend time guarding against in the same way it does attacks similar to Stuxnet.\nFurther, the general purpose of public international law should not be forgotten, and that is that it serves as the framework for the practice of stable and organized international relations and stands in contrast to the remedial nature of dispute resolution commonly seen in civil domestic law.¹²³ Thus, while Operation Shady RAT may fall short of the suggested definition of a cyber attack, that is not to say domestic law would be incapable of restoring the parties if more information about the incident were available.\n## IV. Conclusion\nIn sum, the international legal community not only should task itself with drafting the Law of the Horse, but should also welcome the challenge. While Lessig may be more correct in his analogy of the current technological landscape than Easterbrook is wrong, that does not mean that the ideas of both men cannot be reconciled. There is no reason not to take the existing international public law concerning the seas or outer space and use that as a platform on which international law could evolve and improve. There is no reason to re-invent the wheel when there is plenty of law in existence that could be tailored to fit the unique needs required by this nebulous \"thing\" called cyberspace.\nThe potential for damage from cyber attacks increases as quickly as society's reliance on computer-driven technology.¹²⁴ It would do the globe a gross disservice to ignore the possible harm cyber attacks could cause, and to risk cyber security on an international level by failing to address a looming threat to the infrastructure of a vast number of states. Of course individual\n¹²³ William Slomanson, *Fundamental Perspectives on International Law*, 4-5 (2011).\n¹²⁴ Hathaway at 830.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590\nnations need to be responsible for their own national security; however, this type of international threat that by definition transcends boundaries demands an international solution.\n22 | Page\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590"

INTRODUCTION The advent of the Information Age was sudden and abrupt, changing the world in ways Gutenberg could not have possibly imagined even in his wildest dreams.² Cyberspace is the veritable Wild West of the modern age; a largely untamed infinite wilderness of possibilities and opportunities.\nThis paper will explore why the Internet³ and cyberspace are so different from traditional notions of real property, and what challenges that difference presents to players on the international stage, and will rectify whether cyberspace is a new landscape deserving of its own unique law, or whether existing law is equipped to deal with the challenges of cyberspace as written. Next is a thorough exploration of what a cyber attack might be, could be, should be, and should not be, along with a discussion of why cyber attacks are not only a matter of international importance but why, in some respects, only the international community might be equipped to foster dialogue about how to deal with cyber attacks. There is also a call to action for the United Nations, with the perhaps premature admonishment that the United Nations is in the habit of addressing new and different challenges to international law. The third and final part of this ¹ M. Tullius Cicero, *For Milo*, 11 (52 B.C.E.), translated version available at http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0020%3Atext%3DMil.%3Asection%3D11.\n² Hal Abelson et al., *Blown to Bits: Your life, liberty, and happiness after the digital explosion*, 2-3 (2008).\n³ Id. 303 (“Fundamentally, the internet consists of computers sending bit packets that request services, and other computers sending packets back in response. For example, you don’t really “visit” the web page of a store, like a voyeuristic tourist peeking through the store window. Your computer makes a very specific request of the store’s web server, and the store’s web server responds to it”).\nsection will explore the current state of international law regarding cyber attacks, analyzing what the existing law is, how it might be retrofitted to deal with cyber attacks, and other possible ways the international theater might attempt to regulate nefarious conduct within cyberspace.\nThe next section proposes a workable definition of a cyber attack for the international community that is also mindful of the numerous concerns voiced by various scholars in the area. Then the definition and the framework it provides is put to the test by applying it to two possible instances of cyber attacks: Stuxnet, and Operation Shady RAT.\n## II. CYBERSPACE:⁴ THE NEW FRONTIER?\nThe United States Department of Defense defines cyberspace broadly: A global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.⁵ Webopedia condenses the definition into something a bit more palatable: Cyberspace is, at its simplest, a metaphor for describing the non-physical terrain created by computer systems.⁶ Prior to considering the impact of cyberspace on international law at large, it should be noted that there are differences in levels of nefarious cyber activities, including cyber crime, cyber espionage,⁷ cyber terrorism, cyber attacks, and (the very hotly debated⁸) cyber warfare.⁹ Electronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590 ⁴ Scott Thill, *March 17, 1948: William Gibson, Father of Cyberspace* (17 March 2009) WIRED, available at http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2009/03/dayintech_0317 (Attributing the term “cyberspace” to William Gibson; a term Gibson would later describe in *No Maps for These Territories* as an “evocative and essentially meaningless” buzzword that could serve as a cipher for all of his cybernetic musings).\n⁵ CJCS CM-0363-08, available at www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/index.html.\n⁶ Webopedia, “Cyberspace,” (last accessed 19 Nov. 2012) available at http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/cyberspace.html.\n⁷ Espionage is the world’s second oldest profession. Thus, there is a wealth of material written regarding international law and espionage that would be applicable to espionage in all forms, all of which far exceeds the scope of this paper. See R. M. Sheldon, *Espionage in the Ancient World: An Annotated Bibliography of Books and Articles in Western Languages* (2008).\n⁸ Ryan Singel, *White House Cyber Czar: “There Is No Cyber War”* (4 Mar. 2010) WIRED, available at http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/03/schmidt-cyberwar.\nClassification of malicious cyber activity might derive from the intent of the perpetrator and the effects of the act.¹⁰ For example, cyber crime typically involves the distribution of malware,¹¹ child pornography, and other crimes conducted for profit and primarily motivated by financial gain or notoriety.¹² Cyber espionage is motivated by the desire to unearth sensitive information, and could be conducted by an individual or a group, with the goal being a pecuniary gain or a strategic advantage.¹³ Cyber terrorism is intended to influence or motivate either an audience or a government or both through threats and violence, not unlike any other act of terrorism.¹⁴ A cyber terrorist uses tools available in cyberspace as weapons against both cyber and physical targets.¹⁵ The definition of a cyber attack is still largely inconsistent,¹⁶ and something this paper will attempt to define. But, for introductory purposes, scholars appear to agree that a cyber crime is not a cyber attack, and thus a cyber attack can at least be loosely defined by what it is not.¹⁷ However, even once defined, there are lingering questions: should a cyber attack be considered an act of war? How would a state defend itself against such an attack? How can a state defend itself against an attack with attribution is in some cases impossible. And, at what point does a cyber attack escalate into cyber warfare?\n## A. CONCERNING TERMINOLOGY Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590 The term “cyber warfare” is controversial in and of itself.¹⁸ Howard Schmidt, the cybersecurity czar for the Obama administration, argued in March 2010 that\"There is no cyber war. [...] I think that is a terrible metaphor and I think that is a terrible concept. There are no winners in that environment.\"¹⁹ However, Schmidt’s stance is in direct disagreement with that of Michael McConnell, the former director of national intelligence, who testified to Congress earlier in 2010 that the country was already in the midst of losing a cyber war.²⁰ Meanwhile, still others argue that cyber warfare is just a new version of three activities states know all too well, and practiced for millennia: sabotage, espionage, and subversion.²¹ The ramifications of considering cyber attacks an act of warfare are astronomical.²² As Schmidt stated, there are certainly reasons for considering it a terrible metaphor, and a terrible concept. But then, is an attack on a state’s cyberspace really that different from any other extraterritorial breach of sovereignty?\nThese issues lead to a threshold question: do computer networks pose something unique enough to require the international community to formulate new bodies of law to deal with the novel issues cyberspace and cyber attacks pose? Or, should cyber attacks be addressed in the same way as any other act of aggression and through existing international law, with no differentiation between a state’s cyberspace and real territory?\nB. THE LAW OF THE HORSE: THE WORLD IS FAR BEYOND CHARIOTS AND CHAINMAIL ¹⁸ For the purposes of this paper, “cyber attack” will be used as the generic term for politically motivated computer crimes, with “cyber warfare” representing a subset of cyber attacks that could be considered actual acts of war.\n¹⁹ Singel.\n²⁰ Id.\n²¹ Thomas Rid, *Cyber War Will Not Take Place*, 35 JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES 1, 5-32 (2012).\n²² A discussion of just how astronomical those ramifications would be far exceeds the scope of this paper, but the classification of such acts as “warfare” certainly invokes a militaristic response.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590 The Honorable Frank H. Easterbrook said, “[C]ourses should be limited to subjects that could illuminate the entire law.”²³ The basic concept is that there is no Law of the Horse; that is to say, efforts to collect all laws involving horses²⁴ and to aggregate them into one comprehensive Law of the Horse are, “doomed to be shallow and to miss unifying principles.”²⁵ Thus, Easterbrook suggests the study of general rules when dealing with cyberspace and simply basic existing law to cyberspace as it is. According to Easterbrook’s theory, states should take their existing tort, contract, property law, etc., and use the broad rules encompassed in those areas of law to address cyberspace instead of fabricating new law to address cyberspace specifically, based on the presumption that creating a Law of the Horse for cyberspace will be shallow, disjointed and ultimately, futile.²⁶ Easterbrook makes three core suggestions for making this work in cyberspace: (1) Rules should be clearly defined; (2) Property rights should be created where there are none; and (3) The law should facilitate the formation of bargaining institutions.²⁷ Thus, Easterbrook argues for a laissez-faire view of the internet, that we have cyberspace as it is, we should let it evolve, and we should sit back and enjoy it.²⁸ The basic assumption is that if states have well-defined rights Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590 and we know what those mean, we can assume individuals will make predictable choices and behave in the most efficient way possible.²⁹ However, there is no doubt that the world has evolved beyond chariots and chainmail when it comes to warfare, and the mere existence of cyber attacks show that the laissez-faire method may not be the most effective approach, because as evidenced by some ethically and morally challenged actors, the most beneficial choice was the one that completely undermined a state’s rights over their cyber territory.³⁰ The age-old adage about permission and forgiveness is proven quite true with cyber warfare: It is always easier to beg forgiveness than to ask permission, and when it comes to cyberspace and sovereignty it seems states and other actors would much prefer to put the cart before the horse.\nAlternatively, Lawrence Lessig argues that cyberspace is not the sum of its parts and cannot be dealt with through existing tort, contract, and property law.³¹ Lessig discusses behavioral constraints in cyberspace in terms of four different modalities and enforcement mechanisms: (1) Law, which is enforced by states³²; (2) Social norms, which are enforced by society³³; (3) Markets, which are enforced by price³⁴; and (4) The architecture of cyberspace itself, which is enforced by code.³⁵ Essentially, Lessig argues the modalities of regulations are the prisms through which regulation of cyberspace need to be considered, and that cyberspace must be addressed holistically because if not, there is absolutely no way to regulate it.³⁶ ²⁹ Id.\n³⁰ For a list of the “major” cyber attacks through September of 2011, see Julian Ryall, *A history of major cyber attacks* (20 Sept. 2011) TELEGRAPH, available at http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/8775632/A-history-of-major-cyber-attacks.html.\n³¹ Lawrence Lessig, *The Law of the Horse: What Cyberlaw Might Teach*, 113 HARV. L. REV. 501 (1999).\n³² Id. at 506.\n³³ Id.\n³⁴ Id.\n³⁵ Id.\n³⁶ Id.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590 Lessig’s arguments hinge on the fact that analogies to physical spaces fail when applied to cyberspace and technology. The architecture of physical space is generally unmalleable; that is to say, a state cannot just unilaterally say “Let’s move this ocean,” and then do so. Likewise, customary international law recognizes defined territory as a qualification for statehood,³⁷ and with battles over land punctuating the history of mankind since 2700 B.C.E., it is evident that defining and changing territorial lines is anything but easy.³⁸ Cyberspace is different; the architecture of it is malleable, and thus, cyberspace requires its own set of rules since cyberspace essentially allows states in a sense to move mountains³⁹ and to do so quickly; a notion that is difficult to analogize to the physical world. Thus, the policy behind cyberspace and cyber warfare should reflect the malleable architecture of cyberspace, meaning that cyberspace and attacks upon it should be addressed with their own separate area of law.\nLessig’s argument that cyberspace requires its own proverbial Law of the Horse⁴⁰ is far more compelling than Easterbrook’s position that there is not and should be no Law of the Horse,⁴¹ because cyberspace demands flexibility and different standards to address the unique nature of the challenges faced in cyber warfare, instead of denying their existence and essentially forcing a square peg to fit in a round hole, which is what Easterbrook seems to propose. The international legal community must evolve and embrace the challenges presented by cyberspace, regardless of how baffling they might be, and recognize that though attempts to deal such an alien landscape will be imperfect at best, such attempts will be vital to breathe life into the ³⁷ Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, Art. 1, 165 LNTS 19; 49 Stat 3097 (1934).\n³⁸ John Keegan, War and Our World, note 2, at 29 (2001) (Stating Gilgamesh, who ruled the Mesopotamian city of Uruk, undertook one of history’s first offensive military campaigns in 2700 B.C.).\n³⁹ At least, mountains of data.\n⁴⁰ Lessig at 501.\n⁴¹ See Easterbrook at 207 (“The best way to learn the law applicable to specialized endeavors is to study general rules”).\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590 international community’s ability to maintain relative order and peace in a rapidly changing world.\n## II. WHAT IS A CYBER ATTACK AND WHY SHOULD WE CARE?\nIn an interview with the BBC about the threat of cyber warfare, Dr. Hamadoun Toure, the head of the United Nations telecommunications agency said the “best way to win a war is to avoid it in the first place.”42 The United Nations has called on member states to talk to each other, and to pull back from the threat of cyber war.43 That sounds facially simple, but as it stands, states cannot agree even on what a cyber warfare incident is.44 Suffice it to say, states would find it difficult to agree to enter into an agreement avoiding a threat their brightest experts cannot even clearly define. However, it is clear that despite differing opinions on what cyber warfare really is, cyber security, and the breaches of cyber security are issues of the utmost importance and international law has yet to truly react to the threat cyber security poses for the international community.45 In February 2011, then-Central Intelligence Agency Director Leon Panetta warned, “The next Pearl Harbor could very well be a cyber attack.”46 William Lynn, America’s Deputy Secretary of Defense wrote, “Although cyberspace is a man-made domain, [it is] just as critical to military operations as land, sea, air and space.”47 ## A. DOES THIS MEAN WAR?\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590 Generally speaking, international law permits three situations as legal causes for war: (1) Self defense; (2) Defense of an ally under a mutual defense pact; and (3) via a UN sanction.⁴⁸ An offensive act has to meet certain criteria to qualify as an act of war.⁴⁹ The United States Army’s Cyber Operations and Cyber Terrorism Handbook defines a cyber attack as: “The premeditated use of disruptive activities, or the threat thereof, against computers and/or networks, with the intention to cause harm or to further social, ideological, religious, political, or similar objectives. Or to intimidate any person in furtherance of such objectives.”⁵⁰ A cyber attack, unlike a cyber crime, involves “an aggressive act on the part of one adversary—whether an individual, a competing organization or a rival government—against another in an ongoing struggle for hegemony in the marketplace or the political arena.”⁵¹ Carl von Clausewitz, a Prussian military theorist, penned a succinct, elemental breakdown of what is needed to constitute an act of war.⁵² First, there must be an act of force to compel the enemy to do something.⁵³ Second, that act must be instrumental; i.e., there must be both a means and an end with force being the means and the acceptance of the aggressor’s will as the end.⁵⁴ Third, the act must be political.⁵⁵ As Clausewitz famously said, “War is a mere continuation of politics by other means.”⁵⁶ While Clausewitz’s framework is simple and concise, there is of course plentiful room to debate the interpretation of each element, and thus whether or ⁴⁸ United Nations, Charter of the United Nations, 1 U.N.T.S.

WHY ARE CYBER ATTACKS AN ISSUE OF INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE?\nThere is little debate that modern states increasingly rely on both global and domestic information structures.58 Information gathering and the disruption of communication channels have always been tools of war, and arguably, the destruction of an enemy’s communication networks could reap greater benefits for an aggressor than the destruction of weapons arsenals or supply chains.59 The more heavily a nation state relies on the Internet, especially for military and governmental infrastructures, the more tempting it becomes for states in conflict to exploit those vulnerabilities through cyber attacks.60 Perhaps the most compelling and confusing reason cyber attacks are of international concern is in the nature of how information is sent over the Internet; that is to say that when a computer sends information over the Internet that information is divided into “packets,” and those packets adopt their routes to network congestion, opting for the path of least resistance.61 Since the Internet was specifically designed to send information through the fastest route Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590 possible, the route information takes to get from Computer A to Computer B may be far different from the route between Computers A and B as the crow flies.⁶² ⁶³ This fact, while fabulously convenient for the casual Internet user wanting to check e-mail or moving listings, creates an incredible challenge to one of the most fundamental aspects of international law: territory.⁶⁴ Attribution of cyber attacks is also difficult in light of the nature of the Internet. “[G]iven that the internet is intended to be open and anonymous, the attribution of cyber attacks can be very difficult to achieve and should not be taken lightly,” said David Wu, Subcommittee Chairman of the Committee on Science and Technology’s Subcommittee on Technology and Innovation during a 2010 hearing about cyber attack attribution technology.⁶⁵ A cyber attacker in the domain of cyberspace can “shed ties of citizenship and cross sovereign boundaries without a trace,” cloaked in veritable anonymity.⁶⁶ Though there is the physical presence of hardware in different sovereign states, the information contained in them and the software controlling their servers lacks roots to the physical realm.⁶⁷ ## 1. A Desperate Plea for U.N. Action International law must concern itself with what goes on in cyberspace. Regardless of whether cyberspace is considered an international commons of sorts⁶⁸ or space subject to more traditional notions of sovereignty, the fact of the matter is that international law must attempt ⁶² Ophardt at 24.\n⁶³ “As the crow flies” is an idiom for the shortest distance between two points.\n⁶⁴ Ophardt at 24.\n⁶⁵ Molly Mulrain, *Cyber Attack Attribution Important to Cybersecurity*, *Says Committee* (16 July 2012) ExecutiveGov.com, *available at* http://www.executivegov.com/2010/07/cyber-attack-attribution-important-to-cybersecurity-says-committee.\n⁶⁶ Scott J.

Consider the following: (1) Outer space and the inception of “space law”69 following the launch of Sputnik in 1958;70 (2) The evolution of international maritime law, regulating regions once seen as mysterious, difficult to navigate, and possibly infinite;71 and, (3) The regulation of Antarctica.72 Further, the United Nations is no stranger to new paradigms when it becomes apparent that the area of law at issue is a matter of international concern.73 Cyberspace is certainly an issue of global concern due to its very nature, and is thusly compatible with Article 2 of the United Nations Charter.74 ## C. CICERO ON CYBERSPACE: EXISTING LAW IS SILENT To be quite blunt, international law falls short in terms of securing cyberspace and addressing cyber attacks. To date, there are no treaties in existence dealing directly with cyber Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590 attacks or cyber warfare.75 The United Nations called on nations to “talk to each other,” and “pull back from the threat of cyber war,”76 but such a plea is woefully inadequate at best.\nHowever, as discussed previously, there is plentiful existing international law in various forms dealing with and governing inter alia, the vastness of outer space and the depths of the oceans that could be adapted to address the complexities presented by cyberspace and attacks on and in it.77 Additionally, the commentaries to the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols suggest that “armed conflict” may be considered an expansive term, would could subject cyber attacks to the expansive body of existing international humanitarian law.78 The Tallinn Manual, written by group of experts working with the Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (“CCDCOE”), an institute based in Tallinn, Estonia, specifically contemplates how international law should apply to conflict in cyberspace, keeping in mind the problem that laws of conventional warfare are difficult to apply to such an amorphous space.79\"One of the challenges states face in the cyber environment is that the scope and manner of international law's applicability to cyber operations where in offense or defense has remained unsettled since their advent,\"wrote Michael N. Schmitt, project director and chairman of the International Law Department at the U.S. Naval War College, in the manual's introduction.\"The threshold questions are whether the existing law applies to cyber issues at all, and, if so, how.\"80 However, the Tallinn Manual is not an official document and is instead the summation of opinions of a group of experts acting solely in their personal capacity, and the CCDCOE cautions Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590 readers that it is not meant to reflect NATO doctrine, and nor does it reflect the position of any organization or State represented by observers.⁸¹ While on the one hand, current international law essentially consists of abstinence-only education from the United Nations, on the other hand, there is hardly a shortage of law that could be retrofitted to address those short-comings.\n## III. A PROPOSED DEFINITION AND ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK ### A. DEFINING A CYBER ATTACK: A NARROWLY TAILORED APPROACH Before international law can even remotely begin to address the threat cyber attacks and to prosecute their perpetrators, what a cyber attack is must first be succinctly defined. In an article co-authored with multiple other minds, Oona Hathaway suggested the adoption of a narrow definition of what a cyber attack is, in order to focus attention on the niche cyber warfare fills in the international community: “A cyber-attack consists of any action taken to undermine the functions of a computer network for a political or national security purpose.”⁸² This definition breaks down into easily manageable elements that properly address the specific threat posed by cyber aggression, it echoes Clausewitz’s elemental breakdown of an act of war, and it addresses the intent of the perpetrator called for in The Economist and by Solce. This definition appears to satisfy the vast majority of concerns voiced by scholars on the issue. Implicit in the term “cyber attack” is the idea that the conduct must be active to constitute an attack, whether it is active offensively or defensively.⁸³ Thus, passive conduct like scanning for viruses is filtered out of the definition at the threshold.⁸⁴ ### 1. Any action taken; Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590 ⁸¹ CCDCOE Introduction to The Tallinn Manual, available at https://www.ccdcoe.org/249.html.\n⁸² Oona A. Hathaway, et al., *The Law of Cyber-Attack* 100 CAL. L. REV. 817, 826 (2012).\n⁸³ *Id.* ⁸⁴ *Id.* at fn. 29 Any action can be used as the means with which to carry out a cyber attack.⁸⁵ Thus, cyber warfare could be waged through hacking⁸⁶ or any number of other technological strategies as long as the goal of the attack is to undermine or disrupt a computer network.⁸⁷ The idea of classifying warfare based on the objective of the attack (for example, the objective of a cyber attack is to undermine the functions of a computer network) as opposed to the means (for example, nuclear warfare, chemical warfare, guerilla warfare) is intuitive, logical, and avoids accidental and unnecessary limitations on internet speech⁸⁸, which could be an issue under a means-based classification.⁸⁹ The objective of a cyber attack must be to undermine the function of a computer network; otherwise, the definition encompasses more than it should.⁹⁰ The concept revolves around some kind of compromise or disruption of a computer system instead of simply the use of a computer system in a security breach or an information leak.⁹¹ Note that passive observance of activity or copying of information, no matter how illicit, is not enough to constitute a cyber attack or an act of cyber warfare, thus eliminating some of the aforementioned cyber crimes from the definition, and leaving them to each individual state to deal with domestically.⁹² ⁸⁵ Id. at 826.\n⁸⁶ Hacking is a general term for finding weaknesses in a computer or network and exploiting them.\n⁸⁷ Hathaway at 826.\n⁸⁸ Louis Charbonneau, Iran rejects UN criticism of its cyber security rules (25 Oct. 2012) Reuters, available at http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/25/net-us-iran-security-un-idUSBRE89O19420121025 (“In his latest report, U.N. special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Iran, Ahmed Shaheed, said he was concerned about reports of government activities ‘that seemingly infringe on freedom of expression and the right to information.’”) ⁸⁹ Hathaway at 827.\n⁹⁰ Id. at 828.\n⁹¹ See Hathaway at 829 for a further discussion.\n⁹² Id.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590 At the most basic level, a computer network is a collection of computers connected to each other to facilitate the sharing of information and resources.93 While a common connection exists over the Internet, there is also an array of closed networks, like those used by various government agencies.94 Further, the prevalence of computers is crucial to striking at the core of the issue with cyber attacks and cyber warfare: Computers control elevators, stoplights, regulate water pressure, the power grid, etc.95 Thus it bears repeating: The potential for damage from cyber warfare increases as quickly as society's reliance on computer-driven technology.96 ## 4. For a political or national security purpose.\nActions driven by national security or political purposes properly distinguish cyber attacks from ordinary crime.97 A cyber malfeasance that is not carried out for political or national security purposes, such as Internet fraud, identity theft, piracy, etc., while perhaps interesting for examination for questions of, inter alia, international jurisdiction, is, as previously mentioned, a cyber crime best left to the domain of each individual state to regulate.98 Thus, the definition of cyber warfare is limited by focusing on the purpose of the action as opposed to the intent of the actor to best address the vast ramifications of cyber attacks without limiting possible actors to state actors, only.99 ## B. THE NEXT STEP: APPLYING THE DEFINITION TO INSTANCES OF CYBER ATTACKS ### 1. Stuxnet Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590 Stuxnet is a type of malware called a “worm,” which is a computer program that replicates itself to spread to other computers, usually using a network to spread itself.¹⁰⁰ The worm does not need to attach itself to an existing program on any of the computers, like other kinds of malware like a computer virus¹⁰¹ does. Typically a person installs a worm by inadvertently opening an email attachment or message that contains executable scripts.¹⁰² According to Symantec, Stuxnet infected Windows in its search for industrial control systems, which, in short, can be used to control the automation of industrial processes.¹⁰³ Thus, Stuxnet could potentially control or alter how such a system operates.¹⁰⁴ More specifically, Stuxnet included a special payload designed to target Siemens systems that were configured to control and monitor specific industrial processes, and different variants of the worm targeted organizations mainly in Iran between June 2009 and April 2010.¹⁰⁵ Initial analysis revealed Stuxnet was likely written by a state to target Iran’s growing nuclear program, including uranium enrichment centrifuges at the Natanz facility in Iran.¹⁰⁶ Iranian officials admitted the worm infected staff computers but denied any major delays to the nuclear power program.¹⁰⁷ ¹⁰⁰ Bradley Mitchell, *Worm – Computer Worm* (last accessed on 19 Nov. 2012) About.com, *available at* http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/worldwideweb/g/bldef_worm.htm.

If the allegations set forth in the New York Times were true, and Stuxnet made its way to Iran at the hands of the United States, then does Stuxnet fit within the definition of a cyber attack? Absolutely. An offensive action was taken. It was certainly intended to undermine the function of a computer network; as it was intended to undermine the capabilities of the computer networks used to run Iran’s nuclear facilities. Presuming the United States was behind the attack, the objective was at the least political,¹¹¹, if it was not also perhaps an attempt to fortify national security. Given the historically cloudy relations between the United States and Iran,¹¹² if Iran was developing nuclear weapons as opposed to harnessing nuclear power, then it is certainly logical to consider nuclear weapons in the hands of Iranians a threat to national security in the United ¹⁰⁸ David E. Sanger, Obama Order Sped Up Wave of Cyber Attacks Against Iran, THE NEW YORK TIMES, June 1, 2012, available at http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/world/middleeast/obama-ordered-wave-of-cyberattacks-against-iran.html ¹⁰⁹ Id.\n¹¹⁰ Id.\n¹¹¹ Recall the prevalence of Iran in the 2012 Presidential Debates.

Thus, under the proposed definition, Stuxnet is a clear example of what should be encompassed by were international law to adopt this definition of a cyber attack.\n## 2. Operation Shady RAT Operation Shady RAT perhaps better illustrates the challenges international law must face when dealing with cyber attacks. News reports and journal articles fall short of articulating what exactly happened in Operation Shady RAT, but a report issued by McAfee, the IT security firm giant who unearthed the attacks,¹¹³ revealed the following: (1) It is widely believed that there was one “state actor” behind the attacks, but McAfee declined to name it;¹¹⁴ (2) The attacks, named partially for a common acronym in the IT industry that stands for “remote access tool,”¹¹⁵ compromised no less than 71 identified parties, with more parties present in the activity logs where sufficient information was unavailable to accurately identify them;¹¹⁶ (3) The attacks lasted over five years;¹¹⁷ and, (4) Nobody knows what happened to the stolen data.¹¹⁸ Dmitri Alperovitch, Vice President of Threat Research at McAfee, discussed the breadth of the attacks in a report issued through McAfee: After painstaking analysis of the logs, even we were surprised by the enormous diversity of the victim organizations and were taken aback by the audacity of the perpetrators. Although we will refrain from explicitly identifying most of the victims, describing only their general industry, we feel that naming names is warranted in certain cases, not with the goal of attracting attention to a specific victim organization, but to reinforce the fact that virtually everyone is falling prey to these intrusions, regardless of whether they are ¹¹³ Jim Finkle, “State Actor” behind slew of cyber attacks (3 Aug. 2011) REUTERS, available at http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/03/us-cyberattacks-idUSTRE7720HU20110803.\n¹¹⁴ See Finkle (Several other security experts said the evidence points to China).\n¹¹⁵ Roger Grimes, Danger: Remote Access Trojans (Sept. 2002) Security Administrator, available at http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd632947.aspx(“A remote access tool (RAT) is a piece of software that allows a remote\"operator\"to control a system as if he has physical access to that system.”)\n¹¹⁶ Dmitri Alperovitch, Revealed: Operation Shady RAT McAfee, 3-4 (2011) available at http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-operation-shady-rat.pdf.\n¹¹⁷ Daniel Emery, Governments, IOC and UN hit by massive cyber-attack (3 Aug. 2011) BBC NEWS, available at http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14387559.\n¹¹⁸ See Finkle.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590 the United Nations, a multinational Fortune 100 company, a small, non-profit think tank, a national Olympic team, or even an unfortunate computer security firm.¹¹⁹ The identity of the state actor behind the attacks was widely assumed to be China, however, Beijing proclaimed the accusations were “groundless.”¹²⁰ Frankly, whether China was behind the attack or not matters little when determining where Operation Shady RAT falls in regards to Hathaway’s cyber attack definition.\nThere is little doubt there was an action of some sort; even though research fails to really identify what the action was. It seems almost like the international cyber law version of *res ipsa loquitor*,¹²¹ a doctrine sounding in tort theory where the nature of an outcome speaks for itself and negligence¹²² may be inferred even absent of direct evidence of how the aggressor behaved.\nBut, was the attack intended to undermine the function of a computer network? The analysis becomes more convoluted because it seems the attack was intended to purloin information and not specifically to undermine the function of a computer network. Thus, Hathaway’s definition may very well exclude things like Operation Shady RAT from the definition of what a cyber attack is. Is that the correct outcome? It would certainly seem so given the lack of information that would be needed to come to any other conclusions. Were the definition widened it would defeat the entire purpose of the narrow tailoring of each element to comply with the plethora of concerns voiced by numerous scholars in the field.\nWould that analysis change if it was discovered Operation Shady RAT was politically motivated? Perhaps so, however, since no party has come forward with what happened to the ¹¹⁹ Alperovitch at 3.\n¹²⁰ See Emery.\n¹²¹ Byrne v. Boadle, 2 Hurl. &amp; Colt. 722, 159 Eng. Rep. 299 (1863) (Establishing that tort elements of duty of care and breach can be sometimes inferred from the very nature of an accident or other outcome, even without direct evidence of how any defendant behaved).\n¹²² For the sake of clarity, this is by no means meant to suggest that cyber attacks could be committed negligently; the requirement of the objective is crucial.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2351590 information taken in Operation Shady RAT and what it was used for, any analysis here is purely speculative. Absent any further details, Operation Shady RAT simply is not what international law needs to spend time guarding against in the same way it does attacks similar to Stuxnet.\nFurther, the general purpose of public international law should not be forgotten, and that is that it serves as the framework for the practice of stable and organized international relations and stands in contrast to the remedial nature of dispute resolution commonly seen in civil domestic law.¹²³ Thus, while Operation Shady RAT may fall short of the suggested definition of a cyber attack, that is not to say domestic law would be incapable of restoring the parties if more information about the incident were available.\n## IV. Conclusion In sum, the international legal community not only should task itself with drafting the Law of the Horse, but should also welcome the challenge. While Lessig may be more correct in his analogy of the current technological landscape than Easterbrook is wrong, that does not mean that the ideas of both men cannot be reconciled. There is no reason not to take the existing international public law concerning the seas or outer space and use that as a platform on which international law could evolve and improve. There is no reason to re-invent the wheel when there is plenty of law in existence that could be tailored to fit the unique needs required by this nebulous\"thing\"called cyberspace.\nThe potential for damage from cyber attacks increases as quickly as society's reliance on computer-driven technology.¹²⁴ It would do the globe a gross disservice to ignore the possible harm cyber attacks could cause, and to risk cyber security on an international level by failing to address a looming threat to the infrastructure of a vast number of states.
