Western populations are being asked to trust the word of intelligence agencies and world leaders that these unspecified emerging technological threats are real. The often-classified nature of a potential or emerging technological threat results in governments not being able to provide the public with an evidence base for threat attribution, and, even if such evidence were released to the public, how would they even begin to understand the origins of deleterious and malicious code? The challenges around cyber threat evidence create a situation for the public where government threat attribution discourse must be trusted (or not) by those receiving it.¹ Schluzke (2018, p. 954) recently argued that this form of cyber attribution creates an uncertainty in the mind of the public and that, given state knowledge is necessarily classified in this domain, care needs to be taken by cyber policy makers when crafting language around cyber-attacks. This chapter will argue that the threat potential posed by emerging technologies produces trust and confidence issues for Western populations, (Henschke &amp; Brandt Ford, 2017, p. 82) as the public is asked to trust and have confidence that a government’s particular technological threat attribution claim is accurate, and that robust classified evidence for this attribution exists and it is not being used selectively.\n\nIn recent years, narrative, counter narrative, spin, classified material, and “fake news” have politicized intelligence and cybersecurity discourse in such a way, that official security discourse is potentially contestable. Consequently, it is sensible for the public to ask: Whose security claim should be trusted and why? Likewise, given that there can be skepticism around this discourse, it seems a critical social responsibility for security policy makers and academia to first acknowledge this conundrum and then strive to develop frameworks to better understand the trust and confidence challenges around technological threat attribution.\n\nThe task of academia is to undertake constructive criticism by highlighting the nature of an issue of concern and then concluding by suggesting possible solutions. In a volume devoted to emerging technologies, a broader phenomenon has emerged where issues of trust and the potential for deception that results from new technology",

The age-old balance between human liberty and security is being continually addressed in response to the evolving technologies of attack and defense that are occurring globally across the cyber realm.\n\nThe chapter begins by outlining the recent Five Eyes (USA, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) condemnations of Russian and North Korean cyber policy as a sociological case study to illustrate where and if a technological threat attribution and trust and confidence challenge might be evident. Focus is given to the recent WannaCry (2017) and NotPetya (2017) cyber-attacks that have been attributed to these nations. This case study of the Five Eyes condemnation is used to sketch out how the contestability of national security strategy and government security discourse can present specific trust and confidence challenges around national security discourse for both the public and the government. To illustrate the challenges surrounding contemporary issues of technological threat attribution, it focuses on the smallest member of the Five Eyes alliance, the nation of New Zealand. The case study will compare and contrast the language of the government executive and that of the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) when they attributed these two attacks to North Korea (WannaCry) and Russia (NotPetya).\n\nThis attribution discussion then returns to the broader context where, especially after the accusations of Edward Snowden, trust and confidence in the security actions and motives of the Five Eyes intelligence partners have been questioned. The chapter argues that trust and confidence challenges around the political nature of the Five Eyes cyber attribution is potentially exacerbated by two factors: That the invisible nature of the cyber realm can only be communicated by metaphor. This naturally leads to conflict-laden hyperbole that creates notions of cyber war and cyber threat that may not be helpful for thinking about the intentionally deployed deleterious and malicious effects of code (Lawson, 2012)That the development of the notion of fake news accusations (and other such accusations) brings into question the trustworthiness of the discourse of national security agencies\n\nLastly, the purpose of the chapter's conclusion is to move the content and goals of the chapter beyond simple problem definition to the initiation of a discussion of potential solutions to technological threat attribution, trust and confidence issues, and the contestability of national security policy when it comes to cyber attribution.\n\nWe now turn to review two recent global cyber-attacks, which the Five Eyes nations have publicly stated as deeply influencing their extant national security decision-making -- especially around cybersecurity.\n\n## The WannaCry and NotPetya cyber-attacks and the Five Eyes attributions\n\nThe Five Eyes intelligence sharing network's condemnation of North Korea and Russian cyber policy concentrated on the threat and damage caused by WannaCry",

Together these two attacks represent the two most costly cyber-attacks that the world has experienced to date (Snow, 2018).\n\nWannaCry was a ransomware crypto-worm that, in May 2017, attacked computers using the Windows operating platform (Martin et al, 2018, p. 361). It utilized the Eternal Blue exploit developed by the NSA, which had been stolen by the organization or state that used it for this attack. Once loaded onto the platform, it would encrypt data and then demand payment in bitcoin to release the data. Europol (BBC News, 2017) claimed that it had infected some 75,000 computers across 99 countries within a day, including 48 UK National Health Service (NHS) trusts, leaving doctors unable to retrieve patient information (Martin et al, 2018, p. 361). Ultimately, Kaspersky Lab analysis noted that the attack affected some 200,000 computers across 150 countries (Snow, 2018) with much of this occurring within 24 hours (Jones, 2017). Microsoft was able to respond quickly to the attack by deploying emergency patches that prevented the crypto-worm's spread. Nevertheless, variants of WannaCry were still emerging in 2018, hitting Boeing (Mathews, 2018) in May and Taiwanese Apple chipmaker TSMC in August (Leswing, 2018).\n\nWhat was unprecedented about the WannaCry attack was its indiscriminate global scale and its rapid spread, as well as its payload's ability to disrupt essential services and business. The cost of the disruption caused by the attack is significant, estimated at being between four and eight billion US dollars (Snow, 2018). Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, stated that a global technological problem was emerging where governments were stockpiling cyber weapons that, if stolen, as in the case of Eternal Blue, create the potential for indiscriminate attacks like this to occur (Smith, 2017). He went on to argue that:\n\n> The governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call. They need to take a different approach and adhere in cyberspace to the same rules applied to weapons in the physical world. We need governments to consider the damage to civilians that comes from hoarding these vulnerabilities and the use of these exploits.\n>\n> (Smith, 2017)\n\nThe immense scale of the attack and the possibilities for further attack that WannaCry augured, indicated that globally a shift was required to address the perpetrators of such attacks.\n\nAttribution for WannaCry was formally announced by the White House in December 2017 (Bossert, 2017). USA Homeland Security advisor, Tom Bossert, stated that:\n\n> After careful investigation, the United States is publicly attributing the massive WannaCry cyberattack to North Korea. We do not make this allegation lightly. We do so with evidence, and we do so with partners. Other governments and private companies agree. The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada,",

Microsoft traced the attack to cyber affiliates of the North Korean government, and others in the security community have contributed their analysis. (Bossert 2017, p. 1) ”\n\nUsefully, here we see that commercial attributions for these attacks also exist to support government attributions. The global or, more specifically, US-led Five Eyes attribution for the WannaCry cyber-attack was made against North Korea, and here there was a stated (classified/private) evidence base for the attribution. During the question portion of the briefing, Bossert was asked about the evidence basis for the attribution and he stated: “We took a lot of time to look through classified, sensitive information. What we did was rely on -- and some of it I can't share, unfortunately -- technical links to previously identified North Korean cyber tools, tradecraft, operational infrastructure. We had to examine a lot. And we had to put it together in a way that allowed us to make a confident attribution. (Bossert, 2017) ”\n\nAbove, we see Bossert assert that the US developed and shared its analysis with its partners, and on that evidence, made their attribution of the origin of WannaCry to North Korea. The often-classified nature of the potential or actual emerging technological threat results in governments not being able to provide the public with the evidence for cyber threat attribution.\n\n### NotPetya\n\nClosely following the WannaCry cyber-attack, the NotPetya cyber-attack occurred on June 27, 2017. Kaspersky Lab reported infections in France, Germany, Italy, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, but the majority of infections were occurring in Russia and the Ukraine where more than 80 companies were attacked (Snow, 2017). It mainly targeted businesses as one of the initial propagation vectors was through the financial software MeDoc (Snow, 2018). Kaspersky Lab argued NotPetya was the costliest cyber-attack the world has seen with its deleterious effects reaching some ten billion US dollars (Snow, 2018).\n\nNotPetya was a variation of the 2016 Petya software, which was originally an e-mail-spread ransomware that encrypted hard drives and asked for payment (Snow, 2017, p. 1). However, Kaspersky Lab was quick to state that this attack was from a separate malware family, and utilized the Eternal Blue windows exploit (Robot, 2017, p. 1). Where NotPetya was radically different was that it masqueraded as ransomware but was, in fact, what is known as a “wiper” that permanently deleted material on a computer's hard drive (Robot, 2017). Moreover, it particularly affected businesses in Ukraine, with some 75% of incidents reported in that nation. It then spread globally to the business partners of those initially affected,",

Where WannaCry was global and relatively indiscriminate ransomware, NotPetya was a disguised, targeted attack on a particular nation-state's financial infrastructure.\n\nIn January 2018, the Washington Post stated that the CIA had attributed the NotPetya attack to Russian military hackers (Nakashima, 2018). Reportedly, its sources claimed “The GRU military spy agency created NotPetya, the CIA concluded with ‘high confidence' in November, according to classified reports cited by USA intelligence officials” (Nakashima, 2018). On February 15, 2018, the White House released a brief press statement that attributed NotPetya to the Russian military:\n\n> In June 2017, the Russian military launched the most destructive and costly cyber-attack in history... The attack, dubbed “NotPetya”, quickly spread worldwide, causing billions of dollars in damage across Europe, Asia, and the Americas. It was part of the Kremlin's ongoing effort to destabilize Ukraine and demonstrates ever more clearly Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict. This was also a reckless and indiscriminate cyber-attack that will be met with international consequences.\n>\n> (Statement from the Press Secretary, 2018)\n\nBy late February 2018, the NotPetya attack had been attributed by all Five Eyes nations as originating in Russia (Bussoletti, 2018). United Kingdom Foreign Office minister Lord Tariq Ahmad attributed the NotPetya cyber-attack to the Russian government, stating “The UK Government judges that the Russian Government, specifically the Russian military, was responsible for the destructive NotPetya cyber-attack of June 2017” (Foreign Office Minister condemns Russia, 2018). The rationale for this attribution was: “The decision to publicly attribute this incident underlines the fact that the UK and its allies will not tolerate malicious cyber activity” (Foreign Office Minister condemns Russia, 2018). Clear attribution for the attacks was leveled at the Russian military from across the Five Eyes nations, but, again, it is difficult to discern how and where evidence for this attribution arose and was then shared between these nations.\n\n### The April 2018 Five Eyes head of state cybersecurity meeting\n\nThe Five Eyes condemnation of the Russian cyber-attack occurred on April 18, 2018, when four heads of state (Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and New Zealand) met at the United Kingdom's National Cyber Centre (Waldie, 2018). The meeting publicly attributed the NotPetya Ukraine cyber-attack to Russia. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made the claim that Russia has been “using cyberwarfare as part of a wider effort to attack and undermine the international system” (ibid). In this meeting, British Prime Minister Theresa May described the Five Eyes alliance as “a unique security and intelligence-sharing partnership” that “has done much to protect our people from a range of threats”",

And we should be in no doubt that such cyberwarfare is one of the great challenges of our time” (ibid). Five Eyes's attribution discourse was universal in its condemnation. Another dimension to the trust challenges that the chapter has already outlined is that, in this example for both the Five Eyes governments and their populations, the attribution was denied by Russia (Marsh, 2018). Consequently, without presentation of the shared evidence, the cyber-attack attribution became contested, effectively creating a he-said/she-said situation between the various parties linked to ongoing great power competition.\n\n### The New Zealand attribution\n\nThe New Zealand government attributed both the WannaCry and NotPetya cyberattacks to Russia and North Korea in line with their Five Eyes partners. However, I have not found a New Zealand government source stating that the nation has seen shared ‘classified evidence' for these threat attributions. Official releases from the GSCB, in terms of both WannaCry (Government Communications Services Bureau, 2017b) and NotPetya (Government Communications Services Bureau, 2018), simply state the agency supports their international partners' condemnation. As we can see from Tom Bossert's statement above, he stated that attribution evidence for WannaCry was shared with its Five Eyes partners, specifically naming New Zealand. This means that the public must trust the government's discourse, and it is not clear whether its representatives have seen their partner's evidence of attribution or are simply repeating the attribution. We have to trust (or not) that they have seen evidence. To contextualize the New Zealand support, these attributions coincided with a significant 2018 government focus on cybersecurity as a key threat in the national security threat landscape (Little, 2018, p. 33).\n\nThe 2018 Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC) Cyber Security Strategy Refresh stated that “New Zealand recognizes that the relevance of cybersecurity concerns now extends across multiple branches of government” (Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, 2018a, p. 6). The primary responsibility for cybersecurity is given to the Government Communications Security Bureau, which delivers signals intelligence. A close look at the government's cyber discourse in 2018 shows a discourse had emerged across the national security sector where a cyber technological threat was being attributed to Russia and North Korea. This threat attribution discourse is usually accompanied by an argument that New Zealand is not immune from this threat, and that additional cyber infrastructure development is required. For example, in February 2018, Andrew Hampton, the director general of the GCSB (Government Communications Security Bureau, 2018), stated, “In terms of cyber threats, the GCSB noted a 15% increase in serious incidents affecting New Zealand in the year to June 2017”, and that “The GCSB's international partners have today attributed the NotPetya cyber-attack to the Russian Government”. Here we see that the attribution for NotPetya is sourced from Five Eyes partners, and it is not made clear whether the",

It targeted Ukraine but had a global impact -- including affecting supply chains in New Zealand. In December, New Zealand also expressed concern about international reports which link North Korea to the major WannaCry ransomware campaign.\n>\n> (Little, 2018, p. 33)\n\nA similar type of attribution claim can also be found in the July 2018 Ministry of Defense Strategic Defence Policy Statement which states that:\n\n> Physical distance is no protection in cyberspace, and New Zealand is subject to a growing cyber threat from state sponsored and other malicious actors... Cyber blurs boundaries between conflict and peace, and public and private. (...)\n>\n> Russian ‘active measures' in the 2016 United States Presidential election brought to light ‘cyber enabled information warfare' as a disrupter in liberal democracies. (...)\n>\n> North Korea has a substantial store of chemical and biological weapons, a significant cyber capability (which it has shown a willingness to use).\n>\n> (Ministry of Defence, 2018, pp. 18--21)\n\nAcross these three examples, and more recently in the 2019 New Zealand cyber-security strategy (Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, 2019), we clearly see attributions of cyber threat to Russia and North Korea. We also see in all these examples that the threat attribution for cyber-attacks occurring across nation-states is linked explicitly to a governmental claim that there is a growing cyber threat environment impacting adversely on New Zealand's national security and, by implication, that there is an increased need for investment in the nation's cyber infrastructure. The implication is that cyber-attacks represent a form of virtual domain of threat that circumvents the nation's geographic isolation and that while it may not be a direct target of any such future attack, both WannaCry and NotPetya demonstrated the ability these attacks have to deliver collateral damage on a global scale. Nevertheless, we still need to better understand what might motivate such a small nation to make explicit attribution claims.\n\n## Cyber threat attribution\n\nCyber attribution is generally understood to be a difficult technical process (Kello, 2013, p. 7; Lin, 2016, p. 75). Commonly, the challenge of attributing a cyber-threat has created problems for nations trying to establish deterrence against",

Myriam Dunn Calvety (2013, p. 105) argued that “The link between cyberspace and national security is often presented as an unquestionable and uncontested ‘truth'. However, there is nothing natural or given about this link: It had to be forged, argued, and accepted in the (security) political process”. She argues that cybersecurity discourse is, in fact, constituted by a variety of authority figures in governments. For Dunn Calvety, the political nature of cyber discourse is further complicated by the fact that the very building blocks of cybersecurity language employ analogies or metaphors to describe and explain the effect of unsolicited changes in code across networks. Similar to a conceptualization of disease as an attack (Sontag, 1978), this metaphorical language of cyber “attack” and “weapons” is potentially distorting and results in a tendency to describe the cyber landscape as unruly, dangerous, or threatening, when, in fact, much of the cyber environment is benign and intended to be enabling.\n\nOne consequence of the political construction of cyber discourse is that there are real risks when it comes to generating accurate attribution claims. Thomas Rid and Ben Buchanan (2015, p. 4) argue, “Doing attribution well is at the core of virtually all forms of coercion and deterrence, international and domestic. Doing it poorly undermines a state's credibility, its effectiveness, and ultimately it's liberty and security”. When it comes to cybersecurity, the attribution debate is evolving surprisingly slowly, and this slowness remains the case today (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 19). Rid and Buchanan (2015, p. 4) provide a detailed technical account of the attribution process, where they conclude that developing the evidence for cyberattack attribution is a difficult and costly process which inevitably only indicates the likely source of an attack. Moreover, this evidence cannot easily determine motive or the political gain that may have initially motivated an attack. They conclude with the finding that attribution is what states make of it, and public attribution is a political act used by states to legitimate security positioning. If we are to follow Rid and Buchanan's logic, we could understand the Five Eyes attribution of cyber threat to Russia and North Korea as a broader function of what is at stake politically in terms of the broader relations between these nations.\n\nIn the New Zealand case study, the combination of technical evidence challenges and political nature of attribution claims is made explicit when we look closely at the GCSB's National Cyber Security Centre Annual report, where it states:\n\n> Publicly reporting attribution is a significant [political] decision and is not made by the NCSC alone. Public attribution is one way to reduce the efficacy of malicious cyber actors by revealing their tools or increasing the reputational costs of illegitimate activity. However, it also carries risk for New Zealand and is considered alongside our other national objectives, including the need to maintain our ability to protect the networks that are of importance...\n>\n> (Government Communications Service Bureau, 2017a, p. 12)",

            "markdown": "Given that there is academic and local technical agreement that cyber threat attribution is ultimately a political act, why might this government be making these threat attribution claims -- why now and what might be the risks inherent in this attribution?\n\nThere are three possible explanations for this attribution. Firstly, there is a clear discussion in other sections of these documents that New Zealand is part of the Five Eyes network and is speaking in solidarity with its partners to increase the reputational costs of these activities. The challenge here is that when there is no unclassified evidence to support these attribution claims (there was commercial evidence for WannaCry but none for NotPetya), the public must trust the veracity and motives of these partners, and they must trust that their politicians are maintaining an independent policy stance. For example, Reuben Steff's chapter in this volume (Chapter 3) explains that small states are traditionally considered to be “consumers” of security technology supplied by larger states, given they often cannot develop it on their own. This means that it is necessary for New Zealand to align itself with the US on key technological security issues, and the case suggested here is that this could extend to technological threat attribution too, in order to secure its relations to the US and maintain access to critical technology advances and supply. If this is the case, it fuels critical questions about the independence of the nation's foreign affairs policy (Small, 2018, p. 1), which, if undermined, would be a potential blow to public trust.\n\nA second explanation is sourced from DPMC's National Cyber Policy Office release of April 20, 2018, which takes the form of a letter written by the Right Honorable Claire Curran, then-minister of Broadcasting, Communication, and Digital Media. The topic of the letter is the Refresh of New Zealand's Cyber Security Strategy and Action Plan which resulted in 2019 Cybersecurity Strategy.\n\nClaire Curran stated:\n\n> The clear trend is an upward trajectory of cyber security threats... New Zealand's geographical location does not exempt us from this threat... We will need to consider the mechanisms available to us to dissuade or deter malicious cyber activities, particularly where it is state-sponsored, or state condoned. This includes the option of publicly attributing malicious cyber activity as a way of holding states to account.\n>\n> (Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, 2018b, p. 4, p. 9)\n\nClearly, in the above document, the government has made an active political decision to publicly attribute what it describes as malicious cyber activity to particular nation-states as part of “expanding its international cyber efforts” (ibid). The challenge is that the source and reliability of classified evidence for the threat and the rationale for public attribution are unable to be made transparent, and the public is being represented by this claim. Here, the public is asked to trust that the correct decisions and attributions are being made as part of being a good international citizen and that the government is not being selective in who it calls to account.",

Securitization theory suggests that when a threat is identified and a “speech act” identifying it is utilized, this discourse prioritizes the threat on the political agenda in such a way that it necessitates the development of urgent mitigation measures that could potentially extend even to the encroachment of privacy, the need for secrecy, and the utilization of force (Kassab, 2014, p. 65). For the Copenhagen school, securitization speech acts emphasize the dangers of the cyber threat environment and legitimate additional government funding for the construction of various infrastructures designed to protect the public from the threat. The challenge here, again, is that the speech acts have the power for change, not any classified evidential basis that may sit behind the act. When it comes to cyber threats, the public has no choice but to trust that those who are making the speech act are fully informed by subject matter experts and are making the best national security decisions possible.\n\nTaken together, these explanations suggest that the various 2018--2019 New Zealand Cybersecurity attribution speech acts appear designed to: Align New Zealand closer to its Five Eyes partnersCall out certain acts of cyber aggression where New Zealand can then position itself as a good international cyber citizenBe used as a mechanism to dissuade or deter malicious cyber activity by publicly attributing the activity to hold states to accountCreate, justify, and legitimate the development of additional domestic cybersecurity infrastructure\n\nTogether, these four purposes suggest that the attributions are being utilized for both international and domestic positioning in terms of alignment with our partners, being a good international citizen, and creating global and domestic cyber infrastructures to further New Zealand's interests and safety.\n\n## Public trust and national security discourse\n\nIn a civil society environment where the evidence for attribution is unavailable and the integrity of state institutions such as the GSCB (Rogers 2015, 46) or the Minister for Broadcasting's judgement has recently been called into doubt (Edwards, 2018), it is possible that future trust and confidence issues may arise around the efficacy of this language and the effectiveness of current government cyber initiatives. In 2015 and 2016, similar trust and confidence issues occurred in the justification of counter terrorism funding (Key, 2014), where evidence of a domestic Muslim radicalization threat has never eventuated and the claim of the “Jihadi bride” risk was found by the media to have little evidentiary basis and to have been exaggerated (Vance, 2015) and shifted attention away from the right wing. It is clear that, at least within the New Zealand Fourth Estate (News",

Serious issues around trust in government security discourse and action resulted in recent wholesale reform of the New Zealand intelligence agency legislation with the creation of the Intelligence and Security Act 2017 governing the NZSIS and GSCB (Rogers, 2018, p. 657). Further destabilization of public trust in security agencies is also evident with ongoing “inquiries” into the New Zealand Defence Force's actions in Afghanistan (Operation Burnham Inquiry 2020) and the Christchurch Terror attacks (Christchurch Attack Royal Commission 2020), where the integrity of national security apparatus and discourse has been brought into contention by investigative journalists (Hagar & Stephenson, 2018), expert commentators, or community groups (Ainge Roy, 2019), creating a situation where it is impossible to know whose claim is trustworthy (Hoverd, 2019, p. 17). All the national security organizations (NZDF, GCSB, DPMC, and NZSIS) under investigation in these two inquiries are the same agencies producing the cybersecurity attributions. While clear distinctions need to be made between these individual one-off events and the general effectiveness of these agencies' everyday business and their successful operations, these examples show that they are regularly and recently seen by the public to have their integrity brought into doubt.\n\nThese types of one-off trust challenges to national security agency integrity are also seen at the international level. In 2013, WikiLeaks released an electronic dispersal of NSA classified material of some 1.7 million documents that had been leaked by Edward Snowden. These documents suggested strongly that the NSA, and perhaps also its Five Eyes partners, were engaged in regular global surveillance of their domestic populations (Verbal, 2014, p. 14). Again, it was impossible to know the truth of this claim based on open-source information, but part of the multifaceted collateral damage caused by this leak is a tarnishing of the reputation of the Five Eyes's agencies within their own populations where trust and confidence in those intelligence agencies is diminished in the eyes of the public.\n\nIn 2016, an additional social media technological challenge emerged for government discourse by the name of fake news (Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017, p. 211). Social media allows content to be passed between providers with no verification of its authenticity (ibid). Morgan (2018, p. 39) asserts that this verification problem allows disinformation and what is described as fake news to manipulate the public sphere and has the effect of “declining levels of trust in institutions and experts”. There are significant implications for democracy and free speech emerging from this phenomenon. When it comes to intelligence agency claims, the discussion of fake news is particularly pertinent when it comes to the relationship between US President Donald Trump and his intelligence agencies (McCarthy, 2018). Over a number of highly publicized national security issues related to Iran, ISIS, North Korea, and Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election, the president has called the discourse of his intelligence agencies into question. Donald Trump effectively stated that the intelligence agency claims are fake news and that the integrity of their discourse needs to be stringently questioned.",

            "markdown": "Conversely, one must ask why should the public trust Donald Trump, who has a conflict of interest because of investigations into his own actions, over politically neutral actors? Consequently, it is sensible for the public to ask whose security claim should be trusted and why? When it comes to Russian interference in the US election, Thirdway.org data show that the Donald Trump/James Comey counterclaims have created significant confusion about whose security discourse to trust (Eoyang et al, 2018). The broader ramification of such a claim is that all intelligence agency discourse, including that of cyber threat attribution, could be questioned and further magnifies the question over how Five Eyes partners, and their respective public, know who they should trust.\n\nAn essential assumption of my argument is that a problem of trust exists today when it comes to the public receiving national security agency discourse. How does one define trust? In political science, it has been traditionally assumed that “Trust is relational; it involves an individual making herself vulnerable to another individual, group, or institution that has the capacity to do her harm or betray her” (Levi & Stoker, 2000, p. 476). Trust can be understood as dichotomous in that one trusts or one does not, but trust relations can also be a sliding scale of degrees of trust. For example, Western populations give their trust to their national security agencies to be protected from cyber threats (Shulzke, 2018, p. 954). That trust is essential for cyberspace to function and for governance and security of that critical infrastructure (Azmi et al, 2018, p. 258).\n\nHenschke and Ford (2017, p. 82) have argued that since the Snowden releases there has been a breakdown in the public's trust of national security agencies.\n\n> The cost here is in the public's willingness and capacity to trust in state mechanisms of national and international security, especially those intelligence programmes involving cyber-surveillance. The loss of trust in this area is particularly detrimental to the effective functioning of national security.\n>\n> (Henschke & Ford, 2017, p. 82)\n\nFor Henschke and Ford (2017, p. 82), there is a twofold element of trust in the relationship between national security agencies and the public: 1) That surveillance is necessary and 2) that intelligence activities must be kept secret from the public. The challenge of Snowden (and likewise the GCSB's illegal spying on Kim Dotcom) (Rogers, 2015, p. 46) is that the Five Eyes nations were “caught out abusing this trust risk losing the goodwill of the public. If the public's trust in this area is lost and the government is judged as untrustworthy, then effective governing can become more difficult” (Henschke & Ford, 2017, p. 84). Pew data since the Snowdon releases reveal that the American public's approval for surveillance of citizens has declined as has their confidence that their government can protect their private data (Geiger, 2018). Thirdway.org suggests that in relation to contentious national security issues, most Americans did not know whose claim to trust (Eoyang et al, 2018). The poll data are not conclusive in showing a loss of trust in national security discourse, but it certainly demonstrates a public confusion and a lack of implicit unquestioned trust in national security discourse.",

Ultimately, the loss of public trust is counterproductive for effective national security (Poushter & Fetterolf, 2019) because it leads to increasing media scrutiny and hyperbole, which then adversely impacts security agency transparency in terms of comfort levels with communicating to the public and not over classifying internal documentation. Thus, when it comes to making cyber-security policy, Ball et al (2019, p. 103) have argued that “Cybersecurity policymaking at the national level should be attentive to the central role of trust for maintaining resilient cyber systems -- and it should have plans in place to repair trust”. Trust therefore is an essential element of cyber-governance. To create trust with the public, governments must be seen to be active, careful, and deliberate in the policy and infrastructure they create and sustain to keep cyberspace safe, both domestically and globally. All these activities (including attribution) will be more effective if trust has not been reduced by earlier state failings and when/if a government can be transparent.\n\n## Conclusion: Addressing the contestability of attribution discourse\n\nIn this chapter, my intention has been to argue that, when it comes to cyber threat attribution claims made by governments, it is not always clear whose claim to trust or to what extent. There are inherent challenges in cyber threat attribution discourse: a) The evidence for attribution is not publicly verifiable, b) attribution is inherently political, c) the public must choose to trust attribution discourse or not, and d) attribution discourse often comes from institutions whose integrity has been brought into question elsewhere (this decreases trust). Given these concerns, we can say that there is a trust and confidence challenge that must be addressed by governments when it comes to the production of such discourse in the future.\n\nAs a social scientist, I traditionally look for empirical evidence to back a claim; without it, we are, at best, left with circumstantial evidence or, at worst, simply a truth claim. Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that the public do not (and perhaps should not) have access to classified empirical data to make assessments about the efficacy of cybersecurity decisions and discourse (Kello, 2013, p. 7). This creates a grey zone where cyber-attacks and their attributions live in a contested space of discourse between evidence and trust, where maintaining trust in government action is essential. I have demonstrated that attribution claims are inherently political and are contestable by both the accuser and the accused. While the effects of cyber-attacks are very real, communication about their effects and the intentions and motives behind an attack exist in a land of metaphor and discourse. This makes national security discourse around cyber-attacks contestable; a fact that is exacerbated by an inclination across social media, traditional media, and even the president of the US (with his conflict of interest) to question the integrity of these attribution claims. Therefore, a social scientific crisis emerges where, because of the classified nature of the evidence, the public is asked to trust",

Consequently, it is then sensible for the public to ask whose security claim should be believed and why.\n\nIn modern democracies, trust in government is a key indicator of political legitimacy and stability (Marcinkowski & Starke, 2018, p. 87). Key questions for governments and populations are how and when do we trust the national security discourse of our government. A lack of trust inherently undermines and frustrates the positive intent of governments to keep their citizenry safe. In a contemporary environment where the national security discourse of a nation such as New Zealand (not to mention many other states) can be contested, it seems a critical social responsibility for security policy makers and academia to first acknowledge this trust and confidence conundrum and then strive to develop frameworks to better understand the trust and confidence challenges around threat attribution and apply it to this emerging cyber discourse. How to ensure that there is trust and confidence in the government's ability to identify, communicate, and respond to technological national security threats will be essential 21st-century governance questions for democracies.\n\nUnfortunately, civil society cannot be relied upon to meet such a challenge. A civic challenge exists for both government and academia to consider how to best address the inherent weakness (that they are political and contestable) that exists in national security threat attributions. Ideally, probably the most effective manner in which cyber attribution could be separated from the individual interests of nation-states or commercial entities is if some form of international legal attribution agency was formed. However, realistic solutions to the attribution problem must come from individual governments, who should be sufficiently motivated to increase the efficacy of its security apparatus by decreasing potential criticism of its discourse.\n\nThe producers of national security discourse must acknowledge that these weaknesses exist in their discourse and that it is their responsibility to find ways to mitigate these challenges. This is critical because WannaCry and NotPetya have shown us that cyber issues are changing the national security landscape indelibly. While care is required around cyber hyperbole and metaphor, the potential scale, spread, and damage of future attacks could be catastrophic. Governments need to find better ways to effectively communicate with each other, their opponents, and their own populations when it comes to mitigating these challenges.\n\nIt is important to conclude by asking what might be possible solutions to respond to the technological cyber-attack attribution challenge? First, cyber discourse makers must accept that national security discourse justifications that arise from classified sources cannot always provide a persuasive public evidence basis for their assertions. Second, cyber discourse makers should acknowledge that their claims are inherently political and therefore potentially contestable. Such acknowledgment would allow the discourse to be more reflexive and to self-regulate its claims in a more nuanced manner. Nuanced cyber threat discourse lessens the possibility that a government institution or representative will be subsequently called to account for making an incorrect or exaggerated claim.

Cybersecurity strategy refreshes offer a real opportunity to engage with the public. They can focus both on private enterprise and the public. They can offer an education capacity and more transparency around the nature of various cyber threats. One place where a degree of transparency and limited evidence can exist for the actual nature and prevalence of cyber threats is in the annual reports from their National Cyber Security Centers (see Government Communications Security Bureau, 2017a). These carefully constructed and communicated reports and data could and should be more widely distributed, publicized, and utilized as an evidence basis for future claims. And lastly, one additional way to address the confidence challenge and limited trust around secrecy in national security discourse is to regularly craft language that clearly notes that a fine balance exists between secrecy and transparency. This balance relies heavily on building a trusting and transparent relationship between government officials and the public while working to repair any past breaches of confidence.\n\n## Notes\n\n1. The chapter does not claim that cyber-attack attribution evidence is lacking; simply, it argues that government claims about possessing robust attribution evidence must be trusted by the public.\n2. Trustworthiness is based on the ability to understand the process and the evidence presented to you. If one lacks the technical knowledge and/or when there are competing claims around national security, mediated by the Fourth Estate, a great deal of confusion will be at play in the mind of the public. This may mean that cybersecurity discourse, by being difficult to understand and hyperbolic in nature, makes establishing trust in that discourse problematic from the outset.\n3. The Christchurch Call is one example of State/Private Sector policing of social media threat. Bodies such as the United Nations and Interpol, in collaboration with states and private sector, could potentially develop such a complex mechanism.\n4. One place this could occur is in a careful differentiation between the prevalence of cybercrime events and state sponsored cyber-attacks to ensure that the actual prevalence and nature of cybersecurity threats are properly represented.\n\n## References\n\nAinge Roy, E (2019) Christchurch shootings real issues not being heard. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/08/christchurch-shootings-real-issues-not-being-heard-by-inquiry-critics-say, accessed April 13, 2020.\nAllcott, H and Gentzkow, M (2017) ‘Social media and fake news in the 2016 election’, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 31(2), pp. 211–236.\nAzmi, RA, Tibben, W and Than Win, K (2018) ‘Review of cybersecurity frameworks: context and shared concepts’, Journal of Cyber Policy, 3(2), pp. 258–283.\nBall, K, Degli Esposti, S, Dibb, S, Pavone, V and Santiago-Gomez, E (2019) ‘Institutional trustworthiness and national security governance: evidence from six European countries’, Governance, 32(1), pp. 103–121.\nBBC News (2017) Cyber-attack: Europol says it was unprecedented in scale. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39907965, accessed April 13, 2020.",

  "full_text": "# 13 Cyber threat attribution, trust and confidence, and the contestability of national security policy\nWilliam Hoverd\n## Introduction\nToday, we regularly hear that Chinese company Huawei is a source of vulnerability for Western nations, and that North Korea and Russia are sources of cyber threats. Western populations are being asked to trust the word of intelligence agencies and world leaders that these unspecified emerging technological threats are real. The often-classified nature of a potential or emerging technological threat results in governments not being able to provide the public with an evidence base for threat attribution, and, even if such evidence were released to the public, how would they even begin to understand the origins of deleterious and malicious code? The challenges around cyber threat evidence create a situation for the public where government threat attribution discourse must be trusted (or not) by those receiving it.¹ Schluzke (2018, p. 954) recently argued that this form of cyber attribution creates an uncertainty in the mind of the public and that, given state knowledge is necessarily classified in this domain, care needs to be taken by cyber policy makers when crafting language around cyber-attacks. This chapter will argue that the threat potential posed by emerging technologies produces trust and confidence issues for Western populations, (Henschke &amp; Brandt Ford, 2017, p. 82) as the public is asked to trust and have confidence that a government’s particular technological threat attribution claim is accurate, and that robust classified evidence for this attribution exists and it is not being used selectively.\nIn recent years, narrative, counter narrative, spin, classified material, and “fake news” have politicized intelligence and cybersecurity discourse in such a way, that official security discourse is potentially contestable. Consequently, it is sensible for the public to ask: Whose security claim should be trusted and why? Likewise, given that there can be skepticism around this discourse, it seems a critical social responsibility for security policy makers and academia to first acknowledge this conundrum and then strive to develop frameworks to better understand the trust and confidence challenges around technological threat attribution.\nThe task of academia is to undertake constructive criticism by highlighting the nature of an issue of concern and then concluding by suggesting possible solutions. In a volume devoted to emerging technologies, a broader phenomenon has emerged where issues of trust and the potential for deception that results from new technology\nhave significant ramifications for the social contract between the state and the population and how they are both secured. The age-old balance between human liberty and security is being continually addressed in response to the evolving technologies of attack and defense that are occurring globally across the cyber realm.\nThe chapter begins by outlining the recent Five Eyes (USA, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) condemnations of Russian and North Korean cyber policy as a sociological case study to illustrate where and if a technological threat attribution and trust and confidence challenge might be evident. Focus is given to the recent WannaCry (2017) and NotPetya (2017) cyber-attacks that have been attributed to these nations. This case study of the Five Eyes condemnation is used to sketch out how the contestability of national security strategy and government security discourse can present specific trust and confidence challenges around national security discourse for both the public and the government. To illustrate the challenges surrounding contemporary issues of technological threat attribution, it focuses on the smallest member of the Five Eyes alliance, the nation of New Zealand. The case study will compare and contrast the language of the government executive and that of the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) when they attributed these two attacks to North Korea (WannaCry) and Russia (NotPetya).\nThis attribution discussion then returns to the broader context where, especially after the accusations of Edward Snowden, trust and confidence in the security actions and motives of the Five Eyes intelligence partners have been questioned. The chapter argues that trust and confidence challenges around the political nature of the Five Eyes cyber attribution is potentially exacerbated by two factors: That the invisible nature of the cyber realm can only be communicated by metaphor. This naturally leads to conflict-laden hyperbole that creates notions of cyber war and cyber threat that may not be helpful for thinking about the intentionally deployed deleterious and malicious effects of code (Lawson, 2012)That the development of the notion of fake news accusations (and other such accusations) brings into question the trustworthiness of the discourse of national security agencies\nLastly, the purpose of the chapter's conclusion is to move the content and goals of the chapter beyond simple problem definition to the initiation of a discussion of potential solutions to technological threat attribution, trust and confidence issues, and the contestability of national security policy when it comes to cyber attribution.\nWe now turn to review two recent global cyber-attacks, which the Five Eyes nations have publicly stated as deeply influencing their extant national security decision-making -- especially around cybersecurity.\n## The WannaCry and NotPetya cyber-attacks and the Five Eyes attributions\nThe Five Eyes intelligence sharing network's condemnation of North Korea and Russian cyber policy concentrated on the threat and damage caused by WannaCry\n(2017) and NotPetya (2017), two cyber-attacks attributed to these nations, respectively. Together these two attacks represent the two most costly cyber-attacks that the world has experienced to date (Snow, 2018).\nWannaCry was a ransomware crypto-worm that, in May 2017, attacked computers using the Windows operating platform (Martin et al, 2018, p. 361). It utilized the Eternal Blue exploit developed by the NSA, which had been stolen by the organization or state that used it for this attack. Once loaded onto the platform, it would encrypt data and then demand payment in bitcoin to release the data. Europol (BBC News, 2017) claimed that it had infected some 75,000 computers across 99 countries within a day, including 48 UK National Health Service (NHS) trusts, leaving doctors unable to retrieve patient information (Martin et al, 2018, p. 361). Ultimately, Kaspersky Lab analysis noted that the attack affected some 200,000 computers across 150 countries (Snow, 2018) with much of this occurring within 24 hours (Jones, 2017). Microsoft was able to respond quickly to the attack by deploying emergency patches that prevented the crypto-worm's spread. Nevertheless, variants of WannaCry were still emerging in 2018, hitting Boeing (Mathews, 2018) in May and Taiwanese Apple chipmaker TSMC in August (Leswing, 2018).\nWhat was unprecedented about the WannaCry attack was its indiscriminate global scale and its rapid spread, as well as its payload's ability to disrupt essential services and business. The cost of the disruption caused by the attack is significant, estimated at being between four and eight billion US dollars (Snow, 2018). Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, stated that a global technological problem was emerging where governments were stockpiling cyber weapons that, if stolen, as in the case of Eternal Blue, create the potential for indiscriminate attacks like this to occur (Smith, 2017). He went on to argue that:\n> The governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call. They need to take a different approach and adhere in cyberspace to the same rules applied to weapons in the physical world. We need governments to consider the damage to civilians that comes from hoarding these vulnerabilities and the use of these exploits.\n>\n> (Smith, 2017)\nThe immense scale of the attack and the possibilities for further attack that WannaCry augured, indicated that globally a shift was required to address the perpetrators of such attacks.\nAttribution for WannaCry was formally announced by the White House in December 2017 (Bossert, 2017). USA Homeland Security advisor, Tom Bossert, stated that:\n> After careful investigation, the United States is publicly attributing the massive WannaCry cyberattack to North Korea. We do not make this allegation lightly. We do so with evidence, and we do so with partners. Other governments and private companies agree. The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada,\nNew Zealand, and Japan have seen our analysis, and they join us in denouncing North Korea for WannaCry. Commercial partners have also acted. Microsoft traced the attack to cyber affiliates of the North Korean government, and others in the security community have contributed their analysis. (Bossert 2017, p. 1) ”\nUsefully, here we see that commercial attributions for these attacks also exist to support government attributions. The global or, more specifically, US-led Five Eyes attribution for the WannaCry cyber-attack was made against North Korea, and here there was a stated (classified/private) evidence base for the attribution. During the question portion of the briefing, Bossert was asked about the evidence basis for the attribution and he stated: “We took a lot of time to look through classified, sensitive information. What we did was rely on -- and some of it I can't share, unfortunately -- technical links to previously identified North Korean cyber tools, tradecraft, operational infrastructure. We had to examine a lot. And we had to put it together in a way that allowed us to make a confident attribution. (Bossert, 2017) ”\nAbove, we see Bossert assert that the US developed and shared its analysis with its partners, and on that evidence, made their attribution of the origin of WannaCry to North Korea. The often-classified nature of the potential or actual emerging technological threat results in governments not being able to provide the public with the evidence for cyber threat attribution.\n### NotPetya\nClosely following the WannaCry cyber-attack, the NotPetya cyber-attack occurred on June 27, 2017. Kaspersky Lab reported infections in France, Germany, Italy, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, but the majority of infections were occurring in Russia and the Ukraine where more than 80 companies were attacked (Snow, 2017). It mainly targeted businesses as one of the initial propagation vectors was through the financial software MeDoc (Snow, 2018). Kaspersky Lab argued NotPetya was the costliest cyber-attack the world has seen with its deleterious effects reaching some ten billion US dollars (Snow, 2018).\nNotPetya was a variation of the 2016 Petya software, which was originally an e-mail-spread ransomware that encrypted hard drives and asked for payment (Snow, 2017, p. 1). However, Kaspersky Lab was quick to state that this attack was from a separate malware family, and utilized the Eternal Blue windows exploit (Robot, 2017, p. 1). Where NotPetya was radically different was that it masqueraded as ransomware but was, in fact, what is known as a “wiper” that permanently deleted material on a computer's hard drive (Robot, 2017). Moreover, it particularly affected businesses in Ukraine, with some 75% of incidents reported in that nation. It then spread globally to the business partners of those initially affected,\nwith 9% of incidents occurring in Germany, and the Danish shipping company, Maersk, being particularly affected by the attack (Schwartz, 2018). Where WannaCry was global and relatively indiscriminate ransomware, NotPetya was a disguised, targeted attack on a particular nation-state's financial infrastructure.\nIn January 2018, the Washington Post stated that the CIA had attributed the NotPetya attack to Russian military hackers (Nakashima, 2018). Reportedly, its sources claimed “The GRU military spy agency created NotPetya, the CIA concluded with ‘high confidence' in November, according to classified reports cited by USA intelligence officials” (Nakashima, 2018). On February 15, 2018, the White House released a brief press statement that attributed NotPetya to the Russian military:\n> In June 2017, the Russian military launched the most destructive and costly cyber-attack in history... The attack, dubbed “NotPetya”, quickly spread worldwide, causing billions of dollars in damage across Europe, Asia, and the Americas. It was part of the Kremlin's ongoing effort to destabilize Ukraine and demonstrates ever more clearly Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict. This was also a reckless and indiscriminate cyber-attack that will be met with international consequences.\n>\n> (Statement from the Press Secretary, 2018)\nBy late February 2018, the NotPetya attack had been attributed by all Five Eyes nations as originating in Russia (Bussoletti, 2018). United Kingdom Foreign Office minister Lord Tariq Ahmad attributed the NotPetya cyber-attack to the Russian government, stating “The UK Government judges that the Russian Government, specifically the Russian military, was responsible for the destructive NotPetya cyber-attack of June 2017” (Foreign Office Minister condemns Russia, 2018). The rationale for this attribution was: “The decision to publicly attribute this incident underlines the fact that the UK and its allies will not tolerate malicious cyber activity” (Foreign Office Minister condemns Russia, 2018). Clear attribution for the attacks was leveled at the Russian military from across the Five Eyes nations, but, again, it is difficult to discern how and where evidence for this attribution arose and was then shared between these nations.\n### The April 2018 Five Eyes head of state cybersecurity meeting\nThe Five Eyes condemnation of the Russian cyber-attack occurred on April 18, 2018, when four heads of state (Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and New Zealand) met at the United Kingdom's National Cyber Centre (Waldie, 2018). The meeting publicly attributed the NotPetya Ukraine cyber-attack to Russia. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made the claim that Russia has been “using cyberwarfare as part of a wider effort to attack and undermine the international system” (ibid). In this meeting, British Prime Minister Theresa May described the Five Eyes alliance as “a unique security and intelligence-sharing partnership” that “has done much to protect our people from a range of threats”\n(ibid). In particular, with regard to Russian hacking, she added: “I have been clear to Russia that we know what it is doing. And we should be in no doubt that such cyberwarfare is one of the great challenges of our time” (ibid). Five Eyes's attribution discourse was universal in its condemnation. Another dimension to the trust challenges that the chapter has already outlined is that, in this example for both the Five Eyes governments and their populations, the attribution was denied by Russia (Marsh, 2018). Consequently, without presentation of the shared evidence, the cyber-attack attribution became contested, effectively creating a he-said/she-said situation between the various parties linked to ongoing great power competition.\n### The New Zealand attribution\nThe New Zealand government attributed both the WannaCry and NotPetya cyberattacks to Russia and North Korea in line with their Five Eyes partners. However, I have not found a New Zealand government source stating that the nation has seen shared ‘classified evidence' for these threat attributions. Official releases from the GSCB, in terms of both WannaCry (Government Communications Services Bureau, 2017b) and NotPetya (Government Communications Services Bureau, 2018), simply state the agency supports their international partners' condemnation. As we can see from Tom Bossert's statement above, he stated that attribution evidence for WannaCry was shared with its Five Eyes partners, specifically naming New Zealand. This means that the public must trust the government's discourse, and it is not clear whether its representatives have seen their partner's evidence of attribution or are simply repeating the attribution. We have to trust (or not) that they have seen evidence. To contextualize the New Zealand support, these attributions coincided with a significant 2018 government focus on cybersecurity as a key threat in the national security threat landscape (Little, 2018, p. 33).\nThe 2018 Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC) Cyber Security Strategy Refresh stated that “New Zealand recognizes that the relevance of cybersecurity concerns now extends across multiple branches of government” (Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, 2018a, p. 6). The primary responsibility for cybersecurity is given to the Government Communications Security Bureau, which delivers signals intelligence. A close look at the government's cyber discourse in 2018 shows a discourse had emerged across the national security sector where a cyber technological threat was being attributed to Russia and North Korea. This threat attribution discourse is usually accompanied by an argument that New Zealand is not immune from this threat, and that additional cyber infrastructure development is required. For example, in February 2018, Andrew Hampton, the director general of the GCSB (Government Communications Security Bureau, 2018), stated, “In terms of cyber threats, the GCSB noted a 15% increase in serious incidents affecting New Zealand in the year to June 2017”, and that “The GCSB's international partners have today attributed the NotPetya cyber-attack to the Russian Government”. Here we see that the attribution for NotPetya is sourced from Five Eyes partners, and it is not made clear whether the\nstatement was made simply in support of, or after reviewing classified evidence supplied by their partners.\nSimilarly, in the 2018 winter issue of Line of Defence the Right Honorable Andrew Little, Minister Responsible for the GCSB and NZSIS stated:\n> In February, the Government added New Zealand's voice to the international condemnation of the NotPetya cyber-attack which international partners have now attributed to the Russian Government. It targeted Ukraine but had a global impact -- including affecting supply chains in New Zealand. In December, New Zealand also expressed concern about international reports which link North Korea to the major WannaCry ransomware campaign.\n>\n> (Little, 2018, p. 33)\nA similar type of attribution claim can also be found in the July 2018 Ministry of Defense Strategic Defence Policy Statement which states that:\n> Physical distance is no protection in cyberspace, and New Zealand is subject to a growing cyber threat from state sponsored and other malicious actors... Cyber blurs boundaries between conflict and peace, and public and private. (...)\n>\n> Russian ‘active measures' in the 2016 United States Presidential election brought to light ‘cyber enabled information warfare' as a disrupter in liberal democracies. (...)\n>\n> North Korea has a substantial store of chemical and biological weapons, a significant cyber capability (which it has shown a willingness to use).\n>\n> (Ministry of Defence, 2018, pp. 18--21)\nAcross these three examples, and more recently in the 2019 New Zealand cyber-security strategy (Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, 2019), we clearly see attributions of cyber threat to Russia and North Korea. We also see in all these examples that the threat attribution for cyber-attacks occurring across nation-states is linked explicitly to a governmental claim that there is a growing cyber threat environment impacting adversely on New Zealand's national security and, by implication, that there is an increased need for investment in the nation's cyber infrastructure. The implication is that cyber-attacks represent a form of virtual domain of threat that circumvents the nation's geographic isolation and that while it may not be a direct target of any such future attack, both WannaCry and NotPetya demonstrated the ability these attacks have to deliver collateral damage on a global scale. Nevertheless, we still need to better understand what might motivate such a small nation to make explicit attribution claims.\n## Cyber threat attribution\nCyber attribution is generally understood to be a difficult technical process (Kello, 2013, p. 7; Lin, 2016, p. 75). Commonly, the challenge of attributing a cyber-threat has created problems for nations trying to establish deterrence against\nforeign actors (Lupovici, 2016, p. 322; Lindsay, 2015, p. 53). However, it is the political construction of cyber threat attribution in national security that is useful here. Myriam Dunn Calvety (2013, p. 105) argued that “The link between cyberspace and national security is often presented as an unquestionable and uncontested ‘truth'. However, there is nothing natural or given about this link: It had to be forged, argued, and accepted in the (security) political process”. She argues that cybersecurity discourse is, in fact, constituted by a variety of authority figures in governments. For Dunn Calvety, the political nature of cyber discourse is further complicated by the fact that the very building blocks of cybersecurity language employ analogies or metaphors to describe and explain the effect of unsolicited changes in code across networks. Similar to a conceptualization of disease as an attack (Sontag, 1978), this metaphorical language of cyber “attack” and “weapons” is potentially distorting and results in a tendency to describe the cyber landscape as unruly, dangerous, or threatening, when, in fact, much of the cyber environment is benign and intended to be enabling.\nOne consequence of the political construction of cyber discourse is that there are real risks when it comes to generating accurate attribution claims. Thomas Rid and Ben Buchanan (2015, p. 4) argue, “Doing attribution well is at the core of virtually all forms of coercion and deterrence, international and domestic. Doing it poorly undermines a state's credibility, its effectiveness, and ultimately it's liberty and security”. When it comes to cybersecurity, the attribution debate is evolving surprisingly slowly, and this slowness remains the case today (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 19). Rid and Buchanan (2015, p. 4) provide a detailed technical account of the attribution process, where they conclude that developing the evidence for cyberattack attribution is a difficult and costly process which inevitably only indicates the likely source of an attack. Moreover, this evidence cannot easily determine motive or the political gain that may have initially motivated an attack. They conclude with the finding that attribution is what states make of it, and public attribution is a political act used by states to legitimate security positioning. If we are to follow Rid and Buchanan's logic, we could understand the Five Eyes attribution of cyber threat to Russia and North Korea as a broader function of what is at stake politically in terms of the broader relations between these nations.\nIn the New Zealand case study, the combination of technical evidence challenges and political nature of attribution claims is made explicit when we look closely at the GCSB's National Cyber Security Centre Annual report, where it states:\n> Publicly reporting attribution is a significant [political] decision and is not made by the NCSC alone. Public attribution is one way to reduce the efficacy of malicious cyber actors by revealing their tools or increasing the reputational costs of illegitimate activity. However, it also carries risk for New Zealand and is considered alongside our other national objectives, including the need to maintain our ability to protect the networks that are of importance...\n>\n> (Government Communications Service Bureau, 2017a, p. 12)\nGiven that there is academic and local technical agreement that cyber threat attribution is ultimately a political act, why might this government be making these threat attribution claims -- why now and what might be the risks inherent in this attribution?\nThere are three possible explanations for this attribution. Firstly, there is a clear discussion in other sections of these documents that New Zealand is part of the Five Eyes network and is speaking in solidarity with its partners to increase the reputational costs of these activities. The challenge here is that when there is no unclassified evidence to support these attribution claims (there was commercial evidence for WannaCry but none for NotPetya), the public must trust the veracity and motives of these partners, and they must trust that their politicians are maintaining an independent policy stance. For example, Reuben Steff's chapter in this volume (Chapter 3) explains that small states are traditionally considered to be “consumers” of security technology supplied by larger states, given they often cannot develop it on their own. This means that it is necessary for New Zealand to align itself with the US on key technological security issues, and the case suggested here is that this could extend to technological threat attribution too, in order to secure its relations to the US and maintain access to critical technology advances and supply. If this is the case, it fuels critical questions about the independence of the nation's foreign affairs policy (Small, 2018, p. 1), which, if undermined, would be a potential blow to public trust.\nA second explanation is sourced from DPMC's National Cyber Policy Office release of April 20, 2018, which takes the form of a letter written by the Right Honorable Claire Curran, then-minister of Broadcasting, Communication, and Digital Media. The topic of the letter is the Refresh of New Zealand's Cyber Security Strategy and Action Plan which resulted in 2019 Cybersecurity Strategy.\nClaire Curran stated:\n> The clear trend is an upward trajectory of cyber security threats... New Zealand's geographical location does not exempt us from this threat... We will need to consider the mechanisms available to us to dissuade or deter malicious cyber activities, particularly where it is state-sponsored, or state condoned. This includes the option of publicly attributing malicious cyber activity as a way of holding states to account.\n>\n> (Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, 2018b, p. 4, p. 9)\nClearly, in the above document, the government has made an active political decision to publicly attribute what it describes as malicious cyber activity to particular nation-states as part of “expanding its international cyber efforts” (ibid). The challenge is that the source and reliability of classified evidence for the threat and the rationale for public attribution are unable to be made transparent, and the public is being represented by this claim. Here, the public is asked to trust that the correct decisions and attributions are being made as part of being a good international citizen and that the government is not being selective in who it calls to account.\nA third explanation comes from the Copenhagen school, which developed the securitization theory that focuses on “speech acts” and the significance these acts can have upon political agenda settings and political relations (McDonald, 2008, p. 568). Securitization theory suggests that when a threat is identified and a “speech act” identifying it is utilized, this discourse prioritizes the threat on the political agenda in such a way that it necessitates the development of urgent mitigation measures that could potentially extend even to the encroachment of privacy, the need for secrecy, and the utilization of force (Kassab, 2014, p. 65). For the Copenhagen school, securitization speech acts emphasize the dangers of the cyber threat environment and legitimate additional government funding for the construction of various infrastructures designed to protect the public from the threat. The challenge here, again, is that the speech acts have the power for change, not any classified evidential basis that may sit behind the act. When it comes to cyber threats, the public has no choice but to trust that those who are making the speech act are fully informed by subject matter experts and are making the best national security decisions possible.\nTaken together, these explanations suggest that the various 2018--2019 New Zealand Cybersecurity attribution speech acts appear designed to: Align New Zealand closer to its Five Eyes partnersCall out certain acts of cyber aggression where New Zealand can then position itself as a good international cyber citizenBe used as a mechanism to dissuade or deter malicious cyber activity by publicly attributing the activity to hold states to accountCreate, justify, and legitimate the development of additional domestic cybersecurity infrastructure\nTogether, these four purposes suggest that the attributions are being utilized for both international and domestic positioning in terms of alignment with our partners, being a good international citizen, and creating global and domestic cyber infrastructures to further New Zealand's interests and safety.\n## Public trust and national security discourse\nIn a civil society environment where the evidence for attribution is unavailable and the integrity of state institutions such as the GSCB (Rogers 2015, 46) or the Minister for Broadcasting's judgement has recently been called into doubt (Edwards, 2018), it is possible that future trust and confidence issues may arise around the efficacy of this language and the effectiveness of current government cyber initiatives. In 2015 and 2016, similar trust and confidence issues occurred in the justification of counter terrorism funding (Key, 2014), where evidence of a domestic Muslim radicalization threat has never eventuated and the claim of the “Jihadi bride” risk was found by the media to have little evidentiary basis and to have been exaggerated (Vance, 2015) and shifted attention away from the right wing. It is clear that, at least within the New Zealand Fourth Estate (News\nMedia), there is a tendency to critically examine government security discourse rather than trust it implicitly, and it is this view that underpins their reporting to the population (Jancic, 2019). Serious issues around trust in government security discourse and action resulted in recent wholesale reform of the New Zealand intelligence agency legislation with the creation of the Intelligence and Security Act 2017 governing the NZSIS and GSCB (Rogers, 2018, p. 657). Further destabilization of public trust in security agencies is also evident with ongoing “inquiries” into the New Zealand Defence Force's actions in Afghanistan (Operation Burnham Inquiry 2020) and the Christchurch Terror attacks (Christchurch Attack Royal Commission 2020), where the integrity of national security apparatus and discourse has been brought into contention by investigative journalists (Hagar & Stephenson, 2018), expert commentators, or community groups (Ainge Roy, 2019), creating a situation where it is impossible to know whose claim is trustworthy (Hoverd, 2019, p. 17). All the national security organizations (NZDF, GCSB, DPMC, and NZSIS) under investigation in these two inquiries are the same agencies producing the cybersecurity attributions. While clear distinctions need to be made between these individual one-off events and the general effectiveness of these agencies' everyday business and their successful operations, these examples show that they are regularly and recently seen by the public to have their integrity brought into doubt.\nThese types of one-off trust challenges to national security agency integrity are also seen at the international level. In 2013, WikiLeaks released an electronic dispersal of NSA classified material of some 1.7 million documents that had been leaked by Edward Snowden. These documents suggested strongly that the NSA, and perhaps also its Five Eyes partners, were engaged in regular global surveillance of their domestic populations (Verbal, 2014, p. 14). Again, it was impossible to know the truth of this claim based on open-source information, but part of the multifaceted collateral damage caused by this leak is a tarnishing of the reputation of the Five Eyes's agencies within their own populations where trust and confidence in those intelligence agencies is diminished in the eyes of the public.\nIn 2016, an additional social media technological challenge emerged for government discourse by the name of fake news (Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017, p. 211). Social media allows content to be passed between providers with no verification of its authenticity (ibid). Morgan (2018, p. 39) asserts that this verification problem allows disinformation and what is described as fake news to manipulate the public sphere and has the effect of “declining levels of trust in institutions and experts”. There are significant implications for democracy and free speech emerging from this phenomenon. When it comes to intelligence agency claims, the discussion of fake news is particularly pertinent when it comes to the relationship between US President Donald Trump and his intelligence agencies (McCarthy, 2018). Over a number of highly publicized national security issues related to Iran, ISIS, North Korea, and Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election, the president has called the discourse of his intelligence agencies into question. Donald Trump effectively stated that the intelligence agency claims are fake news and that the integrity of their discourse needs to be stringently questioned.\nConversely, one must ask why should the public trust Donald Trump, who has a conflict of interest because of investigations into his own actions, over politically neutral actors? Consequently, it is sensible for the public to ask whose security claim should be trusted and why? When it comes to Russian interference in the US election, Thirdway.org data show that the Donald Trump/James Comey counterclaims have created significant confusion about whose security discourse to trust (Eoyang et al, 2018). The broader ramification of such a claim is that all intelligence agency discourse, including that of cyber threat attribution, could be questioned and further magnifies the question over how Five Eyes partners, and their respective public, know who they should trust.\nAn essential assumption of my argument is that a problem of trust exists today when it comes to the public receiving national security agency discourse. How does one define trust? In political science, it has been traditionally assumed that “Trust is relational; it involves an individual making herself vulnerable to another individual, group, or institution that has the capacity to do her harm or betray her” (Levi & Stoker, 2000, p. 476). Trust can be understood as dichotomous in that one trusts or one does not, but trust relations can also be a sliding scale of degrees of trust. For example, Western populations give their trust to their national security agencies to be protected from cyber threats (Shulzke, 2018, p. 954). That trust is essential for cyberspace to function and for governance and security of that critical infrastructure (Azmi et al, 2018, p. 258).\nHenschke and Ford (2017, p. 82) have argued that since the Snowden releases there has been a breakdown in the public's trust of national security agencies.\n> The cost here is in the public's willingness and capacity to trust in state mechanisms of national and international security, especially those intelligence programmes involving cyber-surveillance. The loss of trust in this area is particularly detrimental to the effective functioning of national security.\n>\n> (Henschke & Ford, 2017, p. 82)\nFor Henschke and Ford (2017, p. 82), there is a twofold element of trust in the relationship between national security agencies and the public: 1) That surveillance is necessary and 2) that intelligence activities must be kept secret from the public. The challenge of Snowden (and likewise the GCSB's illegal spying on Kim Dotcom) (Rogers, 2015, p. 46) is that the Five Eyes nations were “caught out abusing this trust risk losing the goodwill of the public. If the public's trust in this area is lost and the government is judged as untrustworthy, then effective governing can become more difficult” (Henschke & Ford, 2017, p. 84). Pew data since the Snowdon releases reveal that the American public's approval for surveillance of citizens has declined as has their confidence that their government can protect their private data (Geiger, 2018). Thirdway.org suggests that in relation to contentious national security issues, most Americans did not know whose claim to trust (Eoyang et al, 2018). The poll data are not conclusive in showing a loss of trust in national security discourse, but it certainly demonstrates a public confusion and a lack of implicit unquestioned trust in national security discourse.\nGiven that recent Pew data also suggest the public believe there will be increasing cyber threats to elections and national security infrastructure (Poushter & Fetterolf, 2019), it is essential that trust is maintained. Ultimately, the loss of public trust is counterproductive for effective national security (Poushter & Fetterolf, 2019) because it leads to increasing media scrutiny and hyperbole, which then adversely impacts security agency transparency in terms of comfort levels with communicating to the public and not over classifying internal documentation. Thus, when it comes to making cyber-security policy, Ball et al (2019, p. 103) have argued that “Cybersecurity policymaking at the national level should be attentive to the central role of trust for maintaining resilient cyber systems -- and it should have plans in place to repair trust”. Trust therefore is an essential element of cyber-governance. To create trust with the public, governments must be seen to be active, careful, and deliberate in the policy and infrastructure they create and sustain to keep cyberspace safe, both domestically and globally. All these activities (including attribution) will be more effective if trust has not been reduced by earlier state failings and when/if a government can be transparent.\n## Conclusion: Addressing the contestability of attribution discourse\nIn this chapter, my intention has been to argue that, when it comes to cyber threat attribution claims made by governments, it is not always clear whose claim to trust or to what extent. There are inherent challenges in cyber threat attribution discourse: a) The evidence for attribution is not publicly verifiable, b) attribution is inherently political, c) the public must choose to trust attribution discourse or not, and d) attribution discourse often comes from institutions whose integrity has been brought into question elsewhere (this decreases trust). Given these concerns, we can say that there is a trust and confidence challenge that must be addressed by governments when it comes to the production of such discourse in the future.\nAs a social scientist, I traditionally look for empirical evidence to back a claim; without it, we are, at best, left with circumstantial evidence or, at worst, simply a truth claim. Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that the public do not (and perhaps should not) have access to classified empirical data to make assessments about the efficacy of cybersecurity decisions and discourse (Kello, 2013, p. 7). This creates a grey zone where cyber-attacks and their attributions live in a contested space of discourse between evidence and trust, where maintaining trust in government action is essential. I have demonstrated that attribution claims are inherently political and are contestable by both the accuser and the accused. While the effects of cyber-attacks are very real, communication about their effects and the intentions and motives behind an attack exist in a land of metaphor and discourse. This makes national security discourse around cyber-attacks contestable; a fact that is exacerbated by an inclination across social media, traditional media, and even the president of the US (with his conflict of interest) to question the integrity of these attribution claims. Therefore, a social scientific crisis emerges where, because of the classified nature of the evidence, the public is asked to trust\nand have confidence in a technological threat attribution claim without any further assurance. Consequently, it is then sensible for the public to ask whose security claim should be believed and why.\nIn modern democracies, trust in government is a key indicator of political legitimacy and stability (Marcinkowski & Starke, 2018, p. 87). Key questions for governments and populations are how and when do we trust the national security discourse of our government. A lack of trust inherently undermines and frustrates the positive intent of governments to keep their citizenry safe. In a contemporary environment where the national security discourse of a nation such as New Zealand (not to mention many other states) can be contested, it seems a critical social responsibility for security policy makers and academia to first acknowledge this trust and confidence conundrum and then strive to develop frameworks to better understand the trust and confidence challenges around threat attribution and apply it to this emerging cyber discourse. How to ensure that there is trust and confidence in the government's ability to identify, communicate, and respond to technological national security threats will be essential 21st-century governance questions for democracies.\nUnfortunately, civil society cannot be relied upon to meet such a challenge. A civic challenge exists for both government and academia to consider how to best address the inherent weakness (that they are political and contestable) that exists in national security threat attributions. Ideally, probably the most effective manner in which cyber attribution could be separated from the individual interests of nation-states or commercial entities is if some form of international legal attribution agency was formed. However, realistic solutions to the attribution problem must come from individual governments, who should be sufficiently motivated to increase the efficacy of its security apparatus by decreasing potential criticism of its discourse.\nThe producers of national security discourse must acknowledge that these weaknesses exist in their discourse and that it is their responsibility to find ways to mitigate these challenges. This is critical because WannaCry and NotPetya have shown us that cyber issues are changing the national security landscape indelibly. While care is required around cyber hyperbole and metaphor, the potential scale, spread, and damage of future attacks could be catastrophic. Governments need to find better ways to effectively communicate with each other, their opponents, and their own populations when it comes to mitigating these challenges.\nIt is important to conclude by asking what might be possible solutions to respond to the technological cyber-attack attribution challenge? First, cyber discourse makers must accept that national security discourse justifications that arise from classified sources cannot always provide a persuasive public evidence basis for their assertions. Second, cyber discourse makers should acknowledge that their claims are inherently political and therefore potentially contestable. Such acknowledgment would allow the discourse to be more reflexive and to self-regulate its claims in a more nuanced manner. Nuanced cyber threat discourse lessens the possibility that a government institution or representative will be subsequently called to account for making an incorrect or exaggerated claim. Governments\nCyber threat and national security policy 235\nshould look to employ these observations in the communication tools that they already possess. Cybersecurity strategy refreshes offer a real opportunity to engage with the public. They can focus both on private enterprise and the public. They can offer an education capacity and more transparency around the nature of various cyber threats. One place where a degree of transparency and limited evidence can exist for the actual nature and prevalence of cyber threats is in the annual reports from their National Cyber Security Centers (see Government Communications Security Bureau, 2017a). These carefully constructed and communicated reports and data could and should be more widely distributed, publicized, and utilized as an evidence basis for future claims. And lastly, one additional way to address the confidence challenge and limited trust around secrecy in national security discourse is to regularly craft language that clearly notes that a fine balance exists between secrecy and transparency. This balance relies heavily on building a trusting and transparent relationship between government officials and the public while working to repair any past breaches of confidence.",

    "## Notes\n1. The chapter does not claim that cyber-attack attribution evidence is lacking; simply, it argues that government claims about possessing robust attribution evidence must be trusted by the public.\n2. Trustworthiness is based on the ability to understand the process and the evidence presented to you. If one lacks the technical knowledge and/or when there are competing claims around national security, mediated by the Fourth Estate, a great deal of confusion will be at play in the mind of the public. This may mean that cybersecurity discourse, by being difficult to understand and hyperbolic in nature, makes establishing trust in that discourse problematic from the outset.\n3. The Christchurch Call is one example of State/Private Sector policing of social media threat. Bodies such as the United Nations and Interpol, in collaboration with states and private sector, could potentially develop such a complex mechanism.\n4. One place this could occur is in a careful differentiation between the prevalence of cybercrime events and state sponsored cyber-attacks to ensure that the actual prevalence and nature of cybersecurity threats are properly represented.\n## References\nAinge Roy, E (2019) Christchurch shootings real issues not being heard. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/08/christchurch-shootings-real-issues-not-being-heard-by-inquiry-critics-say, accessed April 13, 2020.\nAllcott, H and Gentzkow, M (2017) ‘Social media and fake news in the 2016 election’, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 31(2), pp. 211–236.\nAzmi, RA, Tibben, W and Than Win, K (2018) ‘Review of cybersecurity frameworks: context and shared concepts’, Journal of Cyber Policy, 3(2), pp. 258–283.\nBall, K, Degli Esposti, S, Dibb, S, Pavone, V and Santiago-Gomez, E (2019) ‘Institutional trustworthiness and national security governance: evidence from six European countries’, Governance, 32(1), pp. 103–121.\nBBC News (2017) Cyber-attack: Europol says it was unprecedented in scale. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39907965, accessed April 13, 2020.\nWilliam Hoverd\nBossert, T (2017) Press briefing on the attribution of the WannaCry Malware attack to North Korea. https://kr.usembassy.gov/121917-press-briefing-attribution-wannacry-malware-attack-north-korea/, accessed April 13, 2020.\nBussoletti, F (2018) All five eyes countries have blamed Russia for the NotPetya cyber attack. https://www.difesaesicurezza.com/en/cyber-en/all-five-eyes-countries-have-blamed-russia-for-the-notpetya-cyber-attack/, accessed April 13, 2020.\nDepartment of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (2018a) Refresh of New Zealand's cyber security strategy and action plan.

  "flat_text": "# 13 Cyber threat attribution, trust and confidence, and the contestability of national security policy\nWilliam Hoverd\n## Introduction\nToday, we regularly hear that Chinese company Huawei is a source of vulnerability for Western nations, and that North Korea and Russia are sources of cyber threats. Western populations are being asked to trust the word of intelligence agencies and world leaders that these unspecified emerging technological threats are real. The often-classified nature of a potential or emerging technological threat results in governments not being able to provide the public with an evidence base for threat attribution, and, even if such evidence were released to the public, how would they even begin to understand the origins of deleterious and malicious code? The challenges around cyber threat evidence create a situation for the public where government threat attribution discourse must be trusted (or not) by those receiving it.¹ Schluzke (2018, p. 954) recently argued that this form of cyber attribution creates an uncertainty in the mind of the public and that, given state knowledge is necessarily classified in this domain, care needs to be taken by cyber policy makers when crafting language around cyber-attacks. This chapter will argue that the threat potential posed by emerging technologies produces trust and confidence issues for Western populations, (Henschke &amp; Brandt Ford, 2017, p. 82) as the public is asked to trust and have confidence that a government’s particular technological threat attribution claim is accurate, and that robust classified evidence for this attribution exists and it is not being used selectively.\nIn recent years, narrative, counter narrative, spin, classified material, and “fake news” have politicized intelligence and cybersecurity discourse in such a way, that official security discourse is potentially contestable. Consequently, it is sensible for the public to ask: Whose security claim should be trusted and why? Likewise, given that there can be skepticism around this discourse, it seems a critical social responsibility for security policy makers and academia to first acknowledge this conundrum and then strive to develop frameworks to better understand the trust and confidence challenges around technological threat attribution.\nThe task of academia is to undertake constructive criticism by highlighting the nature of an issue of concern and then concluding by suggesting possible solutions. In a volume devoted to emerging technologies, a broader phenomenon has emerged where issues of trust and the potential for deception that results from new technology\nhave significant ramifications for the social contract between the state and the population and how they are both secured. The age-old balance between human liberty and security is being continually addressed in response to the evolving technologies of attack and defense that are occurring globally across the cyber realm.\nThe chapter begins by outlining the recent Five Eyes (USA, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) condemnations of Russian and North Korean cyber policy as a sociological case study to illustrate where and if a technological threat attribution and trust and confidence challenge might be evident. Focus is given to the recent WannaCry (2017) and NotPetya (2017) cyber-attacks that have been attributed to these nations. This case study of the Five Eyes condemnation is used to sketch out how the contestability of national security strategy and government security discourse can present specific trust and confidence challenges around national security discourse for both the public and the government. To illustrate the challenges surrounding contemporary issues of technological threat attribution, it focuses on the smallest member of the Five Eyes alliance, the nation of New Zealand. The case study will compare and contrast the language of the government executive and that of the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) when they attributed these two attacks to North Korea (WannaCry) and Russia (NotPetya).\nThis attribution discussion then returns to the broader context where, especially after the accusations of Edward Snowden, trust and confidence in the security actions and motives of the Five Eyes intelligence partners have been questioned. The chapter argues that trust and confidence challenges around the political nature of the Five Eyes cyber attribution is potentially exacerbated by two factors: That the invisible nature of the cyber realm can only be communicated by metaphor. This naturally leads to conflict-laden hyperbole that creates notions of cyber war and cyber threat that may not be helpful for thinking about the intentionally deployed deleterious and malicious effects of code That the development of the notion of fake news accusations (and other such accusations) brings into question the trustworthiness of the discourse of national security agencies\nLastly, the purpose of the chapter's conclusion is to move the content and goals of the chapter beyond simple problem definition to the initiation of a discussion of potential solutions to technological threat attribution, trust and confidence issues, and the contestability of national security policy when it comes to cyber attribution.\nWe now turn to review two recent global cyber-attacks, which the Five Eyes nations have publicly stated as deeply influencing their extant national security decision-making -- especially around cybersecurity.\n## The WannaCry and NotPetya cyber-attacks and the Five Eyes attributions\nThe Five Eyes intelligence sharing network's condemnation of North Korea and Russian cyber policy concentrated on the threat and damage caused by WannaCry\n(2017) and NotPetya (2017), two cyber-attacks attributed to these nations, respectively. Together these two attacks represent the two most costly cyber-attacks that the world has experienced to date .\nWannaCry was a ransomware crypto-worm that, in May 2017, attacked computers using the Windows operating platform (Martin et al, 2018, p. 361). It utilized the Eternal Blue exploit developed by the NSA, which had been stolen by the organization or state that used it for this attack. Once loaded onto the platform, it would encrypt data and then demand payment in bitcoin to release the data. Europol (BBC News, 2017) claimed that it had infected some 75,000 computers across 99 countries within a day, including 48 UK National Health Service (NHS) trusts, leaving doctors unable to retrieve patient information (Martin et al, 2018, p. 361). Ultimately, Kaspersky Lab analysis noted that the attack affected some 200,000 computers across 150 countries  with much of this occurring within 24 hours . Microsoft was able to respond quickly to the attack by deploying emergency patches that prevented the crypto-worm's spread. Nevertheless, variants of WannaCry were still emerging in 2018, hitting Boeing  in May and Taiwanese Apple chipmaker TSMC in August .\nWhat was unprecedented about the WannaCry attack was its indiscriminate global scale and its rapid spread, as well as its payload's ability to disrupt essential services and business. The cost of the disruption caused by the attack is significant, estimated at being between four and eight billion US dollars . Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, stated that a global technological problem was emerging where governments were stockpiling cyber weapons that, if stolen, as in the case of Eternal Blue, create the potential for indiscriminate attacks like this to occur . He went on to argue that:\n> The governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call. They need to take a different approach and adhere in cyberspace to the same rules applied to weapons in the physical world. We need governments to consider the damage to civilians that comes from hoarding these vulnerabilities and the use of these exploits.\n>\n> The immense scale of the attack and the possibilities for further attack that WannaCry augured, indicated that globally a shift was required to address the perpetrators of such attacks.\nAttribution for WannaCry was formally announced by the White House in December 2017 . USA Homeland Security advisor, Tom Bossert, stated that:\n> After careful investigation, the United States is publicly attributing the massive WannaCry cyberattack to North Korea. We do not make this allegation lightly. We do so with evidence, and we do so with partners. Other governments and private companies agree. The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada,\nNew Zealand, and Japan have seen our analysis, and they join us in denouncing North Korea for WannaCry. Commercial partners have also acted. Microsoft traced the attack to cyber affiliates of the North Korean government, and others in the security community have contributed their analysis.  ”\nUsefully, here we see that commercial attributions for these attacks also exist to support government attributions. The global or, more specifically, US-led Five Eyes attribution for the WannaCry cyber-attack was made against North Korea, and here there was a stated (classified/private) evidence base for the attribution. During the question portion of the briefing, Bossert was asked about the evidence basis for the attribution and he stated: “We took a lot of time to look through classified, sensitive information. What we did was rely on -- and some of it I can't share, unfortunately -- technical links to previously identified North Korean cyber tools, tradecraft, operational infrastructure. We had to examine a lot. And we had to put it together in a way that allowed us to make a confident attribution.  ”\nAbove, we see Bossert assert that the US developed and shared its analysis with its partners, and on that evidence, made their attribution of the origin of WannaCry to North Korea. The often-classified nature of the potential or actual emerging technological threat results in governments not being able to provide the public with the evidence for cyber threat attribution.\n### NotPetya\nClosely following the WannaCry cyber-attack, the NotPetya cyber-attack occurred on June 27, 2017. Kaspersky Lab reported infections in France, Germany, Italy, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, but the majority of infections were occurring in Russia and the Ukraine where more than 80 companies were attacked . It mainly targeted businesses as one of the initial propagation vectors was through the financial software MeDoc . Kaspersky Lab argued NotPetya was the costliest cyber-attack the world has seen with its deleterious effects reaching some ten billion US dollars .\nNotPetya was a variation of the 2016 Petya software, which was originally an e-mail-spread ransomware that encrypted hard drives and asked for payment . However, Kaspersky Lab was quick to state that this attack was from a separate malware family, and utilized the Eternal Blue windows exploit . Where NotPetya was radically different was that it masqueraded as ransomware but was, in fact, what is known as a “wiper” that permanently deleted material on a computer's hard drive . Moreover, it particularly affected businesses in Ukraine, with some 75% of incidents reported in that nation. It then spread globally to the business partners of those initially affected,\nwith 9% of incidents occurring in Germany, and the Danish shipping company, Maersk, being particularly affected by the attack . Where WannaCry was global and relatively indiscriminate ransomware, NotPetya was a disguised, targeted attack on a particular nation-state's financial infrastructure.\nIn January 2018, the Washington Post stated that the CIA had attributed the NotPetya attack to Russian military hackers . Reportedly, its sources claimed “The GRU military spy agency created NotPetya, the CIA concluded with ‘high confidence' in November, according to classified reports cited by USA intelligence officials” . On February 15, 2018, the White House released a brief press statement that attributed NotPetya to the Russian military:\n> In June 2017, the Russian military launched the most destructive and costly cyber-attack in history... The attack, dubbed “NotPetya”, quickly spread worldwide, causing billions of dollars in damage across Europe, Asia, and the Americas. It was part of the Kremlin's ongoing effort to destabilize Ukraine and demonstrates ever more clearly Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict. This was also a reckless and indiscriminate cyber-attack that will be met with international consequences.\n>\n> (Statement from the Press Secretary, 2018)\nBy late February 2018, the NotPetya attack had been attributed by all Five Eyes nations as originating in Russia . United Kingdom Foreign Office minister Lord Tariq Ahmad attributed the NotPetya cyber-attack to the Russian government, stating “The UK Government judges that the Russian Government, specifically the Russian military, was responsible for the destructive NotPetya cyber-attack of June 2017” (Foreign Office Minister condemns Russia, 2018). The rationale for this attribution was: “The decision to publicly attribute this incident underlines the fact that the UK and its allies will not tolerate malicious cyber activity” (Foreign Office Minister condemns Russia, 2018). Clear attribution for the attacks was leveled at the Russian military from across the Five Eyes nations, but, again, it is difficult to discern how and where evidence for this attribution arose and was then shared between these nations.\n### The April 2018 Five Eyes head of state cybersecurity meeting\nThe Five Eyes condemnation of the Russian cyber-attack occurred on April 18, 2018, when four heads of state (Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and New Zealand) met at the United Kingdom's National Cyber Centre . The meeting publicly attributed the NotPetya Ukraine cyber-attack to Russia. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made the claim that Russia has been “using cyberwarfare as part of a wider effort to attack and undermine the international system” (ibid). In this meeting, British Prime Minister Theresa May described the Five Eyes alliance as “a unique security and intelligence-sharing partnership” that “has done much to protect our people from a range of threats”\n(ibid). In particular, with regard to Russian hacking, she added: “I have been clear to Russia that we know what it is doing. And we should be in no doubt that such cyberwarfare is one of the great challenges of our time” (ibid). Five Eyes's attribution discourse was universal in its condemnation. Another dimension to the trust challenges that the chapter has already outlined is that, in this example for both the Five Eyes governments and their populations, the attribution was denied by Russia . Consequently, without presentation of the shared evidence, the cyber-attack attribution became contested, effectively creating a he-said/she-said situation between the various parties linked to ongoing great power competition.\n### The New Zealand attribution\nThe New Zealand government attributed both the WannaCry and NotPetya cyberattacks to Russia and North Korea in line with their Five Eyes partners. However, I have not found a New Zealand government source stating that the nation has seen shared ‘classified evidence' for these threat attributions. Official releases from the GSCB, in terms of both WannaCry (Government Communications Services Bureau, 2017b) and NotPetya (Government Communications Services Bureau, 2018), simply state the agency supports their international partners' condemnation. As we can see from Tom Bossert's statement above, he stated that attribution evidence for WannaCry was shared with its Five Eyes partners, specifically naming New Zealand. This means that the public must trust the government's discourse, and it is not clear whether its representatives have seen their partner's evidence of attribution or are simply repeating the attribution. We have to trust (or not) that they have seen evidence. To contextualize the New Zealand support, these attributions coincided with a significant 2018 government focus on cybersecurity as a key threat in the national security threat landscape .\nThe 2018 Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC) Cyber Security Strategy Refresh stated that “New Zealand recognizes that the relevance of cybersecurity concerns now extends across multiple branches of government” (Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, 2018a, p. 6). The primary responsibility for cybersecurity is given to the Government Communications Security Bureau, which delivers signals intelligence. A close look at the government's cyber discourse in 2018 shows a discourse had emerged across the national security sector where a cyber technological threat was being attributed to Russia and North Korea. This threat attribution discourse is usually accompanied by an argument that New Zealand is not immune from this threat, and that additional cyber infrastructure development is required. For example, in February 2018, Andrew Hampton, the director general of the GCSB (Government Communications Security Bureau, 2018), stated, “In terms of cyber threats, the GCSB noted a 15% increase in serious incidents affecting New Zealand in the year to June 2017”, and that “The GCSB's international partners have today attributed the NotPetya cyber-attack to the Russian Government”. Here we see that the attribution for NotPetya is sourced from Five Eyes partners, and it is not made clear whether the\nstatement was made simply in support of, or after reviewing classified evidence supplied by their partners.\nSimilarly, in the 2018 winter issue of Line of Defence the Right Honorable Andrew Little, Minister Responsible for the GCSB and NZSIS stated:\n> In February, the Government added New Zealand's voice to the international condemnation of the NotPetya cyber-attack which international partners have now attributed to the Russian Government. It targeted Ukraine but had a global impact -- including affecting supply chains in New Zealand. In December, New Zealand also expressed concern about international reports which link North Korea to the major WannaCry ransomware campaign.\n>\n> A similar type of attribution claim can also be found in the July 2018 Ministry of Defense Strategic Defence Policy Statement which states that:\n> Physical distance is no protection in cyberspace, and New Zealand is subject to a growing cyber threat from state sponsored and other malicious actors... Cyber blurs boundaries between conflict and peace, and public and private. (...)\n>\n> Russian ‘active measures' in the 2016 United States Presidential election brought to light ‘cyber enabled information warfare' as a disrupter in liberal democracies. (...)\n>\n> North Korea has a substantial store of chemical and biological weapons, a significant cyber capability (which it has shown a willingness to use).\n>\n> (Ministry of Defence, 2018, pp. 18--21)\nAcross these three examples, and more recently in the 2019 New Zealand cyber-security strategy (Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, 2019), we clearly see attributions of cyber threat to Russia and North Korea. We also see in all these examples that the threat attribution for cyber-attacks occurring across nation-states is linked explicitly to a governmental claim that there is a growing cyber threat environment impacting adversely on New Zealand's national security and, by implication, that there is an increased need for investment in the nation's cyber infrastructure. The implication is that cyber-attacks represent a form of virtual domain of threat that circumvents the nation's geographic isolation and that while it may not be a direct target of any such future attack, both WannaCry and NotPetya demonstrated the ability these attacks have to deliver collateral damage on a global scale. Nevertheless, we still need to better understand what might motivate such a small nation to make explicit attribution claims.\n## Cyber threat attribution\nCyber attribution is generally understood to be a difficult technical process . Commonly, the challenge of attributing a cyber-threat has created problems for nations trying to establish deterrence against\nforeign actors . However, it is the political construction of cyber threat attribution in national security that is useful here. Myriam Dunn Calvety (2013, p. 105) argued that “The link between cyberspace and national security is often presented as an unquestionable and uncontested ‘truth'. However, there is nothing natural or given about this link: It had to be forged, argued, and accepted in the (security) political process”. She argues that cybersecurity discourse is, in fact, constituted by a variety of authority figures in governments. For Dunn Calvety, the political nature of cyber discourse is further complicated by the fact that the very building blocks of cybersecurity language employ analogies or metaphors to describe and explain the effect of unsolicited changes in code across networks. Similar to a conceptualization of disease as an attack , this metaphorical language of cyber “attack” and “weapons” is potentially distorting and results in a tendency to describe the cyber landscape as unruly, dangerous, or threatening, when, in fact, much of the cyber environment is benign and intended to be enabling.\nOne consequence of the political construction of cyber discourse is that there are real risks when it comes to generating accurate attribution claims. Thomas Rid and Ben Buchanan (2015, p. 4) argue, “Doing attribution well is at the core of virtually all forms of coercion and deterrence, international and domestic. Doing it poorly undermines a state's credibility, its effectiveness, and ultimately it's liberty and security”. When it comes to cybersecurity, the attribution debate is evolving surprisingly slowly, and this slowness remains the case today . Rid and Buchanan (2015, p. 4) provide a detailed technical account of the attribution process, where they conclude that developing the evidence for cyberattack attribution is a difficult and costly process which inevitably only indicates the likely source of an attack. Moreover, this evidence cannot easily determine motive or the political gain that may have initially motivated an attack. They conclude with the finding that attribution is what states make of it, and public attribution is a political act used by states to legitimate security positioning. If we are to follow Rid and Buchanan's logic, we could understand the Five Eyes attribution of cyber threat to Russia and North Korea as a broader function of what is at stake politically in terms of the broader relations between these nations.\nIn the New Zealand case study, the combination of technical evidence challenges and political nature of attribution claims is made explicit when we look closely at the GCSB's National Cyber Security Centre Annual report, where it states:\n> Publicly reporting attribution is a significant [political] decision and is not made by the NCSC alone. Public attribution is one way to reduce the efficacy of malicious cyber actors by revealing their tools or increasing the reputational costs of illegitimate activity. However, it also carries risk for New Zealand and is considered alongside our other national objectives, including the need to maintain our ability to protect the networks that are of importance...\n>\n> (Government Communications Service Bureau, 2017a, p. 12)\nGiven that there is academic and local technical agreement that cyber threat attribution is ultimately a political act, why might this government be making these threat attribution claims -- why now and what might be the risks inherent in this attribution?\nThere are three possible explanations for this attribution. Firstly, there is a clear discussion in other sections of these documents that New Zealand is part of the Five Eyes network and is speaking in solidarity with its partners to increase the reputational costs of these activities. The challenge here is that when there is no unclassified evidence to support these attribution claims (there was commercial evidence for WannaCry but none for NotPetya), the public must trust the veracity and motives of these partners, and they must trust that their politicians are maintaining an independent policy stance. For example, Reuben Steff's chapter in this volume (Chapter 3) explains that small states are traditionally considered to be “consumers” of security technology supplied by larger states, given they often cannot develop it on their own. This means that it is necessary for New Zealand to align itself with the US on key technological security issues, and the case suggested here is that this could extend to technological threat attribution too, in order to secure its relations to the US and maintain access to critical technology advances and supply. If this is the case, it fuels critical questions about the independence of the nation's foreign affairs policy , which, if undermined, would be a potential blow to public trust.\nA second explanation is sourced from DPMC's National Cyber Policy Office release of April 20, 2018, which takes the form of a letter written by the Right Honorable Claire Curran, then-minister of Broadcasting, Communication, and Digital Media. The topic of the letter is the Refresh of New Zealand's Cyber Security Strategy and Action Plan which resulted in 2019 Cybersecurity Strategy.\nClaire Curran stated:\n> The clear trend is an upward trajectory of cyber security threats... New Zealand's geographical location does not exempt us from this threat... We will need to consider the mechanisms available to us to dissuade or deter malicious cyber activities, particularly where it is state-sponsored, or state condoned. This includes the option of publicly attributing malicious cyber activity as a way of holding states to account.\n>\n> (Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, 2018b, p. 4, p. 9)\nClearly, in the above document, the government has made an active political decision to publicly attribute what it describes as malicious cyber activity to particular nation-states as part of “expanding its international cyber efforts” (ibid). The challenge is that the source and reliability of classified evidence for the threat and the rationale for public attribution are unable to be made transparent, and the public is being represented by this claim. Here, the public is asked to trust that the correct decisions and attributions are being made as part of being a good international citizen and that the government is not being selective in who it calls to account.\nA third explanation comes from the Copenhagen school, which developed the securitization theory that focuses on “speech acts” and the significance these acts can have upon political agenda settings and political relations . Securitization theory suggests that when a threat is identified and a “speech act” identifying it is utilized, this discourse prioritizes the threat on the political agenda in such a way that it necessitates the development of urgent mitigation measures that could potentially extend even to the encroachment of privacy, the need for secrecy, and the utilization of force . For the Copenhagen school, securitization speech acts emphasize the dangers of the cyber threat environment and legitimate additional government funding for the construction of various infrastructures designed to protect the public from the threat. The challenge here, again, is that the speech acts have the power for change, not any classified evidential basis that may sit behind the act. When it comes to cyber threats, the public has no choice but to trust that those who are making the speech act are fully informed by subject matter experts and are making the best national security decisions possible.\nTaken together, these explanations suggest that the various 2018--2019 New Zealand Cybersecurity attribution speech acts appear designed to: Align New Zealand closer to its Five Eyes partnersCall out certain acts of cyber aggression where New Zealand can then position itself as a good international cyber citizenBe used as a mechanism to dissuade or deter malicious cyber activity by publicly attributing the activity to hold states to accountCreate, justify, and legitimate the development of additional domestic cybersecurity infrastructure\nTogether, these four purposes suggest that the attributions are being utilized for both international and domestic positioning in terms of alignment with our partners, being a good international citizen, and creating global and domestic cyber infrastructures to further New Zealand's interests and safety.\n## Public trust and national security discourse\nIn a civil society environment where the evidence for attribution is unavailable and the integrity of state institutions such as the GSCB  or the Minister for Broadcasting's judgement has recently been called into doubt , it is possible that future trust and confidence issues may arise around the efficacy of this language and the effectiveness of current government cyber initiatives. In 2015 and 2016, similar trust and confidence issues occurred in the justification of counter terrorism funding , where evidence of a domestic Muslim radicalization threat has never eventuated and the claim of the “Jihadi bride” risk was found by the media to have little evidentiary basis and to have been exaggerated  and shifted attention away from the right wing. It is clear that, at least within the New Zealand Fourth Estate (News\nMedia), there is a tendency to critically examine government security discourse rather than trust it implicitly, and it is this view that underpins their reporting to the population . Serious issues around trust in government security discourse and action resulted in recent wholesale reform of the New Zealand intelligence agency legislation with the creation of the Intelligence and Security Act 2017 governing the NZSIS and GSCB . Further destabilization of public trust in security agencies is also evident with ongoing “inquiries” into the New Zealand Defence Force's actions in Afghanistan (Operation Burnham Inquiry 2020) and the Christchurch Terror attacks (Christchurch Attack Royal Commission 2020), where the integrity of national security apparatus and discourse has been brought into contention by investigative journalists , expert commentators, or community groups (Ainge Roy, 2019), creating a situation where it is impossible to know whose claim is trustworthy . All the national security organizations (NZDF, GCSB, DPMC, and NZSIS) under investigation in these two inquiries are the same agencies producing the cybersecurity attributions. While clear distinctions need to be made between these individual one-off events and the general effectiveness of these agencies' everyday business and their successful operations, these examples show that they are regularly and recently seen by the public to have their integrity brought into doubt.\nThese types of one-off trust challenges to national security agency integrity are also seen at the international level. In 2013, WikiLeaks released an electronic dispersal of NSA classified material of some 1.7 million documents that had been leaked by Edward Snowden. These documents suggested strongly that the NSA, and perhaps also its Five Eyes partners, were engaged in regular global surveillance of their domestic populations . Again, it was impossible to know the truth of this claim based on open-source information, but part of the multifaceted collateral damage caused by this leak is a tarnishing of the reputation of the Five Eyes's agencies within their own populations where trust and confidence in those intelligence agencies is diminished in the eyes of the public.\nIn 2016, an additional social media technological challenge emerged for government discourse by the name of fake news . Social media allows content to be passed between providers with no verification of its authenticity (ibid). Morgan (2018, p. 39) asserts that this verification problem allows disinformation and what is described as fake news to manipulate the public sphere and has the effect of “declining levels of trust in institutions and experts”. There are significant implications for democracy and free speech emerging from this phenomenon. When it comes to intelligence agency claims, the discussion of fake news is particularly pertinent when it comes to the relationship between US President Donald Trump and his intelligence agencies . Over a number of highly publicized national security issues related to Iran, ISIS, North Korea, and Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election, the president has called the discourse of his intelligence agencies into question. Donald Trump effectively stated that the intelligence agency claims are fake news and that the integrity of their discourse needs to be stringently questioned.\nConversely, one must ask why should the public trust Donald Trump, who has a conflict of interest because of investigations into his own actions, over politically neutral actors? Consequently, it is sensible for the public to ask whose security claim should be trusted and why? When it comes to Russian interference in the US election, Thirdway.org data show that the Donald Trump/James Comey counterclaims have created significant confusion about whose security discourse to trust (Eoyang et al, 2018). The broader ramification of such a claim is that all intelligence agency discourse, including that of cyber threat attribution, could be questioned and further magnifies the question over how Five Eyes partners, and their respective public, know who they should trust.\nAn essential assumption of my argument is that a problem of trust exists today when it comes to the public receiving national security agency discourse. How does one define trust? In political science, it has been traditionally assumed that “Trust is relational; it involves an individual making herself vulnerable to another individual, group, or institution that has the capacity to do her harm or betray her” . Trust can be understood as dichotomous in that one trusts or one does not, but trust relations can also be a sliding scale of degrees of trust. For example, Western populations give their trust to their national security agencies to be protected from cyber threats . That trust is essential for cyberspace to function and for governance and security of that critical infrastructure (Azmi et al, 2018, p. 258).\nHenschke and Ford (2017, p. 82) have argued that since the Snowden releases there has been a breakdown in the public's trust of national security agencies.\n> The cost here is in the public's willingness and capacity to trust in state mechanisms of national and international security, especially those intelligence programmes involving cyber-surveillance. The loss of trust in this area is particularly detrimental to the effective functioning of national security.\n>\n> For Henschke and Ford (2017, p. 82), there is a twofold element of trust in the relationship between national security agencies and the public: 1) That surveillance is necessary and 2) that intelligence activities must be kept secret from the public. The challenge of Snowden (and likewise the GCSB's illegal spying on Kim Dotcom)  is that the Five Eyes nations were “caught out abusing this trust risk losing the goodwill of the public. If the public's trust in this area is lost and the government is judged as untrustworthy, then effective governing can become more difficult” . Pew data since the Snowdon releases reveal that the American public's approval for surveillance of citizens has declined as has their confidence that their government can protect their private data . Thirdway.org suggests that in relation to contentious national security issues, most Americans did not know whose claim to trust (Eoyang et al, 2018). The poll data are not conclusive in showing a loss of trust in national security discourse, but it certainly demonstrates a public confusion and a lack of implicit unquestioned trust in national security discourse.\nGiven that recent Pew data also suggest the public believe there will be increasing cyber threats to elections and national security infrastructure , it is essential that trust is maintained. Ultimately, the loss of public trust is counterproductive for effective national security  because it leads to increasing media scrutiny and hyperbole, which then adversely impacts security agency transparency in terms of comfort levels with communicating to the public and not over classifying internal documentation. Thus, when it comes to making cyber-security policy, Ball et al (2019, p. 103) have argued that “Cybersecurity policymaking at the national level should be attentive to the central role of trust for maintaining resilient cyber systems -- and it should have plans in place to repair trust”. Trust therefore is an essential element of cyber-governance. To create trust with the public, governments must be seen to be active, careful, and deliberate in the policy and infrastructure they create and sustain to keep cyberspace safe, both domestically and globally. All these activities (including attribution) will be more effective if trust has not been reduced by earlier state failings and when/if a government can be transparent.\n## Conclusion: Addressing the contestability of attribution discourse\nIn this chapter, my intention has been to argue that, when it comes to cyber threat attribution claims made by governments, it is not always clear whose claim to trust or to what extent. There are inherent challenges in cyber threat attribution discourse: a) The evidence for attribution is not publicly verifiable, b) attribution is inherently political, c) the public must choose to trust attribution discourse or not, and d) attribution discourse often comes from institutions whose integrity has been brought into question elsewhere (this decreases trust). Given these concerns, we can say that there is a trust and confidence challenge that must be addressed by governments when it comes to the production of such discourse in the future.\nAs a social scientist, I traditionally look for empirical evidence to back a claim; without it, we are, at best, left with circumstantial evidence or, at worst, simply a truth claim. Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that the public do not (and perhaps should not) have access to classified empirical data to make assessments about the efficacy of cybersecurity decisions and discourse . This creates a grey zone where cyber-attacks and their attributions live in a contested space of discourse between evidence and trust, where maintaining trust in government action is essential. I have demonstrated that attribution claims are inherently political and are contestable by both the accuser and the accused. While the effects of cyber-attacks are very real, communication about their effects and the intentions and motives behind an attack exist in a land of metaphor and discourse. This makes national security discourse around cyber-attacks contestable; a fact that is exacerbated by an inclination across social media, traditional media, and even the president of the US (with his conflict of interest) to question the integrity of these attribution claims. Therefore, a social scientific crisis emerges where, because of the classified nature of the evidence, the public is asked to trust\nand have confidence in a technological threat attribution claim without any further assurance. Consequently, it is then sensible for the public to ask whose security claim should be believed and why.\nIn modern democracies, trust in government is a key indicator of political legitimacy and stability . Key questions for governments and populations are how and when do we trust the national security discourse of our government. A lack of trust inherently undermines and frustrates the positive intent of governments to keep their citizenry safe. In a contemporary environment where the national security discourse of a nation such as New Zealand (not to mention many other states) can be contested, it seems a critical social responsibility for security policy makers and academia to first acknowledge this trust and confidence conundrum and then strive to develop frameworks to better understand the trust and confidence challenges around threat attribution and apply it to this emerging cyber discourse. How to ensure that there is trust and confidence in the government's ability to identify, communicate, and respond to technological national security threats will be essential 21st-century governance questions for democracies.\nUnfortunately, civil society cannot be relied upon to meet such a challenge. A civic challenge exists for both government and academia to consider how to best address the inherent weakness (that they are political and contestable) that exists in national security threat attributions. Ideally, probably the most effective manner in which cyber attribution could be separated from the individual interests of nation-states or commercial entities is if some form of international legal attribution agency was formed. However, realistic solutions to the attribution problem must come from individual governments, who should be sufficiently motivated to increase the efficacy of its security apparatus by decreasing potential criticism of its discourse.\nThe producers of national security discourse must acknowledge that these weaknesses exist in their discourse and that it is their responsibility to find ways to mitigate these challenges. This is critical because WannaCry and NotPetya have shown us that cyber issues are changing the national security landscape indelibly. While care is required around cyber hyperbole and metaphor, the potential scale, spread, and damage of future attacks could be catastrophic. Governments need to find better ways to effectively communicate with each other, their opponents, and their own populations when it comes to mitigating these challenges.\nIt is important to conclude by asking what might be possible solutions to respond to the technological cyber-attack attribution challenge? First, cyber discourse makers must accept that national security discourse justifications that arise from classified sources cannot always provide a persuasive public evidence basis for their assertions. Second, cyber discourse makers should acknowledge that their claims are inherently political and therefore potentially contestable. Such acknowledgment would allow the discourse to be more reflexive and to self-regulate its claims in a more nuanced manner. Nuanced cyber threat discourse lessens the possibility that a government institution or representative will be subsequently called to account for making an incorrect or exaggerated claim. Governments\nCyber threat and national security policy 235\nshould look to employ these observations in the communication tools that they already possess. Cybersecurity strategy refreshes offer a real opportunity to engage with the public. They can focus both on private enterprise and the public. They can offer an education capacity and more transparency around the nature of various cyber threats. One place where a degree of transparency and limited evidence can exist for the actual nature and prevalence of cyber threats is in the annual reports from their National Cyber Security Centers (see Government Communications Security Bureau, 2017a). These carefully constructed and communicated reports and data could and should be more widely distributed, publicized, and utilized as an evidence basis for future claims. And lastly, one additional way to address the confidence challenge and limited trust around secrecy in national security discourse is to regularly craft language that clearly notes that a fine balance exists between secrecy and transparency. This balance relies heavily on building a trusting and transparent relationship between government officials and the public while working to repair any past breaches of confidence.",

Western populations are being asked to trust the word of intelligence agencies and world leaders that these unspecified emerging technological threats are real. The often-classified nature of a potential or emerging technological threat results in governments not being able to provide the public with an evidence base for threat attribution, and, even if such evidence were released to the public, how would they even begin to understand the origins of deleterious and malicious code? The challenges around cyber threat evidence create a situation for the public where government threat attribution discourse must be trusted (or not) by those receiving it.¹ Schluzke (2018, p. 954) recently argued that this form of cyber attribution creates an uncertainty in the mind of the public and that, given state knowledge is necessarily classified in this domain, care needs to be taken by cyber policy makers when crafting language around cyber-attacks. This chapter will argue that the threat potential posed by emerging technologies produces trust and confidence issues for Western populations, (Henschke &amp; Brandt Ford, 2017, p. 82) as the public is asked to trust and have confidence that a government’s particular technological threat attribution claim is accurate, and that robust classified evidence for this attribution exists and it is not being used selectively.\nIn recent years, narrative, counter narrative, spin, classified material, and “fake news” have politicized intelligence and cybersecurity discourse in such a way, that official security discourse is potentially contestable. Consequently, it is sensible for the public to ask: Whose security claim should be trusted and why? Likewise, given that there can be skepticism around this discourse, it seems a critical social responsibility for security policy makers and academia to first acknowledge this conundrum and then strive to develop frameworks to better understand the trust and confidence challenges around technological threat attribution.\nThe task of academia is to undertake constructive criticism by highlighting the nature of an issue of concern and then concluding by suggesting possible solutions. In a volume devoted to emerging technologies, a broader phenomenon has emerged where issues of trust and the potential for deception that results from new technology\nhave significant ramifications for the social contract between the state and the population and how they are both secured. The age-old balance between human liberty and security is being continually addressed in response to the evolving technologies of attack and defense that are occurring globally across the cyber realm.\nThe chapter begins by outlining the recent Five Eyes (USA, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) condemnations of Russian and North Korean cyber policy as a sociological case study to illustrate where and if a technological threat attribution and trust and confidence challenge might be evident. Focus is given to the recent WannaCry (2017) and NotPetya (2017) cyber-attacks that have been attributed to these nations. This case study of the Five Eyes condemnation is used to sketch out how the contestability of national security strategy and government security discourse can present specific trust and confidence challenges around national security discourse for both the public and the government. To illustrate the challenges surrounding contemporary issues of technological threat attribution, it focuses on the smallest member of the Five Eyes alliance, the nation of New Zealand. The case study will compare and contrast the language of the government executive and that of the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) when they attributed these two attacks to North Korea (WannaCry) and Russia (NotPetya).\nThis attribution discussion then returns to the broader context where, especially after the accusations of Edward Snowden, trust and confidence in the security actions and motives of the Five Eyes intelligence partners have been questioned. The chapter argues that trust and confidence challenges around the political nature of the Five Eyes cyber attribution is potentially exacerbated by two factors: That the invisible nature of the cyber realm can only be communicated by metaphor. This naturally leads to conflict-laden hyperbole that creates notions of cyber war and cyber threat that may not be helpful for thinking about the intentionally deployed deleterious and malicious effects of code That the development of the notion of fake news accusations (and other such accusations) brings into question the trustworthiness of the discourse of national security agencies\nLastly, the purpose of the chapter's conclusion is to move the content and goals of the chapter beyond simple problem definition to the initiation of a discussion of potential solutions to technological threat attribution, trust and confidence issues, and the contestability of national security policy when it comes to cyber attribution.\nWe now turn to review two recent global cyber-attacks, which the Five Eyes nations have publicly stated as deeply influencing their extant national security decision-making -- especially around cybersecurity.\n## The WannaCry and NotPetya cyber-attacks and the Five Eyes attributions\nThe Five Eyes intelligence sharing network's condemnation of North Korea and Russian cyber policy concentrated on the threat and damage caused by WannaCry\n(2017) and NotPetya (2017), two cyber-attacks attributed to these nations, respectively. Together these two attacks represent the two most costly cyber-attacks that the world has experienced to date .\nWannaCry was a ransomware crypto-worm that, in May 2017, attacked computers using the Windows operating platform (Martin et al, 2018, p. 361). It utilized the Eternal Blue exploit developed by the NSA, which had been stolen by the organization or state that used it for this attack. Once loaded onto the platform, it would encrypt data and then demand payment in bitcoin to release the data. Europol (BBC News, 2017) claimed that it had infected some 75,000 computers across 99 countries within a day, including 48 UK National Health Service (NHS) trusts, leaving doctors unable to retrieve patient information (Martin et al, 2018, p. 361). Ultimately, Kaspersky Lab analysis noted that the attack affected some 200,000 computers across 150 countries  with much of this occurring within 24 hours . Microsoft was able to respond quickly to the attack by deploying emergency patches that prevented the crypto-worm's spread. Nevertheless, variants of WannaCry were still emerging in 2018, hitting Boeing  in May and Taiwanese Apple chipmaker TSMC in August .\nWhat was unprecedented about the WannaCry attack was its indiscriminate global scale and its rapid spread, as well as its payload's ability to disrupt essential services and business. The cost of the disruption caused by the attack is significant, estimated at being between four and eight billion US dollars . Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, stated that a global technological problem was emerging where governments were stockpiling cyber weapons that, if stolen, as in the case of Eternal Blue, create the potential for indiscriminate attacks like this to occur . He went on to argue that:\n> The governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call. They need to take a different approach and adhere in cyberspace to the same rules applied to weapons in the physical world. We need governments to consider the damage to civilians that comes from hoarding these vulnerabilities and the use of these exploits.\n>\n> The immense scale of the attack and the possibilities for further attack that WannaCry augured, indicated that globally a shift was required to address the perpetrators of such attacks.\nAttribution for WannaCry was formally announced by the White House in December 2017 . USA Homeland Security advisor, Tom Bossert, stated that:\n> After careful investigation, the United States is publicly attributing the massive WannaCry cyberattack to North Korea. We do not make this allegation lightly. We do so with evidence, and we do so with partners. Other governments and private companies agree. The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada,\nNew Zealand, and Japan have seen our analysis, and they join us in denouncing North Korea for WannaCry. Commercial partners have also acted. Microsoft traced the attack to cyber affiliates of the North Korean government, and others in the security community have contributed their analysis.  ”\nUsefully, here we see that commercial attributions for these attacks also exist to support government attributions. The global or, more specifically, US-led Five Eyes attribution for the WannaCry cyber-attack was made against North Korea, and here there was a stated (classified/private) evidence base for the attribution. During the question portion of the briefing, Bossert was asked about the evidence basis for the attribution and he stated: “We took a lot of time to look through classified, sensitive information. What we did was rely on -- and some of it I can't share, unfortunately -- technical links to previously identified North Korean cyber tools, tradecraft, operational infrastructure. We had to examine a lot. And we had to put it together in a way that allowed us to make a confident attribution.  ”\nAbove, we see Bossert assert that the US developed and shared its analysis with its partners, and on that evidence, made their attribution of the origin of WannaCry to North Korea. The often-classified nature of the potential or actual emerging technological threat results in governments not being able to provide the public with the evidence for cyber threat attribution.\n### NotPetya\nClosely following the WannaCry cyber-attack, the NotPetya cyber-attack occurred on June 27, 2017. Kaspersky Lab reported infections in France, Germany, Italy, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, but the majority of infections were occurring in Russia and the Ukraine where more than 80 companies were attacked . It mainly targeted businesses as one of the initial propagation vectors was through the financial software MeDoc . Kaspersky Lab argued NotPetya was the costliest cyber-attack the world has seen with its deleterious effects reaching some ten billion US dollars .\nNotPetya was a variation of the 2016 Petya software, which was originally an e-mail-spread ransomware that encrypted hard drives and asked for payment . However, Kaspersky Lab was quick to state that this attack was from a separate malware family, and utilized the Eternal Blue windows exploit . Where NotPetya was radically different was that it masqueraded as ransomware but was, in fact, what is known as a “wiper” that permanently deleted material on a computer's hard drive . Moreover, it particularly affected businesses in Ukraine, with some 75% of incidents reported in that nation. It then spread globally to the business partners of those initially affected,\nwith 9% of incidents occurring in Germany, and the Danish shipping company, Maersk, being particularly affected by the attack . Where WannaCry was global and relatively indiscriminate ransomware, NotPetya was a disguised, targeted attack on a particular nation-state's financial infrastructure.\nIn January 2018, the Washington Post stated that the CIA had attributed the NotPetya attack to Russian military hackers . Reportedly, its sources claimed “The GRU military spy agency created NotPetya, the CIA concluded with ‘high confidence' in November, according to classified reports cited by USA intelligence officials” . On February 15, 2018, the White House released a brief press statement that attributed NotPetya to the Russian military:\n> In June 2017, the Russian military launched the most destructive and costly cyber-attack in history... The attack, dubbed “NotPetya”, quickly spread worldwide, causing billions of dollars in damage across Europe, Asia, and the Americas. It was part of the Kremlin's ongoing effort to destabilize Ukraine and demonstrates ever more clearly Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict. This was also a reckless and indiscriminate cyber-attack that will be met with international consequences.\n>\n> (Statement from the Press Secretary, 2018)\nBy late February 2018, the NotPetya attack had been attributed by all Five Eyes nations as originating in Russia . United Kingdom Foreign Office minister Lord Tariq Ahmad attributed the NotPetya cyber-attack to the Russian government, stating “The UK Government judges that the Russian Government, specifically the Russian military, was responsible for the destructive NotPetya cyber-attack of June 2017” (Foreign Office Minister condemns Russia, 2018). The rationale for this attribution was: “The decision to publicly attribute this incident underlines the fact that the UK and its allies will not tolerate malicious cyber activity” (Foreign Office Minister condemns Russia, 2018). Clear attribution for the attacks was leveled at the Russian military from across the Five Eyes nations, but, again, it is difficult to discern how and where evidence for this attribution arose and was then shared between these nations.\n### The April 2018 Five Eyes head of state cybersecurity meeting\nThe Five Eyes condemnation of the Russian cyber-attack occurred on April 18, 2018, when four heads of state (Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and New Zealand) met at the United Kingdom's National Cyber Centre . The meeting publicly attributed the NotPetya Ukraine cyber-attack to Russia. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made the claim that Russia has been “using cyberwarfare as part of a wider effort to attack and undermine the international system” (ibid). In this meeting, British Prime Minister Theresa May described the Five Eyes alliance as “a unique security and intelligence-sharing partnership” that “has done much to protect our people from a range of threats”\n(ibid). In particular, with regard to Russian hacking, she added: “I have been clear to Russia that we know what it is doing. And we should be in no doubt that such cyberwarfare is one of the great challenges of our time” (ibid). Five Eyes's attribution discourse was universal in its condemnation. Another dimension to the trust challenges that the chapter has already outlined is that, in this example for both the Five Eyes governments and their populations, the attribution was denied by Russia . Consequently, without presentation of the shared evidence, the cyber-attack attribution became contested, effectively creating a he-said/she-said situation between the various parties linked to ongoing great power competition.\n### The New Zealand attribution\nThe New Zealand government attributed both the WannaCry and NotPetya cyberattacks to Russia and North Korea in line with their Five Eyes partners. However, I have not found a New Zealand government source stating that the nation has seen shared ‘classified evidence' for these threat attributions. Official releases from the GSCB, in terms of both WannaCry (Government Communications Services Bureau, 2017b) and NotPetya (Government Communications Services Bureau, 2018), simply state the agency supports their international partners' condemnation. As we can see from Tom Bossert's statement above, he stated that attribution evidence for WannaCry was shared with its Five Eyes partners, specifically naming New Zealand. This means that the public must trust the government's discourse, and it is not clear whether its representatives have seen their partner's evidence of attribution or are simply repeating the attribution. We have to trust (or not) that they have seen evidence. To contextualize the New Zealand support, these attributions coincided with a significant 2018 government focus on cybersecurity as a key threat in the national security threat landscape .\nThe 2018 Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC) Cyber Security Strategy Refresh stated that “New Zealand recognizes that the relevance of cybersecurity concerns now extends across multiple branches of government” (Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, 2018a, p. 6). The primary responsibility for cybersecurity is given to the Government Communications Security Bureau, which delivers signals intelligence. A close look at the government's cyber discourse in 2018 shows a discourse had emerged across the national security sector where a cyber technological threat was being attributed to Russia and North Korea. This threat attribution discourse is usually accompanied by an argument that New Zealand is not immune from this threat, and that additional cyber infrastructure development is required. For example, in February 2018, Andrew Hampton, the director general of the GCSB (Government Communications Security Bureau, 2018), stated, “In terms of cyber threats, the GCSB noted a 15% increase in serious incidents affecting New Zealand in the year to June 2017”, and that “The GCSB's international partners have today attributed the NotPetya cyber-attack to the Russian Government”. Here we see that the attribution for NotPetya is sourced from Five Eyes partners, and it is not made clear whether the\nstatement was made simply in support of, or after reviewing classified evidence supplied by their partners.\nSimilarly, in the 2018 winter issue of Line of Defence the Right Honorable Andrew Little, Minister Responsible for the GCSB and NZSIS stated:\n> In February, the Government added New Zealand's voice to the international condemnation of the NotPetya cyber-attack which international partners have now attributed to the Russian Government. It targeted Ukraine but had a global impact -- including affecting supply chains in New Zealand. In December, New Zealand also expressed concern about international reports which link North Korea to the major WannaCry ransomware campaign.\n>\n> A similar type of attribution claim can also be found in the July 2018 Ministry of Defense Strategic Defence Policy Statement which states that:\n> Physical distance is no protection in cyberspace, and New Zealand is subject to a growing cyber threat from state sponsored and other malicious actors... Cyber blurs boundaries between conflict and peace, and public and private. (...)\n>\n> Russian ‘active measures' in the 2016 United States Presidential election brought to light ‘cyber enabled information warfare' as a disrupter in liberal democracies. (...)\n>\n> North Korea has a substantial store of chemical and biological weapons, a significant cyber capability (which it has shown a willingness to use).\n>\n> (Ministry of Defence, 2018, pp. 18--21)\nAcross these three examples, and more recently in the 2019 New Zealand cyber-security strategy (Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, 2019), we clearly see attributions of cyber threat to Russia and North Korea. We also see in all these examples that the threat attribution for cyber-attacks occurring across nation-states is linked explicitly to a governmental claim that there is a growing cyber threat environment impacting adversely on New Zealand's national security and, by implication, that there is an increased need for investment in the nation's cyber infrastructure. The implication is that cyber-attacks represent a form of virtual domain of threat that circumvents the nation's geographic isolation and that while it may not be a direct target of any such future attack, both WannaCry and NotPetya demonstrated the ability these attacks have to deliver collateral damage on a global scale. Nevertheless, we still need to better understand what might motivate such a small nation to make explicit attribution claims.\n## Cyber threat attribution\nCyber attribution is generally understood to be a difficult technical process . Commonly, the challenge of attributing a cyber-threat has created problems for nations trying to establish deterrence against\nforeign actors . However, it is the political construction of cyber threat attribution in national security that is useful here. Myriam Dunn Calvety (2013, p. 105) argued that “The link between cyberspace and national security is often presented as an unquestionable and uncontested ‘truth'. However, there is nothing natural or given about this link: It had to be forged, argued, and accepted in the (security) political process”. She argues that cybersecurity discourse is, in fact, constituted by a variety of authority figures in governments. For Dunn Calvety, the political nature of cyber discourse is further complicated by the fact that the very building blocks of cybersecurity language employ analogies or metaphors to describe and explain the effect of unsolicited changes in code across networks. Similar to a conceptualization of disease as an attack , this metaphorical language of cyber “attack” and “weapons” is potentially distorting and results in a tendency to describe the cyber landscape as unruly, dangerous, or threatening, when, in fact, much of the cyber environment is benign and intended to be enabling.\nOne consequence of the political construction of cyber discourse is that there are real risks when it comes to generating accurate attribution claims. Thomas Rid and Ben Buchanan (2015, p. 4) argue, “Doing attribution well is at the core of virtually all forms of coercion and deterrence, international and domestic. Doing it poorly undermines a state's credibility, its effectiveness, and ultimately it's liberty and security”. When it comes to cybersecurity, the attribution debate is evolving surprisingly slowly, and this slowness remains the case today . Rid and Buchanan (2015, p. 4) provide a detailed technical account of the attribution process, where they conclude that developing the evidence for cyberattack attribution is a difficult and costly process which inevitably only indicates the likely source of an attack. Moreover, this evidence cannot easily determine motive or the political gain that may have initially motivated an attack. They conclude with the finding that attribution is what states make of it, and public attribution is a political act used by states to legitimate security positioning. If we are to follow Rid and Buchanan's logic, we could understand the Five Eyes attribution of cyber threat to Russia and North Korea as a broader function of what is at stake politically in terms of the broader relations between these nations.\nIn the New Zealand case study, the combination of technical evidence challenges and political nature of attribution claims is made explicit when we look closely at the GCSB's National Cyber Security Centre Annual report, where it states:\n> Publicly reporting attribution is a significant [political] decision and is not made by the NCSC alone. Public attribution is one way to reduce the efficacy of malicious cyber actors by revealing their tools or increasing the reputational costs of illegitimate activity. However, it also carries risk for New Zealand and is considered alongside our other national objectives, including the need to maintain our ability to protect the networks that are of importance...\n>\n> (Government Communications Service Bureau, 2017a, p. 12)\nGiven that there is academic and local technical agreement that cyber threat attribution is ultimately a political act, why might this government be making these threat attribution claims -- why now and what might be the risks inherent in this attribution?\nThere are three possible explanations for this attribution. Firstly, there is a clear discussion in other sections of these documents that New Zealand is part of the Five Eyes network and is speaking in solidarity with its partners to increase the reputational costs of these activities. The challenge here is that when there is no unclassified evidence to support these attribution claims (there was commercial evidence for WannaCry but none for NotPetya), the public must trust the veracity and motives of these partners, and they must trust that their politicians are maintaining an independent policy stance. For example, Reuben Steff's chapter in this volume (Chapter 3) explains that small states are traditionally considered to be “consumers” of security technology supplied by larger states, given they often cannot develop it on their own. This means that it is necessary for New Zealand to align itself with the US on key technological security issues, and the case suggested here is that this could extend to technological threat attribution too, in order to secure its relations to the US and maintain access to critical technology advances and supply. If this is the case, it fuels critical questions about the independence of the nation's foreign affairs policy , which, if undermined, would be a potential blow to public trust.\nA second explanation is sourced from DPMC's National Cyber Policy Office release of April 20, 2018, which takes the form of a letter written by the Right Honorable Claire Curran, then-minister of Broadcasting, Communication, and Digital Media. The topic of the letter is the Refresh of New Zealand's Cyber Security Strategy and Action Plan which resulted in 2019 Cybersecurity Strategy.\nClaire Curran stated:\n> The clear trend is an upward trajectory of cyber security threats... New Zealand's geographical location does not exempt us from this threat... We will need to consider the mechanisms available to us to dissuade or deter malicious cyber activities, particularly where it is state-sponsored, or state condoned. This includes the option of publicly attributing malicious cyber activity as a way of holding states to account.\n>\n> (Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, 2018b, p. 4, p. 9)\nClearly, in the above document, the government has made an active political decision to publicly attribute what it describes as malicious cyber activity to particular nation-states as part of “expanding its international cyber efforts” (ibid). The challenge is that the source and reliability of classified evidence for the threat and the rationale for public attribution are unable to be made transparent, and the public is being represented by this claim. Here, the public is asked to trust that the correct decisions and attributions are being made as part of being a good international citizen and that the government is not being selective in who it calls to account.\nA third explanation comes from the Copenhagen school, which developed the securitization theory that focuses on “speech acts” and the significance these acts can have upon political agenda settings and political relations . Securitization theory suggests that when a threat is identified and a “speech act” identifying it is utilized, this discourse prioritizes the threat on the political agenda in such a way that it necessitates the development of urgent mitigation measures that could potentially extend even to the encroachment of privacy, the need for secrecy, and the utilization of force . For the Copenhagen school, securitization speech acts emphasize the dangers of the cyber threat environment and legitimate additional government funding for the construction of various infrastructures designed to protect the public from the threat. The challenge here, again, is that the speech acts have the power for change, not any classified evidential basis that may sit behind the act. When it comes to cyber threats, the public has no choice but to trust that those who are making the speech act are fully informed by subject matter experts and are making the best national security decisions possible.\nTaken together, these explanations suggest that the various 2018--2019 New Zealand Cybersecurity attribution speech acts appear designed to: Align New Zealand closer to its Five Eyes partnersCall out certain acts of cyber aggression where New Zealand can then position itself as a good international cyber citizenBe used as a mechanism to dissuade or deter malicious cyber activity by publicly attributing the activity to hold states to accountCreate, justify, and legitimate the development of additional domestic cybersecurity infrastructure\nTogether, these four purposes suggest that the attributions are being utilized for both international and domestic positioning in terms of alignment with our partners, being a good international citizen, and creating global and domestic cyber infrastructures to further New Zealand's interests and safety.\n## Public trust and national security discourse\nIn a civil society environment where the evidence for attribution is unavailable and the integrity of state institutions such as the GSCB  or the Minister for Broadcasting's judgement has recently been called into doubt , it is possible that future trust and confidence issues may arise around the efficacy of this language and the effectiveness of current government cyber initiatives. In 2015 and 2016, similar trust and confidence issues occurred in the justification of counter terrorism funding , where evidence of a domestic Muslim radicalization threat has never eventuated and the claim of the “Jihadi bride” risk was found by the media to have little evidentiary basis and to have been exaggerated  and shifted attention away from the right wing. It is clear that, at least within the New Zealand Fourth Estate (News\nMedia), there is a tendency to critically examine government security discourse rather than trust it implicitly, and it is this view that underpins their reporting to the population . Serious issues around trust in government security discourse and action resulted in recent wholesale reform of the New Zealand intelligence agency legislation with the creation of the Intelligence and Security Act 2017 governing the NZSIS and GSCB . Further destabilization of public trust in security agencies is also evident with ongoing “inquiries” into the New Zealand Defence Force's actions in Afghanistan (Operation Burnham Inquiry 2020) and the Christchurch Terror attacks (Christchurch Attack Royal Commission 2020), where the integrity of national security apparatus and discourse has been brought into contention by investigative journalists , expert commentators, or community groups (Ainge Roy, 2019), creating a situation where it is impossible to know whose claim is trustworthy . All the national security organizations (NZDF, GCSB, DPMC, and NZSIS) under investigation in these two inquiries are the same agencies producing the cybersecurity attributions. While clear distinctions need to be made between these individual one-off events and the general effectiveness of these agencies' everyday business and their successful operations, these examples show that they are regularly and recently seen by the public to have their integrity brought into doubt.\nThese types of one-off trust challenges to national security agency integrity are also seen at the international level. In 2013, WikiLeaks released an electronic dispersal of NSA classified material of some 1.7 million documents that had been leaked by Edward Snowden. These documents suggested strongly that the NSA, and perhaps also its Five Eyes partners, were engaged in regular global surveillance of their domestic populations . Again, it was impossible to know the truth of this claim based on open-source information, but part of the multifaceted collateral damage caused by this leak is a tarnishing of the reputation of the Five Eyes's agencies within their own populations where trust and confidence in those intelligence agencies is diminished in the eyes of the public.\nIn 2016, an additional social media technological challenge emerged for government discourse by the name of fake news . Social media allows content to be passed between providers with no verification of its authenticity (ibid). Morgan (2018, p. 39) asserts that this verification problem allows disinformation and what is described as fake news to manipulate the public sphere and has the effect of “declining levels of trust in institutions and experts”. There are significant implications for democracy and free speech emerging from this phenomenon. When it comes to intelligence agency claims, the discussion of fake news is particularly pertinent when it comes to the relationship between US President Donald Trump and his intelligence agencies . Over a number of highly publicized national security issues related to Iran, ISIS, North Korea, and Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election, the president has called the discourse of his intelligence agencies into question. Donald Trump effectively stated that the intelligence agency claims are fake news and that the integrity of their discourse needs to be stringently questioned.\nConversely, one must ask why should the public trust Donald Trump, who has a conflict of interest because of investigations into his own actions, over politically neutral actors? Consequently, it is sensible for the public to ask whose security claim should be trusted and why? When it comes to Russian interference in the US election, Thirdway.org data show that the Donald Trump/James Comey counterclaims have created significant confusion about whose security discourse to trust (Eoyang et al, 2018). The broader ramification of such a claim is that all intelligence agency discourse, including that of cyber threat attribution, could be questioned and further magnifies the question over how Five Eyes partners, and their respective public, know who they should trust.\nAn essential assumption of my argument is that a problem of trust exists today when it comes to the public receiving national security agency discourse. How does one define trust? In political science, it has been traditionally assumed that “Trust is relational; it involves an individual making herself vulnerable to another individual, group, or institution that has the capacity to do her harm or betray her” . Trust can be understood as dichotomous in that one trusts or one does not, but trust relations can also be a sliding scale of degrees of trust. For example, Western populations give their trust to their national security agencies to be protected from cyber threats . That trust is essential for cyberspace to function and for governance and security of that critical infrastructure (Azmi et al, 2018, p. 258).\nHenschke and Ford (2017, p. 82) have argued that since the Snowden releases there has been a breakdown in the public's trust of national security agencies.\n> The cost here is in the public's willingness and capacity to trust in state mechanisms of national and international security, especially those intelligence programmes involving cyber-surveillance. The loss of trust in this area is particularly detrimental to the effective functioning of national security.\n>\n> For Henschke and Ford (2017, p. 82), there is a twofold element of trust in the relationship between national security agencies and the public: 1) That surveillance is necessary and 2) that intelligence activities must be kept secret from the public. The challenge of Snowden (and likewise the GCSB's illegal spying on Kim Dotcom)  is that the Five Eyes nations were “caught out abusing this trust risk losing the goodwill of the public. If the public's trust in this area is lost and the government is judged as untrustworthy, then effective governing can become more difficult” . Pew data since the Snowdon releases reveal that the American public's approval for surveillance of citizens has declined as has their confidence that their government can protect their private data . Thirdway.org suggests that in relation to contentious national security issues, most Americans did not know whose claim to trust (Eoyang et al, 2018). The poll data are not conclusive in showing a loss of trust in national security discourse, but it certainly demonstrates a public confusion and a lack of implicit unquestioned trust in national security discourse.\nGiven that recent Pew data also suggest the public believe there will be increasing cyber threats to elections and national security infrastructure , it is essential that trust is maintained. Ultimately, the loss of public trust is counterproductive for effective national security  because it leads to increasing media scrutiny and hyperbole, which then adversely impacts security agency transparency in terms of comfort levels with communicating to the public and not over classifying internal documentation. Thus, when it comes to making cyber-security policy, Ball et al (2019, p. 103) have argued that “Cybersecurity policymaking at the national level should be attentive to the central role of trust for maintaining resilient cyber systems -- and it should have plans in place to repair trust”. Trust therefore is an essential element of cyber-governance. To create trust with the public, governments must be seen to be active, careful, and deliberate in the policy and infrastructure they create and sustain to keep cyberspace safe, both domestically and globally. All these activities (including attribution) will be more effective if trust has not been reduced by earlier state failings and when/if a government can be transparent.\n## Conclusion: Addressing the contestability of attribution discourse\nIn this chapter, my intention has been to argue that, when it comes to cyber threat attribution claims made by governments, it is not always clear whose claim to trust or to what extent. There are inherent challenges in cyber threat attribution discourse: a) The evidence for attribution is not publicly verifiable, b) attribution is inherently political, c) the public must choose to trust attribution discourse or not, and d) attribution discourse often comes from institutions whose integrity has been brought into question elsewhere (this decreases trust). Given these concerns, we can say that there is a trust and confidence challenge that must be addressed by governments when it comes to the production of such discourse in the future.\nAs a social scientist, I traditionally look for empirical evidence to back a claim; without it, we are, at best, left with circumstantial evidence or, at worst, simply a truth claim. Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that the public do not (and perhaps should not) have access to classified empirical data to make assessments about the efficacy of cybersecurity decisions and discourse . This creates a grey zone where cyber-attacks and their attributions live in a contested space of discourse between evidence and trust, where maintaining trust in government action is essential. I have demonstrated that attribution claims are inherently political and are contestable by both the accuser and the accused. While the effects of cyber-attacks are very real, communication about their effects and the intentions and motives behind an attack exist in a land of metaphor and discourse. This makes national security discourse around cyber-attacks contestable; a fact that is exacerbated by an inclination across social media, traditional media, and even the president of the US (with his conflict of interest) to question the integrity of these attribution claims. Therefore, a social scientific crisis emerges where, because of the classified nature of the evidence, the public is asked to trust\nand have confidence in a technological threat attribution claim without any further assurance. Consequently, it is then sensible for the public to ask whose security claim should be believed and why.\nIn modern democracies, trust in government is a key indicator of political legitimacy and stability . Key questions for governments and populations are how and when do we trust the national security discourse of our government. A lack of trust inherently undermines and frustrates the positive intent of governments to keep their citizenry safe. In a contemporary environment where the national security discourse of a nation such as New Zealand (not to mention many other states) can be contested, it seems a critical social responsibility for security policy makers and academia to first acknowledge this trust and confidence conundrum and then strive to develop frameworks to better understand the trust and confidence challenges around threat attribution and apply it to this emerging cyber discourse. How to ensure that there is trust and confidence in the government's ability to identify, communicate, and respond to technological national security threats will be essential 21st-century governance questions for democracies.\nUnfortunately, civil society cannot be relied upon to meet such a challenge. A civic challenge exists for both government and academia to consider how to best address the inherent weakness (that they are political and contestable) that exists in national security threat attributions. Ideally, probably the most effective manner in which cyber attribution could be separated from the individual interests of nation-states or commercial entities is if some form of international legal attribution agency was formed. However, realistic solutions to the attribution problem must come from individual governments, who should be sufficiently motivated to increase the efficacy of its security apparatus by decreasing potential criticism of its discourse.\nThe producers of national security discourse must acknowledge that these weaknesses exist in their discourse and that it is their responsibility to find ways to mitigate these challenges. This is critical because WannaCry and NotPetya have shown us that cyber issues are changing the national security landscape indelibly. While care is required around cyber hyperbole and metaphor, the potential scale, spread, and damage of future attacks could be catastrophic. Governments need to find better ways to effectively communicate with each other, their opponents, and their own populations when it comes to mitigating these challenges.\nIt is important to conclude by asking what might be possible solutions to respond to the technological cyber-attack attribution challenge? First, cyber discourse makers must accept that national security discourse justifications that arise from classified sources cannot always provide a persuasive public evidence basis for their assertions. Second, cyber discourse makers should acknowledge that their claims are inherently political and therefore potentially contestable. Such acknowledgment would allow the discourse to be more reflexive and to self-regulate its claims in a more nuanced manner. Nuanced cyber threat discourse lessens the possibility that a government institution or representative will be subsequently called to account for making an incorrect or exaggerated claim. Governments\nCyber threat and national security policy 235\nshould look to employ these observations in the communication tools that they already possess. Cybersecurity strategy refreshes offer a real opportunity to engage with the public. They can focus both on private enterprise and the public. They can offer an education capacity and more transparency around the nature of various cyber threats. One place where a degree of transparency and limited evidence can exist for the actual nature and prevalence of cyber threats is in the annual reports from their National Cyber Security Centers (see Government Communications Security Bureau, 2017a). These carefully constructed and communicated reports and data could and should be more widely distributed, publicized, and utilized as an evidence basis for future claims. And lastly, one additional way to address the confidence challenge and limited trust around secrecy in national security discourse is to regularly craft language that clearly notes that a fine balance exists between secrecy and transparency. This balance relies heavily on building a trusting and transparent relationship between government officials and the public while working to repair any past breaches of confidence.",

      "flat_text": "# 13 Cyber threat attribution, trust and confidence, and the contestability of national security policy\nWilliam Hoverd\n## Introduction\nToday, we regularly hear that Chinese company Huawei is a source of vulnerability for Western nations, and that North Korea and Russia are sources of cyber threats. Western populations are being asked to trust the word of intelligence agencies and world leaders that these unspecified emerging technological threats are real. The often-classified nature of a potential or emerging technological threat results in governments not being able to provide the public with an evidence base for threat attribution, and, even if such evidence were released to the public, how would they even begin to understand the origins of deleterious and malicious code? The challenges around cyber threat evidence create a situation for the public where government threat attribution discourse must be trusted (or not) by those receiving it.¹ Schluzke (2018, p. 954) recently argued that this form of cyber attribution creates an uncertainty in the mind of the public and that, given state knowledge is necessarily classified in this domain, care needs to be taken by cyber policy makers when crafting language around cyber-attacks. This chapter will argue that the threat potential posed by emerging technologies produces trust and confidence issues for Western populations, (Henschke &amp; Brandt Ford, 2017, p. 82) as the public is asked to trust and have confidence that a government’s particular technological threat attribution claim is accurate, and that robust classified evidence for this attribution exists and it is not being used selectively.\nIn recent years, narrative, counter narrative, spin, classified material, and “fake news” have politicized intelligence and cybersecurity discourse in such a way, that official security discourse is potentially contestable. Consequently, it is sensible for the public to ask: Whose security claim should be trusted and why? Likewise, given that there can be skepticism around this discourse, it seems a critical social responsibility for security policy makers and academia to first acknowledge this conundrum and then strive to develop frameworks to better understand the trust and confidence challenges around technological threat attribution.\nThe task of academia is to undertake constructive criticism by highlighting the nature of an issue of concern and then concluding by suggesting possible solutions. In a volume devoted to emerging technologies, a broader phenomenon has emerged where issues of trust and the potential for deception that results from new technology\nhave significant ramifications for the social contract between the state and the population and how they are both secured. The age-old balance between human liberty and security is being continually addressed in response to the evolving technologies of attack and defense that are occurring globally across the cyber realm.\nThe chapter begins by outlining the recent Five Eyes (USA, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) condemnations of Russian and North Korean cyber policy as a sociological case study to illustrate where and if a technological threat attribution and trust and confidence challenge might be evident. Focus is given to the recent WannaCry (2017) and NotPetya (2017) cyber-attacks that have been attributed to these nations. This case study of the Five Eyes condemnation is used to sketch out how the contestability of national security strategy and government security discourse can present specific trust and confidence challenges around national security discourse for both the public and the government. To illustrate the challenges surrounding contemporary issues of technological threat attribution, it focuses on the smallest member of the Five Eyes alliance, the nation of New Zealand. The case study will compare and contrast the language of the government executive and that of the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) when they attributed these two attacks to North Korea (WannaCry) and Russia (NotPetya).\nThis attribution discussion then returns to the broader context where, especially after the accusations of Edward Snowden, trust and confidence in the security actions and motives of the Five Eyes intelligence partners have been questioned. The chapter argues that trust and confidence challenges around the political nature of the Five Eyes cyber attribution is potentially exacerbated by two factors: That the invisible nature of the cyber realm can only be communicated by metaphor. This naturally leads to conflict-laden hyperbole that creates notions of cyber war and cyber threat that may not be helpful for thinking about the intentionally deployed deleterious and malicious effects of code (Lawson, 2012)That the development of the notion of fake news accusations (and other such accusations) brings into question the trustworthiness of the discourse of national security agencies\nLastly, the purpose of the chapter's conclusion is to move the content and goals of the chapter beyond simple problem definition to the initiation of a discussion of potential solutions to technological threat attribution, trust and confidence issues, and the contestability of national security policy when it comes to cyber attribution.\nWe now turn to review two recent global cyber-attacks, which the Five Eyes nations have publicly stated as deeply influencing their extant national security decision-making -- especially around cybersecurity.\n## The WannaCry and NotPetya cyber-attacks and the Five Eyes attributions\nThe Five Eyes intelligence sharing network's condemnation of North Korea and Russian cyber policy concentrated on the threat and damage caused by WannaCry\n(2017) and NotPetya (2017), two cyber-attacks attributed to these nations, respectively. Together these two attacks represent the two most costly cyber-attacks that the world has experienced to date (Snow, 2018).\nWannaCry was a ransomware crypto-worm that, in May 2017, attacked computers using the Windows operating platform (Martin et al, 2018, p. 361). It utilized the Eternal Blue exploit developed by the NSA, which had been stolen by the organization or state that used it for this attack. Once loaded onto the platform, it would encrypt data and then demand payment in bitcoin to release the data. Europol (BBC News, 2017) claimed that it had infected some 75,000 computers across 99 countries within a day, including 48 UK National Health Service (NHS) trusts, leaving doctors unable to retrieve patient information (Martin et al, 2018, p. 361). Ultimately, Kaspersky Lab analysis noted that the attack affected some 200,000 computers across 150 countries (Snow, 2018) with much of this occurring within 24 hours (Jones, 2017). Microsoft was able to respond quickly to the attack by deploying emergency patches that prevented the crypto-worm's spread. Nevertheless, variants of WannaCry were still emerging in 2018, hitting Boeing (Mathews, 2018) in May and Taiwanese Apple chipmaker TSMC in August (Leswing, 2018).\nWhat was unprecedented about the WannaCry attack was its indiscriminate global scale and its rapid spread, as well as its payload's ability to disrupt essential services and business. The cost of the disruption caused by the attack is significant, estimated at being between four and eight billion US dollars (Snow, 2018). Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, stated that a global technological problem was emerging where governments were stockpiling cyber weapons that, if stolen, as in the case of Eternal Blue, create the potential for indiscriminate attacks like this to occur (Smith, 2017). He went on to argue that:\n> The governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call. They need to take a different approach and adhere in cyberspace to the same rules applied to weapons in the physical world. We need governments to consider the damage to civilians that comes from hoarding these vulnerabilities and the use of these exploits.\n>\n> (Smith, 2017)\nThe immense scale of the attack and the possibilities for further attack that WannaCry augured, indicated that globally a shift was required to address the perpetrators of such attacks.\nAttribution for WannaCry was formally announced by the White House in December 2017 (Bossert, 2017). USA Homeland Security advisor, Tom Bossert, stated that:\n> After careful investigation, the United States is publicly attributing the massive WannaCry cyberattack to North Korea. We do not make this allegation lightly. We do so with evidence, and we do so with partners. Other governments and private companies agree. The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada,\nNew Zealand, and Japan have seen our analysis, and they join us in denouncing North Korea for WannaCry. Commercial partners have also acted. Microsoft traced the attack to cyber affiliates of the North Korean government, and others in the security community have contributed their analysis. (Bossert 2017, p. 1) ”\nUsefully, here we see that commercial attributions for these attacks also exist to support government attributions. The global or, more specifically, US-led Five Eyes attribution for the WannaCry cyber-attack was made against North Korea, and here there was a stated (classified/private) evidence base for the attribution. During the question portion of the briefing, Bossert was asked about the evidence basis for the attribution and he stated: “We took a lot of time to look through classified, sensitive information. What we did was rely on -- and some of it I can't share, unfortunately -- technical links to previously identified North Korean cyber tools, tradecraft, operational infrastructure. We had to examine a lot. And we had to put it together in a way that allowed us to make a confident attribution. (Bossert, 2017) ”\nAbove, we see Bossert assert that the US developed and shared its analysis with its partners, and on that evidence, made their attribution of the origin of WannaCry to North Korea. The often-classified nature of the potential or actual emerging technological threat results in governments not being able to provide the public with the evidence for cyber threat attribution.\n### NotPetya\nClosely following the WannaCry cyber-attack, the NotPetya cyber-attack occurred on June 27, 2017. Kaspersky Lab reported infections in France, Germany, Italy, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, but the majority of infections were occurring in Russia and the Ukraine where more than 80 companies were attacked (Snow, 2017). It mainly targeted businesses as one of the initial propagation vectors was through the financial software MeDoc (Snow, 2018). Kaspersky Lab argued NotPetya was the costliest cyber-attack the world has seen with its deleterious effects reaching some ten billion US dollars (Snow, 2018).\nNotPetya was a variation of the 2016 Petya software, which was originally an e-mail-spread ransomware that encrypted hard drives and asked for payment (Snow, 2017, p. 1). However, Kaspersky Lab was quick to state that this attack was from a separate malware family, and utilized the Eternal Blue windows exploit (Robot, 2017, p. 1). Where NotPetya was radically different was that it masqueraded as ransomware but was, in fact, what is known as a “wiper” that permanently deleted material on a computer's hard drive (Robot, 2017). Moreover, it particularly affected businesses in Ukraine, with some 75% of incidents reported in that nation. It then spread globally to the business partners of those initially affected,\nwith 9% of incidents occurring in Germany, and the Danish shipping company, Maersk, being particularly affected by the attack (Schwartz, 2018). Where WannaCry was global and relatively indiscriminate ransomware, NotPetya was a disguised, targeted attack on a particular nation-state's financial infrastructure.\nIn January 2018, the Washington Post stated that the CIA had attributed the NotPetya attack to Russian military hackers (Nakashima, 2018). Reportedly, its sources claimed “The GRU military spy agency created NotPetya, the CIA concluded with ‘high confidence' in November, according to classified reports cited by USA intelligence officials” (Nakashima, 2018). On February 15, 2018, the White House released a brief press statement that attributed NotPetya to the Russian military:\n> In June 2017, the Russian military launched the most destructive and costly cyber-attack in history... The attack, dubbed “NotPetya”, quickly spread worldwide, causing billions of dollars in damage across Europe, Asia, and the Americas. It was part of the Kremlin's ongoing effort to destabilize Ukraine and demonstrates ever more clearly Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict. This was also a reckless and indiscriminate cyber-attack that will be met with international consequences.\n>\n> (Statement from the Press Secretary, 2018)\nBy late February 2018, the NotPetya attack had been attributed by all Five Eyes nations as originating in Russia (Bussoletti, 2018). United Kingdom Foreign Office minister Lord Tariq Ahmad attributed the NotPetya cyber-attack to the Russian government, stating “The UK Government judges that the Russian Government, specifically the Russian military, was responsible for the destructive NotPetya cyber-attack of June 2017” (Foreign Office Minister condemns Russia, 2018). The rationale for this attribution was: “The decision to publicly attribute this incident underlines the fact that the UK and its allies will not tolerate malicious cyber activity” (Foreign Office Minister condemns Russia, 2018). Clear attribution for the attacks was leveled at the Russian military from across the Five Eyes nations, but, again, it is difficult to discern how and where evidence for this attribution arose and was then shared between these nations.\n### The April 2018 Five Eyes head of state cybersecurity meeting\nThe Five Eyes condemnation of the Russian cyber-attack occurred on April 18, 2018, when four heads of state (Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and New Zealand) met at the United Kingdom's National Cyber Centre (Waldie, 2018). The meeting publicly attributed the NotPetya Ukraine cyber-attack to Russia. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made the claim that Russia has been “using cyberwarfare as part of a wider effort to attack and undermine the international system” (ibid). In this meeting, British Prime Minister Theresa May described the Five Eyes alliance as “a unique security and intelligence-sharing partnership” that “has done much to protect our people from a range of threats”\n(ibid). In particular, with regard to Russian hacking, she added: “I have been clear to Russia that we know what it is doing. And we should be in no doubt that such cyberwarfare is one of the great challenges of our time” (ibid). Five Eyes's attribution discourse was universal in its condemnation. Another dimension to the trust challenges that the chapter has already outlined is that, in this example for both the Five Eyes governments and their populations, the attribution was denied by Russia (Marsh, 2018). Consequently, without presentation of the shared evidence, the cyber-attack attribution became contested, effectively creating a he-said/she-said situation between the various parties linked to ongoing great power competition.\n### The New Zealand attribution\nThe New Zealand government attributed both the WannaCry and NotPetya cyberattacks to Russia and North Korea in line with their Five Eyes partners. However, I have not found a New Zealand government source stating that the nation has seen shared ‘classified evidence' for these threat attributions. Official releases from the GSCB, in terms of both WannaCry (Government Communications Services Bureau, 2017b) and NotPetya (Government Communications Services Bureau, 2018), simply state the agency supports their international partners' condemnation. As we can see from Tom Bossert's statement above, he stated that attribution evidence for WannaCry was shared with its Five Eyes partners, specifically naming New Zealand. This means that the public must trust the government's discourse, and it is not clear whether its representatives have seen their partner's evidence of attribution or are simply repeating the attribution. We have to trust (or not) that they have seen evidence. To contextualize the New Zealand support, these attributions coincided with a significant 2018 government focus on cybersecurity as a key threat in the national security threat landscape (Little, 2018, p. 33).\nThe 2018 Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC) Cyber Security Strategy Refresh stated that “New Zealand recognizes that the relevance of cybersecurity concerns now extends across multiple branches of government” (Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, 2018a, p. 6). The primary responsibility for cybersecurity is given to the Government Communications Security Bureau, which delivers signals intelligence. A close look at the government's cyber discourse in 2018 shows a discourse had emerged across the national security sector where a cyber technological threat was being attributed to Russia and North Korea. This threat attribution discourse is usually accompanied by an argument that New Zealand is not immune from this threat, and that additional cyber infrastructure development is required. For example, in February 2018, Andrew Hampton, the director general of the GCSB (Government Communications Security Bureau, 2018), stated, “In terms of cyber threats, the GCSB noted a 15% increase in serious incidents affecting New Zealand in the year to June 2017”, and that “The GCSB's international partners have today attributed the NotPetya cyber-attack to the Russian Government”. Here we see that the attribution for NotPetya is sourced from Five Eyes partners, and it is not made clear whether the\nstatement was made simply in support of, or after reviewing classified evidence supplied by their partners.\nSimilarly, in the 2018 winter issue of Line of Defence the Right Honorable Andrew Little, Minister Responsible for the GCSB and NZSIS stated:\n> In February, the Government added New Zealand's voice to the international condemnation of the NotPetya cyber-attack which international partners have now attributed to the Russian Government. It targeted Ukraine but had a global impact -- including affecting supply chains in New Zealand. In December, New Zealand also expressed concern about international reports which link North Korea to the major WannaCry ransomware campaign.\n>\n> (Little, 2018, p. 33)\nA similar type of attribution claim can also be found in the July 2018 Ministry of Defense Strategic Defence Policy Statement which states that:\n> Physical distance is no protection in cyberspace, and New Zealand is subject to a growing cyber threat from state sponsored and other malicious actors... Cyber blurs boundaries between conflict and peace, and public and private. (...)\n>\n> Russian ‘active measures' in the 2016 United States Presidential election brought to light ‘cyber enabled information warfare' as a disrupter in liberal democracies. (...)\n>\n> North Korea has a substantial store of chemical and biological weapons, a significant cyber capability (which it has shown a willingness to use).\n>\n> (Ministry of Defence, 2018, pp. 18--21)\nAcross these three examples, and more recently in the 2019 New Zealand cyber-security strategy (Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, 2019), we clearly see attributions of cyber threat to Russia and North Korea. We also see in all these examples that the threat attribution for cyber-attacks occurring across nation-states is linked explicitly to a governmental claim that there is a growing cyber threat environment impacting adversely on New Zealand's national security and, by implication, that there is an increased need for investment in the nation's cyber infrastructure. The implication is that cyber-attacks represent a form of virtual domain of threat that circumvents the nation's geographic isolation and that while it may not be a direct target of any such future attack, both WannaCry and NotPetya demonstrated the ability these attacks have to deliver collateral damage on a global scale. Nevertheless, we still need to better understand what might motivate such a small nation to make explicit attribution claims.\n## Cyber threat attribution\nCyber attribution is generally understood to be a difficult technical process (Kello, 2013, p. 7; Lin, 2016, p. 75). Commonly, the challenge of attributing a cyber-threat has created problems for nations trying to establish deterrence against\nforeign actors (Lupovici, 2016, p. 322; Lindsay, 2015, p. 53). However, it is the political construction of cyber threat attribution in national security that is useful here. Myriam Dunn Calvety (2013, p. 105) argued that “The link between cyberspace and national security is often presented as an unquestionable and uncontested ‘truth'. However, there is nothing natural or given about this link: It had to be forged, argued, and accepted in the (security) political process”. She argues that cybersecurity discourse is, in fact, constituted by a variety of authority figures in governments. For Dunn Calvety, the political nature of cyber discourse is further complicated by the fact that the very building blocks of cybersecurity language employ analogies or metaphors to describe and explain the effect of unsolicited changes in code across networks. Similar to a conceptualization of disease as an attack (Sontag, 1978), this metaphorical language of cyber “attack” and “weapons” is potentially distorting and results in a tendency to describe the cyber landscape as unruly, dangerous, or threatening, when, in fact, much of the cyber environment is benign and intended to be enabling.\nOne consequence of the political construction of cyber discourse is that there are real risks when it comes to generating accurate attribution claims. Thomas Rid and Ben Buchanan (2015, p. 4) argue, “Doing attribution well is at the core of virtually all forms of coercion and deterrence, international and domestic. Doing it poorly undermines a state's credibility, its effectiveness, and ultimately it's liberty and security”. When it comes to cybersecurity, the attribution debate is evolving surprisingly slowly, and this slowness remains the case today (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 19). Rid and Buchanan (2015, p. 4) provide a detailed technical account of the attribution process, where they conclude that developing the evidence for cyberattack attribution is a difficult and costly process which inevitably only indicates the likely source of an attack. Moreover, this evidence cannot easily determine motive or the political gain that may have initially motivated an attack. They conclude with the finding that attribution is what states make of it, and public attribution is a political act used by states to legitimate security positioning. If we are to follow Rid and Buchanan's logic, we could understand the Five Eyes attribution of cyber threat to Russia and North Korea as a broader function of what is at stake politically in terms of the broader relations between these nations.\nIn the New Zealand case study, the combination of technical evidence challenges and political nature of attribution claims is made explicit when we look closely at the GCSB's National Cyber Security Centre Annual report, where it states:\n> Publicly reporting attribution is a significant [political] decision and is not made by the NCSC alone. Public attribution is one way to reduce the efficacy of malicious cyber actors by revealing their tools or increasing the reputational costs of illegitimate activity. However, it also carries risk for New Zealand and is considered alongside our other national objectives, including the need to maintain our ability to protect the networks that are of importance...\n>\n> (Government Communications Service Bureau, 2017a, p. 12)\nGiven that there is academic and local technical agreement that cyber threat attribution is ultimately a political act, why might this government be making these threat attribution claims -- why now and what might be the risks inherent in this attribution?\nThere are three possible explanations for this attribution. Firstly, there is a clear discussion in other sections of these documents that New Zealand is part of the Five Eyes network and is speaking in solidarity with its partners to increase the reputational costs of these activities. The challenge here is that when there is no unclassified evidence to support these attribution claims (there was commercial evidence for WannaCry but none for NotPetya), the public must trust the veracity and motives of these partners, and they must trust that their politicians are maintaining an independent policy stance. For example, Reuben Steff's chapter in this volume (Chapter 3) explains that small states are traditionally considered to be “consumers” of security technology supplied by larger states, given they often cannot develop it on their own. This means that it is necessary for New Zealand to align itself with the US on key technological security issues, and the case suggested here is that this could extend to technological threat attribution too, in order to secure its relations to the US and maintain access to critical technology advances and supply. If this is the case, it fuels critical questions about the independence of the nation's foreign affairs policy (Small, 2018, p. 1), which, if undermined, would be a potential blow to public trust.\nA second explanation is sourced from DPMC's National Cyber Policy Office release of April 20, 2018, which takes the form of a letter written by the Right Honorable Claire Curran, then-minister of Broadcasting, Communication, and Digital Media. The topic of the letter is the Refresh of New Zealand's Cyber Security Strategy and Action Plan which resulted in 2019 Cybersecurity Strategy.\nClaire Curran stated:\n> The clear trend is an upward trajectory of cyber security threats... New Zealand's geographical location does not exempt us from this threat... We will need to consider the mechanisms available to us to dissuade or deter malicious cyber activities, particularly where it is state-sponsored, or state condoned. This includes the option of publicly attributing malicious cyber activity as a way of holding states to account.\n>\n> (Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, 2018b, p. 4, p. 9)\nClearly, in the above document, the government has made an active political decision to publicly attribute what it describes as malicious cyber activity to particular nation-states as part of “expanding its international cyber efforts” (ibid). The challenge is that the source and reliability of classified evidence for the threat and the rationale for public attribution are unable to be made transparent, and the public is being represented by this claim. Here, the public is asked to trust that the correct decisions and attributions are being made as part of being a good international citizen and that the government is not being selective in who it calls to account.\nA third explanation comes from the Copenhagen school, which developed the securitization theory that focuses on “speech acts” and the significance these acts can have upon political agenda settings and political relations (McDonald, 2008, p. 568). Securitization theory suggests that when a threat is identified and a “speech act” identifying it is utilized, this discourse prioritizes the threat on the political agenda in such a way that it necessitates the development of urgent mitigation measures that could potentially extend even to the encroachment of privacy, the need for secrecy, and the utilization of force (Kassab, 2014, p. 65). For the Copenhagen school, securitization speech acts emphasize the dangers of the cyber threat environment and legitimate additional government funding for the construction of various infrastructures designed to protect the public from the threat. The challenge here, again, is that the speech acts have the power for change, not any classified evidential basis that may sit behind the act. When it comes to cyber threats, the public has no choice but to trust that those who are making the speech act are fully informed by subject matter experts and are making the best national security decisions possible.\nTaken together, these explanations suggest that the various 2018--2019 New Zealand Cybersecurity attribution speech acts appear designed to: Align New Zealand closer to its Five Eyes partnersCall out certain acts of cyber aggression where New Zealand can then position itself as a good international cyber citizenBe used as a mechanism to dissuade or deter malicious cyber activity by publicly attributing the activity to hold states to accountCreate, justify, and legitimate the development of additional domestic cybersecurity infrastructure\nTogether, these four purposes suggest that the attributions are being utilized for both international and domestic positioning in terms of alignment with our partners, being a good international citizen, and creating global and domestic cyber infrastructures to further New Zealand's interests and safety.\n## Public trust and national security discourse\nIn a civil society environment where the evidence for attribution is unavailable and the integrity of state institutions such as the GSCB (Rogers 2015, 46) or the Minister for Broadcasting's judgement has recently been called into doubt (Edwards, 2018), it is possible that future trust and confidence issues may arise around the efficacy of this language and the effectiveness of current government cyber initiatives. In 2015 and 2016, similar trust and confidence issues occurred in the justification of counter terrorism funding (Key, 2014), where evidence of a domestic Muslim radicalization threat has never eventuated and the claim of the “Jihadi bride” risk was found by the media to have little evidentiary basis and to have been exaggerated (Vance, 2015) and shifted attention away from the right wing. It is clear that, at least within the New Zealand Fourth Estate (News\nMedia), there is a tendency to critically examine government security discourse rather than trust it implicitly, and it is this view that underpins their reporting to the population (Jancic, 2019). Serious issues around trust in government security discourse and action resulted in recent wholesale reform of the New Zealand intelligence agency legislation with the creation of the Intelligence and Security Act 2017 governing the NZSIS and GSCB (Rogers, 2018, p. 657). Further destabilization of public trust in security agencies is also evident with ongoing “inquiries” into the New Zealand Defence Force's actions in Afghanistan (Operation Burnham Inquiry 2020) and the Christchurch Terror attacks (Christchurch Attack Royal Commission 2020), where the integrity of national security apparatus and discourse has been brought into contention by investigative journalists (Hagar & Stephenson, 2018), expert commentators, or community groups (Ainge Roy, 2019), creating a situation where it is impossible to know whose claim is trustworthy (Hoverd, 2019, p. 17). All the national security organizations (NZDF, GCSB, DPMC, and NZSIS) under investigation in these two inquiries are the same agencies producing the cybersecurity attributions. While clear distinctions need to be made between these individual one-off events and the general effectiveness of these agencies' everyday business and their successful operations, these examples show that they are regularly and recently seen by the public to have their integrity brought into doubt.\nThese types of one-off trust challenges to national security agency integrity are also seen at the international level. In 2013, WikiLeaks released an electronic dispersal of NSA classified material of some 1.7 million documents that had been leaked by Edward Snowden. These documents suggested strongly that the NSA, and perhaps also its Five Eyes partners, were engaged in regular global surveillance of their domestic populations (Verbal, 2014, p. 14). Again, it was impossible to know the truth of this claim based on open-source information, but part of the multifaceted collateral damage caused by this leak is a tarnishing of the reputation of the Five Eyes's agencies within their own populations where trust and confidence in those intelligence agencies is diminished in the eyes of the public.\nIn 2016, an additional social media technological challenge emerged for government discourse by the name of fake news (Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017, p. 211). Social media allows content to be passed between providers with no verification of its authenticity (ibid). Morgan (2018, p. 39) asserts that this verification problem allows disinformation and what is described as fake news to manipulate the public sphere and has the effect of “declining levels of trust in institutions and experts”. There are significant implications for democracy and free speech emerging from this phenomenon. When it comes to intelligence agency claims, the discussion of fake news is particularly pertinent when it comes to the relationship between US President Donald Trump and his intelligence agencies (McCarthy, 2018). Over a number of highly publicized national security issues related to Iran, ISIS, North Korea, and Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election, the president has called the discourse of his intelligence agencies into question. Donald Trump effectively stated that the intelligence agency claims are fake news and that the integrity of their discourse needs to be stringently questioned.\nConversely, one must ask why should the public trust Donald Trump, who has a conflict of interest because of investigations into his own actions, over politically neutral actors? Consequently, it is sensible for the public to ask whose security claim should be trusted and why? When it comes to Russian interference in the US election, Thirdway.org data show that the Donald Trump/James Comey counterclaims have created significant confusion about whose security discourse to trust (Eoyang et al, 2018). The broader ramification of such a claim is that all intelligence agency discourse, including that of cyber threat attribution, could be questioned and further magnifies the question over how Five Eyes partners, and their respective public, know who they should trust.\nAn essential assumption of my argument is that a problem of trust exists today when it comes to the public receiving national security agency discourse. How does one define trust? In political science, it has been traditionally assumed that “Trust is relational; it involves an individual making herself vulnerable to another individual, group, or institution that has the capacity to do her harm or betray her” (Levi & Stoker, 2000, p. 476). Trust can be understood as dichotomous in that one trusts or one does not, but trust relations can also be a sliding scale of degrees of trust. For example, Western populations give their trust to their national security agencies to be protected from cyber threats (Shulzke, 2018, p. 954). That trust is essential for cyberspace to function and for governance and security of that critical infrastructure (Azmi et al, 2018, p. 258).\nHenschke and Ford (2017, p. 82) have argued that since the Snowden releases there has been a breakdown in the public's trust of national security agencies.\n> The cost here is in the public's willingness and capacity to trust in state mechanisms of national and international security, especially those intelligence programmes involving cyber-surveillance. The loss of trust in this area is particularly detrimental to the effective functioning of national security.\n>\n> (Henschke & Ford, 2017, p. 82)\nFor Henschke and Ford (2017, p. 82), there is a twofold element of trust in the relationship between national security agencies and the public: 1) That surveillance is necessary and 2) that intelligence activities must be kept secret from the public. The challenge of Snowden (and likewise the GCSB's illegal spying on Kim Dotcom) (Rogers, 2015, p. 46) is that the Five Eyes nations were “caught out abusing this trust risk losing the goodwill of the public. If the public's trust in this area is lost and the government is judged as untrustworthy, then effective governing can become more difficult” (Henschke & Ford, 2017, p. 84). Pew data since the Snowdon releases reveal that the American public's approval for surveillance of citizens has declined as has their confidence that their government can protect their private data (Geiger, 2018). Thirdway.org suggests that in relation to contentious national security issues, most Americans did not know whose claim to trust (Eoyang et al, 2018). The poll data are not conclusive in showing a loss of trust in national security discourse, but it certainly demonstrates a public confusion and a lack of implicit unquestioned trust in national security discourse.\nGiven that recent Pew data also suggest the public believe there will be increasing cyber threats to elections and national security infrastructure (Poushter & Fetterolf, 2019), it is essential that trust is maintained. Ultimately, the loss of public trust is counterproductive for effective national security (Poushter & Fetterolf, 2019) because it leads to increasing media scrutiny and hyperbole, which then adversely impacts security agency transparency in terms of comfort levels with communicating to the public and not over classifying internal documentation. Thus, when it comes to making cyber-security policy, Ball et al (2019, p. 103) have argued that “Cybersecurity policymaking at the national level should be attentive to the central role of trust for maintaining resilient cyber systems -- and it should have plans in place to repair trust”. Trust therefore is an essential element of cyber-governance. To create trust with the public, governments must be seen to be active, careful, and deliberate in the policy and infrastructure they create and sustain to keep cyberspace safe, both domestically and globally. All these activities (including attribution) will be more effective if trust has not been reduced by earlier state failings and when/if a government can be transparent.\n## Conclusion: Addressing the contestability of attribution discourse\nIn this chapter, my intention has been to argue that, when it comes to cyber threat attribution claims made by governments, it is not always clear whose claim to trust or to what extent. There are inherent challenges in cyber threat attribution discourse: a) The evidence for attribution is not publicly verifiable, b) attribution is inherently political, c) the public must choose to trust attribution discourse or not, and d) attribution discourse often comes from institutions whose integrity has been brought into question elsewhere (this decreases trust). Given these concerns, we can say that there is a trust and confidence challenge that must be addressed by governments when it comes to the production of such discourse in the future.\nAs a social scientist, I traditionally look for empirical evidence to back a claim; without it, we are, at best, left with circumstantial evidence or, at worst, simply a truth claim. Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that the public do not (and perhaps should not) have access to classified empirical data to make assessments about the efficacy of cybersecurity decisions and discourse (Kello, 2013, p. 7). This creates a grey zone where cyber-attacks and their attributions live in a contested space of discourse between evidence and trust, where maintaining trust in government action is essential. I have demonstrated that attribution claims are inherently political and are contestable by both the accuser and the accused. While the effects of cyber-attacks are very real, communication about their effects and the intentions and motives behind an attack exist in a land of metaphor and discourse. This makes national security discourse around cyber-attacks contestable; a fact that is exacerbated by an inclination across social media, traditional media, and even the president of the US (with his conflict of interest) to question the integrity of these attribution claims. Therefore, a social scientific crisis emerges where, because of the classified nature of the evidence, the public is asked to trust\nand have confidence in a technological threat attribution claim without any further assurance. Consequently, it is then sensible for the public to ask whose security claim should be believed and why.\nIn modern democracies, trust in government is a key indicator of political legitimacy and stability (Marcinkowski & Starke, 2018, p. 87). Key questions for governments and populations are how and when do we trust the national security discourse of our government. A lack of trust inherently undermines and frustrates the positive intent of governments to keep their citizenry safe. In a contemporary environment where the national security discourse of a nation such as New Zealand (not to mention many other states) can be contested, it seems a critical social responsibility for security policy makers and academia to first acknowledge this trust and confidence conundrum and then strive to develop frameworks to better understand the trust and confidence challenges around threat attribution and apply it to this emerging cyber discourse. How to ensure that there is trust and confidence in the government's ability to identify, communicate, and respond to technological national security threats will be essential 21st-century governance questions for democracies.\nUnfortunately, civil society cannot be relied upon to meet such a challenge. A civic challenge exists for both government and academia to consider how to best address the inherent weakness (that they are political and contestable) that exists in national security threat attributions. Ideally, probably the most effective manner in which cyber attribution could be separated from the individual interests of nation-states or commercial entities is if some form of international legal attribution agency was formed. However, realistic solutions to the attribution problem must come from individual governments, who should be sufficiently motivated to increase the efficacy of its security apparatus by decreasing potential criticism of its discourse.\nThe producers of national security discourse must acknowledge that these weaknesses exist in their discourse and that it is their responsibility to find ways to mitigate these challenges. This is critical because WannaCry and NotPetya have shown us that cyber issues are changing the national security landscape indelibly. While care is required around cyber hyperbole and metaphor, the potential scale, spread, and damage of future attacks could be catastrophic. Governments need to find better ways to effectively communicate with each other, their opponents, and their own populations when it comes to mitigating these challenges.\nIt is important to conclude by asking what might be possible solutions to respond to the technological cyber-attack attribution challenge? First, cyber discourse makers must accept that national security discourse justifications that arise from classified sources cannot always provide a persuasive public evidence basis for their assertions. Second, cyber discourse makers should acknowledge that their claims are inherently political and therefore potentially contestable. Such acknowledgment would allow the discourse to be more reflexive and to self-regulate its claims in a more nuanced manner. Nuanced cyber threat discourse lessens the possibility that a government institution or representative will be subsequently called to account for making an incorrect or exaggerated claim. Governments\nCyber threat and national security policy 235\nshould look to employ these observations in the communication tools that they already possess. Cybersecurity strategy refreshes offer a real opportunity to engage with the public. They can focus both on private enterprise and the public. They can offer an education capacity and more transparency around the nature of various cyber threats. One place where a degree of transparency and limited evidence can exist for the actual nature and prevalence of cyber threats is in the annual reports from their National Cyber Security Centers (see Government Communications Security Bureau, 2017a). These carefully constructed and communicated reports and data could and should be more widely distributed, publicized, and utilized as an evidence basis for future claims. And lastly, one additional way to address the confidence challenge and limited trust around secrecy in national security discourse is to regularly craft language that clearly notes that a fine balance exists between secrecy and transparency. This balance relies heavily on building a trusting and transparent relationship between government officials and the public while working to repair any past breaches of confidence."

      "flat_text": "# 13 Cyber threat attribution, trust and confidence, and the contestability of national security policy\nWilliam Hoverd\n## Introduction\nToday, we regularly hear that Chinese company Huawei is a source of vulnerability for Western nations, and that North Korea and Russia are sources of cyber threats. Western populations are being asked to trust the word of intelligence agencies and world leaders that these unspecified emerging technological threats are real. The often-classified nature of a potential or emerging technological threat results in governments not being able to provide the public with an evidence base for threat attribution, and, even if such evidence were released to the public, how would they even begin to understand the origins of deleterious and malicious code? The challenges around cyber threat evidence create a situation for the public where government threat attribution discourse must be trusted (or not) by those receiving it.¹ Schluzke (2018, p. 954) recently argued that this form of cyber attribution creates an uncertainty in the mind of the public and that, given state knowledge is necessarily classified in this domain, care needs to be taken by cyber policy makers when crafting language around cyber-attacks. This chapter will argue that the threat potential posed by emerging technologies produces trust and confidence issues for Western populations, (Henschke &amp; Brandt Ford, 2017, p. 82) as the public is asked to trust and have confidence that a government’s particular technological threat attribution claim is accurate, and that robust classified evidence for this attribution exists and it is not being used selectively.\nIn recent years, narrative, counter narrative, spin, classified material, and “fake news” have politicized intelligence and cybersecurity discourse in such a way, that official security discourse is potentially contestable. Consequently, it is sensible for the public to ask: Whose security claim should be trusted and why? Likewise, given that there can be skepticism around this discourse, it seems a critical social responsibility for security policy makers and academia to first acknowledge this conundrum and then strive to develop frameworks to better understand the trust and confidence challenges around technological threat attribution.\nThe task of academia is to undertake constructive criticism by highlighting the nature of an issue of concern and then concluding by suggesting possible solutions. In a volume devoted to emerging technologies, a broader phenomenon has emerged where issues of trust and the potential for deception that results from new technology\nhave significant ramifications for the social contract between the state and the population and how they are both secured. The age-old balance between human liberty and security is being continually addressed in response to the evolving technologies of attack and defense that are occurring globally across the cyber realm.\nThe chapter begins by outlining the recent Five Eyes (USA, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) condemnations of Russian and North Korean cyber policy as a sociological case study to illustrate where and if a technological threat attribution and trust and confidence challenge might be evident. Focus is given to the recent WannaCry (2017) and NotPetya (2017) cyber-attacks that have been attributed to these nations. This case study of the Five Eyes condemnation is used to sketch out how the contestability of national security strategy and government security discourse can present specific trust and confidence challenges around national security discourse for both the public and the government. To illustrate the challenges surrounding contemporary issues of technological threat attribution, it focuses on the smallest member of the Five Eyes alliance, the nation of New Zealand. The case study will compare and contrast the language of the government executive and that of the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) when they attributed these two attacks to North Korea (WannaCry) and Russia (NotPetya).\nThis attribution discussion then returns to the broader context where, especially after the accusations of Edward Snowden, trust and confidence in the security actions and motives of the Five Eyes intelligence partners have been questioned. The chapter argues that trust and confidence challenges around the political nature of the Five Eyes cyber attribution is potentially exacerbated by two factors: That the invisible nature of the cyber realm can only be communicated by metaphor. This naturally leads to conflict-laden hyperbole that creates notions of cyber war and cyber threat that may not be helpful for thinking about the intentionally deployed deleterious and malicious effects of code (Lawson, 2012)That the development of the notion of fake news accusations (and other such accusations) brings into question the trustworthiness of the discourse of national security agencies\nLastly, the purpose of the chapter's conclusion is to move the content and goals of the chapter beyond simple problem definition to the initiation of a discussion of potential solutions to technological threat attribution, trust and confidence issues, and the contestability of national security policy when it comes to cyber attribution.\nWe now turn to review two recent global cyber-attacks, which the Five Eyes nations have publicly stated as deeply influencing their extant national security decision-making -- especially around cybersecurity.\n## The WannaCry and NotPetya cyber-attacks and the Five Eyes attributions\nThe Five Eyes intelligence sharing network's condemnation of North Korea and Russian cyber policy concentrated on the threat and damage caused by WannaCry\n(2017) and NotPetya (2017), two cyber-attacks attributed to these nations, respectively. Together these two attacks represent the two most costly cyber-attacks that the world has experienced to date (Snow, 2018).\nWannaCry was a ransomware crypto-worm that, in May 2017, attacked computers using the Windows operating platform (Martin et al, 2018, p. 361). It utilized the Eternal Blue exploit developed by the NSA, which had been stolen by the organization or state that used it for this attack. Once loaded onto the platform, it would encrypt data and then demand payment in bitcoin to release the data. Europol (BBC News, 2017) claimed that it had infected some 75,000 computers across 99 countries within a day, including 48 UK National Health Service (NHS) trusts, leaving doctors unable to retrieve patient information (Martin et al, 2018, p. 361). Ultimately, Kaspersky Lab analysis noted that the attack affected some 200,000 computers across 150 countries (Snow, 2018) with much of this occurring within 24 hours (Jones, 2017). Microsoft was able to respond quickly to the attack by deploying emergency patches that prevented the crypto-worm's spread. Nevertheless, variants of WannaCry were still emerging in 2018, hitting Boeing (Mathews, 2018) in May and Taiwanese Apple chipmaker TSMC in August (Leswing, 2018).\nWhat was unprecedented about the WannaCry attack was its indiscriminate global scale and its rapid spread, as well as its payload's ability to disrupt essential services and business. The cost of the disruption caused by the attack is significant, estimated at being between four and eight billion US dollars (Snow, 2018). Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, stated that a global technological problem was emerging where governments were stockpiling cyber weapons that, if stolen, as in the case of Eternal Blue, create the potential for indiscriminate attacks like this to occur (Smith, 2017). He went on to argue that:\n> The governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call. They need to take a different approach and adhere in cyberspace to the same rules applied to weapons in the physical world. We need governments to consider the damage to civilians that comes from hoarding these vulnerabilities and the use of these exploits.\n>\n> (Smith, 2017)\nThe immense scale of the attack and the possibilities for further attack that WannaCry augured, indicated that globally a shift was required to address the perpetrators of such attacks.\nAttribution for WannaCry was formally announced by the White House in December 2017 (Bossert, 2017). USA Homeland Security advisor, Tom Bossert, stated that:\n> After careful investigation, the United States is publicly attributing the massive WannaCry cyberattack to North Korea. We do not make this allegation lightly. We do so with evidence, and we do so with partners. Other governments and private companies agree. The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada,\nNew Zealand, and Japan have seen our analysis, and they join us in denouncing North Korea for WannaCry. Commercial partners have also acted. Microsoft traced the attack to cyber affiliates of the North Korean government, and others in the security community have contributed their analysis. (Bossert 2017, p. 1) ”\nUsefully, here we see that commercial attributions for these attacks also exist to support government attributions. The global or, more specifically, US-led Five Eyes attribution for the WannaCry cyber-attack was made against North Korea, and here there was a stated (classified/private) evidence base for the attribution. During the question portion of the briefing, Bossert was asked about the evidence basis for the attribution and he stated: “We took a lot of time to look through classified, sensitive information. What we did was rely on -- and some of it I can't share, unfortunately -- technical links to previously identified North Korean cyber tools, tradecraft, operational infrastructure. We had to examine a lot. And we had to put it together in a way that allowed us to make a confident attribution. (Bossert, 2017) ”\nAbove, we see Bossert assert that the US developed and shared its analysis with its partners, and on that evidence, made their attribution of the origin of WannaCry to North Korea. The often-classified nature of the potential or actual emerging technological threat results in governments not being able to provide the public with the evidence for cyber threat attribution.\n### NotPetya\nClosely following the WannaCry cyber-attack, the NotPetya cyber-attack occurred on June 27, 2017. Kaspersky Lab reported infections in France, Germany, Italy, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, but the majority of infections were occurring in Russia and the Ukraine where more than 80 companies were attacked (Snow, 2017). It mainly targeted businesses as one of the initial propagation vectors was through the financial software MeDoc (Snow, 2018). Kaspersky Lab argued NotPetya was the costliest cyber-attack the world has seen with its deleterious effects reaching some ten billion US dollars (Snow, 2018).\nNotPetya was a variation of the 2016 Petya software, which was originally an e-mail-spread ransomware that encrypted hard drives and asked for payment (Snow, 2017, p. 1). However, Kaspersky Lab was quick to state that this attack was from a separate malware family, and utilized the Eternal Blue windows exploit (Robot, 2017, p. 1). Where NotPetya was radically different was that it masqueraded as ransomware but was, in fact, what is known as a “wiper” that permanently deleted material on a computer's hard drive (Robot, 2017). Moreover, it particularly affected businesses in Ukraine, with some 75% of incidents reported in that nation. It then spread globally to the business partners of those initially affected,\nwith 9% of incidents occurring in Germany, and the Danish shipping company, Maersk, being particularly affected by the attack (Schwartz, 2018). Where WannaCry was global and relatively indiscriminate ransomware, NotPetya was a disguised, targeted attack on a particular nation-state's financial infrastructure.\nIn January 2018, the Washington Post stated that the CIA had attributed the NotPetya attack to Russian military hackers (Nakashima, 2018). Reportedly, its sources claimed “The GRU military spy agency created NotPetya, the CIA concluded with ‘high confidence' in November, according to classified reports cited by USA intelligence officials” (Nakashima, 2018). On February 15, 2018, the White House released a brief press statement that attributed NotPetya to the Russian military:\n> In June 2017, the Russian military launched the most destructive and costly cyber-attack in history... The attack, dubbed “NotPetya”, quickly spread worldwide, causing billions of dollars in damage across Europe, Asia, and the Americas. It was part of the Kremlin's ongoing effort to destabilize Ukraine and demonstrates ever more clearly Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict. This was also a reckless and indiscriminate cyber-attack that will be met with international consequences.\n>\n> (Statement from the Press Secretary, 2018)\nBy late February 2018, the NotPetya attack had been attributed by all Five Eyes nations as originating in Russia (Bussoletti, 2018). United Kingdom Foreign Office minister Lord Tariq Ahmad attributed the NotPetya cyber-attack to the Russian government, stating “The UK Government judges that the Russian Government, specifically the Russian military, was responsible for the destructive NotPetya cyber-attack of June 2017” (Foreign Office Minister condemns Russia, 2018). The rationale for this attribution was: “The decision to publicly attribute this incident underlines the fact that the UK and its allies will not tolerate malicious cyber activity” (Foreign Office Minister condemns Russia, 2018). Clear attribution for the attacks was leveled at the Russian military from across the Five Eyes nations, but, again, it is difficult to discern how and where evidence for this attribution arose and was then shared between these nations.\n### The April 2018 Five Eyes head of state cybersecurity meeting\nThe Five Eyes condemnation of the Russian cyber-attack occurred on April 18, 2018, when four heads of state (Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and New Zealand) met at the United Kingdom's National Cyber Centre (Waldie, 2018). The meeting publicly attributed the NotPetya Ukraine cyber-attack to Russia. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made the claim that Russia has been “using cyberwarfare as part of a wider effort to attack and undermine the international system” (ibid). In this meeting, British Prime Minister Theresa May described the Five Eyes alliance as “a unique security and intelligence-sharing partnership” that “has done much to protect our people from a range of threats”\n(ibid). In particular, with regard to Russian hacking, she added: “I have been clear to Russia that we know what it is doing. And we should be in no doubt that such cyberwarfare is one of the great challenges of our time” (ibid). Five Eyes's attribution discourse was universal in its condemnation. Another dimension to the trust challenges that the chapter has already outlined is that, in this example for both the Five Eyes governments and their populations, the attribution was denied by Russia (Marsh, 2018). Consequently, without presentation of the shared evidence, the cyber-attack attribution became contested, effectively creating a he-said/she-said situation between the various parties linked to ongoing great power competition.\n### The New Zealand attribution\nThe New Zealand government attributed both the WannaCry and NotPetya cyberattacks to Russia and North Korea in line with their Five Eyes partners. However, I have not found a New Zealand government source stating that the nation has seen shared ‘classified evidence' for these threat attributions. Official releases from the GSCB, in terms of both WannaCry (Government Communications Services Bureau, 2017b) and NotPetya (Government Communications Services Bureau, 2018), simply state the agency supports their international partners' condemnation. As we can see from Tom Bossert's statement above, he stated that attribution evidence for WannaCry was shared with its Five Eyes partners, specifically naming New Zealand. This means that the public must trust the government's discourse, and it is not clear whether its representatives have seen their partner's evidence of attribution or are simply repeating the attribution. We have to trust (or not) that they have seen evidence. To contextualize the New Zealand support, these attributions coincided with a significant 2018 government focus on cybersecurity as a key threat in the national security threat landscape (Little, 2018, p. 33).\nThe 2018 Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC) Cyber Security Strategy Refresh stated that “New Zealand recognizes that the relevance of cybersecurity concerns now extends across multiple branches of government” (Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, 2018a, p. 6). The primary responsibility for cybersecurity is given to the Government Communications Security Bureau, which delivers signals intelligence. A close look at the government's cyber discourse in 2018 shows a discourse had emerged across the national security sector where a cyber technological threat was being attributed to Russia and North Korea. This threat attribution discourse is usually accompanied by an argument that New Zealand is not immune from this threat, and that additional cyber infrastructure development is required. For example, in February 2018, Andrew Hampton, the director general of the GCSB (Government Communications Security Bureau, 2018), stated, “In terms of cyber threats, the GCSB noted a 15% increase in serious incidents affecting New Zealand in the year to June 2017”, and that “The GCSB's international partners have today attributed the NotPetya cyber-attack to the Russian Government”. Here we see that the attribution for NotPetya is sourced from Five Eyes partners, and it is not made clear whether the\nstatement was made simply in support of, or after reviewing classified evidence supplied by their partners.\nSimilarly, in the 2018 winter issue of Line of Defence the Right Honorable Andrew Little, Minister Responsible for the GCSB and NZSIS stated:\n> In February, the Government added New Zealand's voice to the international condemnation of the NotPetya cyber-attack which international partners have now attributed to the Russian Government. It targeted Ukraine but had a global impact -- including affecting supply chains in New Zealand. In December, New Zealand also expressed concern about international reports which link North Korea to the major WannaCry ransomware campaign.\n>\n> (Little, 2018, p. 33)\nA similar type of attribution claim can also be found in the July 2018 Ministry of Defense Strategic Defence Policy Statement which states that:\n> Physical distance is no protection in cyberspace, and New Zealand is subject to a growing cyber threat from state sponsored and other malicious actors... Cyber blurs boundaries between conflict and peace, and public and private. (...)\n>\n> Russian ‘active measures' in the 2016 United States Presidential election brought to light ‘cyber enabled information warfare' as a disrupter in liberal democracies. (...)\n>\n> North Korea has a substantial store of chemical and biological weapons, a significant cyber capability (which it has shown a willingness to use).\n>\n> (Ministry of Defence, 2018, pp. 18--21)\nAcross these three examples, and more recently in the 2019 New Zealand cyber-security strategy (Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, 2019), we clearly see attributions of cyber threat to Russia and North Korea. We also see in all these examples that the threat attribution for cyber-attacks occurring across nation-states is linked explicitly to a governmental claim that there is a growing cyber threat environment impacting adversely on New Zealand's national security and, by implication, that there is an increased need for investment in the nation's cyber infrastructure. The implication is that cyber-attacks represent a form of virtual domain of threat that circumvents the nation's geographic isolation and that while it may not be a direct target of any such future attack, both WannaCry and NotPetya demonstrated the ability these attacks have to deliver collateral damage on a global scale. Nevertheless, we still need to better understand what might motivate such a small nation to make explicit attribution claims.\n## Cyber threat attribution\nCyber attribution is generally understood to be a difficult technical process (Kello, 2013, p. 7; Lin, 2016, p. 75). Commonly, the challenge of attributing a cyber-threat has created problems for nations trying to establish deterrence against\nforeign actors (Lupovici, 2016, p. 322; Lindsay, 2015, p. 53). However, it is the political construction of cyber threat attribution in national security that is useful here. Myriam Dunn Calvety (2013, p. 105) argued that “The link between cyberspace and national security is often presented as an unquestionable and uncontested ‘truth'. However, there is nothing natural or given about this link: It had to be forged, argued, and accepted in the (security) political process”. She argues that cybersecurity discourse is, in fact, constituted by a variety of authority figures in governments. For Dunn Calvety, the political nature of cyber discourse is further complicated by the fact that the very building blocks of cybersecurity language employ analogies or metaphors to describe and explain the effect of unsolicited changes in code across networks. Similar to a conceptualization of disease as an attack (Sontag, 1978), this metaphorical language of cyber “attack” and “weapons” is potentially distorting and results in a tendency to describe the cyber landscape as unruly, dangerous, or threatening, when, in fact, much of the cyber environment is benign and intended to be enabling.\nOne consequence of the political construction of cyber discourse is that there are real risks when it comes to generating accurate attribution claims. Thomas Rid and Ben Buchanan (2015, p. 4) argue, “Doing attribution well is at the core of virtually all forms of coercion and deterrence, international and domestic. Doing it poorly undermines a state's credibility, its effectiveness, and ultimately it's liberty and security”. When it comes to cybersecurity, the attribution debate is evolving surprisingly slowly, and this slowness remains the case today (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 19). Rid and Buchanan (2015, p. 4) provide a detailed technical account of the attribution process, where they conclude that developing the evidence for cyberattack attribution is a difficult and costly process which inevitably only indicates the likely source of an attack. Moreover, this evidence cannot easily determine motive or the political gain that may have initially motivated an attack. They conclude with the finding that attribution is what states make of it, and public attribution is a political act used by states to legitimate security positioning. If we are to follow Rid and Buchanan's logic, we could understand the Five Eyes attribution of cyber threat to Russia and North Korea as a broader function of what is at stake politically in terms of the broader relations between these nations.\nIn the New Zealand case study, the combination of technical evidence challenges and political nature of attribution claims is made explicit when we look closely at the GCSB's National Cyber Security Centre Annual report, where it states:\n> Publicly reporting attribution is a significant [political] decision and is not made by the NCSC alone. Public attribution is one way to reduce the efficacy of malicious cyber actors by revealing their tools or increasing the reputational costs of illegitimate activity. However, it also carries risk for New Zealand and is considered alongside our other national objectives, including the need to maintain our ability to protect the networks that are of importance...\n>\n> (Government Communications Service Bureau, 2017a, p. 12)\nGiven that there is academic and local technical agreement that cyber threat attribution is ultimately a political act, why might this government be making these threat attribution claims -- why now and what might be the risks inherent in this attribution?\nThere are three possible explanations for this attribution. Firstly, there is a clear discussion in other sections of these documents that New Zealand is part of the Five Eyes network and is speaking in solidarity with its partners to increase the reputational costs of these activities. The challenge here is that when there is no unclassified evidence to support these attribution claims (there was commercial evidence for WannaCry but none for NotPetya), the public must trust the veracity and motives of these partners, and they must trust that their politicians are maintaining an independent policy stance. For example, Reuben Steff's chapter in this volume (Chapter 3) explains that small states are traditionally considered to be “consumers” of security technology supplied by larger states, given they often cannot develop it on their own. This means that it is necessary for New Zealand to align itself with the US on key technological security issues, and the case suggested here is that this could extend to technological threat attribution too, in order to secure its relations to the US and maintain access to critical technology advances and supply. If this is the case, it fuels critical questions about the independence of the nation's foreign affairs policy (Small, 2018, p. 1), which, if undermined, would be a potential blow to public trust.\nA second explanation is sourced from DPMC's National Cyber Policy Office release of April 20, 2018, which takes the form of a letter written by the Right Honorable Claire Curran, then-minister of Broadcasting, Communication, and Digital Media. The topic of the letter is the Refresh of New Zealand's Cyber Security Strategy and Action Plan which resulted in 2019 Cybersecurity Strategy.\nClaire Curran stated:\n> The clear trend is an upward trajectory of cyber security threats... New Zealand's geographical location does not exempt us from this threat... We will need to consider the mechanisms available to us to dissuade or deter malicious cyber activities, particularly where it is state-sponsored, or state condoned. This includes the option of publicly attributing malicious cyber activity as a way of holding states to account.\n>\n> (Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, 2018b, p. 4, p. 9)\nClearly, in the above document, the government has made an active political decision to publicly attribute what it describes as malicious cyber activity to particular nation-states as part of “expanding its international cyber efforts” (ibid). The challenge is that the source and reliability of classified evidence for the threat and the rationale for public attribution are unable to be made transparent, and the public is being represented by this claim. Here, the public is asked to trust that the correct decisions and attributions are being made as part of being a good international citizen and that the government is not being selective in who it calls to account.\nA third explanation comes from the Copenhagen school, which developed the securitization theory that focuses on “speech acts” and the significance these acts can have upon political agenda settings and political relations (McDonald, 2008, p. 568). Securitization theory suggests that when a threat is identified and a “speech act” identifying it is utilized, this discourse prioritizes the threat on the political agenda in such a way that it necessitates the development of urgent mitigation measures that could potentially extend even to the encroachment of privacy, the need for secrecy, and the utilization of force (Kassab, 2014, p. 65). For the Copenhagen school, securitization speech acts emphasize the dangers of the cyber threat environment and legitimate additional government funding for the construction of various infrastructures designed to protect the public from the threat. The challenge here, again, is that the speech acts have the power for change, not any classified evidential basis that may sit behind the act. When it comes to cyber threats, the public has no choice but to trust that those who are making the speech act are fully informed by subject matter experts and are making the best national security decisions possible.\nTaken together, these explanations suggest that the various 2018--2019 New Zealand Cybersecurity attribution speech acts appear designed to: Align New Zealand closer to its Five Eyes partnersCall out certain acts of cyber aggression where New Zealand can then position itself as a good international cyber citizenBe used as a mechanism to dissuade or deter malicious cyber activity by publicly attributing the activity to hold states to accountCreate, justify, and legitimate the development of additional domestic cybersecurity infrastructure\nTogether, these four purposes suggest that the attributions are being utilized for both international and domestic positioning in terms of alignment with our partners, being a good international citizen, and creating global and domestic cyber infrastructures to further New Zealand's interests and safety.\n## Public trust and national security discourse\nIn a civil society environment where the evidence for attribution is unavailable and the integrity of state institutions such as the GSCB (Rogers 2015, 46) or the Minister for Broadcasting's judgement has recently been called into doubt (Edwards, 2018), it is possible that future trust and confidence issues may arise around the efficacy of this language and the effectiveness of current government cyber initiatives. In 2015 and 2016, similar trust and confidence issues occurred in the justification of counter terrorism funding (Key, 2014), where evidence of a domestic Muslim radicalization threat has never eventuated and the claim of the “Jihadi bride” risk was found by the media to have little evidentiary basis and to have been exaggerated (Vance, 2015) and shifted attention away from the right wing. It is clear that, at least within the New Zealand Fourth Estate (News\nMedia), there is a tendency to critically examine government security discourse rather than trust it implicitly, and it is this view that underpins their reporting to the population (Jancic, 2019). Serious issues around trust in government security discourse and action resulted in recent wholesale reform of the New Zealand intelligence agency legislation with the creation of the Intelligence and Security Act 2017 governing the NZSIS and GSCB (Rogers, 2018, p. 657). Further destabilization of public trust in security agencies is also evident with ongoing “inquiries” into the New Zealand Defence Force's actions in Afghanistan (Operation Burnham Inquiry 2020) and the Christchurch Terror attacks (Christchurch Attack Royal Commission 2020), where the integrity of national security apparatus and discourse has been brought into contention by investigative journalists (Hagar & Stephenson, 2018), expert commentators, or community groups (Ainge Roy, 2019), creating a situation where it is impossible to know whose claim is trustworthy (Hoverd, 2019, p. 17). All the national security organizations (NZDF, GCSB, DPMC, and NZSIS) under investigation in these two inquiries are the same agencies producing the cybersecurity attributions. While clear distinctions need to be made between these individual one-off events and the general effectiveness of these agencies' everyday business and their successful operations, these examples show that they are regularly and recently seen by the public to have their integrity brought into doubt.\nThese types of one-off trust challenges to national security agency integrity are also seen at the international level. In 2013, WikiLeaks released an electronic dispersal of NSA classified material of some 1.7 million documents that had been leaked by Edward Snowden. These documents suggested strongly that the NSA, and perhaps also its Five Eyes partners, were engaged in regular global surveillance of their domestic populations (Verbal, 2014, p. 14). Again, it was impossible to know the truth of this claim based on open-source information, but part of the multifaceted collateral damage caused by this leak is a tarnishing of the reputation of the Five Eyes's agencies within their own populations where trust and confidence in those intelligence agencies is diminished in the eyes of the public.\nIn 2016, an additional social media technological challenge emerged for government discourse by the name of fake news (Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017, p. 211). Social media allows content to be passed between providers with no verification of its authenticity (ibid). Morgan (2018, p. 39) asserts that this verification problem allows disinformation and what is described as fake news to manipulate the public sphere and has the effect of “declining levels of trust in institutions and experts”. There are significant implications for democracy and free speech emerging from this phenomenon. When it comes to intelligence agency claims, the discussion of fake news is particularly pertinent when it comes to the relationship between US President Donald Trump and his intelligence agencies (McCarthy, 2018). Over a number of highly publicized national security issues related to Iran, ISIS, North Korea, and Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election, the president has called the discourse of his intelligence agencies into question. Donald Trump effectively stated that the intelligence agency claims are fake news and that the integrity of their discourse needs to be stringently questioned.\nConversely, one must ask why should the public trust Donald Trump, who has a conflict of interest because of investigations into his own actions, over politically neutral actors? Consequently, it is sensible for the public to ask whose security claim should be trusted and why? When it comes to Russian interference in the US election, Thirdway.org data show that the Donald Trump/James Comey counterclaims have created significant confusion about whose security discourse to trust (Eoyang et al, 2018). The broader ramification of such a claim is that all intelligence agency discourse, including that of cyber threat attribution, could be questioned and further magnifies the question over how Five Eyes partners, and their respective public, know who they should trust.\nAn essential assumption of my argument is that a problem of trust exists today when it comes to the public receiving national security agency discourse. How does one define trust? In political science, it has been traditionally assumed that “Trust is relational; it involves an individual making herself vulnerable to another individual, group, or institution that has the capacity to do her harm or betray her” (Levi & Stoker, 2000, p. 476). Trust can be understood as dichotomous in that one trusts or one does not, but trust relations can also be a sliding scale of degrees of trust. For example, Western populations give their trust to their national security agencies to be protected from cyber threats (Shulzke, 2018, p. 954). That trust is essential for cyberspace to function and for governance and security of that critical infrastructure (Azmi et al, 2018, p. 258).\nHenschke and Ford (2017, p. 82) have argued that since the Snowden releases there has been a breakdown in the public's trust of national security agencies.\n> The cost here is in the public's willingness and capacity to trust in state mechanisms of national and international security, especially those intelligence programmes involving cyber-surveillance. The loss of trust in this area is particularly detrimental to the effective functioning of national security.\n>\n> (Henschke & Ford, 2017, p. 82)\nFor Henschke and Ford (2017, p. 82), there is a twofold element of trust in the relationship between national security agencies and the public: 1) That surveillance is necessary and 2) that intelligence activities must be kept secret from the public. The challenge of Snowden (and likewise the GCSB's illegal spying on Kim Dotcom) (Rogers, 2015, p. 46) is that the Five Eyes nations were “caught out abusing this trust risk losing the goodwill of the public. If the public's trust in this area is lost and the government is judged as untrustworthy, then effective governing can become more difficult” (Henschke & Ford, 2017, p. 84). Pew data since the Snowdon releases reveal that the American public's approval for surveillance of citizens has declined as has their confidence that their government can protect their private data (Geiger, 2018). Thirdway.org suggests that in relation to contentious national security issues, most Americans did not know whose claim to trust (Eoyang et al, 2018). The poll data are not conclusive in showing a loss of trust in national security discourse, but it certainly demonstrates a public confusion and a lack of implicit unquestioned trust in national security discourse.\nGiven that recent Pew data also suggest the public believe there will be increasing cyber threats to elections and national security infrastructure (Poushter & Fetterolf, 2019), it is essential that trust is maintained. Ultimately, the loss of public trust is counterproductive for effective national security (Poushter & Fetterolf, 2019) because it leads to increasing media scrutiny and hyperbole, which then adversely impacts security agency transparency in terms of comfort levels with communicating to the public and not over classifying internal documentation. Thus, when it comes to making cyber-security policy, Ball et al (2019, p. 103) have argued that “Cybersecurity policymaking at the national level should be attentive to the central role of trust for maintaining resilient cyber systems -- and it should have plans in place to repair trust”. Trust therefore is an essential element of cyber-governance. To create trust with the public, governments must be seen to be active, careful, and deliberate in the policy and infrastructure they create and sustain to keep cyberspace safe, both domestically and globally. All these activities (including attribution) will be more effective if trust has not been reduced by earlier state failings and when/if a government can be transparent.\n## Conclusion: Addressing the contestability of attribution discourse\nIn this chapter, my intention has been to argue that, when it comes to cyber threat attribution claims made by governments, it is not always clear whose claim to trust or to what extent. There are inherent challenges in cyber threat attribution discourse: a) The evidence for attribution is not publicly verifiable, b) attribution is inherently political, c) the public must choose to trust attribution discourse or not, and d) attribution discourse often comes from institutions whose integrity has been brought into question elsewhere (this decreases trust). Given these concerns, we can say that there is a trust and confidence challenge that must be addressed by governments when it comes to the production of such discourse in the future.\nAs a social scientist, I traditionally look for empirical evidence to back a claim; without it, we are, at best, left with circumstantial evidence or, at worst, simply a truth claim. Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that the public do not (and perhaps should not) have access to classified empirical data to make assessments about the efficacy of cybersecurity decisions and discourse (Kello, 2013, p. 7). This creates a grey zone where cyber-attacks and their attributions live in a contested space of discourse between evidence and trust, where maintaining trust in government action is essential. I have demonstrated that attribution claims are inherently political and are contestable by both the accuser and the accused. While the effects of cyber-attacks are very real, communication about their effects and the intentions and motives behind an attack exist in a land of metaphor and discourse. This makes national security discourse around cyber-attacks contestable; a fact that is exacerbated by an inclination across social media, traditional media, and even the president of the US (with his conflict of interest) to question the integrity of these attribution claims. Therefore, a social scientific crisis emerges where, because of the classified nature of the evidence, the public is asked to trust\nand have confidence in a technological threat attribution claim without any further assurance. Consequently, it is then sensible for the public to ask whose security claim should be believed and why.\nIn modern democracies, trust in government is a key indicator of political legitimacy and stability (Marcinkowski & Starke, 2018, p. 87). Key questions for governments and populations are how and when do we trust the national security discourse of our government. A lack of trust inherently undermines and frustrates the positive intent of governments to keep their citizenry safe. In a contemporary environment where the national security discourse of a nation such as New Zealand (not to mention many other states) can be contested, it seems a critical social responsibility for security policy makers and academia to first acknowledge this trust and confidence conundrum and then strive to develop frameworks to better understand the trust and confidence challenges around threat attribution and apply it to this emerging cyber discourse. How to ensure that there is trust and confidence in the government's ability to identify, communicate, and respond to technological national security threats will be essential 21st-century governance questions for democracies.\nUnfortunately, civil society cannot be relied upon to meet such a challenge. A civic challenge exists for both government and academia to consider how to best address the inherent weakness (that they are political and contestable) that exists in national security threat attributions. Ideally, probably the most effective manner in which cyber attribution could be separated from the individual interests of nation-states or commercial entities is if some form of international legal attribution agency was formed. However, realistic solutions to the attribution problem must come from individual governments, who should be sufficiently motivated to increase the efficacy of its security apparatus by decreasing potential criticism of its discourse.\nThe producers of national security discourse must acknowledge that these weaknesses exist in their discourse and that it is their responsibility to find ways to mitigate these challenges. This is critical because WannaCry and NotPetya have shown us that cyber issues are changing the national security landscape indelibly. While care is required around cyber hyperbole and metaphor, the potential scale, spread, and damage of future attacks could be catastrophic. Governments need to find better ways to effectively communicate with each other, their opponents, and their own populations when it comes to mitigating these challenges.\nIt is important to conclude by asking what might be possible solutions to respond to the technological cyber-attack attribution challenge? First, cyber discourse makers must accept that national security discourse justifications that arise from classified sources cannot always provide a persuasive public evidence basis for their assertions. Second, cyber discourse makers should acknowledge that their claims are inherently political and therefore potentially contestable. Such acknowledgment would allow the discourse to be more reflexive and to self-regulate its claims in a more nuanced manner. Nuanced cyber threat discourse lessens the possibility that a government institution or representative will be subsequently called to account for making an incorrect or exaggerated claim. Governments\nCyber threat and national security policy 235\nshould look to employ these observations in the communication tools that they already possess. Cybersecurity strategy refreshes offer a real opportunity to engage with the public. They can focus both on private enterprise and the public. They can offer an education capacity and more transparency around the nature of various cyber threats. One place where a degree of transparency and limited evidence can exist for the actual nature and prevalence of cyber threats is in the annual reports from their National Cyber Security Centers (see Government Communications Security Bureau, 2017a). These carefully constructed and communicated reports and data could and should be more widely distributed, publicized, and utilized as an evidence basis for future claims. And lastly, one additional way to address the confidence challenge and limited trust around secrecy in national security discourse is to regularly craft language that clearly notes that a fine balance exists between secrecy and transparency. This balance relies heavily on building a trusting and transparent relationship between government officials and the public while working to repair any past breaches of confidence."

      "flat_text": "# 13 Cyber threat attribution, trust and confidence, and the contestability of national security policy\nWilliam Hoverd\n## Introduction\nToday, we regularly hear that Chinese company Huawei is a source of vulnerability for Western nations, and that North Korea and Russia are sources of cyber threats. Western populations are being asked to trust the word of intelligence agencies and world leaders that these unspecified emerging technological threats are real. The often-classified nature of a potential or emerging technological threat results in governments not being able to provide the public with an evidence base for threat attribution, and, even if such evidence were released to the public, how would they even begin to understand the origins of deleterious and malicious code? The challenges around cyber threat evidence create a situation for the public where government threat attribution discourse must be trusted (or not) by those receiving it.¹ Schluzke (2018, p. 954) recently argued that this form of cyber attribution creates an uncertainty in the mind of the public and that, given state knowledge is necessarily classified in this domain, care needs to be taken by cyber policy makers when crafting language around cyber-attacks. This chapter will argue that the threat potential posed by emerging technologies produces trust and confidence issues for Western populations, (Henschke &amp; Brandt Ford, 2017, p. 82) as the public is asked to trust and have confidence that a government’s particular technological threat attribution claim is accurate, and that robust classified evidence for this attribution exists and it is not being used selectively.\nIn recent years, narrative, counter narrative, spin, classified material, and “fake news” have politicized intelligence and cybersecurity discourse in such a way, that official security discourse is potentially contestable. Consequently, it is sensible for the public to ask: Whose security claim should be trusted and why? Likewise, given that there can be skepticism around this discourse, it seems a critical social responsibility for security policy makers and academia to first acknowledge this conundrum and then strive to develop frameworks to better understand the trust and confidence challenges around technological threat attribution.\nThe task of academia is to undertake constructive criticism by highlighting the nature of an issue of concern and then concluding by suggesting possible solutions. In a volume devoted to emerging technologies, a broader phenomenon has emerged where issues of trust and the potential for deception that results from new technology\nhave significant ramifications for the social contract between the state and the population and how they are both secured. The age-old balance between human liberty and security is being continually addressed in response to the evolving technologies of attack and defense that are occurring globally across the cyber realm.\nThe chapter begins by outlining the recent Five Eyes (USA, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) condemnations of Russian and North Korean cyber policy as a sociological case study to illustrate where and if a technological threat attribution and trust and confidence challenge might be evident. Focus is given to the recent WannaCry (2017) and NotPetya (2017) cyber-attacks that have been attributed to these nations. This case study of the Five Eyes condemnation is used to sketch out how the contestability of national security strategy and government security discourse can present specific trust and confidence challenges around national security discourse for both the public and the government. To illustrate the challenges surrounding contemporary issues of technological threat attribution, it focuses on the smallest member of the Five Eyes alliance, the nation of New Zealand. The case study will compare and contrast the language of the government executive and that of the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) when they attributed these two attacks to North Korea (WannaCry) and Russia (NotPetya).\nThis attribution discussion then returns to the broader context where, especially after the accusations of Edward Snowden, trust and confidence in the security actions and motives of the Five Eyes intelligence partners have been questioned. The chapter argues that trust and confidence challenges around the political nature of the Five Eyes cyber attribution is potentially exacerbated by two factors: That the invisible nature of the cyber realm can only be communicated by metaphor. This naturally leads to conflict-laden hyperbole that creates notions of cyber war and cyber threat that may not be helpful for thinking about the intentionally deployed deleterious and malicious effects of code That the development of the notion of fake news accusations (and other such accusations) brings into question the trustworthiness of the discourse of national security agencies\nLastly, the purpose of the chapter's conclusion is to move the content and goals of the chapter beyond simple problem definition to the initiation of a discussion of potential solutions to technological threat attribution, trust and confidence issues, and the contestability of national security policy when it comes to cyber attribution.\nWe now turn to review two recent global cyber-attacks, which the Five Eyes nations have publicly stated as deeply influencing their extant national security decision-making -- especially around cybersecurity.\n## The WannaCry and NotPetya cyber-attacks and the Five Eyes attributions\nThe Five Eyes intelligence sharing network's condemnation of North Korea and Russian cyber policy concentrated on the threat and damage caused by WannaCry\n(2017) and NotPetya (2017), two cyber-attacks attributed to these nations, respectively. Together these two attacks represent the two most costly cyber-attacks that the world has experienced to date .\nWannaCry was a ransomware crypto-worm that, in May 2017, attacked computers using the Windows operating platform (Martin et al, 2018, p. 361). It utilized the Eternal Blue exploit developed by the NSA, which had been stolen by the organization or state that used it for this attack. Once loaded onto the platform, it would encrypt data and then demand payment in bitcoin to release the data. Europol (BBC News, 2017) claimed that it had infected some 75,000 computers across 99 countries within a day, including 48 UK National Health Service (NHS) trusts, leaving doctors unable to retrieve patient information (Martin et al, 2018, p. 361). Ultimately, Kaspersky Lab analysis noted that the attack affected some 200,000 computers across 150 countries  with much of this occurring within 24 hours . Microsoft was able to respond quickly to the attack by deploying emergency patches that prevented the crypto-worm's spread. Nevertheless, variants of WannaCry were still emerging in 2018, hitting Boeing  in May and Taiwanese Apple chipmaker TSMC in August .\nWhat was unprecedented about the WannaCry attack was its indiscriminate global scale and its rapid spread, as well as its payload's ability to disrupt essential services and business. The cost of the disruption caused by the attack is significant, estimated at being between four and eight billion US dollars . Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, stated that a global technological problem was emerging where governments were stockpiling cyber weapons that, if stolen, as in the case of Eternal Blue, create the potential for indiscriminate attacks like this to occur . He went on to argue that:\n> The governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call. They need to take a different approach and adhere in cyberspace to the same rules applied to weapons in the physical world. We need governments to consider the damage to civilians that comes from hoarding these vulnerabilities and the use of these exploits.\n>\n> The immense scale of the attack and the possibilities for further attack that WannaCry augured, indicated that globally a shift was required to address the perpetrators of such attacks.\nAttribution for WannaCry was formally announced by the White House in December 2017 . USA Homeland Security advisor, Tom Bossert, stated that:\n> After careful investigation, the United States is publicly attributing the massive WannaCry cyberattack to North Korea. We do not make this allegation lightly. We do so with evidence, and we do so with partners. Other governments and private companies agree. The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada,\nNew Zealand, and Japan have seen our analysis, and they join us in denouncing North Korea for WannaCry. Commercial partners have also acted. Microsoft traced the attack to cyber affiliates of the North Korean government, and others in the security community have contributed their analysis.  ”\nUsefully, here we see that commercial attributions for these attacks also exist to support government attributions. The global or, more specifically, US-led Five Eyes attribution for the WannaCry cyber-attack was made against North Korea, and here there was a stated (classified/private) evidence base for the attribution. During the question portion of the briefing, Bossert was asked about the evidence basis for the attribution and he stated: “We took a lot of time to look through classified, sensitive information. What we did was rely on -- and some of it I can't share, unfortunately -- technical links to previously identified North Korean cyber tools, tradecraft, operational infrastructure. We had to examine a lot. And we had to put it together in a way that allowed us to make a confident attribution.  ”\nAbove, we see Bossert assert that the US developed and shared its analysis with its partners, and on that evidence, made their attribution of the origin of WannaCry to North Korea. The often-classified nature of the potential or actual emerging technological threat results in governments not being able to provide the public with the evidence for cyber threat attribution.\n### NotPetya\nClosely following the WannaCry cyber-attack, the NotPetya cyber-attack occurred on June 27, 2017. Kaspersky Lab reported infections in France, Germany, Italy, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, but the majority of infections were occurring in Russia and the Ukraine where more than 80 companies were attacked . It mainly targeted businesses as one of the initial propagation vectors was through the financial software MeDoc . Kaspersky Lab argued NotPetya was the costliest cyber-attack the world has seen with its deleterious effects reaching some ten billion US dollars .\nNotPetya was a variation of the 2016 Petya software, which was originally an e-mail-spread ransomware that encrypted hard drives and asked for payment . However, Kaspersky Lab was quick to state that this attack was from a separate malware family, and utilized the Eternal Blue windows exploit . Where NotPetya was radically different was that it masqueraded as ransomware but was, in fact, what is known as a “wiper” that permanently deleted material on a computer's hard drive . Moreover, it particularly affected businesses in Ukraine, with some 75% of incidents reported in that nation. It then spread globally to the business partners of those initially affected,\nwith 9% of incidents occurring in Germany, and the Danish shipping company, Maersk, being particularly affected by the attack . Where WannaCry was global and relatively indiscriminate ransomware, NotPetya was a disguised, targeted attack on a particular nation-state's financial infrastructure.\nIn January 2018, the Washington Post stated that the CIA had attributed the NotPetya attack to Russian military hackers . Reportedly, its sources claimed “The GRU military spy agency created NotPetya, the CIA concluded with ‘high confidence' in November, according to classified reports cited by USA intelligence officials” . On February 15, 2018, the White House released a brief press statement that attributed NotPetya to the Russian military:\n> In June 2017, the Russian military launched the most destructive and costly cyber-attack in history... The attack, dubbed “NotPetya”, quickly spread worldwide, causing billions of dollars in damage across Europe, Asia, and the Americas. It was part of the Kremlin's ongoing effort to destabilize Ukraine and demonstrates ever more clearly Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict. This was also a reckless and indiscriminate cyber-attack that will be met with international consequences.\n>\n> (Statement from the Press Secretary, 2018)\nBy late February 2018, the NotPetya attack had been attributed by all Five Eyes nations as originating in Russia . United Kingdom Foreign Office minister Lord Tariq Ahmad attributed the NotPetya cyber-attack to the Russian government, stating “The UK Government judges that the Russian Government, specifically the Russian military, was responsible for the destructive NotPetya cyber-attack of June 2017” (Foreign Office Minister condemns Russia, 2018). The rationale for this attribution was: “The decision to publicly attribute this incident underlines the fact that the UK and its allies will not tolerate malicious cyber activity” (Foreign Office Minister condemns Russia, 2018). Clear attribution for the attacks was leveled at the Russian military from across the Five Eyes nations, but, again, it is difficult to discern how and where evidence for this attribution arose and was then shared between these nations.\n### The April 2018 Five Eyes head of state cybersecurity meeting\nThe Five Eyes condemnation of the Russian cyber-attack occurred on April 18, 2018, when four heads of state (Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and New Zealand) met at the United Kingdom's National Cyber Centre . The meeting publicly attributed the NotPetya Ukraine cyber-attack to Russia. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made the claim that Russia has been “using cyberwarfare as part of a wider effort to attack and undermine the international system” (ibid). In this meeting, British Prime Minister Theresa May described the Five Eyes alliance as “a unique security and intelligence-sharing partnership” that “has done much to protect our people from a range of threats”\n(ibid). In particular, with regard to Russian hacking, she added: “I have been clear to Russia that we know what it is doing. And we should be in no doubt that such cyberwarfare is one of the great challenges of our time” (ibid). Five Eyes's attribution discourse was universal in its condemnation. Another dimension to the trust challenges that the chapter has already outlined is that, in this example for both the Five Eyes governments and their populations, the attribution was denied by Russia . Consequently, without presentation of the shared evidence, the cyber-attack attribution became contested, effectively creating a he-said/she-said situation between the various parties linked to ongoing great power competition.\n### The New Zealand attribution\nThe New Zealand government attributed both the WannaCry and NotPetya cyberattacks to Russia and North Korea in line with their Five Eyes partners. However, I have not found a New Zealand government source stating that the nation has seen shared ‘classified evidence' for these threat attributions. Official releases from the GSCB, in terms of both WannaCry (Government Communications Services Bureau, 2017b) and NotPetya (Government Communications Services Bureau, 2018), simply state the agency supports their international partners' condemnation. As we can see from Tom Bossert's statement above, he stated that attribution evidence for WannaCry was shared with its Five Eyes partners, specifically naming New Zealand. This means that the public must trust the government's discourse, and it is not clear whether its representatives have seen their partner's evidence of attribution or are simply repeating the attribution. We have to trust (or not) that they have seen evidence. To contextualize the New Zealand support, these attributions coincided with a significant 2018 government focus on cybersecurity as a key threat in the national security threat landscape .\nThe 2018 Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC) Cyber Security Strategy Refresh stated that “New Zealand recognizes that the relevance of cybersecurity concerns now extends across multiple branches of government” (Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, 2018a, p. 6). The primary responsibility for cybersecurity is given to the Government Communications Security Bureau, which delivers signals intelligence. A close look at the government's cyber discourse in 2018 shows a discourse had emerged across the national security sector where a cyber technological threat was being attributed to Russia and North Korea. This threat attribution discourse is usually accompanied by an argument that New Zealand is not immune from this threat, and that additional cyber infrastructure development is required. For example, in February 2018, Andrew Hampton, the director general of the GCSB (Government Communications Security Bureau, 2018), stated, “In terms of cyber threats, the GCSB noted a 15% increase in serious incidents affecting New Zealand in the year to June 2017”, and that “The GCSB's international partners have today attributed the NotPetya cyber-attack to the Russian Government”. Here we see that the attribution for NotPetya is sourced from Five Eyes partners, and it is not made clear whether the\nstatement was made simply in support of, or after reviewing classified evidence supplied by their partners.\nSimilarly, in the 2018 winter issue of Line of Defence the Right Honorable Andrew Little, Minister Responsible for the GCSB and NZSIS stated:\n> In February, the Government added New Zealand's voice to the international condemnation of the NotPetya cyber-attack which international partners have now attributed to the Russian Government. It targeted Ukraine but had a global impact -- including affecting supply chains in New Zealand. In December, New Zealand also expressed concern about international reports which link North Korea to the major WannaCry ransomware campaign.\n>\n> A similar type of attribution claim can also be found in the July 2018 Ministry of Defense Strategic Defence Policy Statement which states that:\n> Physical distance is no protection in cyberspace, and New Zealand is subject to a growing cyber threat from state sponsored and other malicious actors... Cyber blurs boundaries between conflict and peace, and public and private. (...)\n>\n> Russian ‘active measures' in the 2016 United States Presidential election brought to light ‘cyber enabled information warfare' as a disrupter in liberal democracies. (...)\n>\n> North Korea has a substantial store of chemical and biological weapons, a significant cyber capability (which it has shown a willingness to use).\n>\n> (Ministry of Defence, 2018, pp. 18--21)\nAcross these three examples, and more recently in the 2019 New Zealand cyber-security strategy (Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, 2019), we clearly see attributions of cyber threat to Russia and North Korea. We also see in all these examples that the threat attribution for cyber-attacks occurring across nation-states is linked explicitly to a governmental claim that there is a growing cyber threat environment impacting adversely on New Zealand's national security and, by implication, that there is an increased need for investment in the nation's cyber infrastructure. The implication is that cyber-attacks represent a form of virtual domain of threat that circumvents the nation's geographic isolation and that while it may not be a direct target of any such future attack, both WannaCry and NotPetya demonstrated the ability these attacks have to deliver collateral damage on a global scale. Nevertheless, we still need to better understand what might motivate such a small nation to make explicit attribution claims.\n## Cyber threat attribution\nCyber attribution is generally understood to be a difficult technical process . Commonly, the challenge of attributing a cyber-threat has created problems for nations trying to establish deterrence against\nforeign actors . However, it is the political construction of cyber threat attribution in national security that is useful here. Myriam Dunn Calvety (2013, p. 105) argued that “The link between cyberspace and national security is often presented as an unquestionable and uncontested ‘truth'. However, there is nothing natural or given about this link: It had to be forged, argued, and accepted in the (security) political process”. She argues that cybersecurity discourse is, in fact, constituted by a variety of authority figures in governments. For Dunn Calvety, the political nature of cyber discourse is further complicated by the fact that the very building blocks of cybersecurity language employ analogies or metaphors to describe and explain the effect of unsolicited changes in code across networks. Similar to a conceptualization of disease as an attack , this metaphorical language of cyber “attack” and “weapons” is potentially distorting and results in a tendency to describe the cyber landscape as unruly, dangerous, or threatening, when, in fact, much of the cyber environment is benign and intended to be enabling.\nOne consequence of the political construction of cyber discourse is that there are real risks when it comes to generating accurate attribution claims. Thomas Rid and Ben Buchanan (2015, p. 4) argue, “Doing attribution well is at the core of virtually all forms of coercion and deterrence, international and domestic. Doing it poorly undermines a state's credibility, its effectiveness, and ultimately it's liberty and security”. When it comes to cybersecurity, the attribution debate is evolving surprisingly slowly, and this slowness remains the case today . Rid and Buchanan (2015, p. 4) provide a detailed technical account of the attribution process, where they conclude that developing the evidence for cyberattack attribution is a difficult and costly process which inevitably only indicates the likely source of an attack. Moreover, this evidence cannot easily determine motive or the political gain that may have initially motivated an attack. They conclude with the finding that attribution is what states make of it, and public attribution is a political act used by states to legitimate security positioning. If we are to follow Rid and Buchanan's logic, we could understand the Five Eyes attribution of cyber threat to Russia and North Korea as a broader function of what is at stake politically in terms of the broader relations between these nations.\nIn the New Zealand case study, the combination of technical evidence challenges and political nature of attribution claims is made explicit when we look closely at the GCSB's National Cyber Security Centre Annual report, where it states:\n> Publicly reporting attribution is a significant [political] decision and is not made by the NCSC alone. Public attribution is one way to reduce the efficacy of malicious cyber actors by revealing their tools or increasing the reputational costs of illegitimate activity. However, it also carries risk for New Zealand and is considered alongside our other national objectives, including the need to maintain our ability to protect the networks that are of importance...\n>\n> (Government Communications Service Bureau, 2017a, p. 12)\nGiven that there is academic and local technical agreement that cyber threat attribution is ultimately a political act, why might this government be making these threat attribution claims -- why now and what might be the risks inherent in this attribution?\nThere are three possible explanations for this attribution. Firstly, there is a clear discussion in other sections of these documents that New Zealand is part of the Five Eyes network and is speaking in solidarity with its partners to increase the reputational costs of these activities. The challenge here is that when there is no unclassified evidence to support these attribution claims (there was commercial evidence for WannaCry but none for NotPetya), the public must trust the veracity and motives of these partners, and they must trust that their politicians are maintaining an independent policy stance. For example, Reuben Steff's chapter in this volume (Chapter 3) explains that small states are traditionally considered to be “consumers” of security technology supplied by larger states, given they often cannot develop it on their own. This means that it is necessary for New Zealand to align itself with the US on key technological security issues, and the case suggested here is that this could extend to technological threat attribution too, in order to secure its relations to the US and maintain access to critical technology advances and supply. If this is the case, it fuels critical questions about the independence of the nation's foreign affairs policy , which, if undermined, would be a potential blow to public trust.\nA second explanation is sourced from DPMC's National Cyber Policy Office release of April 20, 2018, which takes the form of a letter written by the Right Honorable Claire Curran, then-minister of Broadcasting, Communication, and Digital Media. The topic of the letter is the Refresh of New Zealand's Cyber Security Strategy and Action Plan which resulted in 2019 Cybersecurity Strategy.\nClaire Curran stated:\n> The clear trend is an upward trajectory of cyber security threats... New Zealand's geographical location does not exempt us from this threat... We will need to consider the mechanisms available to us to dissuade or deter malicious cyber activities, particularly where it is state-sponsored, or state condoned. This includes the option of publicly attributing malicious cyber activity as a way of holding states to account.\n>\n> (Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, 2018b, p. 4, p. 9)\nClearly, in the above document, the government has made an active political decision to publicly attribute what it describes as malicious cyber activity to particular nation-states as part of “expanding its international cyber efforts” (ibid). The challenge is that the source and reliability of classified evidence for the threat and the rationale for public attribution are unable to be made transparent, and the public is being represented by this claim. Here, the public is asked to trust that the correct decisions and attributions are being made as part of being a good international citizen and that the government is not being selective in who it calls to account.\nA third explanation comes from the Copenhagen school, which developed the securitization theory that focuses on “speech acts” and the significance these acts can have upon political agenda settings and political relations . Securitization theory suggests that when a threat is identified and a “speech act” identifying it is utilized, this discourse prioritizes the threat on the political agenda in such a way that it necessitates the development of urgent mitigation measures that could potentially extend even to the encroachment of privacy, the need for secrecy, and the utilization of force . For the Copenhagen school, securitization speech acts emphasize the dangers of the cyber threat environment and legitimate additional government funding for the construction of various infrastructures designed to protect the public from the threat. The challenge here, again, is that the speech acts have the power for change, not any classified evidential basis that may sit behind the act. When it comes to cyber threats, the public has no choice but to trust that those who are making the speech act are fully informed by subject matter experts and are making the best national security decisions possible.\nTaken together, these explanations suggest that the various 2018--2019 New Zealand Cybersecurity attribution speech acts appear designed to: Align New Zealand closer to its Five Eyes partnersCall out certain acts of cyber aggression where New Zealand can then position itself as a good international cyber citizenBe used as a mechanism to dissuade or deter malicious cyber activity by publicly attributing the activity to hold states to accountCreate, justify, and legitimate the development of additional domestic cybersecurity infrastructure\nTogether, these four purposes suggest that the attributions are being utilized for both international and domestic positioning in terms of alignment with our partners, being a good international citizen, and creating global and domestic cyber infrastructures to further New Zealand's interests and safety.\n## Public trust and national security discourse\nIn a civil society environment where the evidence for attribution is unavailable and the integrity of state institutions such as the GSCB  or the Minister for Broadcasting's judgement has recently been called into doubt , it is possible that future trust and confidence issues may arise around the efficacy of this language and the effectiveness of current government cyber initiatives. In 2015 and 2016, similar trust and confidence issues occurred in the justification of counter terrorism funding , where evidence of a domestic Muslim radicalization threat has never eventuated and the claim of the “Jihadi bride” risk was found by the media to have little evidentiary basis and to have been exaggerated  and shifted attention away from the right wing. It is clear that, at least within the New Zealand Fourth Estate (News\nMedia), there is a tendency to critically examine government security discourse rather than trust it implicitly, and it is this view that underpins their reporting to the population . Serious issues around trust in government security discourse and action resulted in recent wholesale reform of the New Zealand intelligence agency legislation with the creation of the Intelligence and Security Act 2017 governing the NZSIS and GSCB . Further destabilization of public trust in security agencies is also evident with ongoing “inquiries” into the New Zealand Defence Force's actions in Afghanistan (Operation Burnham Inquiry 2020) and the Christchurch Terror attacks (Christchurch Attack Royal Commission 2020), where the integrity of national security apparatus and discourse has been brought into contention by investigative journalists , expert commentators, or community groups (Ainge Roy, 2019), creating a situation where it is impossible to know whose claim is trustworthy . All the national security organizations (NZDF, GCSB, DPMC, and NZSIS) under investigation in these two inquiries are the same agencies producing the cybersecurity attributions. While clear distinctions need to be made between these individual one-off events and the general effectiveness of these agencies' everyday business and their successful operations, these examples show that they are regularly and recently seen by the public to have their integrity brought into doubt.\nThese types of one-off trust challenges to national security agency integrity are also seen at the international level. In 2013, WikiLeaks released an electronic dispersal of NSA classified material of some 1.7 million documents that had been leaked by Edward Snowden. These documents suggested strongly that the NSA, and perhaps also its Five Eyes partners, were engaged in regular global surveillance of their domestic populations . Again, it was impossible to know the truth of this claim based on open-source information, but part of the multifaceted collateral damage caused by this leak is a tarnishing of the reputation of the Five Eyes's agencies within their own populations where trust and confidence in those intelligence agencies is diminished in the eyes of the public.\nIn 2016, an additional social media technological challenge emerged for government discourse by the name of fake news . Social media allows content to be passed between providers with no verification of its authenticity (ibid). Morgan (2018, p. 39) asserts that this verification problem allows disinformation and what is described as fake news to manipulate the public sphere and has the effect of “declining levels of trust in institutions and experts”. There are significant implications for democracy and free speech emerging from this phenomenon. When it comes to intelligence agency claims, the discussion of fake news is particularly pertinent when it comes to the relationship between US President Donald Trump and his intelligence agencies . Over a number of highly publicized national security issues related to Iran, ISIS, North Korea, and Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election, the president has called the discourse of his intelligence agencies into question. Donald Trump effectively stated that the intelligence agency claims are fake news and that the integrity of their discourse needs to be stringently questioned.\nConversely, one must ask why should the public trust Donald Trump, who has a conflict of interest because of investigations into his own actions, over politically neutral actors? Consequently, it is sensible for the public to ask whose security claim should be trusted and why? When it comes to Russian interference in the US election, Thirdway.org data show that the Donald Trump/James Comey counterclaims have created significant confusion about whose security discourse to trust (Eoyang et al, 2018). The broader ramification of such a claim is that all intelligence agency discourse, including that of cyber threat attribution, could be questioned and further magnifies the question over how Five Eyes partners, and their respective public, know who they should trust.\nAn essential assumption of my argument is that a problem of trust exists today when it comes to the public receiving national security agency discourse. How does one define trust? In political science, it has been traditionally assumed that “Trust is relational; it involves an individual making herself vulnerable to another individual, group, or institution that has the capacity to do her harm or betray her” . Trust can be understood as dichotomous in that one trusts or one does not, but trust relations can also be a sliding scale of degrees of trust. For example, Western populations give their trust to their national security agencies to be protected from cyber threats . That trust is essential for cyberspace to function and for governance and security of that critical infrastructure (Azmi et al, 2018, p. 258).\nHenschke and Ford (2017, p. 82) have argued that since the Snowden releases there has been a breakdown in the public's trust of national security agencies.\n> The cost here is in the public's willingness and capacity to trust in state mechanisms of national and international security, especially those intelligence programmes involving cyber-surveillance. The loss of trust in this area is particularly detrimental to the effective functioning of national security.\n>\n> For Henschke and Ford (2017, p. 82), there is a twofold element of trust in the relationship between national security agencies and the public: 1) That surveillance is necessary and 2) that intelligence activities must be kept secret from the public. The challenge of Snowden (and likewise the GCSB's illegal spying on Kim Dotcom)  is that the Five Eyes nations were “caught out abusing this trust risk losing the goodwill of the public. If the public's trust in this area is lost and the government is judged as untrustworthy, then effective governing can become more difficult” . Pew data since the Snowdon releases reveal that the American public's approval for surveillance of citizens has declined as has their confidence that their government can protect their private data . Thirdway.org suggests that in relation to contentious national security issues, most Americans did not know whose claim to trust (Eoyang et al, 2018). The poll data are not conclusive in showing a loss of trust in national security discourse, but it certainly demonstrates a public confusion and a lack of implicit unquestioned trust in national security discourse.\nGiven that recent Pew data also suggest the public believe there will be increasing cyber threats to elections and national security infrastructure , it is essential that trust is maintained. Ultimately, the loss of public trust is counterproductive for effective national security  because it leads to increasing media scrutiny and hyperbole, which then adversely impacts security agency transparency in terms of comfort levels with communicating to the public and not over classifying internal documentation. Thus, when it comes to making cyber-security policy, Ball et al (2019, p. 103) have argued that “Cybersecurity policymaking at the national level should be attentive to the central role of trust for maintaining resilient cyber systems -- and it should have plans in place to repair trust”. Trust therefore is an essential element of cyber-governance. To create trust with the public, governments must be seen to be active, careful, and deliberate in the policy and infrastructure they create and sustain to keep cyberspace safe, both domestically and globally. All these activities (including attribution) will be more effective if trust has not been reduced by earlier state failings and when/if a government can be transparent.\n## Conclusion: Addressing the contestability of attribution discourse\nIn this chapter, my intention has been to argue that, when it comes to cyber threat attribution claims made by governments, it is not always clear whose claim to trust or to what extent. There are inherent challenges in cyber threat attribution discourse: a) The evidence for attribution is not publicly verifiable, b) attribution is inherently political, c) the public must choose to trust attribution discourse or not, and d) attribution discourse often comes from institutions whose integrity has been brought into question elsewhere (this decreases trust). Given these concerns, we can say that there is a trust and confidence challenge that must be addressed by governments when it comes to the production of such discourse in the future.\nAs a social scientist, I traditionally look for empirical evidence to back a claim; without it, we are, at best, left with circumstantial evidence or, at worst, simply a truth claim. Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that the public do not (and perhaps should not) have access to classified empirical data to make assessments about the efficacy of cybersecurity decisions and discourse . This creates a grey zone where cyber-attacks and their attributions live in a contested space of discourse between evidence and trust, where maintaining trust in government action is essential. I have demonstrated that attribution claims are inherently political and are contestable by both the accuser and the accused. While the effects of cyber-attacks are very real, communication about their effects and the intentions and motives behind an attack exist in a land of metaphor and discourse. This makes national security discourse around cyber-attacks contestable; a fact that is exacerbated by an inclination across social media, traditional media, and even the president of the US (with his conflict of interest) to question the integrity of these attribution claims. Therefore, a social scientific crisis emerges where, because of the classified nature of the evidence, the public is asked to trust\nand have confidence in a technological threat attribution claim without any further assurance. Consequently, it is then sensible for the public to ask whose security claim should be believed and why.\nIn modern democracies, trust in government is a key indicator of political legitimacy and stability . Key questions for governments and populations are how and when do we trust the national security discourse of our government. A lack of trust inherently undermines and frustrates the positive intent of governments to keep their citizenry safe. In a contemporary environment where the national security discourse of a nation such as New Zealand (not to mention many other states) can be contested, it seems a critical social responsibility for security policy makers and academia to first acknowledge this trust and confidence conundrum and then strive to develop frameworks to better understand the trust and confidence challenges around threat attribution and apply it to this emerging cyber discourse. How to ensure that there is trust and confidence in the government's ability to identify, communicate, and respond to technological national security threats will be essential 21st-century governance questions for democracies.\nUnfortunately, civil society cannot be relied upon to meet such a challenge. A civic challenge exists for both government and academia to consider how to best address the inherent weakness (that they are political and contestable) that exists in national security threat attributions. Ideally, probably the most effective manner in which cyber attribution could be separated from the individual interests of nation-states or commercial entities is if some form of international legal attribution agency was formed. However, realistic solutions to the attribution problem must come from individual governments, who should be sufficiently motivated to increase the efficacy of its security apparatus by decreasing potential criticism of its discourse.\nThe producers of national security discourse must acknowledge that these weaknesses exist in their discourse and that it is their responsibility to find ways to mitigate these challenges. This is critical because WannaCry and NotPetya have shown us that cyber issues are changing the national security landscape indelibly. While care is required around cyber hyperbole and metaphor, the potential scale, spread, and damage of future attacks could be catastrophic. Governments need to find better ways to effectively communicate with each other, their opponents, and their own populations when it comes to mitigating these challenges.\nIt is important to conclude by asking what might be possible solutions to respond to the technological cyber-attack attribution challenge? First, cyber discourse makers must accept that national security discourse justifications that arise from classified sources cannot always provide a persuasive public evidence basis for their assertions. Second, cyber discourse makers should acknowledge that their claims are inherently political and therefore potentially contestable. Such acknowledgment would allow the discourse to be more reflexive and to self-regulate its claims in a more nuanced manner. Nuanced cyber threat discourse lessens the possibility that a government institution or representative will be subsequently called to account for making an incorrect or exaggerated claim. Governments\nCyber threat and national security policy 235\nshould look to employ these observations in the communication tools that they already possess. Cybersecurity strategy refreshes offer a real opportunity to engage with the public. They can focus both on private enterprise and the public. They can offer an education capacity and more transparency around the nature of various cyber threats. One place where a degree of transparency and limited evidence can exist for the actual nature and prevalence of cyber threats is in the annual reports from their National Cyber Security Centers (see Government Communications Security Bureau, 2017a). These carefully constructed and communicated reports and data could and should be more widely distributed, publicized, and utilized as an evidence basis for future claims. And lastly, one additional way to address the confidence challenge and limited trust around secrecy in national security discourse is to regularly craft language that clearly notes that a fine balance exists between secrecy and transparency. This balance relies heavily on building a trusting and transparent relationship between government officials and the public while working to repair any past breaches of confidence."
