For instance, China’s espionage efforts to identify potential dissidents, including human rights activists, may expose these individuals to physical danger when they return to their own countries. This danger could manifest in various forms, such as anonymous cyber attacks, as demonstrated by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) conducting espionage against Canadian citizen Omar Said.²\nThis paper examines the legal frameworks in Canada and the United States (U.S.) for addressing cyber espionage, highlighting the current lack of international focus on the issue. It aims to enhance Canada’s capacity to fight and prosecute cyber espionage threats in both public and private sectors, offering recommendations to improve Canada’s legal framework to bolster the country’s defence against these threats. Part I provides an overview of cyber espionage and its significance within cyberspace. Part II examines the legal frameworks in both Canada and the U.S., including relevant case law. Part III assesses the distinctions between Canadian and U.S. cybersecurity laws, focusing on their application to cyber espionage. Finally, Part IV offers recommendations for improving Canada’s legal framework.\n# Part I. Cyber Espionage Defined and Explored\n## Cyber Espionage: A Definition\nThere is no universally accepted definition of cyber espionage, a fact that complicates both its legal interpretation and international regulation. The Federal Court of Appeal, in the case of *Qu v Canada* defined it as “surreptitious or covert information gathering”.³ Meanwhile,\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n4\nexperts like Herb Lin, a prominent computer scientist, define it as intentional efforts to infiltrate computer systems or networks to access stored or transitioning information.⁴ Russell Buchan, a Professor of International Law, further refines this by describing it as ‘non-consensual copying of confidential information that is resident in or transiting through cyberspace.’⁵ These varied definitions highlight the fluidity and complexity of the term, distinguishing it from cyberwarfare, which targets disruption rather than mere intelligence gathering.⁶ The lack of consensus on a definition reflects the diverse motivations and actors involved in cyber espionage, ranging from state to non-state actors, and underscores the challenge of creating a unified legal and operational framework to discuss such activities.\n## Purpose and Actors\nCyber espionage serves two primary objectives: political and economic. Political espionage comprises the unauthorized access to military, potential commercial or other secret information, compromising a state’s ability to safeguard itself and its citizens from foreign threats.⁷ Economic espionage entails the illicit acquisition of trade secrets crucial for a nation’s financial success, thus threatening the economic stability of the state.⁸ Each type of espionage carries specific legal consequences, which vary based on whether the espionage was conducted for political or economic reasons.\nThe primary foreign threat actors originate from China and Russia with the primary targets of cyber espionage being the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom.⁹ Many of these target states engage in cyber espionage themselves. For example, the U.S. has faced accusations of conducting cyber espionage in foreign states, as revealed by information disclosed by whistleblower Edward Snowden.¹⁰ This highlights a prevalent lack of accountability that both\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n5\nWestern and non-Western countries aim to maintain. The perpetrators of cyber espionage can be divided between state actors¹¹ and non-state actors, which include private individuals, criminal organizations, and others.¹² This distinction becomes blurred when considering state-sponsored actors, who are non-state entities conducting cyber espionage operations on behalf of their government.¹³\nThe perpetrators of cyber espionage target both the public and private sectors. Currently, there has been a noticeable shift in Canada from cyber espionage targeting the public sector, which benefits from the government’s substantial cybersecurity infrastructure, to espionage aimed at the private sector. This shift underscores the critical need to address threats targeting the private sector.¹⁴ According to a report by New Zealand’s National Cyber Security Centre, financial motivation surpasses state-sponsored activity.¹⁵ Therefore, economic cyber espionage is one of the primary concerns within the cyber arena.\nCanada and the U.S. have established specific legal frameworks to address and penalize cyber espionage activities. In Canada, economic espionage is deemed an indictable offence under section 19 of the Security of Information Act (SOIA).¹⁶ Anyone found guilty of violating subsection 19(1) faces a penalty of imprisonment for up to 10 years.¹⁷ This law applies to cyber-related activities where confidential economic information is illicitly obtained. In the U.S., the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 serves to criminalize economic espionage activities. According to this Act, economic espionage includes actions where an individual intentionally commits an offence that benefits any foreign government, instrumentality, or agent. The Act specifies offences including the unauthorized theft or acquisition of trade secrets through fraudulent means, the unauthorized copying or conveyance of trade secrets, and the unauthorized\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n6\npossession, receipt, or purchase of trade secrets knowing them to have been stolen or obtained without authorization.¹⁸\n## Importance of Addressing Cyber Espionage\nChallenges in attribution and the absence of comprehensive international legal frameworks or extradition treaties significantly undermine the effectiveness of current domestic laws in Canada and the U.S. in combating cyber espionage. These difficulties are compounded by the state-centric nature of international law, which tends to hold foreign states accountable for actions by private entities within their territory. This leads to a significant disconnect in holding the actual perpetrators (defendants) accountable to the victims (appellants) due to the following reasons:\n1) Attribution Errors\nIdentifying the precise origins of cyber espionage activities is notoriously difficult. Cyber attackers often use sophisticated techniques to mask their locations and identities, making it challenging for victim states to accurately attribute cyber attacks to specific actors or states. This ambiguity hinders the ability to levy charges or sanctions against the responsible parties.\n2) Lack of International Legal Agreements or Extradition Treaties\nThe absence of universally accepted international legal agreements or extradition treaties that specifically address cyber espionage exacerbates the problem. Without these agreements, even when attribution is possible, legal mechanisms to pursue or prosecute individuals or entities across borders are limited or non-existent.\n3) State-Centric Model of International Law\nThe prevailing model of international law focuses on the responsibilities and rights of states rather than individuals or non-state actors. When cyber espionage is conducted\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n7\nwithin a state’s jurisdiction, that state is held responsible, creating a situation where the state can deny involvement or blame non-state actors, thus avoiding direct accountability.\n## 4) Perpetuated Lack of Accountability\nThere is an implicit global agreement among states, driven by their own involvement in cyber espionage, to maintain this status quo. This tacit understanding further dilutes the incentive for states to develop stringent international norms or laws against cyber espionage, as doing so could implicate their own activities.\nThese factors collectively lead to a cycle of unaccountability, where states can easily absolve themselves of blame, and victims have limited recourse through domestic or international legal systems. To protect Canadian interests effectively, there is a need for a dual approach that involves strengthening domestic legal frameworks to better protect against cyber espionage and advocating for the development of international norms and agreements that address the unique challenges of cyberspace, including better mechanisms for attribution, accountability, and cross-border cooperation. This comprehensive strategy would not only enhance Canada’s defensive capabilities but also contribute to the global effort to establish a more secure and accountable cyber environment.\n## Part II. Description of Law\n### International Law Framework\nThe “use of force” doctrine dictated by Article 2(4) of the UN Charter states that “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”.¹⁹ However, in the cyber realm, it remains unclear\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n8\nwhen a cyberintrusion amounts to use of force under this Article.²⁰ Cyber espionage alone may not constitute a wrongful act triggering state responsibility under international law. In fact, some scholars would argue that state practice conducting espionage towards foreign states has created a norm that this does not violate state sovereignty.²¹ For instance, the original drafters of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 proposed that “because cyber espionage involves the collection of confidential information and does not therefore produce destructive effects either offline or online, [...] does not qualify as an infringement of the victim state’s territorial sovereignty”.²² However, Russell Buchan argues that acts of political and economic cyber espionage that ‘penetrate computer networks and systems supported by cyber infrastructure situated within the territory of another state [emphasis added] constitute a violation of that state’s territorial sovereignty, irrespective of whether that operation causes damage or harm.’²³ In line with Buchan, suppose an individual walks into your house for the purposes of looking around at midnight while you are unaware, and with your explicit prohibition of any visitors at any time. Would you consider their entry to be a visit or an intrusion into your property? Would that individual have had to cause harm to property or person for you to call the police? The application of force offers limited utility because cyber espionage, considered a breach of international law similar to an intrusion, lacks a coercive element that would provoke a violent response.²⁴\nThere are scenarios where cyber espionage could be considered a violation of international law without requiring the use of force against another state but rather due to the impact that espionage poses on individuals and companies. The principle of non-intervention is considered a part of customary international law as per the International Court of Justice’s ruling in Nicaragua v US 1986,²⁵ in which the court stated:\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\nThe principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference; though examples of trespass against this principle are not infrequent, the Court considers that it is part and parcel of customary international law. A prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones.\nThus, as per Nicaragua, the principle of non-intervention is breached when there is coercive interference with matters falling within a State’s domaine réservé.²⁶ This principle underscores that coercion does not necessarily involve the use of force.²⁷ In fact, a coercive interference is characterized by actions designed to strip a state of its decision-making freedom²⁸ and compel it to act against its will.²⁹ Despite debates around the applicability of this principle to cyber espionage—arguing it falls outside the purview of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) due to the “clean hands doctrine” where states might be equally culpable—the ICJ has clarified it seldom dismisses cases on this basis without substantial justification.³⁰ It did so in Certain Iranian Assets, stating that “the ICJ has never upheld an objection based on the ‘clean hands’ doctrine” and indeed will not do so unless presented with a compelling reason.³¹\nThe ineffectiveness of domestic law in Canada and other signatory states to the International Convention on Cybercrime is evident when applied to foreign actors, primarily due to challenges in attribution and extradition. While Canada commits to criminalizing acts like cyber theft domestically, acknowledging the significant harm data theft poses, these efforts falter when addressing the state-sponsored threats that dominate the cyber espionage arena.³² For instance, within Canada specifically, everyone who fraudulently and without color of right uses a computer service or system “is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.”³³\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n10\nThis convention could be expanded to include cyber espionage due to the harm posed both politically and economically. However, since state-sponsored threats dominate the cyber espionage arena, states are often unwilling to extradite their nationals and reluctant to enforce extradition agreements with one another, which complicates the prosecution of foreign entities. The Cybercrime Convention attempts to address this by suggesting that states should prosecute at the behest of another state if extradition is refused on specific grounds, yet this recommendation highlights a significant gap in international law’s capacity to tackle cross-border cyber crimes.³⁴ This gap underscores the urgent need for a more cohesive international framework to address these challenges.\n## Canadian Cybersecurity Framework\nThe Canadian cybersecurity framework represents a comprehensive approach to addressing the rising tide of cyber threats, particularly in the wake of increased technological adoption and the global pandemic. Canada’s prominence in academic research and economic development has rendered it a prime target for cyber espionage, including both political and economic espionage. With the rise in technological use and transnational interactions due to Covid-19, Microsoft noted that Canada was targeted with 35% more attacks in 2020 than 2019 and was the third most targeted country for Covid-19 related data.³⁵\nDespite significant international collaboration in identifying state-sponsored hackers, and efforts to bolster cybersecurity, the legal capacity to address cyber threats remains largely in the hands of governments. The collaboration between Canada, the U.S., and the United Kingdom in calling out state-sponsored hackers, such as APT29 (also known as ‘the Dukes’ or ‘Cozy Bear’) for their attempts to steal COVID-19 vaccine research exemplifies the proactive stance taken by\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n11\nthese nations.³⁶ Following this, the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security – part of the Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSE) – issued strong recommendations for organizations, specifically health-related ones, to enhance their cyber security and better identify cyber threats.³⁷ They outlined specific Indicators of Compromise (IOC) that organizations should look out for when dealing with such issues.³⁸ While these efforts focus on strengthening defences through cybersecurity frameworks like the ATT&amp;CK Matrix³⁹ and the Cyber Kill Chain,⁴⁰ the emphasis on legal actions against perpetrators remains limited, highlighting the reliance on government intervention.\nThe increase in cyber espionage against private actors underscores the limited legal tools available to these entities to address such threats. Although violations of the law are prosecuted by the government, and protective measures are disseminated through Canadian agencies, private actors do not legally possess the tools to address these threats.⁴¹ This does not mean, however, that there are no avenues for private actors to pursue threat actors that have attacked them. In fact, in 2020, the CSE, acknowledged the commercial availability of advanced cyber tools, indicating a shift towards empowering the private sector in cyber defence.⁴²\nHowever, the lack of specific legislation governing the private sector's involvement in tracking and responding to foreign espionage activities leaves a significant gap in Canada's cybersecurity strategy.⁴³ The concept of Active Cyber Defence (ACD), defined as a non-governmental response to cyber threats that has effects outside the defender's own network,⁴⁴ highlights the emerging debate on how private entities can and should respond to cyber threats.\nCanada's legal framework grants significant authority to government agencies in addressing cyber espionage, but the effectiveness of these measures is limited by international challenges. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has the authority to identify and\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n12\nprosecute cyber espionage under section 12.1 of the CSIS Act, which allows for ‘reasonable and proportionate’ measures to reduce threats to national security.⁴⁵ Additionally, the SOIA under section 19 criminalizes economic espionage, with severe penalties, though its deterrence is limited by the difficulty in prosecuting foreign actors.⁴⁶ There is an implicit delineation between the legal prosecution of political cyber espionage and economic cyber espionage, whereby CSIS deals with the former, focusing on threats to national security, while the Cyber Centre in Canada deals with the latter. While the penalty is significant, its deterrent effect is limited, as the majority of such acts are perpetrated by foreign actors who remain virtually immune from extradition and prosecution due to the complexities of international law. This underscores the challenges discussed earlier regarding the limitations of the current international legal framework in effectively addressing cross-border cyber espionage.\nTo understand how Canada’s legal frameworks counter potential foreign threats related to cyber espionage, this paper will analyze three pivotal cases. These cases demonstrate the application of legal mechanisms, particularly in business and immigration law, to prevent entities and individuals associated with or suspected of cyber espionage from conducting business or entering Canada. Each case offers insight into legal methods and considerations applied when addressing cyber espionage to strike a balance between national security interests and individual rights. Case 1 outlines the legal method pursued when businesses pose the threat of conducting or facilitating cyber espionage. Case 2 outlines the legal method and factors that are accounted for when individuals are being considered for entry into Canada in relation to cyber espionage concerns. Case 3 outlines concerns with inadmissibility of foreign actors fearing persecution.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n13\nCase 1: China Mobile Communications Group Co Ltd v Canada (Attorney General) (2021)⁴⁷\nThe applicants, China Mobile Communications Group Co., Ltd., China Mobile International (Canada) Inc., and China Mobile International (UK) Limited, sought to stay an order under the Investment Canada Act, requiring China Mobile to divest its interest in its Canadian business, CMI Canada, due to identified national security risks pertaining to cyber espionage.⁴⁸ The Federal Court denied the applicants’ motion for a stay. The court stated that it had notable concerns about CMI Canada’s potential facilitation of espionage and foreign interference activities by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) based on sufficient evidence provided by the respondents, which included reports from the CSE and CSIS, indicating the PRC’s involvement in cyber threats. Thus, the court concluded that the public interest harms outweighed the potential harm to the applicants. Stated differently, the public harms associated with the PRC’s opportunity to use its indirect control over CMI Canada to facilitate espionage and foreign interference activities in Canada were significantly greater than the harm that the applicants established they would suffer if the stay was not granted.\nCase 2: Geng v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023⁴⁹\nLiping Geng challenged the decision of an Immigration Officer to refuse his application for permanent residence under the Family Class, rendering him inadmissible under paragraph 34(1)(f) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The Security Screening Branch/CSIS and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)/National Security Screening Division (NSSD) raised concerns about Geng’s employment at the Luoyang Foreign Languages Institute (LFLI) and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) being linked to espionage activities. Geng had a Canadian wife and daughter, frequently traveled between Canada and China, and maintained that he did not hold a military rank.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n14\nThe Federal Court found in favor of Mr. Geng in this immigration case, concluding that the Immigration Officer’s decision to deny admission to the 68-year-old retired language professor was unreasonable and lacked justification, transparency, and intelligibility. The court emphasized the severe consequences of the decision on the applicant, who had been previously admitted to Canada multiple times, including obtaining citizenship.\nCase 3: Yihdego v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2020⁵⁰\nMr. Abel Nahusenay Yihdego, a citizen of Ethiopia, sought refugee protection in Canada, claiming persecution by his previous employer, the Information Network Security Agency (INSA), due to his refusal to join its decryption department, which was allegedly engaged in espionage. The Immigration Division (ID) found Mr. Yihdego inadmissible to Canada for being associated with an organization believed to engage in espionage against Canada’s interests. The decision by the ID was subjected to judicial review by the Federal Court, where the court rules in favor of Mr. Yihdego, deeming the ID’s decision unreasonable. The court held that the ID erred in considering Charter values in defining “Canada’s interests” and questioned the rationale behind concluding that espionage against a Canadian ally was against Canada’s interests. The judgment allowed Mr. Yihdego’s application for judicial review, sending the matter back to another panel of the ID for reconsideration. The court also proposed a question of general importance related to the inadmissibility of a person to Canada under specific circumstances outlined in the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act*.\nIn these cases, legal mechanisms were instrumental in addressing potential foreign threats by scrutinizing business activities and immigration applications, preventing individuals and entities linked to cyber espionage from operating within Canada.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n15\n# U.S. Cybersecurity Framework\nThe U.S., Canada's largest economic and trading partner, is at the forefront of efforts to address international aspects of cyber security.^[51]^ This stems from its private and public sector being the target of cyber espionage attacks – both political and economic – from various foreign actors. According to General Keith B. Alexander, head of the U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, these cyber \"attacks have resulted in the 'greatest transfer of wealth in history'.\"^[52]^\nThe U.S. Cyber Command was created to use information and communications technology (ICT) and the internet as weapons to defend the Defense Department.^[53]^ In 2011, their international cyber defense strategy entailed \"all necessary means consistent with International Law used to respond to hostile cyberspace acts\".^[54]^ The U.S.'s approach to cybersecurity was further enhanced by the introduction of the Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act (ACDC Act), a bill proposed by U.S. Congressman Tom Graves. This legislation aims to legalize certain cyber security practices or, at least, clarify their legality. This bill responded to demands for the legalization of more aggressive measures in order to allow victims of cyber intrusions to defend themselves against malicious actors.^[55]^ This less than comprehensive legislation allows individuals who have sought non-legal (i.e. ACD) methods of tracking attackers to not be penalized, and obtain support from government organizations for advancing national security.\nAn example of the complexities in cybersecurity law is the case of Shawn Carpenter, a cybersecurity analyst who used his company's data to trace a \"hack\" server in China and provided the information to the FBI in 2003.^[56]^ Although Carpenter was fired for violating company policies, he successfully sued for wrongful termination and won.^[57]^ This incident\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n16\ndemonstrates the double-edged sword that cyberspace creates with uncertainty concerning which laws take precedence over others for the purposes of national security against foreign threats.\nEven when the U.S. has identified foreign individuals conducting cyber espionage activities within their national systems, they are unable to prosecute them due to the lack of agreements within extradition treaties. For instance, in 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice publicly charged five Chinese nationals for engaging in corporate espionage against U.S. corporations.^[58]^ Most of the accused were part of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. However, under the terms of the U.S.- Hong Kong Extradition Treaty,\nChina can refuse to extradite a person within its borders if “surrender implicates the defense, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy of the People’s Republic of China,”\nwhich renders prosecution of these accused impossible. This is despite the fact that Chinese actors have conducted approximately 39 cyber espionage operations within the U.S. between 2003 and 2013, with an annual estimated loss of $600 billion revenue of the U.S.^[59]^\nLegal mechanisms also exist under immigration law to prevent potential foreign threats from enacting businesses or entering the U.S. for the purposes of cyber espionage. The case below underscores the challenges in prosecuting foreign entities for cyber espionage activities, especially when the alleged actions span multiple jurisdictions, highlighting the complex interplay between national security, international law, and the limitations of domestic legal systems in addressing transnational cyber threats.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n17\nCase 1: John DOE, also known as Kidane, Appellant v The FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA, Appellee⁶⁰\nIn 2017, the appellant, John Doe, using the pseudonym “Kidane,” claimed that he was deceived into downloading a computer program that allowed the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia to spy on him from abroad. Kidane wanted to sue Ethiopia, but foreign states are generally immune from lawsuits unless an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) applies. Kidane invoked the FSIA’s exception for noncommercial torts, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that this exception only applies to torts that occur entirely within the U.S. Since Kidane alleged a transnational tort, the court affirmed the district court’s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The case involved claims under the Wiretap Act and the Maryland common law tort of intrusion upon seclusion, both of which were dismissed by the district court. The court’s decision was based on the premise that the entire tort, including the alleged spying, did not occur solely within the U.S.\nThus, legal principles, such as those outlined in the FSIA, play a crucial role in addressing these concerns. FSIA typically provides foreign states with immunity from lawsuits in domestic courts, except under specific exceptions.\nPart III. Assessment of Law\nInternational law, while fruitful in creating an area for non-state entities to combat cyber espionage attacks, remains ineffective in prosecuting foreign entities for domestic attacks within both Canada and the U.S. As seen in Doe, domestic law cannot apply to prosecute foreign governments regardless of evidence of attribution.⁶¹ Within Canada, even while tracing espionage activities to a Russian state-sponsored group, APT29, Canada was unable to achieve prosecution, but rather highlighted cybersecurity measures that Canadian organizations can\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n18\nutilize to protect themselves against such attacks. Further to this point, while both Canada and the U.S. have specific legislation to prosecute violations of cyber espionage, the avenues are prohibited as per international law. For instance, section 19 of the SOIA prohibits economic espionage, while CSIS possesses the authority to identify and prosecute violations of cyber espionage, but neither can adequately protect against foreign actors due to the lack of extradition treaties. On the other hand, despite the U.S. having actively pursued legal actions against foreign individuals engaging in cyber espionage, difficulties in prosecution arise due to extradition treaties, as seen in the example of the U.S.-Hong Kong Extradition Treaty. Thus, states are required to opt for security measures due to lack of extradition treaties governing attribution of cyber espionage due to states' unwillingness to create such treaties as a result of their own involvement in cyber espionage activities.\nA comparison of Canadian and the U.S. legal frameworks reveals their distinct approaches to cyber espionage. While the U.S. has actively addressed cybersecurity threats both in the public and private sectors, Canada has yet to implement direct legal avenues. The U.S. has established and implemented legislation like the ACDC Act to legalize certain cybersecurity practices to clarify the measures that targeted private organizations are able to pursue, while Canada has yet to do so. Canada has, however, increased protective measures and actively engaged in providing recommendations to non-state entities to enhance their cybersecurity frameworks. This demonstrates the initiative taken by the U.S. to engage the private sector in responding to threats more aggressively. Canada has not yet initiated the legalization of a non-governmental response to cyber threats, which may result in the overburdening of the criminal justice system in addressing the increased espionage threats to state and non-state actors.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n19\nHowever, Canadian Immigration Law does mitigate threats of cyber espionage by refusing to permit foreign individuals and/or foreign organizations who may be involved in espionage to continue their activities domestically. This can be seen in *China Mobile* 62 where the organization was divested on the basis of it working under the PRC to conduct cyber espionage operations that threaten national security. These laws, though, are subject to rigorous legal scrutiny as seen in the case of *Yihdego* and *Geng* which ruled in favor of the appellants on the basis that the Immigration Division was unreasonable in their ruling of their association with organizations that operated to conduct cyber espionage.63 Similarly, the U.S. also frequently dismisses individuals under section 212 of the *Immigration and Nationality Act* due to suspicion of espionage, subversion or threat activities to national security.\nThus, both Canada and the U.S. actively address cybersecurity challenges, but there are notable differences in their legal frameworks, responses to private sector involvement, and the use of immigration law as a deterrent against cyber threats.\n## Part IV. Proposition for Legal Frameworks\nThe evaluation of international, Canadian and U.S. legal frameworks suggests recommendations for the improvement of international and Canadian frameworks for the purpose of enhancing Canada's national security. While the U.S. legal framework may have imperfections of its own, that is not covered within the scope of this paper.\n## Recommendations for International Law\nThe issue in international law resides not within the rules that it adopts, but rather in its ability to implement and enforce these principles. Considering this, a unique legal framework for cyber espionage, akin to international human rights or environmental law, could be established for more realistic prosecution measures.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n20\nRecommendation #1. Establishing a Multilateral Treaty for Domestic Enforcement of Anti-Cyber Espionage Laws\nThis recommendation proposes the creation of a multilateral treaty that would allow for the domestic enforcement of anti-cyber espionage laws. The primary objective is to address the challenges in holding individuals accountable for cyber espionage, especially when these activities occur across international borders. The primary challenge includes the reluctance of states to extradite their citizens for cybercrimes committed abroad, largely due to the pervasive nature of state-sponsored cyber espionage. This recommendation acknowledges the complexity of international relations and cyber operations, where national interests often prevent the accountability of individuals involved in cyber espionage.\nDrawing on Harold Koh’s Transnational Legal Process theory, the internalization of international law into domestic law would actualize in three stages: interaction (whereby states, international organizations, legal experts and other stakeholders would begin discussions and negotiations on the creation of a multilateral treaty), interpretation (whereby these entities come together to clarify the obligations, legal enforcement mechanisms and scope of the treaties), and finally internalization (whereby signatory states adopt the treaty’s provisions into their national legal systems and establish mechanisms for prosecution).64 Koh’s theory is utilized to emphasize the importance of integrating international norms into domestic legal systems, and is particularly relevant here because it outlines a process through which international law can be internalized at the domestic level, ensuring that states not only adopt but also enforce these norms within their jurisdictions. The outlined stages underscore the necessity for coordinated international effort to address the gaps in current legal mechanisms concerning cyber espionage.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n21\nAdopting this recommendation allows for the addressing of the limitations of existing extradition treaties, which are often ineffective in the context of cyber espionage. Extradition processes are hindered by political considerations, state sovereignty concerns, and the pervasive involvement of state-sponsored actors in cyber operations. A multilateral treaty that allows for domestic prosecution within the country of origin presents a more feasible and effective solution. This approach aims to enhance accountability while respecting state sovereignty, a balance that is crucial in international law. By incorporating compulsory jurisdictional clauses, such a treaty would provide a legal framework for prosecuting cyber espionage that transcends national borders.\nThis approach also aligns with the growing consensus among legal scholars that traditional methods of international law enforcement are insufficient to tackle the complexities of cybercrime and espionage. Scholars like Asaf Lubin and Russell Buchan have discussed the limitations of current international law in addressing cyber espionage. Lubin has highlighted the challenges in achieving international consensus on extradition for cyber crimes due to the geopolitical implications of state-sponsored activities. Buchan, on the other hand, has argued for the necessity of developing new legal frameworks that can address the unique challenges posed by cyber operations. This recommendation aligns with their views by proposing a multilateral treaty as a viable alternative to the current state of affairs, offering a practical and forward-thinking solution that addresses the gaps identified by these experts.\nThus, this recommendation recognizes the limitations of current legal mechanisms and the necessity for states to collaborate in creating norms and laws that reflect the realities of the digital age. Implementing such a treaty would require a significant diplomatic effort, consensus-building, and the willingness of states to enforce these laws domestically against their citizens. It\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n22\nrepresents a forward-thinking approach to international cybersecurity, emphasizing the importance of legal frameworks in maintaining global digital security and justice.\n## Recommendation #2. Implementing International Accountability for Non-State Cyber Actors through Organizational Deterrence\nThis recommendation proposes leveraging international organizations, such as the United Nations (UN) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), to enforce accountability on non-state actors involved in cyber violations, a move beyond the traditional state-centric model of international law. This could take effect in the form of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) publicly denouncing states that support or fail to act against non-state cyber actors. The reputational damage from such denunciations can be a powerful deterrent; the UN Security Council (UNSC) passes binding resolutions that impose sanctions on states that are found to harbor or support non-state cyber actors. These sanctions could range from economic penalties to restrictions on participation in international activities; the ICJ could contribute through legal adjudication by issuing advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by the UNGA, UNSC, or other authorized international organs. Such opinions on the legality of states' actions or inactions regarding cyber activities can influence international law and state behavior. States could bring cases against other states they allege are responsible for cyber violations through support or harboring of non-state actors. A judgment against a state in such a case could lead to direct legal consequences for the state and set precedents that deter future violations. Thus, this approach suggests using public denunciation as a tool for deterrence, identifying non-state actors by their associated state, names, and other identifiable information to hold them accountable on the international stage.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n23\nThe core of this strategy lies in the use of general deterrence, where the public calling out of these actors would lead to tangible consequences. These could include economic sanctions, arms embargoes, or even expulsion from international bodies against the states harboring or indirectly supporting such actors. The premise is that by imposing reputational damage and potential economic or political penalties, both the perpetrators and their host states would be discouraged from engaging in or condoning cyber violations due to the heightened risks of international condemnation and isolation. These have been proven effective in other contexts. For instance, UN sanctions, when well-implemented, have been used to curb behaviors like nuclear proliferation and terrorism. Although the effectiveness of sanctions and public denunciations can vary, historical evidence shows that they can lead to meaningful consequences, such as economic or political isolation of offending states. For example, the sanctions imposed by the UN on North Korea, including economic sanctions and arms embargoes, have aimed to curtail the country's nuclear ambitions by exerting pressure through international isolation and economic restrictions.65 This demonstrates how similar strategies could be applied to the realm of cyber violations.\nThis approach acknowledges the complexities and limitations of attributing cyber activities to specific actors but leverages the global community's collective power to enforce norms and maintain cyber peace. It reflects a pragmatic understanding that in the digital age, where state and non-state boundaries blur in cyber operations, traditional methods of accountability may need to be supplemented with broader, more inclusive strategies that can adapt to the dynamic and interconnected nature of global cybersecurity threats.\nHowever, the effectiveness of such measures depends on the willingness of the international community to enforce them uniformly and the ability to adapt these tools to the\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n24\ndynamic nature of cyber threats. Sanctions and public denunciations, while potentially powerful, can sometimes be circumvented or rendered ineffective by the resilience of non-state actors or the protective actions of state sponsors. Nevertheless, the proposal represents a significant step towards strengthening global cyber governance and ensuring that non-state cyber actors are held accountable on the international stage.\n## Recommendations for Canadian Domestic Law\nRecommendation #1. Establishing a National Open-Source Database for Enhanced Cyber Espionage Defence in Canada\nThis recommendation proposes the creation of a national open-source database to list foreign entities known to have targeted Canada through cyber espionage. This initiative would mirror the approach used by Public Safety Canada for terrorist entities, including details such as the reasoning for their listing, dates of listing, and review dates.⁶⁶ The aim is to enable non-governmental entities, including businesses and organizations, to better protect themselves against foreign cyber threats by: avoiding collaboration with listed entities; exercising increased caution when dealing with businesses associated with these entities; and utilizing general Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) for heightened cybersecurity vigilance.\nThis database allows for the addressing of the existing gaps in Canada’s cybersecurity defences by shifting from a reactive to a proactive stance against cyber threats. Currently, non-state actors often lack the necessary information to adequately protect themselves against sophisticated cyber threats. By making detailed information about known cyber threat actors publicly accessible, the database empowers businesses and organizations to take preventive measures, reducing their vulnerability to espionage. This approach not only enhances the overall\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n25\ncybersecurity posture of non-state actors but also alleviates the burden on government resources, allowing them to focus on more complex or high-level threats.\nDespite challenges such as the adaptability of threat actors, who may change names or methods to evade detection, and the need for regular updates and maintenance, the database represents a shift towards a proactive defence strategy, essential in the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber threats. Publicly listing entities involved in cyber espionage would act as a deterrent, signaling Canada's intolerance of such activities. Additionally, the database would establish a legal basis for prosecuting cyber espionage and disrupt the operations of listed entities by discouraging Canadian businesses from engaging with them, making this approach a robust solution to the challenges posed by cyber espionage.\n## Recommendation #2. Strengthening Cybersecurity Through Legislative Mandates: A Proposal for Enhanced Data Protection in Canada\nThis recommendation urges the adoption of stringent legislative measures in Canada to compel organizations to implement robust cybersecurity practices, particularly those handling sensitive data across sectors such as government, research, and healthcare. Given the provinces' constitutional jurisdiction over property and civil rights as outlined in sections 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, this approach allows legislation to be finely tailored to the specific needs and conditions of each region, addressing local differences effectively, particularly in diverse sectors.\nDrawing on insights from legal experts with a background in cybersecurity, there is a consensus on the necessity for more specific Information Technology (IT) and data protection regulations.[67] Despite the expectation for organizations to maintain high standards of privacy and security, gaps and inconsistencies in their cybersecurity measures are evident, underscoring the\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n26\nneed for enforceable legal standards.⁶⁸ For instance, the Capital One Data Breach of 2019, which exposed the data of over 100 million Capital One customers in the U.S. and 6 million in Canada, was a direct result of a misconfigured web application firewall.⁶⁹ This incident shows how a hacker could exploit such a vulnerability to access customer data stored on a cloud server. Similarly, the 2019 Desjardins Group Data Leak, affecting 4.2 million members of the Quebec-based credit union, was caused by an insider threat, leaking sensitive information including names, addresses, birthdates, and social insurance numbers.⁷⁰ These examples underscore the critical need for regulations that not only mandate regular security assessments of cloud environments and configurations but also emphasize internal security measures, access controls, and employee training to detect and prevent insider threats.\nThis proposal calls for the enactment of provincial laws that mandate organizations to periodically update their cybersecurity protocols to thwart unauthorized access by third parties, potentially jeopardizing their data integrity. This approach is bolstered by the aforementioned examples, which despite substantial investment in data protection, have experienced significant breaches. These instances highlight the pervasive challenge of cybersecurity and the inadequacy of voluntary compliance in safeguarding against data breaches.\nBy instituting specific legal requirements for cybersecurity, the recommendation aims to create a uniform baseline of security measures that all organizations must meet, thereby reducing the likelihood of opportunistic cyberattacks exploiting systemic vulnerabilities. While acknowledging that no legislative measure can entirely eliminate the risk of targeted cyberattacks, the proposed laws are intended to significantly reduce the incidence of such breaches by mandating proactive security measures. In effect, this legal mandate would serve as a deterrent against potential attackers while ensuring that organizations are held accountable for\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n27\nthe protection of sensitive data, thereby enhancing the overall cybersecurity posture of Canadian entities. Moreover, considering cybersecurity’s overlap with both telecommunications (federal jurisdiction) and property rights (provincial jurisdiction), a coordinated effort between federal and provincial governments is essential to cover all aspects of cybersecurity effectively. This layered approach could mitigate the risk of cyberattacks by ensuring no aspect of cybersecurity is overlooked due to jurisdictional limitations.\n## Recommendation #3. Implementing a Structured Active Cyber Defence Framework for Canada: A Strategy for Empowering Private Entities\nThis recommendation advocates for Canada to adopt a legislative approach akin to the U.S.’ ACDC Act, allowing specified private entities to engage in Active Cyber Defense (ACD) activities against cyber threats. The rationale behind this suggestion is to enhance the cybersecurity posture of Canadian organizations by legalizing certain proactive defence measures that enable them to deter, detect, and respond to malicious cyber activities effectively. The emphasis on stricter cybersecurity laws is to mitigate the risks of opportunistic cyber attacks that exploit security vulnerabilities, while also acknowledging that even the most robust security measures may not fully prevent targeted cyber espionage or attacks.\nBy selecting specific private entities for conducting ACD, the recommendation aims to create a controlled environment where such activities are regulated and monitored to prevent abuse or unintended consequences. This approach seeks to strike a balance between empowering organizations to defend themselves and ensuring that such measures do not cross ethical or legal boundaries, potentially causing harm to innocent parties or escalating cyber conflicts. Essential to this approach is the establishment of clear limits and parameters for entities eligible to conduct\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n28\nACD, including criteria such as cybersecurity maturity, certification and accreditation, purpose and proportionality of actions, oversight and reporting obligations, legal and ethical training, collaboration with law enforcement, liability and accountability, and mechanisms for revocation of authorization if needed.\nAs cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated, relying solely on passive defence measures is no longer sufficient. The ACDC Act in the U.S. has been proposed as a means to empower private entities to defend themselves more aggressively against cyberattacks. This Canadian adaptation would similarly provide organizations with the legal tools to protect their networks proactively, potentially reducing the incidence of successful cyber intrusions. The case of Shawn Carpenter, as discussed earlier, highlights the practical benefits of such an approach. Carpenter, a cybersecurity analyst, used his employer's resources to trace a cyber intrusion back to its source, which led to the identification of hackers working for a foreign government. Despite his success, Carpenter was fired for unauthorized use of company resources, illustrating the need for legal protection for individuals who take proactive measures to defend their organizations. This case highlights how individuals or entities, when given the legal authority and proper oversight, can contribute to national cyber defence efforts without resorting to vigilantism or exceeding their legal rights. Thus, by providing a legal framework for ACD, this recommendation would encourage cybersecurity professionals to engage in necessary defence actions without fear of job loss or legal repercussions, thereby contributing to broader national security efforts.\nIncorporating these guidelines ensures that the empowered entities act within a framework that safeguards against misuse while enabling effective defence against cyber threats. Thus, this recommendation proposes a structured legal mechanism for Canada to enable selected\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n29\nprivate entities to actively participate in cyber defence, drawing inspiration from the U.S. experience to tailor a system that accommodates Canadian legal and ethical standards. This approach aims to enhance the overall resilience of Canada’s cyber infrastructure by incorporating the capabilities and resources of the private sector into the national cyber defence strategy, under a framework that ensures accountability, legality, and proportionality of actions, fostering a more secure digital environment for Canada.\nThe strength of such a legislation lies in its ability to empower private entities to take a more active role in cybersecurity, filling a critical gap in Canada’s current defence strategy. Challenges such as the risk of escalating cyber conflicts or potential legal and ethical violations must be carefully managed. Concerns about mistaken attribution and the risk of targeting innocent third parties or nation-states, with serious geopolitical consequences, have been raised. Nevertheless, adopting this recommendation provides a structured and regulated approach to active cyber defence, ensuring actions are taken within a legal and ethical framework. By learning from the U.S. experience, Canada can develop a system that aligns with its own legal standards, ultimately strengthening the resilience of its cyber infrastructure. This approach strikes a critical balance between proactive defence and the need for accountability, legality, and proportionality, making it a progressive step in protecting Canada’s digital landscape.\n## Part V. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the assessment of legal frameworks in both Canada and the U.S. reveals the complexities and challenges associated with combating cyber espionage. While international law lays the foundation for addressing cyber threats, its limitations become apparent when attempting to prosecute foreign entities for domestic attacks, as seen in Doe.71 Both Canada and the U.S. have specific legislation to combat cyber espionage, but avenues for prosecution are\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n30\noften hampered by international law and extradition challenges. Notably, the U.S. has taken a more proactive approach by implementing the Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act to clarify and legalize certain cybersecurity practices, encouraging private sector involvement in responding to threats. Canada, on the other hand, has yet to implement similar direct legal avenues for non-governmental responses, relying more on protective measures and recommendations for non-state entities. The use of immigration law as a deterrent against cyber threats is a shared approach between both countries, as demonstrated in cases such as China Mobile, Geng, and Yihdego.72 Both Canada and the U.S. actively address cybersecurity challenges through legal mechanisms, though differences exist in their frameworks, responses to private sector involvement, and the utilization of immigration law. Proposing improvements to the legal frameworks, the paper suggests recommendations for both international and Canadian domestic laws. For international law, the creation of a multilateral treaty enforcing anti-cyber espionage laws into domestic law is proposed, providing a higher level of accountability. Additionally, the suggestion to engage international organizations in enforcing accountability upon non-state cyber actors broadens the scope of responsibility mechanisms, enriching the traditional state-centric model without directly contesting it. For Canadian domestic law, recommendations include the creation of a national open-source database to track foreign entities involved in cyber espionage, enhancing non-governmental entities’ ability to protect themselves. Mandating specific laws to ensure organizations implement stricter cybersecurity measures and designating selected private entities to conduct Active Cyber Defence against threat actors would bolster Canada’s cybersecurity defences. Addressing the evolving threat landscape of cyber espionage requires a multifaceted approach involving international collaboration, legal advances, and proactive measures at the national level. Implementing these recommendations can contribute to a more\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n31\nrobust legal framework, better protecting Canada’s national security interests in the face of growing cyber threats.\n1.

Conclusion...29 Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 Cybercrime in Canada results in more than $3 billion in economic losses each year, which makes it the leading cause of wealth transfer to foreign states.¹ This threat is compounded by cyber espionage seeking to obtain sensitive and financial data, potentially harming civilians, Canadian economic interests, and national security. For instance, China’s espionage efforts to identify potential dissidents, including human rights activists, may expose these individuals to physical danger when they return to their own countries. This danger could manifest in various forms, such as anonymous cyber attacks, as demonstrated by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) conducting espionage against Canadian citizen Omar Said.² This paper examines the legal frameworks in Canada and the United States (U.S.) for addressing cyber espionage, highlighting the current lack of international focus on the issue. It aims to enhance Canada’s capacity to fight and prosecute cyber espionage threats in both public and private sectors, offering recommendations to improve Canada’s legal framework to bolster the country’s defence against these threats. Part I provides an overview of cyber espionage and its significance within cyberspace. Part II examines the legal frameworks in both Canada and the U.S., including relevant case law. Part III assesses the distinctions between Canadian and U.S. cybersecurity laws, focusing on their application to cyber espionage. Finally, Part IV offers recommendations for improving Canada’s legal framework.\n# Part I. Cyber Espionage Defined and Explored ## Cyber Espionage: A Definition There is no universally accepted definition of cyber espionage, a fact that complicates both its legal interpretation and international regulation. The Federal Court of Appeal, in the case of *Qu v Canada* defined it as “surreptitious or covert information gathering”.³ Meanwhile, Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## Purpose and Actors\nCyber espionage serves two primary objectives: political and economic. Political espionage comprises the unauthorized access to military, potential commercial or other secret information, compromising a state’s ability to safeguard itself and its citizens from foreign threats.⁷ Economic espionage entails the illicit acquisition of trade secrets crucial for a nation’s financial success, thus threatening the economic stability of the state.⁸ Each type of espionage carries specific legal consequences, which vary based on whether the espionage was conducted for political or economic reasons.\nThe primary foreign threat actors originate from China and Russia with the primary targets of cyber espionage being the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom.⁹ Many of these target states engage in cyber espionage themselves. For example, the U.S. has faced accusations of conducting cyber espionage in foreign states, as revealed by information disclosed by whistleblower Edward Snowden.¹⁰ This highlights a prevalent lack of accountability that both\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\nThe perpetrators of cyber espionage target both the public and private sectors. Currently, there has been a noticeable shift in Canada from cyber espionage targeting the public sector, which benefits from the government’s substantial cybersecurity infrastructure, to espionage aimed at the private sector. This shift underscores the critical need to address threats targeting the private sector.¹⁴ According to a report by New Zealand’s National Cyber Security Centre, financial motivation surpasses state-sponsored activity.¹⁵ Therefore, economic cyber espionage is one of the primary concerns within the cyber arena.\nCanada and the U.S. have established specific legal frameworks to address and penalize cyber espionage activities. In Canada, economic espionage is deemed an indictable offence under section 19 of the Security of Information Act (SOIA).¹⁶ Anyone found guilty of violating subsection 19(1) faces a penalty of imprisonment for up to 10 years.¹⁷ This law applies to cyber-related activities where confidential economic information is illicitly obtained. In the U.S., the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 serves to criminalize economic espionage activities. According to this Act, economic espionage includes actions where an individual intentionally commits an offence that benefits any foreign government, instrumentality, or agent. The Act specifies offences including the unauthorized theft or acquisition of trade secrets through fraudulent means, the unauthorized copying or conveyance of trade secrets, and the unauthorized Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## Importance of Addressing Cyber Espionage\nChallenges in attribution and the absence of comprehensive international legal frameworks or extradition treaties significantly undermine the effectiveness of current domestic laws in Canada and the U.S. in combating cyber espionage. These difficulties are compounded by the state-centric nature of international law, which tends to hold foreign states accountable for actions by private entities within their territory. This leads to a significant disconnect in holding the actual perpetrators (defendants) accountable to the victims (appellants) due to the following reasons:\n\nIdentifying the precise origins of cyber espionage activities is notoriously difficult. Cyber attackers often use sophisticated techniques to mask their locations and identities, making it challenging for victim states to accurately attribute cyber attacks to specific actors or states. This ambiguity hinders the ability to levy charges or sanctions against the responsible parties.\n\nThe absence of universally accepted international legal agreements or extradition treaties that specifically address cyber espionage exacerbates the problem. Without these agreements, even when attribution is possible, legal mechanisms to pursue or prosecute individuals or entities across borders are limited or non-existent.\n\nThe prevailing model of international law focuses on the responsibilities and rights of states rather than individuals or non-state actors. When cyber espionage is conducted Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## 4) Perpetuated Lack of Accountability\nThere is an implicit global agreement among states, driven by their own involvement in cyber espionage, to maintain this status quo. This tacit understanding further dilutes the incentive for states to develop stringent international norms or laws against cyber espionage, as doing so could implicate their own activities.\nThese factors collectively lead to a cycle of unaccountability, where states can easily absolve themselves of blame, and victims have limited recourse through domestic or international legal systems. To protect Canadian interests effectively, there is a need for a dual approach that involves strengthening domestic legal frameworks to better protect against cyber espionage and advocating for the development of international norms and agreements that address the unique challenges of cyberspace, including better mechanisms for attribution, accountability, and cross-border cooperation. This comprehensive strategy would not only enhance Canada’s defensive capabilities but also contribute to the global effort to establish a more secure and accountable cyber environment.\n## Part II. Description of Law\n### International Law Framework\nThe “use of force” doctrine dictated by Article 2(4) of the UN Charter states that “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”.¹⁹ However, in the cyber realm, it remains unclear\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\nThere are scenarios where cyber espionage could be considered a violation of international law without requiring the use of force against another state but rather due to the impact that espionage poses on individuals and companies. The principle of non-intervention is considered a part of customary international law as per the International Court of Justice’s ruling in Nicaragua v US 1986,²⁵ in which the court stated: Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 The principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference; though examples of trespass against this principle are not infrequent, the Court considers that it is part and parcel of customary international law. A prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones.\nThus, as per Nicaragua, the principle of non-intervention is breached when there is coercive interference with matters falling within a State’s domaine réservé.²⁶ This principle underscores that coercion does not necessarily involve the use of force.²⁷ In fact, a coercive interference is characterized by actions designed to strip a state of its decision-making freedom²⁸ and compel it to act against its will.²⁹ Despite debates around the applicability of this principle to cyber espionage—arguing it falls outside the purview of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) due to the “clean hands doctrine” where states might be equally culpable—the ICJ has clarified it seldom dismisses cases on this basis without substantial justification.³⁰ It did so in Certain Iranian Assets, stating that “the ICJ has never upheld an objection based on the ‘clean hands’ doctrine” and indeed will not do so unless presented with a compelling reason.³¹ The ineffectiveness of domestic law in Canada and other signatory states to the International Convention on Cybercrime is evident when applied to foreign actors, primarily due to challenges in attribution and extradition. While Canada commits to criminalizing acts like cyber theft domestically, acknowledging the significant harm data theft poses, these efforts falter when addressing the state-sponsored threats that dominate the cyber espionage arena.³² For instance, within Canada specifically, everyone who fraudulently and without color of right uses a computer service or system “is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.”³³ Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## Canadian Cybersecurity Framework\nThe Canadian cybersecurity framework represents a comprehensive approach to addressing the rising tide of cyber threats, particularly in the wake of increased technological adoption and the global pandemic. Canada’s prominence in academic research and economic development has rendered it a prime target for cyber espionage, including both political and economic espionage. With the rise in technological use and transnational interactions due to Covid-19, Microsoft noted that Canada was targeted with 35% more attacks in 2020 than 2019 and was the third most targeted country for Covid-19 related data.³⁵\nDespite significant international collaboration in identifying state-sponsored hackers, and efforts to bolster cybersecurity, the legal capacity to address cyber threats remains largely in the hands of governments. The collaboration between Canada, the U.S., and the United Kingdom in calling out state-sponsored hackers, such as APT29 (also known as ‘the Dukes’ or ‘Cozy Bear’) for their attempts to steal COVID-19 vaccine research exemplifies the proactive stance taken by\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\nThe increase in cyber espionage against private actors underscores the limited legal tools available to these entities to address such threats. Although violations of the law are prosecuted by the government, and protective measures are disseminated through Canadian agencies, private actors do not legally possess the tools to address these threats.⁴¹ This does not mean, however, that there are no avenues for private actors to pursue threat actors that have attacked them. In fact, in 2020, the CSE, acknowledged the commercial availability of advanced cyber tools, indicating a shift towards empowering the private sector in cyber defence.⁴² However, the lack of specific legislation governing the private sector's involvement in tracking and responding to foreign espionage activities leaves a significant gap in Canada's cybersecurity strategy.⁴³ The concept of Active Cyber Defence (ACD), defined as a non-governmental response to cyber threats that has effects outside the defender's own network,⁴⁴ highlights the emerging debate on how private entities can and should respond to cyber threats.\nCanada's legal framework grants significant authority to government agencies in addressing cyber espionage, but the effectiveness of these measures is limited by international challenges. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has the authority to identify and Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 To understand how Canada’s legal frameworks counter potential foreign threats related to cyber espionage, this paper will analyze three pivotal cases. These cases demonstrate the application of legal mechanisms, particularly in business and immigration law, to prevent entities and individuals associated with or suspected of cyber espionage from conducting business or entering Canada. Each case offers insight into legal methods and considerations applied when addressing cyber espionage to strike a balance between national security interests and individual rights. Case 1 outlines the legal method pursued when businesses pose the threat of conducting or facilitating cyber espionage. Case 2 outlines the legal method and factors that are accounted for when individuals are being considered for entry into Canada in relation to cyber espionage concerns. Case 3 outlines concerns with inadmissibility of foreign actors fearing persecution.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 The applicants, China Mobile Communications Group Co., Ltd., China Mobile International (Canada) Inc., and China Mobile International (UK) Limited, sought to stay an order under the Investment Canada Act, requiring China Mobile to divest its interest in its Canadian business, CMI Canada, due to identified national security risks pertaining to cyber espionage.⁴⁸ The Federal Court denied the applicants’ motion for a stay. The court stated that it had notable concerns about CMI Canada’s potential facilitation of espionage and foreign interference activities by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) based on sufficient evidence provided by the respondents, which included reports from the CSE and CSIS, indicating the PRC’s involvement in cyber threats. Thus, the court concluded that the public interest harms outweighed the potential harm to the applicants. Stated differently, the public harms associated with the PRC’s opportunity to use its indirect control over CMI Canada to facilitate espionage and foreign interference activities in Canada were significantly greater than the harm that the applicants established they would suffer if the stay was not granted.\nCase 2: Geng v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023⁴⁹ Liping Geng challenged the decision of an Immigration Officer to refuse his application for permanent residence under the Family Class, rendering him inadmissible under paragraph 34(1)(f) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The Security Screening Branch/CSIS and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)/National Security Screening Division (NSSD) raised concerns about Geng’s employment at the Luoyang Foreign Languages Institute (LFLI) and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) being linked to espionage activities. Geng had a Canadian wife and daughter, frequently traveled between Canada and China, and maintained that he did not hold a military rank.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 Case 3: Yihdego v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2020⁵⁰ Mr. Abel Nahusenay Yihdego, a citizen of Ethiopia, sought refugee protection in Canada, claiming persecution by his previous employer, the Information Network Security Agency (INSA), due to his refusal to join its decryption department, which was allegedly engaged in espionage. The Immigration Division (ID) found Mr. Yihdego inadmissible to Canada for being associated with an organization believed to engage in espionage against Canada’s interests. The decision by the ID was subjected to judicial review by the Federal Court, where the court rules in favor of Mr. Yihdego, deeming the ID’s decision unreasonable. The court held that the ID erred in considering Charter values in defining “Canada’s interests” and questioned the rationale behind concluding that espionage against a Canadian ally was against Canada’s interests. The judgment allowed Mr. Yihdego’s application for judicial review, sending the matter back to another panel of the ID for reconsideration. The court also proposed a question of general importance related to the inadmissibility of a person to Canada under specific circumstances outlined in the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act*.\nIn these cases, legal mechanisms were instrumental in addressing potential foreign threats by scrutinizing business activities and immigration applications, preventing individuals and entities linked to cyber espionage from operating within Canada.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 The U.S., Canada's largest economic and trading partner, is at the forefront of efforts to address international aspects of cyber security.^[51]^ This stems from its private and public sector being the target of cyber espionage attacks – both political and economic – from various foreign actors. According to General Keith B. Alexander, head of the U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, these cyber\"attacks have resulted in the 'greatest transfer of wealth in history'.\"^[52]^ The U.S. Cyber Command was created to use information and communications technology (ICT) and the internet as weapons to defend the Defense Department.^[53]^ In 2011, their international cyber defense strategy entailed\"all necessary means consistent with International Law used to respond to hostile cyberspace acts\".^[54]^ The U.S.'s approach to cybersecurity was further enhanced by the introduction of the Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act (ACDC Act), a bill proposed by U.S. Congressman Tom Graves. This legislation aims to legalize certain cyber security practices or, at least, clarify their legality. This bill responded to demands for the legalization of more aggressive measures in order to allow victims of cyber intrusions to defend themselves against malicious actors.^[55]^ This less than comprehensive legislation allows individuals who have sought non-legal (i.e. ACD) methods of tracking attackers to not be penalized, and obtain support from government organizations for advancing national security.\nAn example of the complexities in cybersecurity law is the case of Shawn Carpenter, a cybersecurity analyst who used his company's data to trace a\"hack\"server in China and provided the information to the FBI in 2003.^[56]^ Although Carpenter was fired for violating company policies, he successfully sued for wrongful termination and won.^[57]^ This incident Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 Even when the U.S. has identified foreign individuals conducting cyber espionage activities within their national systems, they are unable to prosecute them due to the lack of agreements within extradition treaties. For instance, in 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice publicly charged five Chinese nationals for engaging in corporate espionage against U.S. corporations.^[58]^ Most of the accused were part of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. However, under the terms of the U.S.- Hong Kong Extradition Treaty, China can refuse to extradite a person within its borders if “surrender implicates the defense, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy of the People’s Republic of China,” which renders prosecution of these accused impossible. This is despite the fact that Chinese actors have conducted approximately 39 cyber espionage operations within the U.S. between 2003 and 2013, with an annual estimated loss of $600 billion revenue of the U.S.^[59]^ Legal mechanisms also exist under immigration law to prevent potential foreign threats from enacting businesses or entering the U.S. for the purposes of cyber espionage. The case below underscores the challenges in prosecuting foreign entities for cyber espionage activities, especially when the alleged actions span multiple jurisdictions, highlighting the complex interplay between national security, international law, and the limitations of domestic legal systems in addressing transnational cyber threats.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 In 2017, the appellant, John Doe, using the pseudonym “Kidane,” claimed that he was deceived into downloading a computer program that allowed the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia to spy on him from abroad. Kidane wanted to sue Ethiopia, but foreign states are generally immune from lawsuits unless an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) applies. Kidane invoked the FSIA’s exception for noncommercial torts, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that this exception only applies to torts that occur entirely within the U.S. Since Kidane alleged a transnational tort, the court affirmed the district court’s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The case involved claims under the Wiretap Act and the Maryland common law tort of intrusion upon seclusion, both of which were dismissed by the district court. The court’s decision was based on the premise that the entire tort, including the alleged spying, did not occur solely within the U.S.\nThus, legal principles, such as those outlined in the FSIA, play a crucial role in addressing these concerns. FSIA typically provides foreign states with immunity from lawsuits in domestic courts, except under specific exceptions.\nPart III. Assessment of Law International law, while fruitful in creating an area for non-state entities to combat cyber espionage attacks, remains ineffective in prosecuting foreign entities for domestic attacks within both Canada and the U.S. As seen in Doe, domestic law cannot apply to prosecute foreign governments regardless of evidence of attribution.⁶¹ Within Canada, even while tracing espionage activities to a Russian state-sponsored group, APT29, Canada was unable to achieve prosecution, but rather highlighted cybersecurity measures that Canadian organizations can Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 A comparison of Canadian and the U.S. legal frameworks reveals their distinct approaches to cyber espionage. While the U.S. has actively addressed cybersecurity threats both in the public and private sectors, Canada has yet to implement direct legal avenues. The U.S. has established and implemented legislation like the ACDC Act to legalize certain cybersecurity practices to clarify the measures that targeted private organizations are able to pursue, while Canada has yet to do so. Canada has, however, increased protective measures and actively engaged in providing recommendations to non-state entities to enhance their cybersecurity frameworks. This demonstrates the initiative taken by the U.S. to engage the private sector in responding to threats more aggressively. Canada has not yet initiated the legalization of a non-governmental response to cyber threats, which may result in the overburdening of the criminal justice system in addressing the increased espionage threats to state and non-state actors.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 Thus, both Canada and the U.S. actively address cybersecurity challenges, but there are notable differences in their legal frameworks, responses to private sector involvement, and the use of immigration law as a deterrent against cyber threats.\n## Part IV. Proposition for Legal Frameworks The evaluation of international, Canadian and U.S. legal frameworks suggests recommendations for the improvement of international and Canadian frameworks for the purpose of enhancing Canada's national security. While the U.S. legal framework may have imperfections of its own, that is not covered within the scope of this paper.\n## Recommendations for International Law The issue in international law resides not within the rules that it adopts, but rather in its ability to implement and enforce these principles. Considering this, a unique legal framework for cyber espionage, akin to international human rights or environmental law, could be established for more realistic prosecution measures.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 This recommendation proposes the creation of a multilateral treaty that would allow for the domestic enforcement of anti-cyber espionage laws. The primary objective is to address the challenges in holding individuals accountable for cyber espionage, especially when these activities occur across international borders. The primary challenge includes the reluctance of states to extradite their citizens for cybercrimes committed abroad, largely due to the pervasive nature of state-sponsored cyber espionage. This recommendation acknowledges the complexity of international relations and cyber operations, where national interests often prevent the accountability of individuals involved in cyber espionage.\nDrawing on Harold Koh’s Transnational Legal Process theory, the internalization of international law into domestic law would actualize in three stages: interaction (whereby states, international organizations, legal experts and other stakeholders would begin discussions and negotiations on the creation of a multilateral treaty), interpretation (whereby these entities come together to clarify the obligations, legal enforcement mechanisms and scope of the treaties), and finally internalization (whereby signatory states adopt the treaty’s provisions into their national legal systems and establish mechanisms for prosecution).64 Koh’s theory is utilized to emphasize the importance of integrating international norms into domestic legal systems, and is particularly relevant here because it outlines a process through which international law can be internalized at the domestic level, ensuring that states not only adopt but also enforce these norms within their jurisdictions. The outlined stages underscore the necessity for coordinated international effort to address the gaps in current legal mechanisms concerning cyber espionage.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 This approach also aligns with the growing consensus among legal scholars that traditional methods of international law enforcement are insufficient to tackle the complexities of cybercrime and espionage. Scholars like Asaf Lubin and Russell Buchan have discussed the limitations of current international law in addressing cyber espionage. Lubin has highlighted the challenges in achieving international consensus on extradition for cyber crimes due to the geopolitical implications of state-sponsored activities. Buchan, on the other hand, has argued for the necessity of developing new legal frameworks that can address the unique challenges posed by cyber operations. This recommendation aligns with their views by proposing a multilateral treaty as a viable alternative to the current state of affairs, offering a practical and forward-thinking solution that addresses the gaps identified by these experts.\nThus, this recommendation recognizes the limitations of current legal mechanisms and the necessity for states to collaborate in creating norms and laws that reflect the realities of the digital age. Implementing such a treaty would require a significant diplomatic effort, consensus-building, and the willingness of states to enforce these laws domestically against their citizens. It Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## Recommendation #2. Implementing International Accountability for Non-State Cyber Actors through Organizational Deterrence\nThis recommendation proposes leveraging international organizations, such as the United Nations (UN) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), to enforce accountability on non-state actors involved in cyber violations, a move beyond the traditional state-centric model of international law. This could take effect in the form of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) publicly denouncing states that support or fail to act against non-state cyber actors. The reputational damage from such denunciations can be a powerful deterrent; the UN Security Council (UNSC) passes binding resolutions that impose sanctions on states that are found to harbor or support non-state cyber actors. These sanctions could range from economic penalties to restrictions on participation in international activities; the ICJ could contribute through legal adjudication by issuing advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by the UNGA, UNSC, or other authorized international organs. Such opinions on the legality of states' actions or inactions regarding cyber activities can influence international law and state behavior. States could bring cases against other states they allege are responsible for cyber violations through support or harboring of non-state actors. A judgment against a state in such a case could lead to direct legal consequences for the state and set precedents that deter future violations. Thus, this approach suggests using public denunciation as a tool for deterrence, identifying non-state actors by their associated state, names, and other identifiable information to hold them accountable on the international stage.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\nThis approach acknowledges the complexities and limitations of attributing cyber activities to specific actors but leverages the global community's collective power to enforce norms and maintain cyber peace. It reflects a pragmatic understanding that in the digital age, where state and non-state boundaries blur in cyber operations, traditional methods of accountability may need to be supplemented with broader, more inclusive strategies that can adapt to the dynamic and interconnected nature of global cybersecurity threats.\nHowever, the effectiveness of such measures depends on the willingness of the international community to enforce them uniformly and the ability to adapt these tools to the Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## Recommendations for Canadian Domestic Law\nRecommendation #1. Establishing a National Open-Source Database for Enhanced Cyber Espionage Defence in Canada\nThis recommendation proposes the creation of a national open-source database to list foreign entities known to have targeted Canada through cyber espionage. This initiative would mirror the approach used by Public Safety Canada for terrorist entities, including details such as the reasoning for their listing, dates of listing, and review dates.⁶⁶ The aim is to enable non-governmental entities, including businesses and organizations, to better protect themselves against foreign cyber threats by: avoiding collaboration with listed entities; exercising increased caution when dealing with businesses associated with these entities; and utilizing general Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) for heightened cybersecurity vigilance.\nThis database allows for the addressing of the existing gaps in Canada’s cybersecurity defences by shifting from a reactive to a proactive stance against cyber threats. Currently, non-state actors often lack the necessary information to adequately protect themselves against sophisticated cyber threats. By making detailed information about known cyber threat actors publicly accessible, the database empowers businesses and organizations to take preventive measures, reducing their vulnerability to espionage. This approach not only enhances the overall\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\nDespite challenges such as the adaptability of threat actors, who may change names or methods to evade detection, and the need for regular updates and maintenance, the database represents a shift towards a proactive defence strategy, essential in the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber threats. Publicly listing entities involved in cyber espionage would act as a deterrent, signaling Canada's intolerance of such activities. Additionally, the database would establish a legal basis for prosecuting cyber espionage and disrupt the operations of listed entities by discouraging Canadian businesses from engaging with them, making this approach a robust solution to the challenges posed by cyber espionage.\n## Recommendation #2. Strengthening Cybersecurity Through Legislative Mandates: A Proposal for Enhanced Data Protection in Canada This recommendation urges the adoption of stringent legislative measures in Canada to compel organizations to implement robust cybersecurity practices, particularly those handling sensitive data across sectors such as government, research, and healthcare. Given the provinces' constitutional jurisdiction over property and civil rights as outlined in sections 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, this approach allows legislation to be finely tailored to the specific needs and conditions of each region, addressing local differences effectively, particularly in diverse sectors.\nDrawing on insights from legal experts with a background in cybersecurity, there is a consensus on the necessity for more specific Information Technology (IT) and data protection regulations.[67] Despite the expectation for organizations to maintain high standards of privacy and security, gaps and inconsistencies in their cybersecurity measures are evident, underscoring the Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 This proposal calls for the enactment of provincial laws that mandate organizations to periodically update their cybersecurity protocols to thwart unauthorized access by third parties, potentially jeopardizing their data integrity. This approach is bolstered by the aforementioned examples, which despite substantial investment in data protection, have experienced significant breaches. These instances highlight the pervasive challenge of cybersecurity and the inadequacy of voluntary compliance in safeguarding against data breaches.\nBy instituting specific legal requirements for cybersecurity, the recommendation aims to create a uniform baseline of security measures that all organizations must meet, thereby reducing the likelihood of opportunistic cyberattacks exploiting systemic vulnerabilities. While acknowledging that no legislative measure can entirely eliminate the risk of targeted cyberattacks, the proposed laws are intended to significantly reduce the incidence of such breaches by mandating proactive security measures. In effect, this legal mandate would serve as a deterrent against potential attackers while ensuring that organizations are held accountable for Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## Recommendation #3. Implementing a Structured Active Cyber Defence Framework for Canada: A Strategy for Empowering Private Entities\nThis recommendation advocates for Canada to adopt a legislative approach akin to the U.S.’ ACDC Act, allowing specified private entities to engage in Active Cyber Defense (ACD) activities against cyber threats. The rationale behind this suggestion is to enhance the cybersecurity posture of Canadian organizations by legalizing certain proactive defence measures that enable them to deter, detect, and respond to malicious cyber activities effectively. The emphasis on stricter cybersecurity laws is to mitigate the risks of opportunistic cyber attacks that exploit security vulnerabilities, while also acknowledging that even the most robust security measures may not fully prevent targeted cyber espionage or attacks.\nBy selecting specific private entities for conducting ACD, the recommendation aims to create a controlled environment where such activities are regulated and monitored to prevent abuse or unintended consequences. This approach seeks to strike a balance between empowering organizations to defend themselves and ensuring that such measures do not cross ethical or legal boundaries, potentially causing harm to innocent parties or escalating cyber conflicts. Essential to this approach is the establishment of clear limits and parameters for entities eligible to conduct\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\nAs cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated, relying solely on passive defence measures is no longer sufficient. The ACDC Act in the U.S. has been proposed as a means to empower private entities to defend themselves more aggressively against cyberattacks. This Canadian adaptation would similarly provide organizations with the legal tools to protect their networks proactively, potentially reducing the incidence of successful cyber intrusions. The case of Shawn Carpenter, as discussed earlier, highlights the practical benefits of such an approach. Carpenter, a cybersecurity analyst, used his employer's resources to trace a cyber intrusion back to its source, which led to the identification of hackers working for a foreign government. Despite his success, Carpenter was fired for unauthorized use of company resources, illustrating the need for legal protection for individuals who take proactive measures to defend their organizations. This case highlights how individuals or entities, when given the legal authority and proper oversight, can contribute to national cyber defence efforts without resorting to vigilantism or exceeding their legal rights. Thus, by providing a legal framework for ACD, this recommendation would encourage cybersecurity professionals to engage in necessary defence actions without fear of job loss or legal repercussions, thereby contributing to broader national security efforts.\nIncorporating these guidelines ensures that the empowered entities act within a framework that safeguards against misuse while enabling effective defence against cyber threats. Thus, this recommendation proposes a structured legal mechanism for Canada to enable selected Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 The strength of such a legislation lies in its ability to empower private entities to take a more active role in cybersecurity, filling a critical gap in Canada’s current defence strategy. Challenges such as the risk of escalating cyber conflicts or potential legal and ethical violations must be carefully managed. Concerns about mistaken attribution and the risk of targeting innocent third parties or nation-states, with serious geopolitical consequences, have been raised. Nevertheless, adopting this recommendation provides a structured and regulated approach to active cyber defence, ensuring actions are taken within a legal and ethical framework. By learning from the U.S. experience, Canada can develop a system that aligns with its own legal standards, ultimately strengthening the resilience of its cyber infrastructure. This approach strikes a critical balance between proactive defence and the need for accountability, legality, and proportionality, making it a progressive step in protecting Canada’s digital landscape.\n## Part V. Conclusion In conclusion, the assessment of legal frameworks in both Canada and the U.S. reveals the complexities and challenges associated with combating cyber espionage. While international law lays the foundation for addressing cyber threats, its limitations become apparent when attempting to prosecute foreign entities for domestic attacks, as seen in Doe.71 Both Canada and the U.S. have specific legislation to combat cyber espionage, but avenues for prosecution are Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 34",

    "# Introduction": "Cybercrime in Canada results in more than $3 billion in economic losses each year, which makes it the leading cause of wealth transfer to foreign states.¹ This threat is compounded by cyber espionage seeking to obtain sensitive and financial data, potentially harming civilians, Canadian economic interests, and national security. For instance, China’s espionage efforts to identify potential dissidents, including human rights activists, may expose these individuals to physical danger when they return to their own countries. This danger could manifest in various forms, such as anonymous cyber attacks, as demonstrated by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) conducting espionage against Canadian citizen Omar Said.²\nThis paper examines the legal frameworks in Canada and the United States (U.S.) for addressing cyber espionage, highlighting the current lack of international focus on the issue. It aims to enhance Canada’s capacity to fight and prosecute cyber espionage threats in both public and private sectors, offering recommendations to improve Canada’s legal framework to bolster the country’s defence against these threats. Part I provides an overview of cyber espionage and its significance within cyberspace. Part II examines the legal frameworks in both Canada and the U.S., including relevant case law. Part III assesses the distinctions between Canadian and U.S. cybersecurity laws, focusing on their application to cyber espionage. Finally, Part IV offers recommendations for improving Canada’s legal framework.",
    "# Part I. Cyber Espionage Defined and Explored": "## Cyber Espionage: A Definition\nThere is no universally accepted definition of cyber espionage, a fact that complicates both its legal interpretation and international regulation. The Federal Court of Appeal, in the case of *Qu v Canada* defined it as “surreptitious or covert information gathering”.³ Meanwhile,\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n4\nexperts like Herb Lin, a prominent computer scientist, define it as intentional efforts to infiltrate computer systems or networks to access stored or transitioning information.⁴ Russell Buchan, a Professor of International Law, further refines this by describing it as ‘non-consensual copying of confidential information that is resident in or transiting through cyberspace.’⁵ These varied definitions highlight the fluidity and complexity of the term, distinguishing it from cyberwarfare, which targets disruption rather than mere intelligence gathering.⁶ The lack of consensus on a definition reflects the diverse motivations and actors involved in cyber espionage, ranging from state to non-state actors, and underscores the challenge of creating a unified legal and operational framework to discuss such activities.\n## Purpose and Actors\nCyber espionage serves two primary objectives: political and economic. Political espionage comprises the unauthorized access to military, potential commercial or other secret information, compromising a state’s ability to safeguard itself and its citizens from foreign threats.⁷ Economic espionage entails the illicit acquisition of trade secrets crucial for a nation’s financial success, thus threatening the economic stability of the state.⁸ Each type of espionage carries specific legal consequences, which vary based on whether the espionage was conducted for political or economic reasons.\nThe primary foreign threat actors originate from China and Russia with the primary targets of cyber espionage being the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom.⁹ Many of these target states engage in cyber espionage themselves. For example, the U.S. has faced accusations of conducting cyber espionage in foreign states, as revealed by information disclosed by whistleblower Edward Snowden.¹⁰ This highlights a prevalent lack of accountability that both\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n5\nWestern and non-Western countries aim to maintain. The perpetrators of cyber espionage can be divided between state actors¹¹ and non-state actors, which include private individuals, criminal organizations, and others.¹² This distinction becomes blurred when considering state-sponsored actors, who are non-state entities conducting cyber espionage operations on behalf of their government.¹³\nThe perpetrators of cyber espionage target both the public and private sectors. Currently, there has been a noticeable shift in Canada from cyber espionage targeting the public sector, which benefits from the government’s substantial cybersecurity infrastructure, to espionage aimed at the private sector. This shift underscores the critical need to address threats targeting the private sector.¹⁴ According to a report by New Zealand’s National Cyber Security Centre, financial motivation surpasses state-sponsored activity.¹⁵ Therefore, economic cyber espionage is one of the primary concerns within the cyber arena.\nCanada and the U.S. have established specific legal frameworks to address and penalize cyber espionage activities. In Canada, economic espionage is deemed an indictable offence under section 19 of the Security of Information Act (SOIA).¹⁶ Anyone found guilty of violating subsection 19(1) faces a penalty of imprisonment for up to 10 years.¹⁷ This law applies to cyber-related activities where confidential economic information is illicitly obtained. In the U.S., the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 serves to criminalize economic espionage activities. According to this Act, economic espionage includes actions where an individual intentionally commits an offence that benefits any foreign government, instrumentality, or agent. The Act specifies offences including the unauthorized theft or acquisition of trade secrets through fraudulent means, the unauthorized copying or conveyance of trade secrets, and the unauthorized\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n6\npossession, receipt, or purchase of trade secrets knowing them to have been stolen or obtained without authorization.¹⁸\n## Importance of Addressing Cyber Espionage\nChallenges in attribution and the absence of comprehensive international legal frameworks or extradition treaties significantly undermine the effectiveness of current domestic laws in Canada and the U.S. in combating cyber espionage. These difficulties are compounded by the state-centric nature of international law, which tends to hold foreign states accountable for actions by private entities within their territory. This leads to a significant disconnect in holding the actual perpetrators (defendants) accountable to the victims (appellants) due to the following reasons:\n1) Attribution Errors\nIdentifying the precise origins of cyber espionage activities is notoriously difficult. Cyber attackers often use sophisticated techniques to mask their locations and identities, making it challenging for victim states to accurately attribute cyber attacks to specific actors or states. This ambiguity hinders the ability to levy charges or sanctions against the responsible parties.\n2) Lack of International Legal Agreements or Extradition Treaties\nThe absence of universally accepted international legal agreements or extradition treaties that specifically address cyber espionage exacerbates the problem. Without these agreements, even when attribution is possible, legal mechanisms to pursue or prosecute individuals or entities across borders are limited or non-existent.\n3) State-Centric Model of International Law\nThe prevailing model of international law focuses on the responsibilities and rights of states rather than individuals or non-state actors. When cyber espionage is conducted\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n7\nwithin a state’s jurisdiction, that state is held responsible, creating a situation where the state can deny involvement or blame non-state actors, thus avoiding direct accountability.\n## 4) Perpetuated Lack of Accountability\nThere is an implicit global agreement among states, driven by their own involvement in cyber espionage, to maintain this status quo. This tacit understanding further dilutes the incentive for states to develop stringent international norms or laws against cyber espionage, as doing so could implicate their own activities.\nThese factors collectively lead to a cycle of unaccountability, where states can easily absolve themselves of blame, and victims have limited recourse through domestic or international legal systems. To protect Canadian interests effectively, there is a need for a dual approach that involves strengthening domestic legal frameworks to better protect against cyber espionage and advocating for the development of international norms and agreements that address the unique challenges of cyberspace, including better mechanisms for attribution, accountability, and cross-border cooperation. This comprehensive strategy would not only enhance Canada’s defensive capabilities but also contribute to the global effort to establish a more secure and accountable cyber environment.\n## Part II. Description of Law\n### International Law Framework\nThe “use of force” doctrine dictated by Article 2(4) of the UN Charter states that “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”.¹⁹ However, in the cyber realm, it remains unclear\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n8\nwhen a cyberintrusion amounts to use of force under this Article.²⁰ Cyber espionage alone may not constitute a wrongful act triggering state responsibility under international law. In fact, some scholars would argue that state practice conducting espionage towards foreign states has created a norm that this does not violate state sovereignty.²¹ For instance, the original drafters of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 proposed that “because cyber espionage involves the collection of confidential information and does not therefore produce destructive effects either offline or online, [...] does not qualify as an infringement of the victim state’s territorial sovereignty”.²² However, Russell Buchan argues that acts of political and economic cyber espionage that ‘penetrate computer networks and systems supported by cyber infrastructure situated within the territory of another state [emphasis added] constitute a violation of that state’s territorial sovereignty, irrespective of whether that operation causes damage or harm.’²³ In line with Buchan, suppose an individual walks into your house for the purposes of looking around at midnight while you are unaware, and with your explicit prohibition of any visitors at any time. Would you consider their entry to be a visit or an intrusion into your property? Would that individual have had to cause harm to property or person for you to call the police? The application of force offers limited utility because cyber espionage, considered a breach of international law similar to an intrusion, lacks a coercive element that would provoke a violent response.²⁴\nThere are scenarios where cyber espionage could be considered a violation of international law without requiring the use of force against another state but rather due to the impact that espionage poses on individuals and companies. The principle of non-intervention is considered a part of customary international law as per the International Court of Justice’s ruling in Nicaragua v US 1986,²⁵ in which the court stated:\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\nThe principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference; though examples of trespass against this principle are not infrequent, the Court considers that it is part and parcel of customary international law. A prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones.\nThus, as per Nicaragua, the principle of non-intervention is breached when there is coercive interference with matters falling within a State’s domaine réservé.²⁶ This principle underscores that coercion does not necessarily involve the use of force.²⁷ In fact, a coercive interference is characterized by actions designed to strip a state of its decision-making freedom²⁸ and compel it to act against its will.²⁹ Despite debates around the applicability of this principle to cyber espionage—arguing it falls outside the purview of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) due to the “clean hands doctrine” where states might be equally culpable—the ICJ has clarified it seldom dismisses cases on this basis without substantial justification.³⁰ It did so in Certain Iranian Assets, stating that “the ICJ has never upheld an objection based on the ‘clean hands’ doctrine” and indeed will not do so unless presented with a compelling reason.³¹\nThe ineffectiveness of domestic law in Canada and other signatory states to the International Convention on Cybercrime is evident when applied to foreign actors, primarily due to challenges in attribution and extradition. While Canada commits to criminalizing acts like cyber theft domestically, acknowledging the significant harm data theft poses, these efforts falter when addressing the state-sponsored threats that dominate the cyber espionage arena.³² For instance, within Canada specifically, everyone who fraudulently and without color of right uses a computer service or system “is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.”³³\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n10\nThis convention could be expanded to include cyber espionage due to the harm posed both politically and economically. However, since state-sponsored threats dominate the cyber espionage arena, states are often unwilling to extradite their nationals and reluctant to enforce extradition agreements with one another, which complicates the prosecution of foreign entities. The Cybercrime Convention attempts to address this by suggesting that states should prosecute at the behest of another state if extradition is refused on specific grounds, yet this recommendation highlights a significant gap in international law’s capacity to tackle cross-border cyber crimes.³⁴ This gap underscores the urgent need for a more cohesive international framework to address these challenges.\n## Canadian Cybersecurity Framework\nThe Canadian cybersecurity framework represents a comprehensive approach to addressing the rising tide of cyber threats, particularly in the wake of increased technological adoption and the global pandemic. Canada’s prominence in academic research and economic development has rendered it a prime target for cyber espionage, including both political and economic espionage. With the rise in technological use and transnational interactions due to Covid-19, Microsoft noted that Canada was targeted with 35% more attacks in 2020 than 2019 and was the third most targeted country for Covid-19 related data.³⁵\nDespite significant international collaboration in identifying state-sponsored hackers, and efforts to bolster cybersecurity, the legal capacity to address cyber threats remains largely in the hands of governments. The collaboration between Canada, the U.S., and the United Kingdom in calling out state-sponsored hackers, such as APT29 (also known as ‘the Dukes’ or ‘Cozy Bear’) for their attempts to steal COVID-19 vaccine research exemplifies the proactive stance taken by\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n11\nthese nations.³⁶ Following this, the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security – part of the Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSE) – issued strong recommendations for organizations, specifically health-related ones, to enhance their cyber security and better identify cyber threats.³⁷ They outlined specific Indicators of Compromise (IOC) that organizations should look out for when dealing with such issues.³⁸ While these efforts focus on strengthening defences through cybersecurity frameworks like the ATT&amp;CK Matrix³⁹ and the Cyber Kill Chain,⁴⁰ the emphasis on legal actions against perpetrators remains limited, highlighting the reliance on government intervention.\nThe increase in cyber espionage against private actors underscores the limited legal tools available to these entities to address such threats. Although violations of the law are prosecuted by the government, and protective measures are disseminated through Canadian agencies, private actors do not legally possess the tools to address these threats.⁴¹ This does not mean, however, that there are no avenues for private actors to pursue threat actors that have attacked them. In fact, in 2020, the CSE, acknowledged the commercial availability of advanced cyber tools, indicating a shift towards empowering the private sector in cyber defence.⁴²\nHowever, the lack of specific legislation governing the private sector's involvement in tracking and responding to foreign espionage activities leaves a significant gap in Canada's cybersecurity strategy.⁴³ The concept of Active Cyber Defence (ACD), defined as a non-governmental response to cyber threats that has effects outside the defender's own network,⁴⁴ highlights the emerging debate on how private entities can and should respond to cyber threats.\nCanada's legal framework grants significant authority to government agencies in addressing cyber espionage, but the effectiveness of these measures is limited by international challenges. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has the authority to identify and\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n12\nprosecute cyber espionage under section 12.1 of the CSIS Act, which allows for ‘reasonable and proportionate’ measures to reduce threats to national security.⁴⁵ Additionally, the SOIA under section 19 criminalizes economic espionage, with severe penalties, though its deterrence is limited by the difficulty in prosecuting foreign actors.⁴⁶ There is an implicit delineation between the legal prosecution of political cyber espionage and economic cyber espionage, whereby CSIS deals with the former, focusing on threats to national security, while the Cyber Centre in Canada deals with the latter. While the penalty is significant, its deterrent effect is limited, as the majority of such acts are perpetrated by foreign actors who remain virtually immune from extradition and prosecution due to the complexities of international law. This underscores the challenges discussed earlier regarding the limitations of the current international legal framework in effectively addressing cross-border cyber espionage.\nTo understand how Canada’s legal frameworks counter potential foreign threats related to cyber espionage, this paper will analyze three pivotal cases. These cases demonstrate the application of legal mechanisms, particularly in business and immigration law, to prevent entities and individuals associated with or suspected of cyber espionage from conducting business or entering Canada. Each case offers insight into legal methods and considerations applied when addressing cyber espionage to strike a balance between national security interests and individual rights. Case 1 outlines the legal method pursued when businesses pose the threat of conducting or facilitating cyber espionage. Case 2 outlines the legal method and factors that are accounted for when individuals are being considered for entry into Canada in relation to cyber espionage concerns. Case 3 outlines concerns with inadmissibility of foreign actors fearing persecution.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n13\nCase 1: China Mobile Communications Group Co Ltd v Canada (Attorney General) (2021)⁴⁷\nThe applicants, China Mobile Communications Group Co., Ltd., China Mobile International (Canada) Inc., and China Mobile International (UK) Limited, sought to stay an order under the Investment Canada Act, requiring China Mobile to divest its interest in its Canadian business, CMI Canada, due to identified national security risks pertaining to cyber espionage.⁴⁸ The Federal Court denied the applicants’ motion for a stay. The court stated that it had notable concerns about CMI Canada’s potential facilitation of espionage and foreign interference activities by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) based on sufficient evidence provided by the respondents, which included reports from the CSE and CSIS, indicating the PRC’s involvement in cyber threats. Thus, the court concluded that the public interest harms outweighed the potential harm to the applicants. Stated differently, the public harms associated with the PRC’s opportunity to use its indirect control over CMI Canada to facilitate espionage and foreign interference activities in Canada were significantly greater than the harm that the applicants established they would suffer if the stay was not granted.\nCase 2: Geng v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023⁴⁹\nLiping Geng challenged the decision of an Immigration Officer to refuse his application for permanent residence under the Family Class, rendering him inadmissible under paragraph 34(1)(f) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The Security Screening Branch/CSIS and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)/National Security Screening Division (NSSD) raised concerns about Geng’s employment at the Luoyang Foreign Languages Institute (LFLI) and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) being linked to espionage activities. Geng had a Canadian wife and daughter, frequently traveled between Canada and China, and maintained that he did not hold a military rank.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n14\nThe Federal Court found in favor of Mr. Geng in this immigration case, concluding that the Immigration Officer’s decision to deny admission to the 68-year-old retired language professor was unreasonable and lacked justification, transparency, and intelligibility. The court emphasized the severe consequences of the decision on the applicant, who had been previously admitted to Canada multiple times, including obtaining citizenship.\nCase 3: Yihdego v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2020⁵⁰\nMr. Abel Nahusenay Yihdego, a citizen of Ethiopia, sought refugee protection in Canada, claiming persecution by his previous employer, the Information Network Security Agency (INSA), due to his refusal to join its decryption department, which was allegedly engaged in espionage. The Immigration Division (ID) found Mr. Yihdego inadmissible to Canada for being associated with an organization believed to engage in espionage against Canada’s interests. The decision by the ID was subjected to judicial review by the Federal Court, where the court rules in favor of Mr. Yihdego, deeming the ID’s decision unreasonable. The court held that the ID erred in considering Charter values in defining “Canada’s interests” and questioned the rationale behind concluding that espionage against a Canadian ally was against Canada’s interests. The judgment allowed Mr. Yihdego’s application for judicial review, sending the matter back to another panel of the ID for reconsideration. The court also proposed a question of general importance related to the inadmissibility of a person to Canada under specific circumstances outlined in the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act*.\nIn these cases, legal mechanisms were instrumental in addressing potential foreign threats by scrutinizing business activities and immigration applications, preventing individuals and entities linked to cyber espionage from operating within Canada.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n15",
    "# U.S. Cybersecurity Framework": "The U.S., Canada's largest economic and trading partner, is at the forefront of efforts to address international aspects of cyber security.^^ This stems from its private and public sector being the target of cyber espionage attacks – both political and economic – from various foreign actors. According to General Keith B. Alexander, head of the U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, these cyber \"attacks have resulted in the 'greatest transfer of wealth in history'.\"^^\nThe U.S. Cyber Command was created to use information and communications technology (ICT) and the internet as weapons to defend the Defense Department.^^ In 2011, their international cyber defense strategy entailed \"all necessary means consistent with International Law used to respond to hostile cyberspace acts\".^^ The U.S.'s approach to cybersecurity was further enhanced by the introduction of the Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act (ACDC Act), a bill proposed by U.S. Congressman Tom Graves. This legislation aims to legalize certain cyber security practices or, at least, clarify their legality. This bill responded to demands for the legalization of more aggressive measures in order to allow victims of cyber intrusions to defend themselves against malicious actors.^^ This less than comprehensive legislation allows individuals who have sought non-legal (i.e. ACD) methods of tracking attackers to not be penalized, and obtain support from government organizations for advancing national security.\nAn example of the complexities in cybersecurity law is the case of Shawn Carpenter, a cybersecurity analyst who used his company's data to trace a \"hack\" server in China and provided the information to the FBI in 2003.^^ Although Carpenter was fired for violating company policies, he successfully sued for wrongful termination and won.^^ This incident\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n16\ndemonstrates the double-edged sword that cyberspace creates with uncertainty concerning which laws take precedence over others for the purposes of national security against foreign threats.\nEven when the U.S. has identified foreign individuals conducting cyber espionage activities within their national systems, they are unable to prosecute them due to the lack of agreements within extradition treaties. For instance, in 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice publicly charged five Chinese nationals for engaging in corporate espionage against U.S. corporations.^^ Most of the accused were part of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. However, under the terms of the U.S.- Hong Kong Extradition Treaty,\nChina can refuse to extradite a person within its borders if “surrender implicates the defense, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy of the People’s Republic of China,”\nwhich renders prosecution of these accused impossible. This is despite the fact that Chinese actors have conducted approximately 39 cyber espionage operations within the U.S. between 2003 and 2013, with an annual estimated loss of $600 billion revenue of the U.S.^^\nLegal mechanisms also exist under immigration law to prevent potential foreign threats from enacting businesses or entering the U.S. for the purposes of cyber espionage. The case below underscores the challenges in prosecuting foreign entities for cyber espionage activities, especially when the alleged actions span multiple jurisdictions, highlighting the complex interplay between national security, international law, and the limitations of domestic legal systems in addressing transnational cyber threats.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n17\nCase 1: John DOE, also known as Kidane, Appellant v The FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA, Appellee⁶⁰\nIn 2017, the appellant, John Doe, using the pseudonym “Kidane,” claimed that he was deceived into downloading a computer program that allowed the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia to spy on him from abroad. Kidane wanted to sue Ethiopia, but foreign states are generally immune from lawsuits unless an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) applies. Kidane invoked the FSIA’s exception for noncommercial torts, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that this exception only applies to torts that occur entirely within the U.S. Since Kidane alleged a transnational tort, the court affirmed the district court’s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The case involved claims under the Wiretap Act and the Maryland common law tort of intrusion upon seclusion, both of which were dismissed by the district court. The court’s decision was based on the premise that the entire tort, including the alleged spying, did not occur solely within the U.S.\nThus, legal principles, such as those outlined in the FSIA, play a crucial role in addressing these concerns. FSIA typically provides foreign states with immunity from lawsuits in domestic courts, except under specific exceptions.\nPart III. Assessment of Law\nInternational law, while fruitful in creating an area for non-state entities to combat cyber espionage attacks, remains ineffective in prosecuting foreign entities for domestic attacks within both Canada and the U.S. As seen in Doe, domestic law cannot apply to prosecute foreign governments regardless of evidence of attribution.⁶¹ Within Canada, even while tracing espionage activities to a Russian state-sponsored group, APT29, Canada was unable to achieve prosecution, but rather highlighted cybersecurity measures that Canadian organizations can\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n18\nutilize to protect themselves against such attacks. Further to this point, while both Canada and the U.S. have specific legislation to prosecute violations of cyber espionage, the avenues are prohibited as per international law. For instance, section 19 of the SOIA prohibits economic espionage, while CSIS possesses the authority to identify and prosecute violations of cyber espionage, but neither can adequately protect against foreign actors due to the lack of extradition treaties. On the other hand, despite the U.S. having actively pursued legal actions against foreign individuals engaging in cyber espionage, difficulties in prosecution arise due to extradition treaties, as seen in the example of the U.S.-Hong Kong Extradition Treaty. Thus, states are required to opt for security measures due to lack of extradition treaties governing attribution of cyber espionage due to states' unwillingness to create such treaties as a result of their own involvement in cyber espionage activities.\nA comparison of Canadian and the U.S. legal frameworks reveals their distinct approaches to cyber espionage. While the U.S. has actively addressed cybersecurity threats both in the public and private sectors, Canada has yet to implement direct legal avenues. The U.S. has established and implemented legislation like the ACDC Act to legalize certain cybersecurity practices to clarify the measures that targeted private organizations are able to pursue, while Canada has yet to do so. Canada has, however, increased protective measures and actively engaged in providing recommendations to non-state entities to enhance their cybersecurity frameworks. This demonstrates the initiative taken by the U.S. to engage the private sector in responding to threats more aggressively. Canada has not yet initiated the legalization of a non-governmental response to cyber threats, which may result in the overburdening of the criminal justice system in addressing the increased espionage threats to state and non-state actors.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n19\nHowever, Canadian Immigration Law does mitigate threats of cyber espionage by refusing to permit foreign individuals and/or foreign organizations who may be involved in espionage to continue their activities domestically. This can be seen in *China Mobile* 62 where the organization was divested on the basis of it working under the PRC to conduct cyber espionage operations that threaten national security. These laws, though, are subject to rigorous legal scrutiny as seen in the case of *Yihdego* and *Geng* which ruled in favor of the appellants on the basis that the Immigration Division was unreasonable in their ruling of their association with organizations that operated to conduct cyber espionage.63 Similarly, the U.S. also frequently dismisses individuals under section 212 of the *Immigration and Nationality Act* due to suspicion of espionage, subversion or threat activities to national security.\nThus, both Canada and the U.S. actively address cybersecurity challenges, but there are notable differences in their legal frameworks, responses to private sector involvement, and the use of immigration law as a deterrent against cyber threats.\n## Part IV. Proposition for Legal Frameworks\nThe evaluation of international, Canadian and U.S. legal frameworks suggests recommendations for the improvement of international and Canadian frameworks for the purpose of enhancing Canada's national security. While the U.S. legal framework may have imperfections of its own, that is not covered within the scope of this paper.\n## Recommendations for International Law\nThe issue in international law resides not within the rules that it adopts, but rather in its ability to implement and enforce these principles. Considering this, a unique legal framework for cyber espionage, akin to international human rights or environmental law, could be established for more realistic prosecution measures.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n20\nRecommendation #1. Establishing a Multilateral Treaty for Domestic Enforcement of Anti-Cyber Espionage Laws\nThis recommendation proposes the creation of a multilateral treaty that would allow for the domestic enforcement of anti-cyber espionage laws. The primary objective is to address the challenges in holding individuals accountable for cyber espionage, especially when these activities occur across international borders. The primary challenge includes the reluctance of states to extradite their citizens for cybercrimes committed abroad, largely due to the pervasive nature of state-sponsored cyber espionage. This recommendation acknowledges the complexity of international relations and cyber operations, where national interests often prevent the accountability of individuals involved in cyber espionage.\nDrawing on Harold Koh’s Transnational Legal Process theory, the internalization of international law into domestic law would actualize in three stages: interaction (whereby states, international organizations, legal experts and other stakeholders would begin discussions and negotiations on the creation of a multilateral treaty), interpretation (whereby these entities come together to clarify the obligations, legal enforcement mechanisms and scope of the treaties), and finally internalization (whereby signatory states adopt the treaty’s provisions into their national legal systems and establish mechanisms for prosecution).64 Koh’s theory is utilized to emphasize the importance of integrating international norms into domestic legal systems, and is particularly relevant here because it outlines a process through which international law can be internalized at the domestic level, ensuring that states not only adopt but also enforce these norms within their jurisdictions. The outlined stages underscore the necessity for coordinated international effort to address the gaps in current legal mechanisms concerning cyber espionage.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n21\nAdopting this recommendation allows for the addressing of the limitations of existing extradition treaties, which are often ineffective in the context of cyber espionage. Extradition processes are hindered by political considerations, state sovereignty concerns, and the pervasive involvement of state-sponsored actors in cyber operations. A multilateral treaty that allows for domestic prosecution within the country of origin presents a more feasible and effective solution. This approach aims to enhance accountability while respecting state sovereignty, a balance that is crucial in international law. By incorporating compulsory jurisdictional clauses, such a treaty would provide a legal framework for prosecuting cyber espionage that transcends national borders.\nThis approach also aligns with the growing consensus among legal scholars that traditional methods of international law enforcement are insufficient to tackle the complexities of cybercrime and espionage. Scholars like Asaf Lubin and Russell Buchan have discussed the limitations of current international law in addressing cyber espionage. Lubin has highlighted the challenges in achieving international consensus on extradition for cyber crimes due to the geopolitical implications of state-sponsored activities. Buchan, on the other hand, has argued for the necessity of developing new legal frameworks that can address the unique challenges posed by cyber operations. This recommendation aligns with their views by proposing a multilateral treaty as a viable alternative to the current state of affairs, offering a practical and forward-thinking solution that addresses the gaps identified by these experts.\nThus, this recommendation recognizes the limitations of current legal mechanisms and the necessity for states to collaborate in creating norms and laws that reflect the realities of the digital age. Implementing such a treaty would require a significant diplomatic effort, consensus-building, and the willingness of states to enforce these laws domestically against their citizens. It\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n22\nrepresents a forward-thinking approach to international cybersecurity, emphasizing the importance of legal frameworks in maintaining global digital security and justice.\n## Recommendation #2. Implementing International Accountability for Non-State Cyber Actors through Organizational Deterrence\nThis recommendation proposes leveraging international organizations, such as the United Nations (UN) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), to enforce accountability on non-state actors involved in cyber violations, a move beyond the traditional state-centric model of international law. This could take effect in the form of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) publicly denouncing states that support or fail to act against non-state cyber actors. The reputational damage from such denunciations can be a powerful deterrent; the UN Security Council (UNSC) passes binding resolutions that impose sanctions on states that are found to harbor or support non-state cyber actors. These sanctions could range from economic penalties to restrictions on participation in international activities; the ICJ could contribute through legal adjudication by issuing advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by the UNGA, UNSC, or other authorized international organs. Such opinions on the legality of states' actions or inactions regarding cyber activities can influence international law and state behavior. States could bring cases against other states they allege are responsible for cyber violations through support or harboring of non-state actors. A judgment against a state in such a case could lead to direct legal consequences for the state and set precedents that deter future violations. Thus, this approach suggests using public denunciation as a tool for deterrence, identifying non-state actors by their associated state, names, and other identifiable information to hold them accountable on the international stage.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n23\nThe core of this strategy lies in the use of general deterrence, where the public calling out of these actors would lead to tangible consequences. These could include economic sanctions, arms embargoes, or even expulsion from international bodies against the states harboring or indirectly supporting such actors. The premise is that by imposing reputational damage and potential economic or political penalties, both the perpetrators and their host states would be discouraged from engaging in or condoning cyber violations due to the heightened risks of international condemnation and isolation. These have been proven effective in other contexts. For instance, UN sanctions, when well-implemented, have been used to curb behaviors like nuclear proliferation and terrorism. Although the effectiveness of sanctions and public denunciations can vary, historical evidence shows that they can lead to meaningful consequences, such as economic or political isolation of offending states. For example, the sanctions imposed by the UN on North Korea, including economic sanctions and arms embargoes, have aimed to curtail the country's nuclear ambitions by exerting pressure through international isolation and economic restrictions.65 This demonstrates how similar strategies could be applied to the realm of cyber violations.\nThis approach acknowledges the complexities and limitations of attributing cyber activities to specific actors but leverages the global community's collective power to enforce norms and maintain cyber peace. It reflects a pragmatic understanding that in the digital age, where state and non-state boundaries blur in cyber operations, traditional methods of accountability may need to be supplemented with broader, more inclusive strategies that can adapt to the dynamic and interconnected nature of global cybersecurity threats.\nHowever, the effectiveness of such measures depends on the willingness of the international community to enforce them uniformly and the ability to adapt these tools to the\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n24\ndynamic nature of cyber threats. Sanctions and public denunciations, while potentially powerful, can sometimes be circumvented or rendered ineffective by the resilience of non-state actors or the protective actions of state sponsors. Nevertheless, the proposal represents a significant step towards strengthening global cyber governance and ensuring that non-state cyber actors are held accountable on the international stage.\n## Recommendations for Canadian Domestic Law\nRecommendation #1. Establishing a National Open-Source Database for Enhanced Cyber Espionage Defence in Canada\nThis recommendation proposes the creation of a national open-source database to list foreign entities known to have targeted Canada through cyber espionage. This initiative would mirror the approach used by Public Safety Canada for terrorist entities, including details such as the reasoning for their listing, dates of listing, and review dates.⁶⁶ The aim is to enable non-governmental entities, including businesses and organizations, to better protect themselves against foreign cyber threats by: avoiding collaboration with listed entities; exercising increased caution when dealing with businesses associated with these entities; and utilizing general Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) for heightened cybersecurity vigilance.\nThis database allows for the addressing of the existing gaps in Canada’s cybersecurity defences by shifting from a reactive to a proactive stance against cyber threats. Currently, non-state actors often lack the necessary information to adequately protect themselves against sophisticated cyber threats. By making detailed information about known cyber threat actors publicly accessible, the database empowers businesses and organizations to take preventive measures, reducing their vulnerability to espionage. This approach not only enhances the overall\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n25\ncybersecurity posture of non-state actors but also alleviates the burden on government resources, allowing them to focus on more complex or high-level threats.\nDespite challenges such as the adaptability of threat actors, who may change names or methods to evade detection, and the need for regular updates and maintenance, the database represents a shift towards a proactive defence strategy, essential in the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber threats. Publicly listing entities involved in cyber espionage would act as a deterrent, signaling Canada's intolerance of such activities. Additionally, the database would establish a legal basis for prosecuting cyber espionage and disrupt the operations of listed entities by discouraging Canadian businesses from engaging with them, making this approach a robust solution to the challenges posed by cyber espionage.\n## Recommendation #2. Strengthening Cybersecurity Through Legislative Mandates: A Proposal for Enhanced Data Protection in Canada\nThis recommendation urges the adoption of stringent legislative measures in Canada to compel organizations to implement robust cybersecurity practices, particularly those handling sensitive data across sectors such as government, research, and healthcare. Given the provinces' constitutional jurisdiction over property and civil rights as outlined in sections 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, this approach allows legislation to be finely tailored to the specific needs and conditions of each region, addressing local differences effectively, particularly in diverse sectors.\nDrawing on insights from legal experts with a background in cybersecurity, there is a consensus on the necessity for more specific Information Technology (IT) and data protection regulations. Despite the expectation for organizations to maintain high standards of privacy and security, gaps and inconsistencies in their cybersecurity measures are evident, underscoring the\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n26\nneed for enforceable legal standards.⁶⁸ For instance, the Capital One Data Breach of 2019, which exposed the data of over 100 million Capital One customers in the U.S. and 6 million in Canada, was a direct result of a misconfigured web application firewall.⁶⁹ This incident shows how a hacker could exploit such a vulnerability to access customer data stored on a cloud server. Similarly, the 2019 Desjardins Group Data Leak, affecting 4.2 million members of the Quebec-based credit union, was caused by an insider threat, leaking sensitive information including names, addresses, birthdates, and social insurance numbers.⁷⁰ These examples underscore the critical need for regulations that not only mandate regular security assessments of cloud environments and configurations but also emphasize internal security measures, access controls, and employee training to detect and prevent insider threats.\nThis proposal calls for the enactment of provincial laws that mandate organizations to periodically update their cybersecurity protocols to thwart unauthorized access by third parties, potentially jeopardizing their data integrity. This approach is bolstered by the aforementioned examples, which despite substantial investment in data protection, have experienced significant breaches. These instances highlight the pervasive challenge of cybersecurity and the inadequacy of voluntary compliance in safeguarding against data breaches.\nBy instituting specific legal requirements for cybersecurity, the recommendation aims to create a uniform baseline of security measures that all organizations must meet, thereby reducing the likelihood of opportunistic cyberattacks exploiting systemic vulnerabilities. While acknowledging that no legislative measure can entirely eliminate the risk of targeted cyberattacks, the proposed laws are intended to significantly reduce the incidence of such breaches by mandating proactive security measures. In effect, this legal mandate would serve as a deterrent against potential attackers while ensuring that organizations are held accountable for\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n27\nthe protection of sensitive data, thereby enhancing the overall cybersecurity posture of Canadian entities. Moreover, considering cybersecurity’s overlap with both telecommunications (federal jurisdiction) and property rights (provincial jurisdiction), a coordinated effort between federal and provincial governments is essential to cover all aspects of cybersecurity effectively. This layered approach could mitigate the risk of cyberattacks by ensuring no aspect of cybersecurity is overlooked due to jurisdictional limitations.\n## Recommendation #3. Implementing a Structured Active Cyber Defence Framework for Canada: A Strategy for Empowering Private Entities\nThis recommendation advocates for Canada to adopt a legislative approach akin to the U.S.’ ACDC Act, allowing specified private entities to engage in Active Cyber Defense (ACD) activities against cyber threats. The rationale behind this suggestion is to enhance the cybersecurity posture of Canadian organizations by legalizing certain proactive defence measures that enable them to deter, detect, and respond to malicious cyber activities effectively. The emphasis on stricter cybersecurity laws is to mitigate the risks of opportunistic cyber attacks that exploit security vulnerabilities, while also acknowledging that even the most robust security measures may not fully prevent targeted cyber espionage or attacks.\nBy selecting specific private entities for conducting ACD, the recommendation aims to create a controlled environment where such activities are regulated and monitored to prevent abuse or unintended consequences. This approach seeks to strike a balance between empowering organizations to defend themselves and ensuring that such measures do not cross ethical or legal boundaries, potentially causing harm to innocent parties or escalating cyber conflicts. Essential to this approach is the establishment of clear limits and parameters for entities eligible to conduct\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n28\nACD, including criteria such as cybersecurity maturity, certification and accreditation, purpose and proportionality of actions, oversight and reporting obligations, legal and ethical training, collaboration with law enforcement, liability and accountability, and mechanisms for revocation of authorization if needed.\nAs cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated, relying solely on passive defence measures is no longer sufficient. The ACDC Act in the U.S. has been proposed as a means to empower private entities to defend themselves more aggressively against cyberattacks. This Canadian adaptation would similarly provide organizations with the legal tools to protect their networks proactively, potentially reducing the incidence of successful cyber intrusions. The case of Shawn Carpenter, as discussed earlier, highlights the practical benefits of such an approach. Carpenter, a cybersecurity analyst, used his employer's resources to trace a cyber intrusion back to its source, which led to the identification of hackers working for a foreign government. Despite his success, Carpenter was fired for unauthorized use of company resources, illustrating the need for legal protection for individuals who take proactive measures to defend their organizations. This case highlights how individuals or entities, when given the legal authority and proper oversight, can contribute to national cyber defence efforts without resorting to vigilantism or exceeding their legal rights. Thus, by providing a legal framework for ACD, this recommendation would encourage cybersecurity professionals to engage in necessary defence actions without fear of job loss or legal repercussions, thereby contributing to broader national security efforts.\nIncorporating these guidelines ensures that the empowered entities act within a framework that safeguards against misuse while enabling effective defence against cyber threats. Thus, this recommendation proposes a structured legal mechanism for Canada to enable selected\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n29\nprivate entities to actively participate in cyber defence, drawing inspiration from the U.S. experience to tailor a system that accommodates Canadian legal and ethical standards. This approach aims to enhance the overall resilience of Canada’s cyber infrastructure by incorporating the capabilities and resources of the private sector into the national cyber defence strategy, under a framework that ensures accountability, legality, and proportionality of actions, fostering a more secure digital environment for Canada.\nThe strength of such a legislation lies in its ability to empower private entities to take a more active role in cybersecurity, filling a critical gap in Canada’s current defence strategy. Challenges such as the risk of escalating cyber conflicts or potential legal and ethical violations must be carefully managed. Concerns about mistaken attribution and the risk of targeting innocent third parties or nation-states, with serious geopolitical consequences, have been raised. Nevertheless, adopting this recommendation provides a structured and regulated approach to active cyber defence, ensuring actions are taken within a legal and ethical framework. By learning from the U.S. experience, Canada can develop a system that aligns with its own legal standards, ultimately strengthening the resilience of its cyber infrastructure. This approach strikes a critical balance between proactive defence and the need for accountability, legality, and proportionality, making it a progressive step in protecting Canada’s digital landscape.\n## Part V. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the assessment of legal frameworks in both Canada and the U.S. reveals the complexities and challenges associated with combating cyber espionage. While international law lays the foundation for addressing cyber threats, its limitations become apparent when attempting to prosecute foreign entities for domestic attacks, as seen in Doe.71 Both Canada and the U.S. have specific legislation to combat cyber espionage, but avenues for prosecution are\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n30\noften hampered by international law and extradition challenges. Notably, the U.S. has taken a more proactive approach by implementing the Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act to clarify and legalize certain cybersecurity practices, encouraging private sector involvement in responding to threats. Canada, on the other hand, has yet to implement similar direct legal avenues for non-governmental responses, relying more on protective measures and recommendations for non-state entities. The use of immigration law as a deterrent against cyber threats is a shared approach between both countries, as demonstrated in cases such as China Mobile, Geng, and Yihdego.72 Both Canada and the U.S. actively address cybersecurity challenges through legal mechanisms, though differences exist in their frameworks, responses to private sector involvement, and the utilization of immigration law. Proposing improvements to the legal frameworks, the paper suggests recommendations for both international and Canadian domestic laws. For international law, the creation of a multilateral treaty enforcing anti-cyber espionage laws into domestic law is proposed, providing a higher level of accountability. Additionally, the suggestion to engage international organizations in enforcing accountability upon non-state cyber actors broadens the scope of responsibility mechanisms, enriching the traditional state-centric model without directly contesting it. For Canadian domestic law, recommendations include the creation of a national open-source database to track foreign entities involved in cyber espionage, enhancing non-governmental entities’ ability to protect themselves. Mandating specific laws to ensure organizations implement stricter cybersecurity measures and designating selected private entities to conduct Active Cyber Defence against threat actors would bolster Canada’s cybersecurity defences. Addressing the evolving threat landscape of cyber espionage requires a multifaceted approach involving international collaboration, legal advances, and proactive measures at the national level. Implementing these recommendations can contribute to a more\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n31\nrobust legal framework, better protecting Canada’s national security interests in the face of growing cyber threats.\n1.

Conclusion...29 Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 Cybercrime in Canada results in more than $3 billion in economic losses each year, which makes it the leading cause of wealth transfer to foreign states.¹ This threat is compounded by cyber espionage seeking to obtain sensitive and financial data, potentially harming civilians, Canadian economic interests, and national security. For instance, China’s espionage efforts to identify potential dissidents, including human rights activists, may expose these individuals to physical danger when they return to their own countries. This danger could manifest in various forms, such as anonymous cyber attacks, as demonstrated by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) conducting espionage against Canadian citizen Omar Said.² This paper examines the legal frameworks in Canada and the United States (U.S.) for addressing cyber espionage, highlighting the current lack of international focus on the issue. It aims to enhance Canada’s capacity to fight and prosecute cyber espionage threats in both public and private sectors, offering recommendations to improve Canada’s legal framework to bolster the country’s defence against these threats. Part I provides an overview of cyber espionage and its significance within cyberspace. Part II examines the legal frameworks in both Canada and the U.S., including relevant case law. Part III assesses the distinctions between Canadian and U.S. cybersecurity laws, focusing on their application to cyber espionage. Finally, Part IV offers recommendations for improving Canada’s legal framework.\n# Part I. Cyber Espionage Defined and Explored ## Cyber Espionage: A Definition There is no universally accepted definition of cyber espionage, a fact that complicates both its legal interpretation and international regulation. The Federal Court of Appeal, in the case of *Qu v Canada* defined it as “surreptitious or covert information gathering”.³ Meanwhile, Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## Purpose and Actors\nCyber espionage serves two primary objectives: political and economic. Political espionage comprises the unauthorized access to military, potential commercial or other secret information, compromising a state’s ability to safeguard itself and its citizens from foreign threats.⁷ Economic espionage entails the illicit acquisition of trade secrets crucial for a nation’s financial success, thus threatening the economic stability of the state.⁸ Each type of espionage carries specific legal consequences, which vary based on whether the espionage was conducted for political or economic reasons.\nThe primary foreign threat actors originate from China and Russia with the primary targets of cyber espionage being the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom.⁹ Many of these target states engage in cyber espionage themselves. For example, the U.S. has faced accusations of conducting cyber espionage in foreign states, as revealed by information disclosed by whistleblower Edward Snowden.¹⁰ This highlights a prevalent lack of accountability that both\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\nThe perpetrators of cyber espionage target both the public and private sectors. Currently, there has been a noticeable shift in Canada from cyber espionage targeting the public sector, which benefits from the government’s substantial cybersecurity infrastructure, to espionage aimed at the private sector. This shift underscores the critical need to address threats targeting the private sector.¹⁴ According to a report by New Zealand’s National Cyber Security Centre, financial motivation surpasses state-sponsored activity.¹⁵ Therefore, economic cyber espionage is one of the primary concerns within the cyber arena.\nCanada and the U.S. have established specific legal frameworks to address and penalize cyber espionage activities. In Canada, economic espionage is deemed an indictable offence under section 19 of the Security of Information Act (SOIA).¹⁶ Anyone found guilty of violating subsection 19(1) faces a penalty of imprisonment for up to 10 years.¹⁷ This law applies to cyber-related activities where confidential economic information is illicitly obtained. In the U.S., the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 serves to criminalize economic espionage activities. According to this Act, economic espionage includes actions where an individual intentionally commits an offence that benefits any foreign government, instrumentality, or agent. The Act specifies offences including the unauthorized theft or acquisition of trade secrets through fraudulent means, the unauthorized copying or conveyance of trade secrets, and the unauthorized Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## Importance of Addressing Cyber Espionage\nChallenges in attribution and the absence of comprehensive international legal frameworks or extradition treaties significantly undermine the effectiveness of current domestic laws in Canada and the U.S. in combating cyber espionage. These difficulties are compounded by the state-centric nature of international law, which tends to hold foreign states accountable for actions by private entities within their territory. This leads to a significant disconnect in holding the actual perpetrators (defendants) accountable to the victims (appellants) due to the following reasons:\n\nIdentifying the precise origins of cyber espionage activities is notoriously difficult. Cyber attackers often use sophisticated techniques to mask their locations and identities, making it challenging for victim states to accurately attribute cyber attacks to specific actors or states. This ambiguity hinders the ability to levy charges or sanctions against the responsible parties.\n\nThe absence of universally accepted international legal agreements or extradition treaties that specifically address cyber espionage exacerbates the problem. Without these agreements, even when attribution is possible, legal mechanisms to pursue or prosecute individuals or entities across borders are limited or non-existent.\n\nThe prevailing model of international law focuses on the responsibilities and rights of states rather than individuals or non-state actors. When cyber espionage is conducted Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## 4) Perpetuated Lack of Accountability\nThere is an implicit global agreement among states, driven by their own involvement in cyber espionage, to maintain this status quo. This tacit understanding further dilutes the incentive for states to develop stringent international norms or laws against cyber espionage, as doing so could implicate their own activities.\nThese factors collectively lead to a cycle of unaccountability, where states can easily absolve themselves of blame, and victims have limited recourse through domestic or international legal systems. To protect Canadian interests effectively, there is a need for a dual approach that involves strengthening domestic legal frameworks to better protect against cyber espionage and advocating for the development of international norms and agreements that address the unique challenges of cyberspace, including better mechanisms for attribution, accountability, and cross-border cooperation. This comprehensive strategy would not only enhance Canada’s defensive capabilities but also contribute to the global effort to establish a more secure and accountable cyber environment.\n## Part II. Description of Law\n### International Law Framework\nThe “use of force” doctrine dictated by Article 2(4) of the UN Charter states that “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”.¹⁹ However, in the cyber realm, it remains unclear\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\nThere are scenarios where cyber espionage could be considered a violation of international law without requiring the use of force against another state but rather due to the impact that espionage poses on individuals and companies. The principle of non-intervention is considered a part of customary international law as per the International Court of Justice’s ruling in Nicaragua v US 1986,²⁵ in which the court stated: Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 The principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference; though examples of trespass against this principle are not infrequent, the Court considers that it is part and parcel of customary international law. A prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones.\nThus, as per Nicaragua, the principle of non-intervention is breached when there is coercive interference with matters falling within a State’s domaine réservé.²⁶ This principle underscores that coercion does not necessarily involve the use of force.²⁷ In fact, a coercive interference is characterized by actions designed to strip a state of its decision-making freedom²⁸ and compel it to act against its will.²⁹ Despite debates around the applicability of this principle to cyber espionage—arguing it falls outside the purview of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) due to the “clean hands doctrine” where states might be equally culpable—the ICJ has clarified it seldom dismisses cases on this basis without substantial justification.³⁰ It did so in Certain Iranian Assets, stating that “the ICJ has never upheld an objection based on the ‘clean hands’ doctrine” and indeed will not do so unless presented with a compelling reason.³¹ The ineffectiveness of domestic law in Canada and other signatory states to the International Convention on Cybercrime is evident when applied to foreign actors, primarily due to challenges in attribution and extradition. While Canada commits to criminalizing acts like cyber theft domestically, acknowledging the significant harm data theft poses, these efforts falter when addressing the state-sponsored threats that dominate the cyber espionage arena.³² For instance, within Canada specifically, everyone who fraudulently and without color of right uses a computer service or system “is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.”³³ Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## Canadian Cybersecurity Framework\nThe Canadian cybersecurity framework represents a comprehensive approach to addressing the rising tide of cyber threats, particularly in the wake of increased technological adoption and the global pandemic. Canada’s prominence in academic research and economic development has rendered it a prime target for cyber espionage, including both political and economic espionage. With the rise in technological use and transnational interactions due to Covid-19, Microsoft noted that Canada was targeted with 35% more attacks in 2020 than 2019 and was the third most targeted country for Covid-19 related data.³⁵\nDespite significant international collaboration in identifying state-sponsored hackers, and efforts to bolster cybersecurity, the legal capacity to address cyber threats remains largely in the hands of governments. The collaboration between Canada, the U.S., and the United Kingdom in calling out state-sponsored hackers, such as APT29 (also known as ‘the Dukes’ or ‘Cozy Bear’) for their attempts to steal COVID-19 vaccine research exemplifies the proactive stance taken by\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\nThe increase in cyber espionage against private actors underscores the limited legal tools available to these entities to address such threats. Although violations of the law are prosecuted by the government, and protective measures are disseminated through Canadian agencies, private actors do not legally possess the tools to address these threats.⁴¹ This does not mean, however, that there are no avenues for private actors to pursue threat actors that have attacked them. In fact, in 2020, the CSE, acknowledged the commercial availability of advanced cyber tools, indicating a shift towards empowering the private sector in cyber defence.⁴² However, the lack of specific legislation governing the private sector's involvement in tracking and responding to foreign espionage activities leaves a significant gap in Canada's cybersecurity strategy.⁴³ The concept of Active Cyber Defence (ACD), defined as a non-governmental response to cyber threats that has effects outside the defender's own network,⁴⁴ highlights the emerging debate on how private entities can and should respond to cyber threats.\nCanada's legal framework grants significant authority to government agencies in addressing cyber espionage, but the effectiveness of these measures is limited by international challenges. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has the authority to identify and Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 To understand how Canada’s legal frameworks counter potential foreign threats related to cyber espionage, this paper will analyze three pivotal cases. These cases demonstrate the application of legal mechanisms, particularly in business and immigration law, to prevent entities and individuals associated with or suspected of cyber espionage from conducting business or entering Canada. Each case offers insight into legal methods and considerations applied when addressing cyber espionage to strike a balance between national security interests and individual rights. Case 1 outlines the legal method pursued when businesses pose the threat of conducting or facilitating cyber espionage. Case 2 outlines the legal method and factors that are accounted for when individuals are being considered for entry into Canada in relation to cyber espionage concerns. Case 3 outlines concerns with inadmissibility of foreign actors fearing persecution.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 The applicants, China Mobile Communications Group Co., Ltd., China Mobile International (Canada) Inc., and China Mobile International (UK) Limited, sought to stay an order under the Investment Canada Act, requiring China Mobile to divest its interest in its Canadian business, CMI Canada, due to identified national security risks pertaining to cyber espionage.⁴⁸ The Federal Court denied the applicants’ motion for a stay. The court stated that it had notable concerns about CMI Canada’s potential facilitation of espionage and foreign interference activities by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) based on sufficient evidence provided by the respondents, which included reports from the CSE and CSIS, indicating the PRC’s involvement in cyber threats. Thus, the court concluded that the public interest harms outweighed the potential harm to the applicants. Stated differently, the public harms associated with the PRC’s opportunity to use its indirect control over CMI Canada to facilitate espionage and foreign interference activities in Canada were significantly greater than the harm that the applicants established they would suffer if the stay was not granted.\nCase 2: Geng v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023⁴⁹ Liping Geng challenged the decision of an Immigration Officer to refuse his application for permanent residence under the Family Class, rendering him inadmissible under paragraph 34(1)(f) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The Security Screening Branch/CSIS and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)/National Security Screening Division (NSSD) raised concerns about Geng’s employment at the Luoyang Foreign Languages Institute (LFLI) and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) being linked to espionage activities. Geng had a Canadian wife and daughter, frequently traveled between Canada and China, and maintained that he did not hold a military rank.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 Case 3: Yihdego v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2020⁵⁰ Mr. Abel Nahusenay Yihdego, a citizen of Ethiopia, sought refugee protection in Canada, claiming persecution by his previous employer, the Information Network Security Agency (INSA), due to his refusal to join its decryption department, which was allegedly engaged in espionage. The Immigration Division (ID) found Mr. Yihdego inadmissible to Canada for being associated with an organization believed to engage in espionage against Canada’s interests. The decision by the ID was subjected to judicial review by the Federal Court, where the court rules in favor of Mr. Yihdego, deeming the ID’s decision unreasonable. The court held that the ID erred in considering Charter values in defining “Canada’s interests” and questioned the rationale behind concluding that espionage against a Canadian ally was against Canada’s interests. The judgment allowed Mr. Yihdego’s application for judicial review, sending the matter back to another panel of the ID for reconsideration. The court also proposed a question of general importance related to the inadmissibility of a person to Canada under specific circumstances outlined in the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act*.\nIn these cases, legal mechanisms were instrumental in addressing potential foreign threats by scrutinizing business activities and immigration applications, preventing individuals and entities linked to cyber espionage from operating within Canada.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 The U.S., Canada's largest economic and trading partner, is at the forefront of efforts to address international aspects of cyber security.^[51]^ This stems from its private and public sector being the target of cyber espionage attacks – both political and economic – from various foreign actors. According to General Keith B. Alexander, head of the U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, these cyber\"attacks have resulted in the 'greatest transfer of wealth in history'.\"^[52]^ The U.S. Cyber Command was created to use information and communications technology (ICT) and the internet as weapons to defend the Defense Department.^[53]^ In 2011, their international cyber defense strategy entailed\"all necessary means consistent with International Law used to respond to hostile cyberspace acts\".^[54]^ The U.S.'s approach to cybersecurity was further enhanced by the introduction of the Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act (ACDC Act), a bill proposed by U.S. Congressman Tom Graves. This legislation aims to legalize certain cyber security practices or, at least, clarify their legality. This bill responded to demands for the legalization of more aggressive measures in order to allow victims of cyber intrusions to defend themselves against malicious actors.^[55]^ This less than comprehensive legislation allows individuals who have sought non-legal (i.e. ACD) methods of tracking attackers to not be penalized, and obtain support from government organizations for advancing national security.\nAn example of the complexities in cybersecurity law is the case of Shawn Carpenter, a cybersecurity analyst who used his company's data to trace a\"hack\"server in China and provided the information to the FBI in 2003.^[56]^ Although Carpenter was fired for violating company policies, he successfully sued for wrongful termination and won.^[57]^ This incident Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 Even when the U.S. has identified foreign individuals conducting cyber espionage activities within their national systems, they are unable to prosecute them due to the lack of agreements within extradition treaties. For instance, in 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice publicly charged five Chinese nationals for engaging in corporate espionage against U.S. corporations.^[58]^ Most of the accused were part of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. However, under the terms of the U.S.- Hong Kong Extradition Treaty, China can refuse to extradite a person within its borders if “surrender implicates the defense, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy of the People’s Republic of China,” which renders prosecution of these accused impossible. This is despite the fact that Chinese actors have conducted approximately 39 cyber espionage operations within the U.S. between 2003 and 2013, with an annual estimated loss of $600 billion revenue of the U.S.^[59]^ Legal mechanisms also exist under immigration law to prevent potential foreign threats from enacting businesses or entering the U.S. for the purposes of cyber espionage. The case below underscores the challenges in prosecuting foreign entities for cyber espionage activities, especially when the alleged actions span multiple jurisdictions, highlighting the complex interplay between national security, international law, and the limitations of domestic legal systems in addressing transnational cyber threats.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 In 2017, the appellant, John Doe, using the pseudonym “Kidane,” claimed that he was deceived into downloading a computer program that allowed the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia to spy on him from abroad. Kidane wanted to sue Ethiopia, but foreign states are generally immune from lawsuits unless an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) applies. Kidane invoked the FSIA’s exception for noncommercial torts, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that this exception only applies to torts that occur entirely within the U.S. Since Kidane alleged a transnational tort, the court affirmed the district court’s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The case involved claims under the Wiretap Act and the Maryland common law tort of intrusion upon seclusion, both of which were dismissed by the district court. The court’s decision was based on the premise that the entire tort, including the alleged spying, did not occur solely within the U.S.\nThus, legal principles, such as those outlined in the FSIA, play a crucial role in addressing these concerns. FSIA typically provides foreign states with immunity from lawsuits in domestic courts, except under specific exceptions.\nPart III. Assessment of Law International law, while fruitful in creating an area for non-state entities to combat cyber espionage attacks, remains ineffective in prosecuting foreign entities for domestic attacks within both Canada and the U.S. As seen in Doe, domestic law cannot apply to prosecute foreign governments regardless of evidence of attribution.⁶¹ Within Canada, even while tracing espionage activities to a Russian state-sponsored group, APT29, Canada was unable to achieve prosecution, but rather highlighted cybersecurity measures that Canadian organizations can Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 A comparison of Canadian and the U.S. legal frameworks reveals their distinct approaches to cyber espionage. While the U.S. has actively addressed cybersecurity threats both in the public and private sectors, Canada has yet to implement direct legal avenues. The U.S. has established and implemented legislation like the ACDC Act to legalize certain cybersecurity practices to clarify the measures that targeted private organizations are able to pursue, while Canada has yet to do so. Canada has, however, increased protective measures and actively engaged in providing recommendations to non-state entities to enhance their cybersecurity frameworks. This demonstrates the initiative taken by the U.S. to engage the private sector in responding to threats more aggressively. Canada has not yet initiated the legalization of a non-governmental response to cyber threats, which may result in the overburdening of the criminal justice system in addressing the increased espionage threats to state and non-state actors.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 Thus, both Canada and the U.S. actively address cybersecurity challenges, but there are notable differences in their legal frameworks, responses to private sector involvement, and the use of immigration law as a deterrent against cyber threats.\n## Part IV. Proposition for Legal Frameworks The evaluation of international, Canadian and U.S. legal frameworks suggests recommendations for the improvement of international and Canadian frameworks for the purpose of enhancing Canada's national security. While the U.S. legal framework may have imperfections of its own, that is not covered within the scope of this paper.\n## Recommendations for International Law The issue in international law resides not within the rules that it adopts, but rather in its ability to implement and enforce these principles. Considering this, a unique legal framework for cyber espionage, akin to international human rights or environmental law, could be established for more realistic prosecution measures.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 This recommendation proposes the creation of a multilateral treaty that would allow for the domestic enforcement of anti-cyber espionage laws. The primary objective is to address the challenges in holding individuals accountable for cyber espionage, especially when these activities occur across international borders. The primary challenge includes the reluctance of states to extradite their citizens for cybercrimes committed abroad, largely due to the pervasive nature of state-sponsored cyber espionage. This recommendation acknowledges the complexity of international relations and cyber operations, where national interests often prevent the accountability of individuals involved in cyber espionage.\nDrawing on Harold Koh’s Transnational Legal Process theory, the internalization of international law into domestic law would actualize in three stages: interaction (whereby states, international organizations, legal experts and other stakeholders would begin discussions and negotiations on the creation of a multilateral treaty), interpretation (whereby these entities come together to clarify the obligations, legal enforcement mechanisms and scope of the treaties), and finally internalization (whereby signatory states adopt the treaty’s provisions into their national legal systems and establish mechanisms for prosecution).64 Koh’s theory is utilized to emphasize the importance of integrating international norms into domestic legal systems, and is particularly relevant here because it outlines a process through which international law can be internalized at the domestic level, ensuring that states not only adopt but also enforce these norms within their jurisdictions. The outlined stages underscore the necessity for coordinated international effort to address the gaps in current legal mechanisms concerning cyber espionage.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 This approach also aligns with the growing consensus among legal scholars that traditional methods of international law enforcement are insufficient to tackle the complexities of cybercrime and espionage. Scholars like Asaf Lubin and Russell Buchan have discussed the limitations of current international law in addressing cyber espionage. Lubin has highlighted the challenges in achieving international consensus on extradition for cyber crimes due to the geopolitical implications of state-sponsored activities. Buchan, on the other hand, has argued for the necessity of developing new legal frameworks that can address the unique challenges posed by cyber operations. This recommendation aligns with their views by proposing a multilateral treaty as a viable alternative to the current state of affairs, offering a practical and forward-thinking solution that addresses the gaps identified by these experts.\nThus, this recommendation recognizes the limitations of current legal mechanisms and the necessity for states to collaborate in creating norms and laws that reflect the realities of the digital age. Implementing such a treaty would require a significant diplomatic effort, consensus-building, and the willingness of states to enforce these laws domestically against their citizens. It Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## Recommendation #2. Implementing International Accountability for Non-State Cyber Actors through Organizational Deterrence\nThis recommendation proposes leveraging international organizations, such as the United Nations (UN) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), to enforce accountability on non-state actors involved in cyber violations, a move beyond the traditional state-centric model of international law. This could take effect in the form of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) publicly denouncing states that support or fail to act against non-state cyber actors. The reputational damage from such denunciations can be a powerful deterrent; the UN Security Council (UNSC) passes binding resolutions that impose sanctions on states that are found to harbor or support non-state cyber actors. These sanctions could range from economic penalties to restrictions on participation in international activities; the ICJ could contribute through legal adjudication by issuing advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by the UNGA, UNSC, or other authorized international organs. Such opinions on the legality of states' actions or inactions regarding cyber activities can influence international law and state behavior. States could bring cases against other states they allege are responsible for cyber violations through support or harboring of non-state actors. A judgment against a state in such a case could lead to direct legal consequences for the state and set precedents that deter future violations. Thus, this approach suggests using public denunciation as a tool for deterrence, identifying non-state actors by their associated state, names, and other identifiable information to hold them accountable on the international stage.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\nThis approach acknowledges the complexities and limitations of attributing cyber activities to specific actors but leverages the global community's collective power to enforce norms and maintain cyber peace. It reflects a pragmatic understanding that in the digital age, where state and non-state boundaries blur in cyber operations, traditional methods of accountability may need to be supplemented with broader, more inclusive strategies that can adapt to the dynamic and interconnected nature of global cybersecurity threats.\nHowever, the effectiveness of such measures depends on the willingness of the international community to enforce them uniformly and the ability to adapt these tools to the Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## Recommendations for Canadian Domestic Law\nRecommendation #1. Establishing a National Open-Source Database for Enhanced Cyber Espionage Defence in Canada\nThis recommendation proposes the creation of a national open-source database to list foreign entities known to have targeted Canada through cyber espionage. This initiative would mirror the approach used by Public Safety Canada for terrorist entities, including details such as the reasoning for their listing, dates of listing, and review dates.⁶⁶ The aim is to enable non-governmental entities, including businesses and organizations, to better protect themselves against foreign cyber threats by: avoiding collaboration with listed entities; exercising increased caution when dealing with businesses associated with these entities; and utilizing general Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) for heightened cybersecurity vigilance.\nThis database allows for the addressing of the existing gaps in Canada’s cybersecurity defences by shifting from a reactive to a proactive stance against cyber threats. Currently, non-state actors often lack the necessary information to adequately protect themselves against sophisticated cyber threats. By making detailed information about known cyber threat actors publicly accessible, the database empowers businesses and organizations to take preventive measures, reducing their vulnerability to espionage. This approach not only enhances the overall\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\nDespite challenges such as the adaptability of threat actors, who may change names or methods to evade detection, and the need for regular updates and maintenance, the database represents a shift towards a proactive defence strategy, essential in the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber threats. Publicly listing entities involved in cyber espionage would act as a deterrent, signaling Canada's intolerance of such activities. Additionally, the database would establish a legal basis for prosecuting cyber espionage and disrupt the operations of listed entities by discouraging Canadian businesses from engaging with them, making this approach a robust solution to the challenges posed by cyber espionage.\n## Recommendation #2. Strengthening Cybersecurity Through Legislative Mandates: A Proposal for Enhanced Data Protection in Canada This recommendation urges the adoption of stringent legislative measures in Canada to compel organizations to implement robust cybersecurity practices, particularly those handling sensitive data across sectors such as government, research, and healthcare. Given the provinces' constitutional jurisdiction over property and civil rights as outlined in sections 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, this approach allows legislation to be finely tailored to the specific needs and conditions of each region, addressing local differences effectively, particularly in diverse sectors.\nDrawing on insights from legal experts with a background in cybersecurity, there is a consensus on the necessity for more specific Information Technology (IT) and data protection regulations.[67] Despite the expectation for organizations to maintain high standards of privacy and security, gaps and inconsistencies in their cybersecurity measures are evident, underscoring the Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 This proposal calls for the enactment of provincial laws that mandate organizations to periodically update their cybersecurity protocols to thwart unauthorized access by third parties, potentially jeopardizing their data integrity. This approach is bolstered by the aforementioned examples, which despite substantial investment in data protection, have experienced significant breaches. These instances highlight the pervasive challenge of cybersecurity and the inadequacy of voluntary compliance in safeguarding against data breaches.\nBy instituting specific legal requirements for cybersecurity, the recommendation aims to create a uniform baseline of security measures that all organizations must meet, thereby reducing the likelihood of opportunistic cyberattacks exploiting systemic vulnerabilities. While acknowledging that no legislative measure can entirely eliminate the risk of targeted cyberattacks, the proposed laws are intended to significantly reduce the incidence of such breaches by mandating proactive security measures. In effect, this legal mandate would serve as a deterrent against potential attackers while ensuring that organizations are held accountable for Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## Recommendation #3. Implementing a Structured Active Cyber Defence Framework for Canada: A Strategy for Empowering Private Entities\nThis recommendation advocates for Canada to adopt a legislative approach akin to the U.S.’ ACDC Act, allowing specified private entities to engage in Active Cyber Defense (ACD) activities against cyber threats. The rationale behind this suggestion is to enhance the cybersecurity posture of Canadian organizations by legalizing certain proactive defence measures that enable them to deter, detect, and respond to malicious cyber activities effectively. The emphasis on stricter cybersecurity laws is to mitigate the risks of opportunistic cyber attacks that exploit security vulnerabilities, while also acknowledging that even the most robust security measures may not fully prevent targeted cyber espionage or attacks.\nBy selecting specific private entities for conducting ACD, the recommendation aims to create a controlled environment where such activities are regulated and monitored to prevent abuse or unintended consequences. This approach seeks to strike a balance between empowering organizations to defend themselves and ensuring that such measures do not cross ethical or legal boundaries, potentially causing harm to innocent parties or escalating cyber conflicts. Essential to this approach is the establishment of clear limits and parameters for entities eligible to conduct\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\nAs cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated, relying solely on passive defence measures is no longer sufficient. The ACDC Act in the U.S. has been proposed as a means to empower private entities to defend themselves more aggressively against cyberattacks. This Canadian adaptation would similarly provide organizations with the legal tools to protect their networks proactively, potentially reducing the incidence of successful cyber intrusions. The case of Shawn Carpenter, as discussed earlier, highlights the practical benefits of such an approach. Carpenter, a cybersecurity analyst, used his employer's resources to trace a cyber intrusion back to its source, which led to the identification of hackers working for a foreign government. Despite his success, Carpenter was fired for unauthorized use of company resources, illustrating the need for legal protection for individuals who take proactive measures to defend their organizations. This case highlights how individuals or entities, when given the legal authority and proper oversight, can contribute to national cyber defence efforts without resorting to vigilantism or exceeding their legal rights. Thus, by providing a legal framework for ACD, this recommendation would encourage cybersecurity professionals to engage in necessary defence actions without fear of job loss or legal repercussions, thereby contributing to broader national security efforts.\nIncorporating these guidelines ensures that the empowered entities act within a framework that safeguards against misuse while enabling effective defence against cyber threats. Thus, this recommendation proposes a structured legal mechanism for Canada to enable selected Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 The strength of such a legislation lies in its ability to empower private entities to take a more active role in cybersecurity, filling a critical gap in Canada’s current defence strategy. Challenges such as the risk of escalating cyber conflicts or potential legal and ethical violations must be carefully managed. Concerns about mistaken attribution and the risk of targeting innocent third parties or nation-states, with serious geopolitical consequences, have been raised. Nevertheless, adopting this recommendation provides a structured and regulated approach to active cyber defence, ensuring actions are taken within a legal and ethical framework. By learning from the U.S. experience, Canada can develop a system that aligns with its own legal standards, ultimately strengthening the resilience of its cyber infrastructure. This approach strikes a critical balance between proactive defence and the need for accountability, legality, and proportionality, making it a progressive step in protecting Canada’s digital landscape.\n## Part V. Conclusion In conclusion, the assessment of legal frameworks in both Canada and the U.S. reveals the complexities and challenges associated with combating cyber espionage. While international law lays the foundation for addressing cyber threats, its limitations become apparent when attempting to prosecute foreign entities for domestic attacks, as seen in Doe.71 Both Canada and the U.S. have specific legislation to combat cyber espionage, but avenues for prosecution are Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 34",

Conclusion...29 Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 Cybercrime in Canada results in more than $3 billion in economic losses each year, which makes it the leading cause of wealth transfer to foreign states.¹ This threat is compounded by cyber espionage seeking to obtain sensitive and financial data, potentially harming civilians, Canadian economic interests, and national security. For instance, China’s espionage efforts to identify potential dissidents, including human rights activists, may expose these individuals to physical danger when they return to their own countries. This danger could manifest in various forms, such as anonymous cyber attacks, as demonstrated by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) conducting espionage against Canadian citizen Omar Said.² This paper examines the legal frameworks in Canada and the United States (U.S.) for addressing cyber espionage, highlighting the current lack of international focus on the issue. It aims to enhance Canada’s capacity to fight and prosecute cyber espionage threats in both public and private sectors, offering recommendations to improve Canada’s legal framework to bolster the country’s defence against these threats. Part I provides an overview of cyber espionage and its significance within cyberspace. Part II examines the legal frameworks in both Canada and the U.S., including relevant case law. Part III assesses the distinctions between Canadian and U.S. cybersecurity laws, focusing on their application to cyber espionage. Finally, Part IV offers recommendations for improving Canada’s legal framework.\n# Part I. Cyber Espionage Defined and Explored ## Cyber Espionage: A Definition There is no universally accepted definition of cyber espionage, a fact that complicates both its legal interpretation and international regulation. The Federal Court of Appeal, in the case of *Qu v Canada* defined it as “surreptitious or covert information gathering”.³ Meanwhile, Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## Purpose and Actors\nCyber espionage serves two primary objectives: political and economic. Political espionage comprises the unauthorized access to military, potential commercial or other secret information, compromising a state’s ability to safeguard itself and its citizens from foreign threats.⁷ Economic espionage entails the illicit acquisition of trade secrets crucial for a nation’s financial success, thus threatening the economic stability of the state.⁸ Each type of espionage carries specific legal consequences, which vary based on whether the espionage was conducted for political or economic reasons.\nThe primary foreign threat actors originate from China and Russia with the primary targets of cyber espionage being the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom.⁹ Many of these target states engage in cyber espionage themselves. For example, the U.S. has faced accusations of conducting cyber espionage in foreign states, as revealed by information disclosed by whistleblower Edward Snowden.¹⁰ This highlights a prevalent lack of accountability that both\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\nThe perpetrators of cyber espionage target both the public and private sectors. Currently, there has been a noticeable shift in Canada from cyber espionage targeting the public sector, which benefits from the government’s substantial cybersecurity infrastructure, to espionage aimed at the private sector. This shift underscores the critical need to address threats targeting the private sector.¹⁴ According to a report by New Zealand’s National Cyber Security Centre, financial motivation surpasses state-sponsored activity.¹⁵ Therefore, economic cyber espionage is one of the primary concerns within the cyber arena.\nCanada and the U.S. have established specific legal frameworks to address and penalize cyber espionage activities. In Canada, economic espionage is deemed an indictable offence under section 19 of the Security of Information Act (SOIA).¹⁶ Anyone found guilty of violating subsection 19(1) faces a penalty of imprisonment for up to 10 years.¹⁷ This law applies to cyber-related activities where confidential economic information is illicitly obtained. In the U.S., the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 serves to criminalize economic espionage activities. According to this Act, economic espionage includes actions where an individual intentionally commits an offence that benefits any foreign government, instrumentality, or agent. The Act specifies offences including the unauthorized theft or acquisition of trade secrets through fraudulent means, the unauthorized copying or conveyance of trade secrets, and the unauthorized Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## Importance of Addressing Cyber Espionage\nChallenges in attribution and the absence of comprehensive international legal frameworks or extradition treaties significantly undermine the effectiveness of current domestic laws in Canada and the U.S. in combating cyber espionage. These difficulties are compounded by the state-centric nature of international law, which tends to hold foreign states accountable for actions by private entities within their territory. This leads to a significant disconnect in holding the actual perpetrators (defendants) accountable to the victims (appellants) due to the following reasons:\n\nIdentifying the precise origins of cyber espionage activities is notoriously difficult. Cyber attackers often use sophisticated techniques to mask their locations and identities, making it challenging for victim states to accurately attribute cyber attacks to specific actors or states. This ambiguity hinders the ability to levy charges or sanctions against the responsible parties.\n\nThe absence of universally accepted international legal agreements or extradition treaties that specifically address cyber espionage exacerbates the problem. Without these agreements, even when attribution is possible, legal mechanisms to pursue or prosecute individuals or entities across borders are limited or non-existent.\n\nThe prevailing model of international law focuses on the responsibilities and rights of states rather than individuals or non-state actors. When cyber espionage is conducted Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## 4) Perpetuated Lack of Accountability\nThere is an implicit global agreement among states, driven by their own involvement in cyber espionage, to maintain this status quo. This tacit understanding further dilutes the incentive for states to develop stringent international norms or laws against cyber espionage, as doing so could implicate their own activities.\nThese factors collectively lead to a cycle of unaccountability, where states can easily absolve themselves of blame, and victims have limited recourse through domestic or international legal systems. To protect Canadian interests effectively, there is a need for a dual approach that involves strengthening domestic legal frameworks to better protect against cyber espionage and advocating for the development of international norms and agreements that address the unique challenges of cyberspace, including better mechanisms for attribution, accountability, and cross-border cooperation. This comprehensive strategy would not only enhance Canada’s defensive capabilities but also contribute to the global effort to establish a more secure and accountable cyber environment.\n## Part II. Description of Law\n### International Law Framework\nThe “use of force” doctrine dictated by Article 2(4) of the UN Charter states that “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”.¹⁹ However, in the cyber realm, it remains unclear\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\nThere are scenarios where cyber espionage could be considered a violation of international law without requiring the use of force against another state but rather due to the impact that espionage poses on individuals and companies. The principle of non-intervention is considered a part of customary international law as per the International Court of Justice’s ruling in Nicaragua v US 1986,²⁵ in which the court stated: Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 The principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference; though examples of trespass against this principle are not infrequent, the Court considers that it is part and parcel of customary international law. A prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones.\nThus, as per Nicaragua, the principle of non-intervention is breached when there is coercive interference with matters falling within a State’s domaine réservé.²⁶ This principle underscores that coercion does not necessarily involve the use of force.²⁷ In fact, a coercive interference is characterized by actions designed to strip a state of its decision-making freedom²⁸ and compel it to act against its will.²⁹ Despite debates around the applicability of this principle to cyber espionage—arguing it falls outside the purview of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) due to the “clean hands doctrine” where states might be equally culpable—the ICJ has clarified it seldom dismisses cases on this basis without substantial justification.³⁰ It did so in Certain Iranian Assets, stating that “the ICJ has never upheld an objection based on the ‘clean hands’ doctrine” and indeed will not do so unless presented with a compelling reason.³¹ The ineffectiveness of domestic law in Canada and other signatory states to the International Convention on Cybercrime is evident when applied to foreign actors, primarily due to challenges in attribution and extradition. While Canada commits to criminalizing acts like cyber theft domestically, acknowledging the significant harm data theft poses, these efforts falter when addressing the state-sponsored threats that dominate the cyber espionage arena.³² For instance, within Canada specifically, everyone who fraudulently and without color of right uses a computer service or system “is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.”³³ Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## Canadian Cybersecurity Framework\nThe Canadian cybersecurity framework represents a comprehensive approach to addressing the rising tide of cyber threats, particularly in the wake of increased technological adoption and the global pandemic. Canada’s prominence in academic research and economic development has rendered it a prime target for cyber espionage, including both political and economic espionage. With the rise in technological use and transnational interactions due to Covid-19, Microsoft noted that Canada was targeted with 35% more attacks in 2020 than 2019 and was the third most targeted country for Covid-19 related data.³⁵\nDespite significant international collaboration in identifying state-sponsored hackers, and efforts to bolster cybersecurity, the legal capacity to address cyber threats remains largely in the hands of governments. The collaboration between Canada, the U.S., and the United Kingdom in calling out state-sponsored hackers, such as APT29 (also known as ‘the Dukes’ or ‘Cozy Bear’) for their attempts to steal COVID-19 vaccine research exemplifies the proactive stance taken by\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\nThe increase in cyber espionage against private actors underscores the limited legal tools available to these entities to address such threats. Although violations of the law are prosecuted by the government, and protective measures are disseminated through Canadian agencies, private actors do not legally possess the tools to address these threats.⁴¹ This does not mean, however, that there are no avenues for private actors to pursue threat actors that have attacked them. In fact, in 2020, the CSE, acknowledged the commercial availability of advanced cyber tools, indicating a shift towards empowering the private sector in cyber defence.⁴² However, the lack of specific legislation governing the private sector's involvement in tracking and responding to foreign espionage activities leaves a significant gap in Canada's cybersecurity strategy.⁴³ The concept of Active Cyber Defence (ACD), defined as a non-governmental response to cyber threats that has effects outside the defender's own network,⁴⁴ highlights the emerging debate on how private entities can and should respond to cyber threats.\nCanada's legal framework grants significant authority to government agencies in addressing cyber espionage, but the effectiveness of these measures is limited by international challenges. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has the authority to identify and Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 To understand how Canada’s legal frameworks counter potential foreign threats related to cyber espionage, this paper will analyze three pivotal cases. These cases demonstrate the application of legal mechanisms, particularly in business and immigration law, to prevent entities and individuals associated with or suspected of cyber espionage from conducting business or entering Canada. Each case offers insight into legal methods and considerations applied when addressing cyber espionage to strike a balance between national security interests and individual rights. Case 1 outlines the legal method pursued when businesses pose the threat of conducting or facilitating cyber espionage. Case 2 outlines the legal method and factors that are accounted for when individuals are being considered for entry into Canada in relation to cyber espionage concerns. Case 3 outlines concerns with inadmissibility of foreign actors fearing persecution.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 The applicants, China Mobile Communications Group Co., Ltd., China Mobile International (Canada) Inc., and China Mobile International (UK) Limited, sought to stay an order under the Investment Canada Act, requiring China Mobile to divest its interest in its Canadian business, CMI Canada, due to identified national security risks pertaining to cyber espionage.⁴⁸ The Federal Court denied the applicants’ motion for a stay. The court stated that it had notable concerns about CMI Canada’s potential facilitation of espionage and foreign interference activities by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) based on sufficient evidence provided by the respondents, which included reports from the CSE and CSIS, indicating the PRC’s involvement in cyber threats. Thus, the court concluded that the public interest harms outweighed the potential harm to the applicants. Stated differently, the public harms associated with the PRC’s opportunity to use its indirect control over CMI Canada to facilitate espionage and foreign interference activities in Canada were significantly greater than the harm that the applicants established they would suffer if the stay was not granted.\nCase 2: Geng v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023⁴⁹ Liping Geng challenged the decision of an Immigration Officer to refuse his application for permanent residence under the Family Class, rendering him inadmissible under paragraph 34(1)(f) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The Security Screening Branch/CSIS and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)/National Security Screening Division (NSSD) raised concerns about Geng’s employment at the Luoyang Foreign Languages Institute (LFLI) and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) being linked to espionage activities. Geng had a Canadian wife and daughter, frequently traveled between Canada and China, and maintained that he did not hold a military rank.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 Case 3: Yihdego v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2020⁵⁰ Mr. Abel Nahusenay Yihdego, a citizen of Ethiopia, sought refugee protection in Canada, claiming persecution by his previous employer, the Information Network Security Agency (INSA), due to his refusal to join its decryption department, which was allegedly engaged in espionage. The Immigration Division (ID) found Mr. Yihdego inadmissible to Canada for being associated with an organization believed to engage in espionage against Canada’s interests. The decision by the ID was subjected to judicial review by the Federal Court, where the court rules in favor of Mr. Yihdego, deeming the ID’s decision unreasonable. The court held that the ID erred in considering Charter values in defining “Canada’s interests” and questioned the rationale behind concluding that espionage against a Canadian ally was against Canada’s interests. The judgment allowed Mr. Yihdego’s application for judicial review, sending the matter back to another panel of the ID for reconsideration. The court also proposed a question of general importance related to the inadmissibility of a person to Canada under specific circumstances outlined in the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act*.\nIn these cases, legal mechanisms were instrumental in addressing potential foreign threats by scrutinizing business activities and immigration applications, preventing individuals and entities linked to cyber espionage from operating within Canada.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 The U.S., Canada's largest economic and trading partner, is at the forefront of efforts to address international aspects of cyber security.^[51]^ This stems from its private and public sector being the target of cyber espionage attacks – both political and economic – from various foreign actors. According to General Keith B. Alexander, head of the U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, these cyber\"attacks have resulted in the 'greatest transfer of wealth in history'.\"^[52]^ The U.S. Cyber Command was created to use information and communications technology (ICT) and the internet as weapons to defend the Defense Department.^[53]^ In 2011, their international cyber defense strategy entailed\"all necessary means consistent with International Law used to respond to hostile cyberspace acts\".^[54]^ The U.S.'s approach to cybersecurity was further enhanced by the introduction of the Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act (ACDC Act), a bill proposed by U.S. Congressman Tom Graves. This legislation aims to legalize certain cyber security practices or, at least, clarify their legality. This bill responded to demands for the legalization of more aggressive measures in order to allow victims of cyber intrusions to defend themselves against malicious actors.^[55]^ This less than comprehensive legislation allows individuals who have sought non-legal (i.e. ACD) methods of tracking attackers to not be penalized, and obtain support from government organizations for advancing national security.\nAn example of the complexities in cybersecurity law is the case of Shawn Carpenter, a cybersecurity analyst who used his company's data to trace a\"hack\"server in China and provided the information to the FBI in 2003.^[56]^ Although Carpenter was fired for violating company policies, he successfully sued for wrongful termination and won.^[57]^ This incident Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 Even when the U.S. has identified foreign individuals conducting cyber espionage activities within their national systems, they are unable to prosecute them due to the lack of agreements within extradition treaties. For instance, in 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice publicly charged five Chinese nationals for engaging in corporate espionage against U.S. corporations.^[58]^ Most of the accused were part of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. However, under the terms of the U.S.- Hong Kong Extradition Treaty, China can refuse to extradite a person within its borders if “surrender implicates the defense, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy of the People’s Republic of China,” which renders prosecution of these accused impossible. This is despite the fact that Chinese actors have conducted approximately 39 cyber espionage operations within the U.S. between 2003 and 2013, with an annual estimated loss of $600 billion revenue of the U.S.^[59]^ Legal mechanisms also exist under immigration law to prevent potential foreign threats from enacting businesses or entering the U.S. for the purposes of cyber espionage. The case below underscores the challenges in prosecuting foreign entities for cyber espionage activities, especially when the alleged actions span multiple jurisdictions, highlighting the complex interplay between national security, international law, and the limitations of domestic legal systems in addressing transnational cyber threats.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 In 2017, the appellant, John Doe, using the pseudonym “Kidane,” claimed that he was deceived into downloading a computer program that allowed the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia to spy on him from abroad. Kidane wanted to sue Ethiopia, but foreign states are generally immune from lawsuits unless an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) applies. Kidane invoked the FSIA’s exception for noncommercial torts, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that this exception only applies to torts that occur entirely within the U.S. Since Kidane alleged a transnational tort, the court affirmed the district court’s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The case involved claims under the Wiretap Act and the Maryland common law tort of intrusion upon seclusion, both of which were dismissed by the district court. The court’s decision was based on the premise that the entire tort, including the alleged spying, did not occur solely within the U.S.\nThus, legal principles, such as those outlined in the FSIA, play a crucial role in addressing these concerns. FSIA typically provides foreign states with immunity from lawsuits in domestic courts, except under specific exceptions.\nPart III. Assessment of Law International law, while fruitful in creating an area for non-state entities to combat cyber espionage attacks, remains ineffective in prosecuting foreign entities for domestic attacks within both Canada and the U.S. As seen in Doe, domestic law cannot apply to prosecute foreign governments regardless of evidence of attribution.⁶¹ Within Canada, even while tracing espionage activities to a Russian state-sponsored group, APT29, Canada was unable to achieve prosecution, but rather highlighted cybersecurity measures that Canadian organizations can Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 A comparison of Canadian and the U.S. legal frameworks reveals their distinct approaches to cyber espionage. While the U.S. has actively addressed cybersecurity threats both in the public and private sectors, Canada has yet to implement direct legal avenues. The U.S. has established and implemented legislation like the ACDC Act to legalize certain cybersecurity practices to clarify the measures that targeted private organizations are able to pursue, while Canada has yet to do so. Canada has, however, increased protective measures and actively engaged in providing recommendations to non-state entities to enhance their cybersecurity frameworks. This demonstrates the initiative taken by the U.S. to engage the private sector in responding to threats more aggressively. Canada has not yet initiated the legalization of a non-governmental response to cyber threats, which may result in the overburdening of the criminal justice system in addressing the increased espionage threats to state and non-state actors.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 Thus, both Canada and the U.S. actively address cybersecurity challenges, but there are notable differences in their legal frameworks, responses to private sector involvement, and the use of immigration law as a deterrent against cyber threats.\n## Part IV. Proposition for Legal Frameworks The evaluation of international, Canadian and U.S. legal frameworks suggests recommendations for the improvement of international and Canadian frameworks for the purpose of enhancing Canada's national security. While the U.S. legal framework may have imperfections of its own, that is not covered within the scope of this paper.\n## Recommendations for International Law The issue in international law resides not within the rules that it adopts, but rather in its ability to implement and enforce these principles. Considering this, a unique legal framework for cyber espionage, akin to international human rights or environmental law, could be established for more realistic prosecution measures.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 This recommendation proposes the creation of a multilateral treaty that would allow for the domestic enforcement of anti-cyber espionage laws. The primary objective is to address the challenges in holding individuals accountable for cyber espionage, especially when these activities occur across international borders. The primary challenge includes the reluctance of states to extradite their citizens for cybercrimes committed abroad, largely due to the pervasive nature of state-sponsored cyber espionage. This recommendation acknowledges the complexity of international relations and cyber operations, where national interests often prevent the accountability of individuals involved in cyber espionage.\nDrawing on Harold Koh’s Transnational Legal Process theory, the internalization of international law into domestic law would actualize in three stages: interaction (whereby states, international organizations, legal experts and other stakeholders would begin discussions and negotiations on the creation of a multilateral treaty), interpretation (whereby these entities come together to clarify the obligations, legal enforcement mechanisms and scope of the treaties), and finally internalization (whereby signatory states adopt the treaty’s provisions into their national legal systems and establish mechanisms for prosecution).64 Koh’s theory is utilized to emphasize the importance of integrating international norms into domestic legal systems, and is particularly relevant here because it outlines a process through which international law can be internalized at the domestic level, ensuring that states not only adopt but also enforce these norms within their jurisdictions. The outlined stages underscore the necessity for coordinated international effort to address the gaps in current legal mechanisms concerning cyber espionage.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 This approach also aligns with the growing consensus among legal scholars that traditional methods of international law enforcement are insufficient to tackle the complexities of cybercrime and espionage. Scholars like Asaf Lubin and Russell Buchan have discussed the limitations of current international law in addressing cyber espionage. Lubin has highlighted the challenges in achieving international consensus on extradition for cyber crimes due to the geopolitical implications of state-sponsored activities. Buchan, on the other hand, has argued for the necessity of developing new legal frameworks that can address the unique challenges posed by cyber operations. This recommendation aligns with their views by proposing a multilateral treaty as a viable alternative to the current state of affairs, offering a practical and forward-thinking solution that addresses the gaps identified by these experts.\nThus, this recommendation recognizes the limitations of current legal mechanisms and the necessity for states to collaborate in creating norms and laws that reflect the realities of the digital age. Implementing such a treaty would require a significant diplomatic effort, consensus-building, and the willingness of states to enforce these laws domestically against their citizens. It Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## Recommendation #2. Implementing International Accountability for Non-State Cyber Actors through Organizational Deterrence\nThis recommendation proposes leveraging international organizations, such as the United Nations (UN) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), to enforce accountability on non-state actors involved in cyber violations, a move beyond the traditional state-centric model of international law. This could take effect in the form of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) publicly denouncing states that support or fail to act against non-state cyber actors. The reputational damage from such denunciations can be a powerful deterrent; the UN Security Council (UNSC) passes binding resolutions that impose sanctions on states that are found to harbor or support non-state cyber actors. These sanctions could range from economic penalties to restrictions on participation in international activities; the ICJ could contribute through legal adjudication by issuing advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by the UNGA, UNSC, or other authorized international organs. Such opinions on the legality of states' actions or inactions regarding cyber activities can influence international law and state behavior. States could bring cases against other states they allege are responsible for cyber violations through support or harboring of non-state actors. A judgment against a state in such a case could lead to direct legal consequences for the state and set precedents that deter future violations. Thus, this approach suggests using public denunciation as a tool for deterrence, identifying non-state actors by their associated state, names, and other identifiable information to hold them accountable on the international stage.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\nThis approach acknowledges the complexities and limitations of attributing cyber activities to specific actors but leverages the global community's collective power to enforce norms and maintain cyber peace. It reflects a pragmatic understanding that in the digital age, where state and non-state boundaries blur in cyber operations, traditional methods of accountability may need to be supplemented with broader, more inclusive strategies that can adapt to the dynamic and interconnected nature of global cybersecurity threats.\nHowever, the effectiveness of such measures depends on the willingness of the international community to enforce them uniformly and the ability to adapt these tools to the Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## Recommendations for Canadian Domestic Law\nRecommendation #1. Establishing a National Open-Source Database for Enhanced Cyber Espionage Defence in Canada\nThis recommendation proposes the creation of a national open-source database to list foreign entities known to have targeted Canada through cyber espionage. This initiative would mirror the approach used by Public Safety Canada for terrorist entities, including details such as the reasoning for their listing, dates of listing, and review dates.⁶⁶ The aim is to enable non-governmental entities, including businesses and organizations, to better protect themselves against foreign cyber threats by: avoiding collaboration with listed entities; exercising increased caution when dealing with businesses associated with these entities; and utilizing general Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) for heightened cybersecurity vigilance.\nThis database allows for the addressing of the existing gaps in Canada’s cybersecurity defences by shifting from a reactive to a proactive stance against cyber threats. Currently, non-state actors often lack the necessary information to adequately protect themselves against sophisticated cyber threats. By making detailed information about known cyber threat actors publicly accessible, the database empowers businesses and organizations to take preventive measures, reducing their vulnerability to espionage. This approach not only enhances the overall\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\nDespite challenges such as the adaptability of threat actors, who may change names or methods to evade detection, and the need for regular updates and maintenance, the database represents a shift towards a proactive defence strategy, essential in the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber threats. Publicly listing entities involved in cyber espionage would act as a deterrent, signaling Canada's intolerance of such activities. Additionally, the database would establish a legal basis for prosecuting cyber espionage and disrupt the operations of listed entities by discouraging Canadian businesses from engaging with them, making this approach a robust solution to the challenges posed by cyber espionage.\n## Recommendation #2. Strengthening Cybersecurity Through Legislative Mandates: A Proposal for Enhanced Data Protection in Canada This recommendation urges the adoption of stringent legislative measures in Canada to compel organizations to implement robust cybersecurity practices, particularly those handling sensitive data across sectors such as government, research, and healthcare. Given the provinces' constitutional jurisdiction over property and civil rights as outlined in sections 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, this approach allows legislation to be finely tailored to the specific needs and conditions of each region, addressing local differences effectively, particularly in diverse sectors.\nDrawing on insights from legal experts with a background in cybersecurity, there is a consensus on the necessity for more specific Information Technology (IT) and data protection regulations.[67] Despite the expectation for organizations to maintain high standards of privacy and security, gaps and inconsistencies in their cybersecurity measures are evident, underscoring the Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 This proposal calls for the enactment of provincial laws that mandate organizations to periodically update their cybersecurity protocols to thwart unauthorized access by third parties, potentially jeopardizing their data integrity. This approach is bolstered by the aforementioned examples, which despite substantial investment in data protection, have experienced significant breaches. These instances highlight the pervasive challenge of cybersecurity and the inadequacy of voluntary compliance in safeguarding against data breaches.\nBy instituting specific legal requirements for cybersecurity, the recommendation aims to create a uniform baseline of security measures that all organizations must meet, thereby reducing the likelihood of opportunistic cyberattacks exploiting systemic vulnerabilities. While acknowledging that no legislative measure can entirely eliminate the risk of targeted cyberattacks, the proposed laws are intended to significantly reduce the incidence of such breaches by mandating proactive security measures. In effect, this legal mandate would serve as a deterrent against potential attackers while ensuring that organizations are held accountable for Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## Recommendation #3. Implementing a Structured Active Cyber Defence Framework for Canada: A Strategy for Empowering Private Entities\nThis recommendation advocates for Canada to adopt a legislative approach akin to the U.S.’ ACDC Act, allowing specified private entities to engage in Active Cyber Defense (ACD) activities against cyber threats. The rationale behind this suggestion is to enhance the cybersecurity posture of Canadian organizations by legalizing certain proactive defence measures that enable them to deter, detect, and respond to malicious cyber activities effectively. The emphasis on stricter cybersecurity laws is to mitigate the risks of opportunistic cyber attacks that exploit security vulnerabilities, while also acknowledging that even the most robust security measures may not fully prevent targeted cyber espionage or attacks.\nBy selecting specific private entities for conducting ACD, the recommendation aims to create a controlled environment where such activities are regulated and monitored to prevent abuse or unintended consequences. This approach seeks to strike a balance between empowering organizations to defend themselves and ensuring that such measures do not cross ethical or legal boundaries, potentially causing harm to innocent parties or escalating cyber conflicts. Essential to this approach is the establishment of clear limits and parameters for entities eligible to conduct\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\nAs cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated, relying solely on passive defence measures is no longer sufficient. The ACDC Act in the U.S. has been proposed as a means to empower private entities to defend themselves more aggressively against cyberattacks. This Canadian adaptation would similarly provide organizations with the legal tools to protect their networks proactively, potentially reducing the incidence of successful cyber intrusions. The case of Shawn Carpenter, as discussed earlier, highlights the practical benefits of such an approach. Carpenter, a cybersecurity analyst, used his employer's resources to trace a cyber intrusion back to its source, which led to the identification of hackers working for a foreign government. Despite his success, Carpenter was fired for unauthorized use of company resources, illustrating the need for legal protection for individuals who take proactive measures to defend their organizations. This case highlights how individuals or entities, when given the legal authority and proper oversight, can contribute to national cyber defence efforts without resorting to vigilantism or exceeding their legal rights. Thus, by providing a legal framework for ACD, this recommendation would encourage cybersecurity professionals to engage in necessary defence actions without fear of job loss or legal repercussions, thereby contributing to broader national security efforts.\nIncorporating these guidelines ensures that the empowered entities act within a framework that safeguards against misuse while enabling effective defence against cyber threats. Thus, this recommendation proposes a structured legal mechanism for Canada to enable selected Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 The strength of such a legislation lies in its ability to empower private entities to take a more active role in cybersecurity, filling a critical gap in Canada’s current defence strategy. Challenges such as the risk of escalating cyber conflicts or potential legal and ethical violations must be carefully managed. Concerns about mistaken attribution and the risk of targeting innocent third parties or nation-states, with serious geopolitical consequences, have been raised. Nevertheless, adopting this recommendation provides a structured and regulated approach to active cyber defence, ensuring actions are taken within a legal and ethical framework. By learning from the U.S. experience, Canada can develop a system that aligns with its own legal standards, ultimately strengthening the resilience of its cyber infrastructure. This approach strikes a critical balance between proactive defence and the need for accountability, legality, and proportionality, making it a progressive step in protecting Canada’s digital landscape.\n## Part V. Conclusion In conclusion, the assessment of legal frameworks in both Canada and the U.S. reveals the complexities and challenges associated with combating cyber espionage. While international law lays the foundation for addressing cyber threats, its limitations become apparent when attempting to prosecute foreign entities for domestic attacks, as seen in Doe.71 Both Canada and the U.S. have specific legislation to combat cyber espionage, but avenues for prosecution are Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 34"

For instance, China’s espionage efforts to identify potential dissidents, including human rights activists, may expose these individuals to physical danger when they return to their own countries. This danger could manifest in various forms, such as anonymous cyber attacks, as demonstrated by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) conducting espionage against Canadian citizen Omar Said.²\nThis paper examines the legal frameworks in Canada and the United States (U.S.) for addressing cyber espionage, highlighting the current lack of international focus on the issue. It aims to enhance Canada’s capacity to fight and prosecute cyber espionage threats in both public and private sectors, offering recommendations to improve Canada’s legal framework to bolster the country’s defence against these threats. Part I provides an overview of cyber espionage and its significance within cyberspace. Part II examines the legal frameworks in both Canada and the U.S., including relevant case law. Part III assesses the distinctions between Canadian and U.S. cybersecurity laws, focusing on their application to cyber espionage. Finally, Part IV offers recommendations for improving Canada’s legal framework.\n# Part I. Cyber Espionage Defined and Explored\n## Cyber Espionage: A Definition\nThere is no universally accepted definition of cyber espionage, a fact that complicates both its legal interpretation and international regulation. The Federal Court of Appeal, in the case of *Qu v Canada* defined it as “surreptitious or covert information gathering”.³ Meanwhile,\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n4\nexperts like Herb Lin, a prominent computer scientist, define it as intentional efforts to infiltrate computer systems or networks to access stored or transitioning information.⁴ Russell Buchan, a Professor of International Law, further refines this by describing it as ‘non-consensual copying of confidential information that is resident in or transiting through cyberspace.’⁵ These varied definitions highlight the fluidity and complexity of the term, distinguishing it from cyberwarfare, which targets disruption rather than mere intelligence gathering.⁶ The lack of consensus on a definition reflects the diverse motivations and actors involved in cyber espionage, ranging from state to non-state actors, and underscores the challenge of creating a unified legal and operational framework to discuss such activities.\n## Purpose and Actors\nCyber espionage serves two primary objectives: political and economic. Political espionage comprises the unauthorized access to military, potential commercial or other secret information, compromising a state’s ability to safeguard itself and its citizens from foreign threats.⁷ Economic espionage entails the illicit acquisition of trade secrets crucial for a nation’s financial success, thus threatening the economic stability of the state.⁸ Each type of espionage carries specific legal consequences, which vary based on whether the espionage was conducted for political or economic reasons.\nThe primary foreign threat actors originate from China and Russia with the primary targets of cyber espionage being the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom.⁹ Many of these target states engage in cyber espionage themselves. For example, the U.S. has faced accusations of conducting cyber espionage in foreign states, as revealed by information disclosed by whistleblower Edward Snowden.¹⁰ This highlights a prevalent lack of accountability that both\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n5\nWestern and non-Western countries aim to maintain. The perpetrators of cyber espionage can be divided between state actors¹¹ and non-state actors, which include private individuals, criminal organizations, and others.¹² This distinction becomes blurred when considering state-sponsored actors, who are non-state entities conducting cyber espionage operations on behalf of their government.¹³\nThe perpetrators of cyber espionage target both the public and private sectors. Currently, there has been a noticeable shift in Canada from cyber espionage targeting the public sector, which benefits from the government’s substantial cybersecurity infrastructure, to espionage aimed at the private sector. This shift underscores the critical need to address threats targeting the private sector.¹⁴ According to a report by New Zealand’s National Cyber Security Centre, financial motivation surpasses state-sponsored activity.¹⁵ Therefore, economic cyber espionage is one of the primary concerns within the cyber arena.\nCanada and the U.S. have established specific legal frameworks to address and penalize cyber espionage activities. In Canada, economic espionage is deemed an indictable offence under section 19 of the Security of Information Act (SOIA).¹⁶ Anyone found guilty of violating subsection 19(1) faces a penalty of imprisonment for up to 10 years.¹⁷ This law applies to cyber-related activities where confidential economic information is illicitly obtained. In the U.S., the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 serves to criminalize economic espionage activities. According to this Act, economic espionage includes actions where an individual intentionally commits an offence that benefits any foreign government, instrumentality, or agent. The Act specifies offences including the unauthorized theft or acquisition of trade secrets through fraudulent means, the unauthorized copying or conveyance of trade secrets, and the unauthorized\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n6\npossession, receipt, or purchase of trade secrets knowing them to have been stolen or obtained without authorization.¹⁸\n## Importance of Addressing Cyber Espionage\nChallenges in attribution and the absence of comprehensive international legal frameworks or extradition treaties significantly undermine the effectiveness of current domestic laws in Canada and the U.S. in combating cyber espionage. These difficulties are compounded by the state-centric nature of international law, which tends to hold foreign states accountable for actions by private entities within their territory. This leads to a significant disconnect in holding the actual perpetrators (defendants) accountable to the victims (appellants) due to the following reasons:\n1) Attribution Errors\nIdentifying the precise origins of cyber espionage activities is notoriously difficult. Cyber attackers often use sophisticated techniques to mask their locations and identities, making it challenging for victim states to accurately attribute cyber attacks to specific actors or states. This ambiguity hinders the ability to levy charges or sanctions against the responsible parties.\n2) Lack of International Legal Agreements or Extradition Treaties\nThe absence of universally accepted international legal agreements or extradition treaties that specifically address cyber espionage exacerbates the problem. Without these agreements, even when attribution is possible, legal mechanisms to pursue or prosecute individuals or entities across borders are limited or non-existent.\n3) State-Centric Model of International Law\nThe prevailing model of international law focuses on the responsibilities and rights of states rather than individuals or non-state actors. When cyber espionage is conducted\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n7\nwithin a state’s jurisdiction, that state is held responsible, creating a situation where the state can deny involvement or blame non-state actors, thus avoiding direct accountability.\n## 4) Perpetuated Lack of Accountability\nThere is an implicit global agreement among states, driven by their own involvement in cyber espionage, to maintain this status quo. This tacit understanding further dilutes the incentive for states to develop stringent international norms or laws against cyber espionage, as doing so could implicate their own activities.\nThese factors collectively lead to a cycle of unaccountability, where states can easily absolve themselves of blame, and victims have limited recourse through domestic or international legal systems. To protect Canadian interests effectively, there is a need for a dual approach that involves strengthening domestic legal frameworks to better protect against cyber espionage and advocating for the development of international norms and agreements that address the unique challenges of cyberspace, including better mechanisms for attribution, accountability, and cross-border cooperation. This comprehensive strategy would not only enhance Canada’s defensive capabilities but also contribute to the global effort to establish a more secure and accountable cyber environment.\n## Part II. Description of Law\n### International Law Framework\nThe “use of force” doctrine dictated by Article 2(4) of the UN Charter states that “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”.¹⁹ However, in the cyber realm, it remains unclear\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n8\nwhen a cyberintrusion amounts to use of force under this Article.²⁰ Cyber espionage alone may not constitute a wrongful act triggering state responsibility under international law. In fact, some scholars would argue that state practice conducting espionage towards foreign states has created a norm that this does not violate state sovereignty.²¹ For instance, the original drafters of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 proposed that “because cyber espionage involves the collection of confidential information and does not therefore produce destructive effects either offline or online, [...] does not qualify as an infringement of the victim state’s territorial sovereignty”.²² However, Russell Buchan argues that acts of political and economic cyber espionage that ‘penetrate computer networks and systems supported by cyber infrastructure situated within the territory of another state [emphasis added] constitute a violation of that state’s territorial sovereignty, irrespective of whether that operation causes damage or harm.’²³ In line with Buchan, suppose an individual walks into your house for the purposes of looking around at midnight while you are unaware, and with your explicit prohibition of any visitors at any time. Would you consider their entry to be a visit or an intrusion into your property? Would that individual have had to cause harm to property or person for you to call the police? The application of force offers limited utility because cyber espionage, considered a breach of international law similar to an intrusion, lacks a coercive element that would provoke a violent response.²⁴\nThere are scenarios where cyber espionage could be considered a violation of international law without requiring the use of force against another state but rather due to the impact that espionage poses on individuals and companies. The principle of non-intervention is considered a part of customary international law as per the International Court of Justice’s ruling in Nicaragua v US 1986,²⁵ in which the court stated:\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\nThe principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference; though examples of trespass against this principle are not infrequent, the Court considers that it is part and parcel of customary international law. A prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones.\nThus, as per Nicaragua, the principle of non-intervention is breached when there is coercive interference with matters falling within a State’s domaine réservé.²⁶ This principle underscores that coercion does not necessarily involve the use of force.²⁷ In fact, a coercive interference is characterized by actions designed to strip a state of its decision-making freedom²⁸ and compel it to act against its will.²⁹ Despite debates around the applicability of this principle to cyber espionage—arguing it falls outside the purview of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) due to the “clean hands doctrine” where states might be equally culpable—the ICJ has clarified it seldom dismisses cases on this basis without substantial justification.³⁰ It did so in Certain Iranian Assets, stating that “the ICJ has never upheld an objection based on the ‘clean hands’ doctrine” and indeed will not do so unless presented with a compelling reason.³¹\nThe ineffectiveness of domestic law in Canada and other signatory states to the International Convention on Cybercrime is evident when applied to foreign actors, primarily due to challenges in attribution and extradition. While Canada commits to criminalizing acts like cyber theft domestically, acknowledging the significant harm data theft poses, these efforts falter when addressing the state-sponsored threats that dominate the cyber espionage arena.³² For instance, within Canada specifically, everyone who fraudulently and without color of right uses a computer service or system “is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.”³³\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n10\nThis convention could be expanded to include cyber espionage due to the harm posed both politically and economically. However, since state-sponsored threats dominate the cyber espionage arena, states are often unwilling to extradite their nationals and reluctant to enforce extradition agreements with one another, which complicates the prosecution of foreign entities. The Cybercrime Convention attempts to address this by suggesting that states should prosecute at the behest of another state if extradition is refused on specific grounds, yet this recommendation highlights a significant gap in international law’s capacity to tackle cross-border cyber crimes.³⁴ This gap underscores the urgent need for a more cohesive international framework to address these challenges.\n## Canadian Cybersecurity Framework\nThe Canadian cybersecurity framework represents a comprehensive approach to addressing the rising tide of cyber threats, particularly in the wake of increased technological adoption and the global pandemic. Canada’s prominence in academic research and economic development has rendered it a prime target for cyber espionage, including both political and economic espionage. With the rise in technological use and transnational interactions due to Covid-19, Microsoft noted that Canada was targeted with 35% more attacks in 2020 than 2019 and was the third most targeted country for Covid-19 related data.³⁵\nDespite significant international collaboration in identifying state-sponsored hackers, and efforts to bolster cybersecurity, the legal capacity to address cyber threats remains largely in the hands of governments. The collaboration between Canada, the U.S., and the United Kingdom in calling out state-sponsored hackers, such as APT29 (also known as ‘the Dukes’ or ‘Cozy Bear’) for their attempts to steal COVID-19 vaccine research exemplifies the proactive stance taken by\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n11\nthese nations.³⁶ Following this, the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security – part of the Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSE) – issued strong recommendations for organizations, specifically health-related ones, to enhance their cyber security and better identify cyber threats.³⁷ They outlined specific Indicators of Compromise (IOC) that organizations should look out for when dealing with such issues.³⁸ While these efforts focus on strengthening defences through cybersecurity frameworks like the ATT&amp;CK Matrix³⁹ and the Cyber Kill Chain,⁴⁰ the emphasis on legal actions against perpetrators remains limited, highlighting the reliance on government intervention.\nThe increase in cyber espionage against private actors underscores the limited legal tools available to these entities to address such threats. Although violations of the law are prosecuted by the government, and protective measures are disseminated through Canadian agencies, private actors do not legally possess the tools to address these threats.⁴¹ This does not mean, however, that there are no avenues for private actors to pursue threat actors that have attacked them. In fact, in 2020, the CSE, acknowledged the commercial availability of advanced cyber tools, indicating a shift towards empowering the private sector in cyber defence.⁴²\nHowever, the lack of specific legislation governing the private sector's involvement in tracking and responding to foreign espionage activities leaves a significant gap in Canada's cybersecurity strategy.⁴³ The concept of Active Cyber Defence (ACD), defined as a non-governmental response to cyber threats that has effects outside the defender's own network,⁴⁴ highlights the emerging debate on how private entities can and should respond to cyber threats.\nCanada's legal framework grants significant authority to government agencies in addressing cyber espionage, but the effectiveness of these measures is limited by international challenges. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has the authority to identify and\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n12\nprosecute cyber espionage under section 12.1 of the CSIS Act, which allows for ‘reasonable and proportionate’ measures to reduce threats to national security.⁴⁵ Additionally, the SOIA under section 19 criminalizes economic espionage, with severe penalties, though its deterrence is limited by the difficulty in prosecuting foreign actors.⁴⁶ There is an implicit delineation between the legal prosecution of political cyber espionage and economic cyber espionage, whereby CSIS deals with the former, focusing on threats to national security, while the Cyber Centre in Canada deals with the latter. While the penalty is significant, its deterrent effect is limited, as the majority of such acts are perpetrated by foreign actors who remain virtually immune from extradition and prosecution due to the complexities of international law. This underscores the challenges discussed earlier regarding the limitations of the current international legal framework in effectively addressing cross-border cyber espionage.\nTo understand how Canada’s legal frameworks counter potential foreign threats related to cyber espionage, this paper will analyze three pivotal cases. These cases demonstrate the application of legal mechanisms, particularly in business and immigration law, to prevent entities and individuals associated with or suspected of cyber espionage from conducting business or entering Canada. Each case offers insight into legal methods and considerations applied when addressing cyber espionage to strike a balance between national security interests and individual rights. Case 1 outlines the legal method pursued when businesses pose the threat of conducting or facilitating cyber espionage. Case 2 outlines the legal method and factors that are accounted for when individuals are being considered for entry into Canada in relation to cyber espionage concerns. Case 3 outlines concerns with inadmissibility of foreign actors fearing persecution.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n13\nCase 1: China Mobile Communications Group Co Ltd v Canada (Attorney General) (2021)⁴⁷\nThe applicants, China Mobile Communications Group Co., Ltd., China Mobile International (Canada) Inc., and China Mobile International (UK) Limited, sought to stay an order under the Investment Canada Act, requiring China Mobile to divest its interest in its Canadian business, CMI Canada, due to identified national security risks pertaining to cyber espionage.⁴⁸ The Federal Court denied the applicants’ motion for a stay. The court stated that it had notable concerns about CMI Canada’s potential facilitation of espionage and foreign interference activities by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) based on sufficient evidence provided by the respondents, which included reports from the CSE and CSIS, indicating the PRC’s involvement in cyber threats. Thus, the court concluded that the public interest harms outweighed the potential harm to the applicants. Stated differently, the public harms associated with the PRC’s opportunity to use its indirect control over CMI Canada to facilitate espionage and foreign interference activities in Canada were significantly greater than the harm that the applicants established they would suffer if the stay was not granted.\nCase 2: Geng v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023⁴⁹\nLiping Geng challenged the decision of an Immigration Officer to refuse his application for permanent residence under the Family Class, rendering him inadmissible under paragraph 34(1)(f) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The Security Screening Branch/CSIS and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)/National Security Screening Division (NSSD) raised concerns about Geng’s employment at the Luoyang Foreign Languages Institute (LFLI) and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) being linked to espionage activities. Geng had a Canadian wife and daughter, frequently traveled between Canada and China, and maintained that he did not hold a military rank.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n14\nThe Federal Court found in favor of Mr. Geng in this immigration case, concluding that the Immigration Officer’s decision to deny admission to the 68-year-old retired language professor was unreasonable and lacked justification, transparency, and intelligibility. The court emphasized the severe consequences of the decision on the applicant, who had been previously admitted to Canada multiple times, including obtaining citizenship.\nCase 3: Yihdego v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2020⁵⁰\nMr. Abel Nahusenay Yihdego, a citizen of Ethiopia, sought refugee protection in Canada, claiming persecution by his previous employer, the Information Network Security Agency (INSA), due to his refusal to join its decryption department, which was allegedly engaged in espionage. The Immigration Division (ID) found Mr. Yihdego inadmissible to Canada for being associated with an organization believed to engage in espionage against Canada’s interests. The decision by the ID was subjected to judicial review by the Federal Court, where the court rules in favor of Mr. Yihdego, deeming the ID’s decision unreasonable. The court held that the ID erred in considering Charter values in defining “Canada’s interests” and questioned the rationale behind concluding that espionage against a Canadian ally was against Canada’s interests. The judgment allowed Mr. Yihdego’s application for judicial review, sending the matter back to another panel of the ID for reconsideration. The court also proposed a question of general importance related to the inadmissibility of a person to Canada under specific circumstances outlined in the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act*.\nIn these cases, legal mechanisms were instrumental in addressing potential foreign threats by scrutinizing business activities and immigration applications, preventing individuals and entities linked to cyber espionage from operating within Canada.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n15\n# U.S. Cybersecurity Framework\nThe U.S., Canada's largest economic and trading partner, is at the forefront of efforts to address international aspects of cyber security.^^ This stems from its private and public sector being the target of cyber espionage attacks – both political and economic – from various foreign actors. According to General Keith B. Alexander, head of the U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, these cyber \"attacks have resulted in the 'greatest transfer of wealth in history'.\"^^\nThe U.S. Cyber Command was created to use information and communications technology (ICT) and the internet as weapons to defend the Defense Department.^^ In 2011, their international cyber defense strategy entailed \"all necessary means consistent with International Law used to respond to hostile cyberspace acts\".^^ The U.S.'s approach to cybersecurity was further enhanced by the introduction of the Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act (ACDC Act), a bill proposed by U.S. Congressman Tom Graves. This legislation aims to legalize certain cyber security practices or, at least, clarify their legality. This bill responded to demands for the legalization of more aggressive measures in order to allow victims of cyber intrusions to defend themselves against malicious actors.^^ This less than comprehensive legislation allows individuals who have sought non-legal (i.e. ACD) methods of tracking attackers to not be penalized, and obtain support from government organizations for advancing national security.\nAn example of the complexities in cybersecurity law is the case of Shawn Carpenter, a cybersecurity analyst who used his company's data to trace a \"hack\" server in China and provided the information to the FBI in 2003.^^ Although Carpenter was fired for violating company policies, he successfully sued for wrongful termination and won.^^ This incident\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n16\ndemonstrates the double-edged sword that cyberspace creates with uncertainty concerning which laws take precedence over others for the purposes of national security against foreign threats.\nEven when the U.S. has identified foreign individuals conducting cyber espionage activities within their national systems, they are unable to prosecute them due to the lack of agreements within extradition treaties. For instance, in 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice publicly charged five Chinese nationals for engaging in corporate espionage against U.S. corporations.^^ Most of the accused were part of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. However, under the terms of the U.S.- Hong Kong Extradition Treaty,\nChina can refuse to extradite a person within its borders if “surrender implicates the defense, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy of the People’s Republic of China,”\nwhich renders prosecution of these accused impossible. This is despite the fact that Chinese actors have conducted approximately 39 cyber espionage operations within the U.S. between 2003 and 2013, with an annual estimated loss of $600 billion revenue of the U.S.^^\nLegal mechanisms also exist under immigration law to prevent potential foreign threats from enacting businesses or entering the U.S. for the purposes of cyber espionage. The case below underscores the challenges in prosecuting foreign entities for cyber espionage activities, especially when the alleged actions span multiple jurisdictions, highlighting the complex interplay between national security, international law, and the limitations of domestic legal systems in addressing transnational cyber threats.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n17\nCase 1: John DOE, also known as Kidane, Appellant v The FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA, Appellee⁶⁰\nIn 2017, the appellant, John Doe, using the pseudonym “Kidane,” claimed that he was deceived into downloading a computer program that allowed the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia to spy on him from abroad. Kidane wanted to sue Ethiopia, but foreign states are generally immune from lawsuits unless an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) applies. Kidane invoked the FSIA’s exception for noncommercial torts, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that this exception only applies to torts that occur entirely within the U.S. Since Kidane alleged a transnational tort, the court affirmed the district court’s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The case involved claims under the Wiretap Act and the Maryland common law tort of intrusion upon seclusion, both of which were dismissed by the district court. The court’s decision was based on the premise that the entire tort, including the alleged spying, did not occur solely within the U.S.\nThus, legal principles, such as those outlined in the FSIA, play a crucial role in addressing these concerns. FSIA typically provides foreign states with immunity from lawsuits in domestic courts, except under specific exceptions.\nPart III. Assessment of Law\nInternational law, while fruitful in creating an area for non-state entities to combat cyber espionage attacks, remains ineffective in prosecuting foreign entities for domestic attacks within both Canada and the U.S. As seen in Doe, domestic law cannot apply to prosecute foreign governments regardless of evidence of attribution.⁶¹ Within Canada, even while tracing espionage activities to a Russian state-sponsored group, APT29, Canada was unable to achieve prosecution, but rather highlighted cybersecurity measures that Canadian organizations can\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n18\nutilize to protect themselves against such attacks. Further to this point, while both Canada and the U.S. have specific legislation to prosecute violations of cyber espionage, the avenues are prohibited as per international law. For instance, section 19 of the SOIA prohibits economic espionage, while CSIS possesses the authority to identify and prosecute violations of cyber espionage, but neither can adequately protect against foreign actors due to the lack of extradition treaties. On the other hand, despite the U.S. having actively pursued legal actions against foreign individuals engaging in cyber espionage, difficulties in prosecution arise due to extradition treaties, as seen in the example of the U.S.-Hong Kong Extradition Treaty. Thus, states are required to opt for security measures due to lack of extradition treaties governing attribution of cyber espionage due to states' unwillingness to create such treaties as a result of their own involvement in cyber espionage activities.\nA comparison of Canadian and the U.S. legal frameworks reveals their distinct approaches to cyber espionage. While the U.S. has actively addressed cybersecurity threats both in the public and private sectors, Canada has yet to implement direct legal avenues. The U.S. has established and implemented legislation like the ACDC Act to legalize certain cybersecurity practices to clarify the measures that targeted private organizations are able to pursue, while Canada has yet to do so. Canada has, however, increased protective measures and actively engaged in providing recommendations to non-state entities to enhance their cybersecurity frameworks. This demonstrates the initiative taken by the U.S. to engage the private sector in responding to threats more aggressively. Canada has not yet initiated the legalization of a non-governmental response to cyber threats, which may result in the overburdening of the criminal justice system in addressing the increased espionage threats to state and non-state actors.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n19\nHowever, Canadian Immigration Law does mitigate threats of cyber espionage by refusing to permit foreign individuals and/or foreign organizations who may be involved in espionage to continue their activities domestically. This can be seen in *China Mobile* 62 where the organization was divested on the basis of it working under the PRC to conduct cyber espionage operations that threaten national security. These laws, though, are subject to rigorous legal scrutiny as seen in the case of *Yihdego* and *Geng* which ruled in favor of the appellants on the basis that the Immigration Division was unreasonable in their ruling of their association with organizations that operated to conduct cyber espionage.63 Similarly, the U.S. also frequently dismisses individuals under section 212 of the *Immigration and Nationality Act* due to suspicion of espionage, subversion or threat activities to national security.\nThus, both Canada and the U.S. actively address cybersecurity challenges, but there are notable differences in their legal frameworks, responses to private sector involvement, and the use of immigration law as a deterrent against cyber threats.\n## Part IV. Proposition for Legal Frameworks\nThe evaluation of international, Canadian and U.S. legal frameworks suggests recommendations for the improvement of international and Canadian frameworks for the purpose of enhancing Canada's national security. While the U.S. legal framework may have imperfections of its own, that is not covered within the scope of this paper.\n## Recommendations for International Law\nThe issue in international law resides not within the rules that it adopts, but rather in its ability to implement and enforce these principles. Considering this, a unique legal framework for cyber espionage, akin to international human rights or environmental law, could be established for more realistic prosecution measures.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n20\nRecommendation #1. Establishing a Multilateral Treaty for Domestic Enforcement of Anti-Cyber Espionage Laws\nThis recommendation proposes the creation of a multilateral treaty that would allow for the domestic enforcement of anti-cyber espionage laws. The primary objective is to address the challenges in holding individuals accountable for cyber espionage, especially when these activities occur across international borders. The primary challenge includes the reluctance of states to extradite their citizens for cybercrimes committed abroad, largely due to the pervasive nature of state-sponsored cyber espionage. This recommendation acknowledges the complexity of international relations and cyber operations, where national interests often prevent the accountability of individuals involved in cyber espionage.\nDrawing on Harold Koh’s Transnational Legal Process theory, the internalization of international law into domestic law would actualize in three stages: interaction (whereby states, international organizations, legal experts and other stakeholders would begin discussions and negotiations on the creation of a multilateral treaty), interpretation (whereby these entities come together to clarify the obligations, legal enforcement mechanisms and scope of the treaties), and finally internalization (whereby signatory states adopt the treaty’s provisions into their national legal systems and establish mechanisms for prosecution).64 Koh’s theory is utilized to emphasize the importance of integrating international norms into domestic legal systems, and is particularly relevant here because it outlines a process through which international law can be internalized at the domestic level, ensuring that states not only adopt but also enforce these norms within their jurisdictions. The outlined stages underscore the necessity for coordinated international effort to address the gaps in current legal mechanisms concerning cyber espionage.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n21\nAdopting this recommendation allows for the addressing of the limitations of existing extradition treaties, which are often ineffective in the context of cyber espionage. Extradition processes are hindered by political considerations, state sovereignty concerns, and the pervasive involvement of state-sponsored actors in cyber operations. A multilateral treaty that allows for domestic prosecution within the country of origin presents a more feasible and effective solution. This approach aims to enhance accountability while respecting state sovereignty, a balance that is crucial in international law. By incorporating compulsory jurisdictional clauses, such a treaty would provide a legal framework for prosecuting cyber espionage that transcends national borders.\nThis approach also aligns with the growing consensus among legal scholars that traditional methods of international law enforcement are insufficient to tackle the complexities of cybercrime and espionage. Scholars like Asaf Lubin and Russell Buchan have discussed the limitations of current international law in addressing cyber espionage. Lubin has highlighted the challenges in achieving international consensus on extradition for cyber crimes due to the geopolitical implications of state-sponsored activities. Buchan, on the other hand, has argued for the necessity of developing new legal frameworks that can address the unique challenges posed by cyber operations. This recommendation aligns with their views by proposing a multilateral treaty as a viable alternative to the current state of affairs, offering a practical and forward-thinking solution that addresses the gaps identified by these experts.\nThus, this recommendation recognizes the limitations of current legal mechanisms and the necessity for states to collaborate in creating norms and laws that reflect the realities of the digital age. Implementing such a treaty would require a significant diplomatic effort, consensus-building, and the willingness of states to enforce these laws domestically against their citizens. It\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n22\nrepresents a forward-thinking approach to international cybersecurity, emphasizing the importance of legal frameworks in maintaining global digital security and justice.\n## Recommendation #2. Implementing International Accountability for Non-State Cyber Actors through Organizational Deterrence\nThis recommendation proposes leveraging international organizations, such as the United Nations (UN) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), to enforce accountability on non-state actors involved in cyber violations, a move beyond the traditional state-centric model of international law. This could take effect in the form of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) publicly denouncing states that support or fail to act against non-state cyber actors. The reputational damage from such denunciations can be a powerful deterrent; the UN Security Council (UNSC) passes binding resolutions that impose sanctions on states that are found to harbor or support non-state cyber actors. These sanctions could range from economic penalties to restrictions on participation in international activities; the ICJ could contribute through legal adjudication by issuing advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by the UNGA, UNSC, or other authorized international organs. Such opinions on the legality of states' actions or inactions regarding cyber activities can influence international law and state behavior. States could bring cases against other states they allege are responsible for cyber violations through support or harboring of non-state actors. A judgment against a state in such a case could lead to direct legal consequences for the state and set precedents that deter future violations. Thus, this approach suggests using public denunciation as a tool for deterrence, identifying non-state actors by their associated state, names, and other identifiable information to hold them accountable on the international stage.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n23\nThe core of this strategy lies in the use of general deterrence, where the public calling out of these actors would lead to tangible consequences. These could include economic sanctions, arms embargoes, or even expulsion from international bodies against the states harboring or indirectly supporting such actors. The premise is that by imposing reputational damage and potential economic or political penalties, both the perpetrators and their host states would be discouraged from engaging in or condoning cyber violations due to the heightened risks of international condemnation and isolation. These have been proven effective in other contexts. For instance, UN sanctions, when well-implemented, have been used to curb behaviors like nuclear proliferation and terrorism. Although the effectiveness of sanctions and public denunciations can vary, historical evidence shows that they can lead to meaningful consequences, such as economic or political isolation of offending states. For example, the sanctions imposed by the UN on North Korea, including economic sanctions and arms embargoes, have aimed to curtail the country's nuclear ambitions by exerting pressure through international isolation and economic restrictions.65 This demonstrates how similar strategies could be applied to the realm of cyber violations.\nThis approach acknowledges the complexities and limitations of attributing cyber activities to specific actors but leverages the global community's collective power to enforce norms and maintain cyber peace. It reflects a pragmatic understanding that in the digital age, where state and non-state boundaries blur in cyber operations, traditional methods of accountability may need to be supplemented with broader, more inclusive strategies that can adapt to the dynamic and interconnected nature of global cybersecurity threats.\nHowever, the effectiveness of such measures depends on the willingness of the international community to enforce them uniformly and the ability to adapt these tools to the\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n24\ndynamic nature of cyber threats. Sanctions and public denunciations, while potentially powerful, can sometimes be circumvented or rendered ineffective by the resilience of non-state actors or the protective actions of state sponsors. Nevertheless, the proposal represents a significant step towards strengthening global cyber governance and ensuring that non-state cyber actors are held accountable on the international stage.\n## Recommendations for Canadian Domestic Law\nRecommendation #1. Establishing a National Open-Source Database for Enhanced Cyber Espionage Defence in Canada\nThis recommendation proposes the creation of a national open-source database to list foreign entities known to have targeted Canada through cyber espionage. This initiative would mirror the approach used by Public Safety Canada for terrorist entities, including details such as the reasoning for their listing, dates of listing, and review dates.⁶⁶ The aim is to enable non-governmental entities, including businesses and organizations, to better protect themselves against foreign cyber threats by: avoiding collaboration with listed entities; exercising increased caution when dealing with businesses associated with these entities; and utilizing general Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) for heightened cybersecurity vigilance.\nThis database allows for the addressing of the existing gaps in Canada’s cybersecurity defences by shifting from a reactive to a proactive stance against cyber threats. Currently, non-state actors often lack the necessary information to adequately protect themselves against sophisticated cyber threats. By making detailed information about known cyber threat actors publicly accessible, the database empowers businesses and organizations to take preventive measures, reducing their vulnerability to espionage. This approach not only enhances the overall\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n25\ncybersecurity posture of non-state actors but also alleviates the burden on government resources, allowing them to focus on more complex or high-level threats.\nDespite challenges such as the adaptability of threat actors, who may change names or methods to evade detection, and the need for regular updates and maintenance, the database represents a shift towards a proactive defence strategy, essential in the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber threats. Publicly listing entities involved in cyber espionage would act as a deterrent, signaling Canada's intolerance of such activities. Additionally, the database would establish a legal basis for prosecuting cyber espionage and disrupt the operations of listed entities by discouraging Canadian businesses from engaging with them, making this approach a robust solution to the challenges posed by cyber espionage.\n## Recommendation #2. Strengthening Cybersecurity Through Legislative Mandates: A Proposal for Enhanced Data Protection in Canada\nThis recommendation urges the adoption of stringent legislative measures in Canada to compel organizations to implement robust cybersecurity practices, particularly those handling sensitive data across sectors such as government, research, and healthcare. Given the provinces' constitutional jurisdiction over property and civil rights as outlined in sections 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, this approach allows legislation to be finely tailored to the specific needs and conditions of each region, addressing local differences effectively, particularly in diverse sectors.\nDrawing on insights from legal experts with a background in cybersecurity, there is a consensus on the necessity for more specific Information Technology (IT) and data protection regulations. Despite the expectation for organizations to maintain high standards of privacy and security, gaps and inconsistencies in their cybersecurity measures are evident, underscoring the\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n26\nneed for enforceable legal standards.⁶⁸ For instance, the Capital One Data Breach of 2019, which exposed the data of over 100 million Capital One customers in the U.S. and 6 million in Canada, was a direct result of a misconfigured web application firewall.⁶⁹ This incident shows how a hacker could exploit such a vulnerability to access customer data stored on a cloud server. Similarly, the 2019 Desjardins Group Data Leak, affecting 4.2 million members of the Quebec-based credit union, was caused by an insider threat, leaking sensitive information including names, addresses, birthdates, and social insurance numbers.⁷⁰ These examples underscore the critical need for regulations that not only mandate regular security assessments of cloud environments and configurations but also emphasize internal security measures, access controls, and employee training to detect and prevent insider threats.\nThis proposal calls for the enactment of provincial laws that mandate organizations to periodically update their cybersecurity protocols to thwart unauthorized access by third parties, potentially jeopardizing their data integrity. This approach is bolstered by the aforementioned examples, which despite substantial investment in data protection, have experienced significant breaches. These instances highlight the pervasive challenge of cybersecurity and the inadequacy of voluntary compliance in safeguarding against data breaches.\nBy instituting specific legal requirements for cybersecurity, the recommendation aims to create a uniform baseline of security measures that all organizations must meet, thereby reducing the likelihood of opportunistic cyberattacks exploiting systemic vulnerabilities. While acknowledging that no legislative measure can entirely eliminate the risk of targeted cyberattacks, the proposed laws are intended to significantly reduce the incidence of such breaches by mandating proactive security measures. In effect, this legal mandate would serve as a deterrent against potential attackers while ensuring that organizations are held accountable for\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n27\nthe protection of sensitive data, thereby enhancing the overall cybersecurity posture of Canadian entities. Moreover, considering cybersecurity’s overlap with both telecommunications (federal jurisdiction) and property rights (provincial jurisdiction), a coordinated effort between federal and provincial governments is essential to cover all aspects of cybersecurity effectively. This layered approach could mitigate the risk of cyberattacks by ensuring no aspect of cybersecurity is overlooked due to jurisdictional limitations.\n## Recommendation #3. Implementing a Structured Active Cyber Defence Framework for Canada: A Strategy for Empowering Private Entities\nThis recommendation advocates for Canada to adopt a legislative approach akin to the U.S.’ ACDC Act, allowing specified private entities to engage in Active Cyber Defense (ACD) activities against cyber threats. The rationale behind this suggestion is to enhance the cybersecurity posture of Canadian organizations by legalizing certain proactive defence measures that enable them to deter, detect, and respond to malicious cyber activities effectively. The emphasis on stricter cybersecurity laws is to mitigate the risks of opportunistic cyber attacks that exploit security vulnerabilities, while also acknowledging that even the most robust security measures may not fully prevent targeted cyber espionage or attacks.\nBy selecting specific private entities for conducting ACD, the recommendation aims to create a controlled environment where such activities are regulated and monitored to prevent abuse or unintended consequences. This approach seeks to strike a balance between empowering organizations to defend themselves and ensuring that such measures do not cross ethical or legal boundaries, potentially causing harm to innocent parties or escalating cyber conflicts. Essential to this approach is the establishment of clear limits and parameters for entities eligible to conduct\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n28\nACD, including criteria such as cybersecurity maturity, certification and accreditation, purpose and proportionality of actions, oversight and reporting obligations, legal and ethical training, collaboration with law enforcement, liability and accountability, and mechanisms for revocation of authorization if needed.\nAs cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated, relying solely on passive defence measures is no longer sufficient. The ACDC Act in the U.S. has been proposed as a means to empower private entities to defend themselves more aggressively against cyberattacks. This Canadian adaptation would similarly provide organizations with the legal tools to protect their networks proactively, potentially reducing the incidence of successful cyber intrusions. The case of Shawn Carpenter, as discussed earlier, highlights the practical benefits of such an approach. Carpenter, a cybersecurity analyst, used his employer's resources to trace a cyber intrusion back to its source, which led to the identification of hackers working for a foreign government. Despite his success, Carpenter was fired for unauthorized use of company resources, illustrating the need for legal protection for individuals who take proactive measures to defend their organizations. This case highlights how individuals or entities, when given the legal authority and proper oversight, can contribute to national cyber defence efforts without resorting to vigilantism or exceeding their legal rights. Thus, by providing a legal framework for ACD, this recommendation would encourage cybersecurity professionals to engage in necessary defence actions without fear of job loss or legal repercussions, thereby contributing to broader national security efforts.\nIncorporating these guidelines ensures that the empowered entities act within a framework that safeguards against misuse while enabling effective defence against cyber threats. Thus, this recommendation proposes a structured legal mechanism for Canada to enable selected\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n29\nprivate entities to actively participate in cyber defence, drawing inspiration from the U.S. experience to tailor a system that accommodates Canadian legal and ethical standards. This approach aims to enhance the overall resilience of Canada’s cyber infrastructure by incorporating the capabilities and resources of the private sector into the national cyber defence strategy, under a framework that ensures accountability, legality, and proportionality of actions, fostering a more secure digital environment for Canada.\nThe strength of such a legislation lies in its ability to empower private entities to take a more active role in cybersecurity, filling a critical gap in Canada’s current defence strategy. Challenges such as the risk of escalating cyber conflicts or potential legal and ethical violations must be carefully managed. Concerns about mistaken attribution and the risk of targeting innocent third parties or nation-states, with serious geopolitical consequences, have been raised. Nevertheless, adopting this recommendation provides a structured and regulated approach to active cyber defence, ensuring actions are taken within a legal and ethical framework. By learning from the U.S. experience, Canada can develop a system that aligns with its own legal standards, ultimately strengthening the resilience of its cyber infrastructure. This approach strikes a critical balance between proactive defence and the need for accountability, legality, and proportionality, making it a progressive step in protecting Canada’s digital landscape.\n## Part V. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the assessment of legal frameworks in both Canada and the U.S. reveals the complexities and challenges associated with combating cyber espionage. While international law lays the foundation for addressing cyber threats, its limitations become apparent when attempting to prosecute foreign entities for domestic attacks, as seen in Doe.71 Both Canada and the U.S. have specific legislation to combat cyber espionage, but avenues for prosecution are\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n30\noften hampered by international law and extradition challenges. Notably, the U.S. has taken a more proactive approach by implementing the Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act to clarify and legalize certain cybersecurity practices, encouraging private sector involvement in responding to threats. Canada, on the other hand, has yet to implement similar direct legal avenues for non-governmental responses, relying more on protective measures and recommendations for non-state entities. The use of immigration law as a deterrent against cyber threats is a shared approach between both countries, as demonstrated in cases such as China Mobile, Geng, and Yihdego.72 Both Canada and the U.S. actively address cybersecurity challenges through legal mechanisms, though differences exist in their frameworks, responses to private sector involvement, and the utilization of immigration law. Proposing improvements to the legal frameworks, the paper suggests recommendations for both international and Canadian domestic laws. For international law, the creation of a multilateral treaty enforcing anti-cyber espionage laws into domestic law is proposed, providing a higher level of accountability. Additionally, the suggestion to engage international organizations in enforcing accountability upon non-state cyber actors broadens the scope of responsibility mechanisms, enriching the traditional state-centric model without directly contesting it. For Canadian domestic law, recommendations include the creation of a national open-source database to track foreign entities involved in cyber espionage, enhancing non-governmental entities’ ability to protect themselves. Mandating specific laws to ensure organizations implement stricter cybersecurity measures and designating selected private entities to conduct Active Cyber Defence against threat actors would bolster Canada’s cybersecurity defences. Addressing the evolving threat landscape of cyber espionage requires a multifaceted approach involving international collaboration, legal advances, and proactive measures at the national level. Implementing these recommendations can contribute to a more\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n31\nrobust legal framework, better protecting Canada’s national security interests in the face of growing cyber threats.\n1.

Conclusion...29 Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 Cybercrime in Canada results in more than $3 billion in economic losses each year, which makes it the leading cause of wealth transfer to foreign states.¹ This threat is compounded by cyber espionage seeking to obtain sensitive and financial data, potentially harming civilians, Canadian economic interests, and national security. For instance, China’s espionage efforts to identify potential dissidents, including human rights activists, may expose these individuals to physical danger when they return to their own countries. This danger could manifest in various forms, such as anonymous cyber attacks, as demonstrated by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) conducting espionage against Canadian citizen Omar Said.² This paper examines the legal frameworks in Canada and the United States (U.S.) for addressing cyber espionage, highlighting the current lack of international focus on the issue. It aims to enhance Canada’s capacity to fight and prosecute cyber espionage threats in both public and private sectors, offering recommendations to improve Canada’s legal framework to bolster the country’s defence against these threats. Part I provides an overview of cyber espionage and its significance within cyberspace. Part II examines the legal frameworks in both Canada and the U.S., including relevant case law. Part III assesses the distinctions between Canadian and U.S. cybersecurity laws, focusing on their application to cyber espionage. Finally, Part IV offers recommendations for improving Canada’s legal framework.\n# Part I. Cyber Espionage Defined and Explored ## Cyber Espionage: A Definition There is no universally accepted definition of cyber espionage, a fact that complicates both its legal interpretation and international regulation. The Federal Court of Appeal, in the case of *Qu v Canada* defined it as “surreptitious or covert information gathering”.³ Meanwhile, Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## Purpose and Actors\nCyber espionage serves two primary objectives: political and economic. Political espionage comprises the unauthorized access to military, potential commercial or other secret information, compromising a state’s ability to safeguard itself and its citizens from foreign threats.⁷ Economic espionage entails the illicit acquisition of trade secrets crucial for a nation’s financial success, thus threatening the economic stability of the state.⁸ Each type of espionage carries specific legal consequences, which vary based on whether the espionage was conducted for political or economic reasons.\nThe primary foreign threat actors originate from China and Russia with the primary targets of cyber espionage being the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom.⁹ Many of these target states engage in cyber espionage themselves. For example, the U.S. has faced accusations of conducting cyber espionage in foreign states, as revealed by information disclosed by whistleblower Edward Snowden.¹⁰ This highlights a prevalent lack of accountability that both\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\nThe perpetrators of cyber espionage target both the public and private sectors. Currently, there has been a noticeable shift in Canada from cyber espionage targeting the public sector, which benefits from the government’s substantial cybersecurity infrastructure, to espionage aimed at the private sector. This shift underscores the critical need to address threats targeting the private sector.¹⁴ According to a report by New Zealand’s National Cyber Security Centre, financial motivation surpasses state-sponsored activity.¹⁵ Therefore, economic cyber espionage is one of the primary concerns within the cyber arena.\nCanada and the U.S. have established specific legal frameworks to address and penalize cyber espionage activities. In Canada, economic espionage is deemed an indictable offence under section 19 of the Security of Information Act (SOIA).¹⁶ Anyone found guilty of violating subsection 19(1) faces a penalty of imprisonment for up to 10 years.¹⁷ This law applies to cyber-related activities where confidential economic information is illicitly obtained. In the U.S., the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 serves to criminalize economic espionage activities. According to this Act, economic espionage includes actions where an individual intentionally commits an offence that benefits any foreign government, instrumentality, or agent. The Act specifies offences including the unauthorized theft or acquisition of trade secrets through fraudulent means, the unauthorized copying or conveyance of trade secrets, and the unauthorized Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## Importance of Addressing Cyber Espionage\nChallenges in attribution and the absence of comprehensive international legal frameworks or extradition treaties significantly undermine the effectiveness of current domestic laws in Canada and the U.S. in combating cyber espionage. These difficulties are compounded by the state-centric nature of international law, which tends to hold foreign states accountable for actions by private entities within their territory. This leads to a significant disconnect in holding the actual perpetrators (defendants) accountable to the victims (appellants) due to the following reasons:\n\nIdentifying the precise origins of cyber espionage activities is notoriously difficult. Cyber attackers often use sophisticated techniques to mask their locations and identities, making it challenging for victim states to accurately attribute cyber attacks to specific actors or states. This ambiguity hinders the ability to levy charges or sanctions against the responsible parties.\n\nThe absence of universally accepted international legal agreements or extradition treaties that specifically address cyber espionage exacerbates the problem. Without these agreements, even when attribution is possible, legal mechanisms to pursue or prosecute individuals or entities across borders are limited or non-existent.\n\nThe prevailing model of international law focuses on the responsibilities and rights of states rather than individuals or non-state actors. When cyber espionage is conducted Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## 4) Perpetuated Lack of Accountability\nThere is an implicit global agreement among states, driven by their own involvement in cyber espionage, to maintain this status quo. This tacit understanding further dilutes the incentive for states to develop stringent international norms or laws against cyber espionage, as doing so could implicate their own activities.\nThese factors collectively lead to a cycle of unaccountability, where states can easily absolve themselves of blame, and victims have limited recourse through domestic or international legal systems. To protect Canadian interests effectively, there is a need for a dual approach that involves strengthening domestic legal frameworks to better protect against cyber espionage and advocating for the development of international norms and agreements that address the unique challenges of cyberspace, including better mechanisms for attribution, accountability, and cross-border cooperation. This comprehensive strategy would not only enhance Canada’s defensive capabilities but also contribute to the global effort to establish a more secure and accountable cyber environment.\n## Part II. Description of Law\n### International Law Framework\nThe “use of force” doctrine dictated by Article 2(4) of the UN Charter states that “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”.¹⁹ However, in the cyber realm, it remains unclear\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\nThere are scenarios where cyber espionage could be considered a violation of international law without requiring the use of force against another state but rather due to the impact that espionage poses on individuals and companies. The principle of non-intervention is considered a part of customary international law as per the International Court of Justice’s ruling in Nicaragua v US 1986,²⁵ in which the court stated: Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 The principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference; though examples of trespass against this principle are not infrequent, the Court considers that it is part and parcel of customary international law. A prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones.\nThus, as per Nicaragua, the principle of non-intervention is breached when there is coercive interference with matters falling within a State’s domaine réservé.²⁶ This principle underscores that coercion does not necessarily involve the use of force.²⁷ In fact, a coercive interference is characterized by actions designed to strip a state of its decision-making freedom²⁸ and compel it to act against its will.²⁹ Despite debates around the applicability of this principle to cyber espionage—arguing it falls outside the purview of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) due to the “clean hands doctrine” where states might be equally culpable—the ICJ has clarified it seldom dismisses cases on this basis without substantial justification.³⁰ It did so in Certain Iranian Assets, stating that “the ICJ has never upheld an objection based on the ‘clean hands’ doctrine” and indeed will not do so unless presented with a compelling reason.³¹ The ineffectiveness of domestic law in Canada and other signatory states to the International Convention on Cybercrime is evident when applied to foreign actors, primarily due to challenges in attribution and extradition. While Canada commits to criminalizing acts like cyber theft domestically, acknowledging the significant harm data theft poses, these efforts falter when addressing the state-sponsored threats that dominate the cyber espionage arena.³² For instance, within Canada specifically, everyone who fraudulently and without color of right uses a computer service or system “is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.”³³ Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## Canadian Cybersecurity Framework\nThe Canadian cybersecurity framework represents a comprehensive approach to addressing the rising tide of cyber threats, particularly in the wake of increased technological adoption and the global pandemic. Canada’s prominence in academic research and economic development has rendered it a prime target for cyber espionage, including both political and economic espionage. With the rise in technological use and transnational interactions due to Covid-19, Microsoft noted that Canada was targeted with 35% more attacks in 2020 than 2019 and was the third most targeted country for Covid-19 related data.³⁵\nDespite significant international collaboration in identifying state-sponsored hackers, and efforts to bolster cybersecurity, the legal capacity to address cyber threats remains largely in the hands of governments. The collaboration between Canada, the U.S., and the United Kingdom in calling out state-sponsored hackers, such as APT29 (also known as ‘the Dukes’ or ‘Cozy Bear’) for their attempts to steal COVID-19 vaccine research exemplifies the proactive stance taken by\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\nThe increase in cyber espionage against private actors underscores the limited legal tools available to these entities to address such threats. Although violations of the law are prosecuted by the government, and protective measures are disseminated through Canadian agencies, private actors do not legally possess the tools to address these threats.⁴¹ This does not mean, however, that there are no avenues for private actors to pursue threat actors that have attacked them. In fact, in 2020, the CSE, acknowledged the commercial availability of advanced cyber tools, indicating a shift towards empowering the private sector in cyber defence.⁴² However, the lack of specific legislation governing the private sector's involvement in tracking and responding to foreign espionage activities leaves a significant gap in Canada's cybersecurity strategy.⁴³ The concept of Active Cyber Defence (ACD), defined as a non-governmental response to cyber threats that has effects outside the defender's own network,⁴⁴ highlights the emerging debate on how private entities can and should respond to cyber threats.\nCanada's legal framework grants significant authority to government agencies in addressing cyber espionage, but the effectiveness of these measures is limited by international challenges. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has the authority to identify and Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 To understand how Canada’s legal frameworks counter potential foreign threats related to cyber espionage, this paper will analyze three pivotal cases. These cases demonstrate the application of legal mechanisms, particularly in business and immigration law, to prevent entities and individuals associated with or suspected of cyber espionage from conducting business or entering Canada. Each case offers insight into legal methods and considerations applied when addressing cyber espionage to strike a balance between national security interests and individual rights. Case 1 outlines the legal method pursued when businesses pose the threat of conducting or facilitating cyber espionage. Case 2 outlines the legal method and factors that are accounted for when individuals are being considered for entry into Canada in relation to cyber espionage concerns. Case 3 outlines concerns with inadmissibility of foreign actors fearing persecution.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 The applicants, China Mobile Communications Group Co., Ltd., China Mobile International (Canada) Inc., and China Mobile International (UK) Limited, sought to stay an order under the Investment Canada Act, requiring China Mobile to divest its interest in its Canadian business, CMI Canada, due to identified national security risks pertaining to cyber espionage.⁴⁸ The Federal Court denied the applicants’ motion for a stay. The court stated that it had notable concerns about CMI Canada’s potential facilitation of espionage and foreign interference activities by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) based on sufficient evidence provided by the respondents, which included reports from the CSE and CSIS, indicating the PRC’s involvement in cyber threats. Thus, the court concluded that the public interest harms outweighed the potential harm to the applicants. Stated differently, the public harms associated with the PRC’s opportunity to use its indirect control over CMI Canada to facilitate espionage and foreign interference activities in Canada were significantly greater than the harm that the applicants established they would suffer if the stay was not granted.\nCase 2: Geng v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023⁴⁹ Liping Geng challenged the decision of an Immigration Officer to refuse his application for permanent residence under the Family Class, rendering him inadmissible under paragraph 34(1)(f) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The Security Screening Branch/CSIS and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)/National Security Screening Division (NSSD) raised concerns about Geng’s employment at the Luoyang Foreign Languages Institute (LFLI) and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) being linked to espionage activities. Geng had a Canadian wife and daughter, frequently traveled between Canada and China, and maintained that he did not hold a military rank.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 Case 3: Yihdego v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2020⁵⁰ Mr. Abel Nahusenay Yihdego, a citizen of Ethiopia, sought refugee protection in Canada, claiming persecution by his previous employer, the Information Network Security Agency (INSA), due to his refusal to join its decryption department, which was allegedly engaged in espionage. The Immigration Division (ID) found Mr. Yihdego inadmissible to Canada for being associated with an organization believed to engage in espionage against Canada’s interests. The decision by the ID was subjected to judicial review by the Federal Court, where the court rules in favor of Mr. Yihdego, deeming the ID’s decision unreasonable. The court held that the ID erred in considering Charter values in defining “Canada’s interests” and questioned the rationale behind concluding that espionage against a Canadian ally was against Canada’s interests. The judgment allowed Mr. Yihdego’s application for judicial review, sending the matter back to another panel of the ID for reconsideration. The court also proposed a question of general importance related to the inadmissibility of a person to Canada under specific circumstances outlined in the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act*.\nIn these cases, legal mechanisms were instrumental in addressing potential foreign threats by scrutinizing business activities and immigration applications, preventing individuals and entities linked to cyber espionage from operating within Canada.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 The U.S., Canada's largest economic and trading partner, is at the forefront of efforts to address international aspects of cyber security.^[51]^ This stems from its private and public sector being the target of cyber espionage attacks – both political and economic – from various foreign actors. According to General Keith B. Alexander, head of the U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, these cyber\"attacks have resulted in the 'greatest transfer of wealth in history'.\"^[52]^ The U.S. Cyber Command was created to use information and communications technology (ICT) and the internet as weapons to defend the Defense Department.^[53]^ In 2011, their international cyber defense strategy entailed\"all necessary means consistent with International Law used to respond to hostile cyberspace acts\".^[54]^ The U.S.'s approach to cybersecurity was further enhanced by the introduction of the Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act (ACDC Act), a bill proposed by U.S. Congressman Tom Graves. This legislation aims to legalize certain cyber security practices or, at least, clarify their legality. This bill responded to demands for the legalization of more aggressive measures in order to allow victims of cyber intrusions to defend themselves against malicious actors.^[55]^ This less than comprehensive legislation allows individuals who have sought non-legal (i.e. ACD) methods of tracking attackers to not be penalized, and obtain support from government organizations for advancing national security.\nAn example of the complexities in cybersecurity law is the case of Shawn Carpenter, a cybersecurity analyst who used his company's data to trace a\"hack\"server in China and provided the information to the FBI in 2003.^[56]^ Although Carpenter was fired for violating company policies, he successfully sued for wrongful termination and won.^[57]^ This incident Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 Even when the U.S. has identified foreign individuals conducting cyber espionage activities within their national systems, they are unable to prosecute them due to the lack of agreements within extradition treaties. For instance, in 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice publicly charged five Chinese nationals for engaging in corporate espionage against U.S. corporations.^[58]^ Most of the accused were part of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. However, under the terms of the U.S.- Hong Kong Extradition Treaty, China can refuse to extradite a person within its borders if “surrender implicates the defense, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy of the People’s Republic of China,” which renders prosecution of these accused impossible. This is despite the fact that Chinese actors have conducted approximately 39 cyber espionage operations within the U.S. between 2003 and 2013, with an annual estimated loss of $600 billion revenue of the U.S.^[59]^ Legal mechanisms also exist under immigration law to prevent potential foreign threats from enacting businesses or entering the U.S. for the purposes of cyber espionage. The case below underscores the challenges in prosecuting foreign entities for cyber espionage activities, especially when the alleged actions span multiple jurisdictions, highlighting the complex interplay between national security, international law, and the limitations of domestic legal systems in addressing transnational cyber threats.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 In 2017, the appellant, John Doe, using the pseudonym “Kidane,” claimed that he was deceived into downloading a computer program that allowed the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia to spy on him from abroad. Kidane wanted to sue Ethiopia, but foreign states are generally immune from lawsuits unless an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) applies. Kidane invoked the FSIA’s exception for noncommercial torts, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that this exception only applies to torts that occur entirely within the U.S. Since Kidane alleged a transnational tort, the court affirmed the district court’s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The case involved claims under the Wiretap Act and the Maryland common law tort of intrusion upon seclusion, both of which were dismissed by the district court. The court’s decision was based on the premise that the entire tort, including the alleged spying, did not occur solely within the U.S.\nThus, legal principles, such as those outlined in the FSIA, play a crucial role in addressing these concerns. FSIA typically provides foreign states with immunity from lawsuits in domestic courts, except under specific exceptions.\nPart III. Assessment of Law International law, while fruitful in creating an area for non-state entities to combat cyber espionage attacks, remains ineffective in prosecuting foreign entities for domestic attacks within both Canada and the U.S. As seen in Doe, domestic law cannot apply to prosecute foreign governments regardless of evidence of attribution.⁶¹ Within Canada, even while tracing espionage activities to a Russian state-sponsored group, APT29, Canada was unable to achieve prosecution, but rather highlighted cybersecurity measures that Canadian organizations can Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 A comparison of Canadian and the U.S. legal frameworks reveals their distinct approaches to cyber espionage. While the U.S. has actively addressed cybersecurity threats both in the public and private sectors, Canada has yet to implement direct legal avenues. The U.S. has established and implemented legislation like the ACDC Act to legalize certain cybersecurity practices to clarify the measures that targeted private organizations are able to pursue, while Canada has yet to do so. Canada has, however, increased protective measures and actively engaged in providing recommendations to non-state entities to enhance their cybersecurity frameworks. This demonstrates the initiative taken by the U.S. to engage the private sector in responding to threats more aggressively. Canada has not yet initiated the legalization of a non-governmental response to cyber threats, which may result in the overburdening of the criminal justice system in addressing the increased espionage threats to state and non-state actors.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 Thus, both Canada and the U.S. actively address cybersecurity challenges, but there are notable differences in their legal frameworks, responses to private sector involvement, and the use of immigration law as a deterrent against cyber threats.\n## Part IV. Proposition for Legal Frameworks The evaluation of international, Canadian and U.S. legal frameworks suggests recommendations for the improvement of international and Canadian frameworks for the purpose of enhancing Canada's national security. While the U.S. legal framework may have imperfections of its own, that is not covered within the scope of this paper.\n## Recommendations for International Law The issue in international law resides not within the rules that it adopts, but rather in its ability to implement and enforce these principles. Considering this, a unique legal framework for cyber espionage, akin to international human rights or environmental law, could be established for more realistic prosecution measures.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 This recommendation proposes the creation of a multilateral treaty that would allow for the domestic enforcement of anti-cyber espionage laws. The primary objective is to address the challenges in holding individuals accountable for cyber espionage, especially when these activities occur across international borders. The primary challenge includes the reluctance of states to extradite their citizens for cybercrimes committed abroad, largely due to the pervasive nature of state-sponsored cyber espionage. This recommendation acknowledges the complexity of international relations and cyber operations, where national interests often prevent the accountability of individuals involved in cyber espionage.\nDrawing on Harold Koh’s Transnational Legal Process theory, the internalization of international law into domestic law would actualize in three stages: interaction (whereby states, international organizations, legal experts and other stakeholders would begin discussions and negotiations on the creation of a multilateral treaty), interpretation (whereby these entities come together to clarify the obligations, legal enforcement mechanisms and scope of the treaties), and finally internalization (whereby signatory states adopt the treaty’s provisions into their national legal systems and establish mechanisms for prosecution).64 Koh’s theory is utilized to emphasize the importance of integrating international norms into domestic legal systems, and is particularly relevant here because it outlines a process through which international law can be internalized at the domestic level, ensuring that states not only adopt but also enforce these norms within their jurisdictions. The outlined stages underscore the necessity for coordinated international effort to address the gaps in current legal mechanisms concerning cyber espionage.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3 This approach also aligns with the growing consensus among legal scholars that traditional methods of international law enforcement are insufficient to tackle the complexities of cybercrime and espionage. Scholars like Asaf Lubin and Russell Buchan have discussed the limitations of current international law in addressing cyber espionage. Lubin has highlighted the challenges in achieving international consensus on extradition for cyber crimes due to the geopolitical implications of state-sponsored activities. Buchan, on the other hand, has argued for the necessity of developing new legal frameworks that can address the unique challenges posed by cyber operations. This recommendation aligns with their views by proposing a multilateral treaty as a viable alternative to the current state of affairs, offering a practical and forward-thinking solution that addresses the gaps identified by these experts.\nThus, this recommendation recognizes the limitations of current legal mechanisms and the necessity for states to collaborate in creating norms and laws that reflect the realities of the digital age. Implementing such a treaty would require a significant diplomatic effort, consensus-building, and the willingness of states to enforce these laws domestically against their citizens. It Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## Recommendation #2. Implementing International Accountability for Non-State Cyber Actors through Organizational Deterrence\nThis recommendation proposes leveraging international organizations, such as the United Nations (UN) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), to enforce accountability on non-state actors involved in cyber violations, a move beyond the traditional state-centric model of international law. This could take effect in the form of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) publicly denouncing states that support or fail to act against non-state cyber actors. The reputational damage from such denunciations can be a powerful deterrent; the UN Security Council (UNSC) passes binding resolutions that impose sanctions on states that are found to harbor or support non-state cyber actors. These sanctions could range from economic penalties to restrictions on participation in international activities; the ICJ could contribute through legal adjudication by issuing advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by the UNGA, UNSC, or other authorized international organs. Such opinions on the legality of states' actions or inactions regarding cyber activities can influence international law and state behavior. States could bring cases against other states they allege are responsible for cyber violations through support or harboring of non-state actors. A judgment against a state in such a case could lead to direct legal consequences for the state and set precedents that deter future violations. Thus, this approach suggests using public denunciation as a tool for deterrence, identifying non-state actors by their associated state, names, and other identifiable information to hold them accountable on the international stage.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\nThis approach acknowledges the complexities and limitations of attributing cyber activities to specific actors but leverages the global community's collective power to enforce norms and maintain cyber peace. It reflects a pragmatic understanding that in the digital age, where state and non-state boundaries blur in cyber operations, traditional methods of accountability may need to be supplemented with broader, more inclusive strategies that can adapt to the dynamic and interconnected nature of global cybersecurity threats.\nHowever, the effectiveness of such measures depends on the willingness of the international community to enforce them uniformly and the ability to adapt these tools to the Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## Recommendations for Canadian Domestic Law\nRecommendation #1. Establishing a National Open-Source Database for Enhanced Cyber Espionage Defence in Canada\nThis recommendation proposes the creation of a national open-source database to list foreign entities known to have targeted Canada through cyber espionage. This initiative would mirror the approach used by Public Safety Canada for terrorist entities, including details such as the reasoning for their listing, dates of listing, and review dates.⁶⁶ The aim is to enable non-governmental entities, including businesses and organizations, to better protect themselves against foreign cyber threats by: avoiding collaboration with listed entities; exercising increased caution when dealing with businesses associated with these entities; and utilizing general Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) for heightened cybersecurity vigilance.\nThis database allows for the addressing of the existing gaps in Canada’s cybersecurity defences by shifting from a reactive to a proactive stance against cyber threats. Currently, non-state actors often lack the necessary information to adequately protect themselves against sophisticated cyber threats. By making detailed information about known cyber threat actors publicly accessible, the database empowers businesses and organizations to take preventive measures, reducing their vulnerability to espionage. This approach not only enhances the overall\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\nDespite challenges such as the adaptability of threat actors, who may change names or methods to evade detection, and the need for regular updates and maintenance, the database represents a shift towards a proactive defence strategy, essential in the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber threats. Publicly listing entities involved in cyber espionage would act as a deterrent, signaling Canada's intolerance of such activities. Additionally, the database would establish a legal basis for prosecuting cyber espionage and disrupt the operations of listed entities by discouraging Canadian businesses from engaging with them, making this approach a robust solution to the challenges posed by cyber espionage.\n## Recommendation #2. Strengthening Cybersecurity Through Legislative Mandates: A Proposal for Enhanced Data Protection in Canada This recommendation urges the adoption of stringent legislative measures in Canada to compel organizations to implement robust cybersecurity practices, particularly those handling sensitive data across sectors such as government, research, and healthcare. Given the provinces' constitutional jurisdiction over property and civil rights as outlined in sections 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, this approach allows legislation to be finely tailored to the specific needs and conditions of each region, addressing local differences effectively, particularly in diverse sectors.\nDrawing on insights from legal experts with a background in cybersecurity, there is a consensus on the necessity for more specific Information Technology (IT) and data protection regulations.[67] Despite the expectation for organizations to maintain high standards of privacy and security, gaps and inconsistencies in their cybersecurity measures are evident, underscoring the Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 This proposal calls for the enactment of provincial laws that mandate organizations to periodically update their cybersecurity protocols to thwart unauthorized access by third parties, potentially jeopardizing their data integrity. This approach is bolstered by the aforementioned examples, which despite substantial investment in data protection, have experienced significant breaches. These instances highlight the pervasive challenge of cybersecurity and the inadequacy of voluntary compliance in safeguarding against data breaches.\nBy instituting specific legal requirements for cybersecurity, the recommendation aims to create a uniform baseline of security measures that all organizations must meet, thereby reducing the likelihood of opportunistic cyberattacks exploiting systemic vulnerabilities. While acknowledging that no legislative measure can entirely eliminate the risk of targeted cyberattacks, the proposed laws are intended to significantly reduce the incidence of such breaches by mandating proactive security measures. In effect, this legal mandate would serve as a deterrent against potential attackers while ensuring that organizations are held accountable for Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\n## Recommendation #3. Implementing a Structured Active Cyber Defence Framework for Canada: A Strategy for Empowering Private Entities\nThis recommendation advocates for Canada to adopt a legislative approach akin to the U.S.’ ACDC Act, allowing specified private entities to engage in Active Cyber Defense (ACD) activities against cyber threats. The rationale behind this suggestion is to enhance the cybersecurity posture of Canadian organizations by legalizing certain proactive defence measures that enable them to deter, detect, and respond to malicious cyber activities effectively. The emphasis on stricter cybersecurity laws is to mitigate the risks of opportunistic cyber attacks that exploit security vulnerabilities, while also acknowledging that even the most robust security measures may not fully prevent targeted cyber espionage or attacks.\nBy selecting specific private entities for conducting ACD, the recommendation aims to create a controlled environment where such activities are regulated and monitored to prevent abuse or unintended consequences. This approach seeks to strike a balance between empowering organizations to defend themselves and ensuring that such measures do not cross ethical or legal boundaries, potentially causing harm to innocent parties or escalating cyber conflicts. Essential to this approach is the establishment of clear limits and parameters for entities eligible to conduct\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\nAs cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated, relying solely on passive defence measures is no longer sufficient. The ACDC Act in the U.S. has been proposed as a means to empower private entities to defend themselves more aggressively against cyberattacks. This Canadian adaptation would similarly provide organizations with the legal tools to protect their networks proactively, potentially reducing the incidence of successful cyber intrusions. The case of Shawn Carpenter, as discussed earlier, highlights the practical benefits of such an approach. Carpenter, a cybersecurity analyst, used his employer's resources to trace a cyber intrusion back to its source, which led to the identification of hackers working for a foreign government. Despite his success, Carpenter was fired for unauthorized use of company resources, illustrating the need for legal protection for individuals who take proactive measures to defend their organizations. This case highlights how individuals or entities, when given the legal authority and proper oversight, can contribute to national cyber defence efforts without resorting to vigilantism or exceeding their legal rights. Thus, by providing a legal framework for ACD, this recommendation would encourage cybersecurity professionals to engage in necessary defence actions without fear of job loss or legal repercussions, thereby contributing to broader national security efforts.\nIncorporating these guidelines ensures that the empowered entities act within a framework that safeguards against misuse while enabling effective defence against cyber threats. Thus, this recommendation proposes a structured legal mechanism for Canada to enable selected Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 The strength of such a legislation lies in its ability to empower private entities to take a more active role in cybersecurity, filling a critical gap in Canada’s current defence strategy. Challenges such as the risk of escalating cyber conflicts or potential legal and ethical violations must be carefully managed. Concerns about mistaken attribution and the risk of targeting innocent third parties or nation-states, with serious geopolitical consequences, have been raised. Nevertheless, adopting this recommendation provides a structured and regulated approach to active cyber defence, ensuring actions are taken within a legal and ethical framework. By learning from the U.S. experience, Canada can develop a system that aligns with its own legal standards, ultimately strengthening the resilience of its cyber infrastructure. This approach strikes a critical balance between proactive defence and the need for accountability, legality, and proportionality, making it a progressive step in protecting Canada’s digital landscape.\n## Part V. Conclusion In conclusion, the assessment of legal frameworks in both Canada and the U.S. reveals the complexities and challenges associated with combating cyber espionage. While international law lays the foundation for addressing cyber threats, its limitations become apparent when attempting to prosecute foreign entities for domestic attacks, as seen in Doe.71 Both Canada and the U.S. have specific legislation to combat cyber espionage, but avenues for prosecution are Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 Canadian Law Review | Volume 3 34"

For instance, China’s espionage efforts to identify potential dissidents, including human rights activists, may expose these individuals to physical danger when they return to their own countries. This danger could manifest in various forms, such as anonymous cyber attacks, as demonstrated by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) conducting espionage against Canadian citizen Omar Said.²\nThis paper examines the legal frameworks in Canada and the United States (U.S.) for addressing cyber espionage, highlighting the current lack of international focus on the issue. It aims to enhance Canada’s capacity to fight and prosecute cyber espionage threats in both public and private sectors, offering recommendations to improve Canada’s legal framework to bolster the country’s defence against these threats. Part I provides an overview of cyber espionage and its significance within cyberspace. Part II examines the legal frameworks in both Canada and the U.S., including relevant case law. Part III assesses the distinctions between Canadian and U.S. cybersecurity laws, focusing on their application to cyber espionage. Finally, Part IV offers recommendations for improving Canada’s legal framework.\n\n---\n\n## # U.S. Cybersecurity Framework\n\nThe U.S., Canada's largest economic and trading partner, is at the forefront of efforts to address international aspects of cyber security.^^ This stems from its private and public sector being the target of cyber espionage attacks – both political and economic – from various foreign actors.

For instance, in 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice publicly charged five Chinese nationals for engaging in corporate espionage against U.S. corporations.^^ Most of the accused were part of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

The case below underscores the challenges in prosecuting foreign entities for cyber espionage activities, especially when the alleged actions span multiple jurisdictions, highlighting the complex interplay between national security, international law, and the limitations of domestic legal systems in addressing transnational cyber threats.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n17\nCase 1: John DOE, also known as Kidane, Appellant v The FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA, Appellee⁶⁰\nIn 2017, the appellant, John Doe, using the pseudonym “Kidane,” claimed that he was deceived into downloading a computer program that allowed the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia to spy on him from abroad. Kidane wanted to sue Ethiopia, but foreign states are generally immune from lawsuits unless an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) applies. Kidane invoked the FSIA’s exception for noncommercial torts, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that this exception only applies to torts that occur entirely within the U.S. Since Kidane alleged a transnational tort, the court affirmed the district court’s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The case involved claims under the Wiretap Act and the Maryland common law tort of intrusion upon seclusion, both of which were dismissed by the district court. The court’s decision was based on the premise that the entire tort, including the alleged spying, did not occur solely within the U.S.\nThus, legal principles, such as those outlined in the FSIA, play a crucial role in addressing these concerns. FSIA typically provides foreign states with immunity from lawsuits in domestic courts, except under specific exceptions.\nPart III. Assessment of Law\nInternational law, while fruitful in creating an area for non-state entities to combat cyber espionage attacks, remains ineffective in prosecuting foreign entities for domestic attacks within both Canada and the U.S. As seen in Doe, domestic law cannot apply to prosecute foreign governments regardless of evidence of attribution.⁶¹ Within Canada, even while tracing espionage activities to a Russian state-sponsored group, APT29, Canada was unable to achieve prosecution, but rather highlighted cybersecurity measures that Canadian organizations can\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n18\nutilize to protect themselves against such attacks. Further to this point, while both Canada and the U.S. have specific legislation to prosecute violations of cyber espionage, the avenues are prohibited as per international law. For instance, section 19 of the SOIA prohibits economic espionage, while CSIS possesses the authority to identify and prosecute violations of cyber espionage, but neither can adequately protect against foreign actors due to the lack of extradition treaties. On the other hand, despite the U.S. having actively pursued legal actions against foreign individuals engaging in cyber espionage, difficulties in prosecution arise due to extradition treaties, as seen in the example of the U.S.-Hong Kong Extradition Treaty. Thus, states are required to opt for security measures due to lack of extradition treaties governing attribution of cyber espionage due to states' unwillingness to create such treaties as a result of their own involvement in cyber espionage activities.\nA comparison of Canadian and the U.S. legal frameworks reveals their distinct approaches to cyber espionage. While the U.S. has actively addressed cybersecurity threats both in the public and private sectors, Canada has yet to implement direct legal avenues. The U.S. has established and implemented legislation like the ACDC Act to legalize certain cybersecurity practices to clarify the measures that targeted private organizations are able to pursue, while Canada has yet to do so. Canada has, however, increased protective measures and actively engaged in providing recommendations to non-state entities to enhance their cybersecurity frameworks. This demonstrates the initiative taken by the U.S. to engage the private sector in responding to threats more aggressively. Canada has not yet initiated the legalization of a non-governmental response to cyber threats, which may result in the overburdening of the criminal justice system in addressing the increased espionage threats to state and non-state actors.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n19\nHowever, Canadian Immigration Law does mitigate threats of cyber espionage by refusing to permit foreign individuals and/or foreign organizations who may be involved in espionage to continue their activities domestically. This can be seen in *China Mobile* 62 where the organization was divested on the basis of it working under the PRC to conduct cyber espionage operations that threaten national security. These laws, though, are subject to rigorous legal scrutiny as seen in the case of *Yihdego* and *Geng* which ruled in favor of the appellants on the basis that the Immigration Division was unreasonable in their ruling of their association with organizations that operated to conduct cyber espionage.63 Similarly, the U.S. also frequently dismisses individuals under section 212 of the *Immigration and Nationality Act* due to suspicion of espionage, subversion or threat activities to national security.\nThus, both Canada and the U.S. actively address cybersecurity challenges, but there are notable differences in their legal frameworks, responses to private sector involvement, and the use of immigration law as a deterrent against cyber threats.\nThe evaluation of international, Canadian and U.S. legal frameworks suggests recommendations for the improvement of international and Canadian frameworks for the purpose of enhancing Canada's national security. While the U.S. legal framework may have imperfections of its own, that is not covered within the scope of this paper.\n## Recommendations for International Law\nThe issue in international law resides not within the rules that it adopts, but rather in its ability to implement and enforce these principles. Considering this, a unique legal framework for cyber espionage, akin to international human rights or environmental law, could be established for more realistic prosecution measures.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n20\nRecommendation #1. Establishing a Multilateral Treaty for Domestic Enforcement of Anti-Cyber Espionage Laws\nThis recommendation proposes the creation of a multilateral treaty that would allow for the domestic enforcement of anti-cyber espionage laws. The primary objective is to address the challenges in holding individuals accountable for cyber espionage, especially when these activities occur across international borders. The primary challenge includes the reluctance of states to extradite their citizens for cybercrimes committed abroad, largely due to the pervasive nature of state-sponsored cyber espionage. This recommendation acknowledges the complexity of international relations and cyber operations, where national interests often prevent the accountability of individuals involved in cyber espionage.\nDrawing on Harold Koh’s Transnational Legal Process theory, the internalization of international law into domestic law would actualize in three stages: interaction (whereby states, international organizations, legal experts and other stakeholders would begin discussions and negotiations on the creation of a multilateral treaty), interpretation (whereby these entities come together to clarify the obligations, legal enforcement mechanisms and scope of the treaties), and finally internalization (whereby signatory states adopt the treaty’s provisions into their national legal systems and establish mechanisms for prosecution).64 Koh’s theory is utilized to emphasize the importance of integrating international norms into domestic legal systems, and is particularly relevant here because it outlines a process through which international law can be internalized at the domestic level, ensuring that states not only adopt but also enforce these norms within their jurisdictions. The outlined stages underscore the necessity for coordinated international effort to address the gaps in current legal mechanisms concerning cyber espionage.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n21\nAdopting this recommendation allows for the addressing of the limitations of existing extradition treaties, which are often ineffective in the context of cyber espionage. Extradition processes are hindered by political considerations, state sovereignty concerns, and the pervasive involvement of state-sponsored actors in cyber operations. A multilateral treaty that allows for domestic prosecution within the country of origin presents a more feasible and effective solution. This approach aims to enhance accountability while respecting state sovereignty, a balance that is crucial in international law. By incorporating compulsory jurisdictional clauses, such a treaty would provide a legal framework for prosecuting cyber espionage that transcends national borders.\nThis approach also aligns with the growing consensus among legal scholars that traditional methods of international law enforcement are insufficient to tackle the complexities of cybercrime and espionage. Scholars like Asaf Lubin and Russell Buchan have discussed the limitations of current international law in addressing cyber espionage. Lubin has highlighted the challenges in achieving international consensus on extradition for cyber crimes due to the geopolitical implications of state-sponsored activities. Buchan, on the other hand, has argued for the necessity of developing new legal frameworks that can address the unique challenges posed by cyber operations. This recommendation aligns with their views by proposing a multilateral treaty as a viable alternative to the current state of affairs, offering a practical and forward-thinking solution that addresses the gaps identified by these experts.\nThus, this recommendation recognizes the limitations of current legal mechanisms and the necessity for states to collaborate in creating norms and laws that reflect the realities of the digital age. Implementing such a treaty would require a significant diplomatic effort, consensus-building, and the willingness of states to enforce these laws domestically against their citizens. It\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n22\nrepresents a forward-thinking approach to international cybersecurity, emphasizing the importance of legal frameworks in maintaining global digital security and justice.\n## Recommendation #2. Implementing International Accountability for Non-State Cyber Actors through Organizational Deterrence\nThis recommendation proposes leveraging international organizations, such as the United Nations (UN) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), to enforce accountability on non-state actors involved in cyber violations, a move beyond the traditional state-centric model of international law. This could take effect in the form of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) publicly denouncing states that support or fail to act against non-state cyber actors. The reputational damage from such denunciations can be a powerful deterrent; the UN Security Council (UNSC) passes binding resolutions that impose sanctions on states that are found to harbor or support non-state cyber actors. These sanctions could range from economic penalties to restrictions on participation in international activities; the ICJ could contribute through legal adjudication by issuing advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by the UNGA, UNSC, or other authorized international organs. Such opinions on the legality of states' actions or inactions regarding cyber activities can influence international law and state behavior. States could bring cases against other states they allege are responsible for cyber violations through support or harboring of non-state actors. A judgment against a state in such a case could lead to direct legal consequences for the state and set precedents that deter future violations. Thus, this approach suggests using public denunciation as a tool for deterrence, identifying non-state actors by their associated state, names, and other identifiable information to hold them accountable on the international stage.\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n23\nThe core of this strategy lies in the use of general deterrence, where the public calling out of these actors would lead to tangible consequences. These could include economic sanctions, arms embargoes, or even expulsion from international bodies against the states harboring or indirectly supporting such actors. The premise is that by imposing reputational damage and potential economic or political penalties, both the perpetrators and their host states would be discouraged from engaging in or condoning cyber violations due to the heightened risks of international condemnation and isolation. These have been proven effective in other contexts. For instance, UN sanctions, when well-implemented, have been used to curb behaviors like nuclear proliferation and terrorism. Although the effectiveness of sanctions and public denunciations can vary, historical evidence shows that they can lead to meaningful consequences, such as economic or political isolation of offending states. For example, the sanctions imposed by the UN on North Korea, including economic sanctions and arms embargoes, have aimed to curtail the country's nuclear ambitions by exerting pressure through international isolation and economic restrictions.65 This demonstrates how similar strategies could be applied to the realm of cyber violations.\nThis approach acknowledges the complexities and limitations of attributing cyber activities to specific actors but leverages the global community's collective power to enforce norms and maintain cyber peace. It reflects a pragmatic understanding that in the digital age, where state and non-state boundaries blur in cyber operations, traditional methods of accountability may need to be supplemented with broader, more inclusive strategies that can adapt to the dynamic and interconnected nature of global cybersecurity threats.\nHowever, the effectiveness of such measures depends on the willingness of the international community to enforce them uniformly and the ability to adapt these tools to the\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n24\ndynamic nature of cyber threats. Sanctions and public denunciations, while potentially powerful, can sometimes be circumvented or rendered ineffective by the resilience of non-state actors or the protective actions of state sponsors. Nevertheless, the proposal represents a significant step towards strengthening global cyber governance and ensuring that non-state cyber actors are held accountable on the international stage.\n## Recommendations for Canadian Domestic Law\nRecommendation #1. Establishing a National Open-Source Database for Enhanced Cyber Espionage Defence in Canada\nThis recommendation proposes the creation of a national open-source database to list foreign entities known to have targeted Canada through cyber espionage. This initiative would mirror the approach used by Public Safety Canada for terrorist entities, including details such as the reasoning for their listing, dates of listing, and review dates.⁶⁶ The aim is to enable non-governmental entities, including businesses and organizations, to better protect themselves against foreign cyber threats by: avoiding collaboration with listed entities; exercising increased caution when dealing with businesses associated with these entities; and utilizing general Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) for heightened cybersecurity vigilance.\nThis database allows for the addressing of the existing gaps in Canada’s cybersecurity defences by shifting from a reactive to a proactive stance against cyber threats. Currently, non-state actors often lack the necessary information to adequately protect themselves against sophisticated cyber threats. By making detailed information about known cyber threat actors publicly accessible, the database empowers businesses and organizations to take preventive measures, reducing their vulnerability to espionage. This approach not only enhances the overall\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n25\ncybersecurity posture of non-state actors but also alleviates the burden on government resources, allowing them to focus on more complex or high-level threats.\nDespite challenges such as the adaptability of threat actors, who may change names or methods to evade detection, and the need for regular updates and maintenance, the database represents a shift towards a proactive defence strategy, essential in the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber threats. Publicly listing entities involved in cyber espionage would act as a deterrent, signaling Canada's intolerance of such activities. Additionally, the database would establish a legal basis for prosecuting cyber espionage and disrupt the operations of listed entities by discouraging Canadian businesses from engaging with them, making this approach a robust solution to the challenges posed by cyber espionage.\n## Recommendation #2. Strengthening Cybersecurity Through Legislative Mandates: A Proposal for Enhanced Data Protection in Canada\nThis recommendation urges the adoption of stringent legislative measures in Canada to compel organizations to implement robust cybersecurity practices, particularly those handling sensitive data across sectors such as government, research, and healthcare. Given the provinces' constitutional jurisdiction over property and civil rights as outlined in sections 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, this approach allows legislation to be finely tailored to the specific needs and conditions of each region, addressing local differences effectively, particularly in diverse sectors.\nDrawing on insights from legal experts with a background in cybersecurity, there is a consensus on the necessity for more specific Information Technology (IT) and data protection regulations. Despite the expectation for organizations to maintain high standards of privacy and security, gaps and inconsistencies in their cybersecurity measures are evident, underscoring the\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n26\nneed for enforceable legal standards.⁶⁸ For instance, the Capital One Data Breach of 2019, which exposed the data of over 100 million Capital One customers in the U.S. and 6 million in Canada, was a direct result of a misconfigured web application firewall.⁶⁹ This incident shows how a hacker could exploit such a vulnerability to access customer data stored on a cloud server. Similarly, the 2019 Desjardins Group Data Leak, affecting 4.2 million members of the Quebec-based credit union, was caused by an insider threat, leaking sensitive information including names, addresses, birthdates, and social insurance numbers.⁷⁰ These examples underscore the critical need for regulations that not only mandate regular security assessments of cloud environments and configurations but also emphasize internal security measures, access controls, and employee training to detect and prevent insider threats.\nThis proposal calls for the enactment of provincial laws that mandate organizations to periodically update their cybersecurity protocols to thwart unauthorized access by third parties, potentially jeopardizing their data integrity. This approach is bolstered by the aforementioned examples, which despite substantial investment in data protection, have experienced significant breaches. These instances highlight the pervasive challenge of cybersecurity and the inadequacy of voluntary compliance in safeguarding against data breaches.\nBy instituting specific legal requirements for cybersecurity, the recommendation aims to create a uniform baseline of security measures that all organizations must meet, thereby reducing the likelihood of opportunistic cyberattacks exploiting systemic vulnerabilities. While acknowledging that no legislative measure can entirely eliminate the risk of targeted cyberattacks, the proposed laws are intended to significantly reduce the incidence of such breaches by mandating proactive security measures. In effect, this legal mandate would serve as a deterrent against potential attackers while ensuring that organizations are held accountable for\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n27\nthe protection of sensitive data, thereby enhancing the overall cybersecurity posture of Canadian entities. Moreover, considering cybersecurity’s overlap with both telecommunications (federal jurisdiction) and property rights (provincial jurisdiction), a coordinated effort between federal and provincial governments is essential to cover all aspects of cybersecurity effectively. This layered approach could mitigate the risk of cyberattacks by ensuring no aspect of cybersecurity is overlooked due to jurisdictional limitations.\n## Recommendation #3. Implementing a Structured Active Cyber Defence Framework for Canada: A Strategy for Empowering Private Entities\nThis recommendation advocates for Canada to adopt a legislative approach akin to the U.S.’ ACDC Act, allowing specified private entities to engage in Active Cyber Defense (ACD) activities against cyber threats. The rationale behind this suggestion is to enhance the cybersecurity posture of Canadian organizations by legalizing certain proactive defence measures that enable them to deter, detect, and respond to malicious cyber activities effectively. The emphasis on stricter cybersecurity laws is to mitigate the risks of opportunistic cyber attacks that exploit security vulnerabilities, while also acknowledging that even the most robust security measures may not fully prevent targeted cyber espionage or attacks.\nBy selecting specific private entities for conducting ACD, the recommendation aims to create a controlled environment where such activities are regulated and monitored to prevent abuse or unintended consequences. This approach seeks to strike a balance between empowering organizations to defend themselves and ensuring that such measures do not cross ethical or legal boundaries, potentially causing harm to innocent parties or escalating cyber conflicts. Essential to this approach is the establishment of clear limits and parameters for entities eligible to conduct\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n28\nACD, including criteria such as cybersecurity maturity, certification and accreditation, purpose and proportionality of actions, oversight and reporting obligations, legal and ethical training, collaboration with law enforcement, liability and accountability, and mechanisms for revocation of authorization if needed.\nAs cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated, relying solely on passive defence measures is no longer sufficient. The ACDC Act in the U.S. has been proposed as a means to empower private entities to defend themselves more aggressively against cyberattacks. This Canadian adaptation would similarly provide organizations with the legal tools to protect their networks proactively, potentially reducing the incidence of successful cyber intrusions. The case of Shawn Carpenter, as discussed earlier, highlights the practical benefits of such an approach. Carpenter, a cybersecurity analyst, used his employer's resources to trace a cyber intrusion back to its source, which led to the identification of hackers working for a foreign government. Despite his success, Carpenter was fired for unauthorized use of company resources, illustrating the need for legal protection for individuals who take proactive measures to defend their organizations. This case highlights how individuals or entities, when given the legal authority and proper oversight, can contribute to national cyber defence efforts without resorting to vigilantism or exceeding their legal rights. Thus, by providing a legal framework for ACD, this recommendation would encourage cybersecurity professionals to engage in necessary defence actions without fear of job loss or legal repercussions, thereby contributing to broader national security efforts.\nIncorporating these guidelines ensures that the empowered entities act within a framework that safeguards against misuse while enabling effective defence against cyber threats. Thus, this recommendation proposes a structured legal mechanism for Canada to enable selected\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n29\nprivate entities to actively participate in cyber defence, drawing inspiration from the U.S. experience to tailor a system that accommodates Canadian legal and ethical standards. This approach aims to enhance the overall resilience of Canada’s cyber infrastructure by incorporating the capabilities and resources of the private sector into the national cyber defence strategy, under a framework that ensures accountability, legality, and proportionality of actions, fostering a more secure digital environment for Canada.\nThe strength of such a legislation lies in its ability to empower private entities to take a more active role in cybersecurity, filling a critical gap in Canada’s current defence strategy. Challenges such as the risk of escalating cyber conflicts or potential legal and ethical violations must be carefully managed. Concerns about mistaken attribution and the risk of targeting innocent third parties or nation-states, with serious geopolitical consequences, have been raised. Nevertheless, adopting this recommendation provides a structured and regulated approach to active cyber defence, ensuring actions are taken within a legal and ethical framework. By learning from the U.S. experience, Canada can develop a system that aligns with its own legal standards, ultimately strengthening the resilience of its cyber infrastructure. This approach strikes a critical balance between proactive defence and the need for accountability, legality, and proportionality, making it a progressive step in protecting Canada’s digital landscape.\n## Part V. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the assessment of legal frameworks in both Canada and the U.S. reveals the complexities and challenges associated with combating cyber espionage. While international law lays the foundation for addressing cyber threats, its limitations become apparent when attempting to prosecute foreign entities for domestic attacks, as seen in Doe.71 Both Canada and the U.S. have specific legislation to combat cyber espionage, but avenues for prosecution are\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n30\noften hampered by international law and extradition challenges. Notably, the U.S. has taken a more proactive approach by implementing the Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act to clarify and legalize certain cybersecurity practices, encouraging private sector involvement in responding to threats. Canada, on the other hand, has yet to implement similar direct legal avenues for non-governmental responses, relying more on protective measures and recommendations for non-state entities. The use of immigration law as a deterrent against cyber threats is a shared approach between both countries, as demonstrated in cases such as China Mobile, Geng, and Yihdego.72 Both Canada and the U.S. actively address cybersecurity challenges through legal mechanisms, though differences exist in their frameworks, responses to private sector involvement, and the utilization of immigration law. Proposing improvements to the legal frameworks, the paper suggests recommendations for both international and Canadian domestic laws. For international law, the creation of a multilateral treaty enforcing anti-cyber espionage laws into domestic law is proposed, providing a higher level of accountability. Additionally, the suggestion to engage international organizations in enforcing accountability upon non-state cyber actors broadens the scope of responsibility mechanisms, enriching the traditional state-centric model without directly contesting it. For Canadian domestic law, recommendations include the creation of a national open-source database to track foreign entities involved in cyber espionage, enhancing non-governmental entities’ ability to protect themselves. Mandating specific laws to ensure organizations implement stricter cybersecurity measures and designating selected private entities to conduct Active Cyber Defence against threat actors would bolster Canada’s cybersecurity defences. Addressing the evolving threat landscape of cyber espionage requires a multifaceted approach involving international collaboration, legal advances, and proactive measures at the national level. Implementing these recommendations can contribute to a more\nCanadian Law Review | Volume 3\n31\nrobust legal framework, better protecting Canada’s national security interests in the face of growing cyber threats.\n1.

    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n3\n\n# Introduction\n\nCybercrime in Canada results in more than $3 billion in economic losses each year, which makes it the leading cause of wealth transfer to foreign states.¹ This threat is compounded by cyber espionage seeking to obtain sensitive and financial data, potentially harming civilians, Canadian economic interests, and national security. For instance, China’s espionage efforts to identify potential dissidents, including human rights activists, may expose these individuals to physical danger when they return to their own countries. This danger could manifest in various forms, such as anonymous cyber attacks, as demonstrated by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) conducting espionage against Canadian citizen Omar Said.²\n\nThis paper examines the legal frameworks in Canada and the United States (U.S.) for addressing cyber espionage, highlighting the current lack of international focus on the issue. It aims to enhance Canada’s capacity to fight and prosecute cyber espionage threats in both public and private sectors, offering recommendations to improve Canada’s legal framework to bolster the country’s defence against these threats. Part I provides an overview of cyber espionage and its significance within cyberspace. Part II examines the legal frameworks in both Canada and the U.S., including relevant case law. Part III assesses the distinctions between Canadian and U.S. cybersecurity laws, focusing on their application to cyber espionage. Finally, Part IV offers recommendations for improving Canada’s legal framework.\n\n# Part I. Cyber Espionage Defined and Explored\n\n## Cyber Espionage: A Definition\n\nThere is no universally accepted definition of cyber espionage, a fact that complicates both its legal interpretation and international regulation. The Federal Court of Appeal, in the case of *Qu v Canada* defined it as “surreptitious or covert information gathering”.³ Meanwhile,",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n4\n\nexperts like Herb Lin, a prominent computer scientist, define it as intentional efforts to infiltrate computer systems or networks to access stored or transitioning information.⁴ Russell Buchan, a Professor of International Law, further refines this by describing it as ‘non-consensual copying of confidential information that is resident in or transiting through cyberspace.’⁵ These varied definitions highlight the fluidity and complexity of the term, distinguishing it from cyberwarfare, which targets disruption rather than mere intelligence gathering.⁶ The lack of consensus on a definition reflects the diverse motivations and actors involved in cyber espionage, ranging from state to non-state actors, and underscores the challenge of creating a unified legal and operational framework to discuss such activities.\n\n## Purpose and Actors\n\nCyber espionage serves two primary objectives: political and economic. Political espionage comprises the unauthorized access to military, potential commercial or other secret information, compromising a state’s ability to safeguard itself and its citizens from foreign threats.⁷ Economic espionage entails the illicit acquisition of trade secrets crucial for a nation’s financial success, thus threatening the economic stability of the state.⁸ Each type of espionage carries specific legal consequences, which vary based on whether the espionage was conducted for political or economic reasons.\n\nThe primary foreign threat actors originate from China and Russia with the primary targets of cyber espionage being the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom.⁹ Many of these target states engage in cyber espionage themselves. For example, the U.S. has faced accusations of conducting cyber espionage in foreign states, as revealed by information disclosed by whistleblower Edward Snowden.¹⁰ This highlights a prevalent lack of accountability that both",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n5\n\nWestern and non-Western countries aim to maintain. The perpetrators of cyber espionage can be divided between state actors¹¹ and non-state actors, which include private individuals, criminal organizations, and others.¹² This distinction becomes blurred when considering state-sponsored actors, who are non-state entities conducting cyber espionage operations on behalf of their government.¹³\n\nThe perpetrators of cyber espionage target both the public and private sectors. Currently, there has been a noticeable shift in Canada from cyber espionage targeting the public sector, which benefits from the government’s substantial cybersecurity infrastructure, to espionage aimed at the private sector. This shift underscores the critical need to address threats targeting the private sector.¹⁴ According to a report by New Zealand’s National Cyber Security Centre, financial motivation surpasses state-sponsored activity.¹⁵ Therefore, economic cyber espionage is one of the primary concerns within the cyber arena.\n\nCanada and the U.S. have established specific legal frameworks to address and penalize cyber espionage activities. In Canada, economic espionage is deemed an indictable offence under section 19 of the Security of Information Act (SOIA).¹⁶ Anyone found guilty of violating subsection 19(1) faces a penalty of imprisonment for up to 10 years.¹⁷ This law applies to cyber-related activities where confidential economic information is illicitly obtained. In the U.S., the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 serves to criminalize economic espionage activities. According to this Act, economic espionage includes actions where an individual intentionally commits an offence that benefits any foreign government, instrumentality, or agent. The Act specifies offences including the unauthorized theft or acquisition of trade secrets through fraudulent means, the unauthorized copying or conveyance of trade secrets, and the unauthorized",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n6\n\npossession, receipt, or purchase of trade secrets knowing them to have been stolen or obtained without authorization.¹⁸\n\n## Importance of Addressing Cyber Espionage\n\nChallenges in attribution and the absence of comprehensive international legal frameworks or extradition treaties significantly undermine the effectiveness of current domestic laws in Canada and the U.S. in combating cyber espionage. These difficulties are compounded by the state-centric nature of international law, which tends to hold foreign states accountable for actions by private entities within their territory. This leads to a significant disconnect in holding the actual perpetrators (defendants) accountable to the victims (appellants) due to the following reasons:\n\n1) Attribution Errors\n\nIdentifying the precise origins of cyber espionage activities is notoriously difficult. Cyber attackers often use sophisticated techniques to mask their locations and identities, making it challenging for victim states to accurately attribute cyber attacks to specific actors or states. This ambiguity hinders the ability to levy charges or sanctions against the responsible parties.\n\n2) Lack of International Legal Agreements or Extradition Treaties\n\nThe absence of universally accepted international legal agreements or extradition treaties that specifically address cyber espionage exacerbates the problem. Without these agreements, even when attribution is possible, legal mechanisms to pursue or prosecute individuals or entities across borders are limited or non-existent.\n\n3) State-Centric Model of International Law\n\nThe prevailing model of international law focuses on the responsibilities and rights of states rather than individuals or non-state actors. When cyber espionage is conducted",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n7\n\nwithin a state’s jurisdiction, that state is held responsible, creating a situation where the state can deny involvement or blame non-state actors, thus avoiding direct accountability.\n\n## 4) Perpetuated Lack of Accountability\n\nThere is an implicit global agreement among states, driven by their own involvement in cyber espionage, to maintain this status quo. This tacit understanding further dilutes the incentive for states to develop stringent international norms or laws against cyber espionage, as doing so could implicate their own activities.\n\nThese factors collectively lead to a cycle of unaccountability, where states can easily absolve themselves of blame, and victims have limited recourse through domestic or international legal systems. To protect Canadian interests effectively, there is a need for a dual approach that involves strengthening domestic legal frameworks to better protect against cyber espionage and advocating for the development of international norms and agreements that address the unique challenges of cyberspace, including better mechanisms for attribution, accountability, and cross-border cooperation. This comprehensive strategy would not only enhance Canada’s defensive capabilities but also contribute to the global effort to establish a more secure and accountable cyber environment.\n\n## Part II. Description of Law\n\n### International Law Framework\n\nThe “use of force” doctrine dictated by Article 2(4) of the UN Charter states that “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”.¹⁹ However, in the cyber realm, it remains unclear",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n8\n\nwhen a cyberintrusion amounts to use of force under this Article.²⁰ Cyber espionage alone may not constitute a wrongful act triggering state responsibility under international law. In fact, some scholars would argue that state practice conducting espionage towards foreign states has created a norm that this does not violate state sovereignty.²¹ For instance, the original drafters of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 proposed that “because cyber espionage involves the collection of confidential information and does not therefore produce destructive effects either offline or online, [...] does not qualify as an infringement of the victim state’s territorial sovereignty”.²² However, Russell Buchan argues that acts of political and economic cyber espionage that ‘penetrate computer networks and systems supported by cyber infrastructure situated within the territory of another state [emphasis added] constitute a violation of that state’s territorial sovereignty, irrespective of whether that operation causes damage or harm.’²³ In line with Buchan, suppose an individual walks into your house for the purposes of looking around at midnight while you are unaware, and with your explicit prohibition of any visitors at any time. Would you consider their entry to be a visit or an intrusion into your property? Would that individual have had to cause harm to property or person for you to call the police? The application of force offers limited utility because cyber espionage, considered a breach of international law similar to an intrusion, lacks a coercive element that would provoke a violent response.²⁴\n\nThere are scenarios where cyber espionage could be considered a violation of international law without requiring the use of force against another state but rather due to the impact that espionage poses on individuals and companies. The principle of non-intervention is considered a part of customary international law as per the International Court of Justice’s ruling in Nicaragua v US 1986,²⁵ in which the court stated:",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n\nThe principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference; though examples of trespass against this principle are not infrequent, the Court considers that it is part and parcel of customary international law. A prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones.\n\nThus, as per Nicaragua, the principle of non-intervention is breached when there is coercive interference with matters falling within a State’s domaine réservé.²⁶ This principle underscores that coercion does not necessarily involve the use of force.²⁷ In fact, a coercive interference is characterized by actions designed to strip a state of its decision-making freedom²⁸ and compel it to act against its will.²⁹ Despite debates around the applicability of this principle to cyber espionage—arguing it falls outside the purview of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) due to the “clean hands doctrine” where states might be equally culpable—the ICJ has clarified it seldom dismisses cases on this basis without substantial justification.³⁰ It did so in Certain Iranian Assets, stating that “the ICJ has never upheld an objection based on the ‘clean hands’ doctrine” and indeed will not do so unless presented with a compelling reason.³¹\n\nThe ineffectiveness of domestic law in Canada and other signatory states to the International Convention on Cybercrime is evident when applied to foreign actors, primarily due to challenges in attribution and extradition. While Canada commits to criminalizing acts like cyber theft domestically, acknowledging the significant harm data theft poses, these efforts falter when addressing the state-sponsored threats that dominate the cyber espionage arena.³² For instance, within Canada specifically, everyone who fraudulently and without color of right uses a computer service or system “is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.”³³",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n10\n\nThis convention could be expanded to include cyber espionage due to the harm posed both politically and economically. However, since state-sponsored threats dominate the cyber espionage arena, states are often unwilling to extradite their nationals and reluctant to enforce extradition agreements with one another, which complicates the prosecution of foreign entities. The Cybercrime Convention attempts to address this by suggesting that states should prosecute at the behest of another state if extradition is refused on specific grounds, yet this recommendation highlights a significant gap in international law’s capacity to tackle cross-border cyber crimes.³⁴ This gap underscores the urgent need for a more cohesive international framework to address these challenges.\n\n## Canadian Cybersecurity Framework\n\nThe Canadian cybersecurity framework represents a comprehensive approach to addressing the rising tide of cyber threats, particularly in the wake of increased technological adoption and the global pandemic. Canada’s prominence in academic research and economic development has rendered it a prime target for cyber espionage, including both political and economic espionage. With the rise in technological use and transnational interactions due to Covid-19, Microsoft noted that Canada was targeted with 35% more attacks in 2020 than 2019 and was the third most targeted country for Covid-19 related data.³⁵\n\nDespite significant international collaboration in identifying state-sponsored hackers, and efforts to bolster cybersecurity, the legal capacity to address cyber threats remains largely in the hands of governments. The collaboration between Canada, the U.S., and the United Kingdom in calling out state-sponsored hackers, such as APT29 (also known as ‘the Dukes’ or ‘Cozy Bear’) for their attempts to steal COVID-19 vaccine research exemplifies the proactive stance taken by",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n11\n\nthese nations.³⁶ Following this, the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security – part of the Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSE) – issued strong recommendations for organizations, specifically health-related ones, to enhance their cyber security and better identify cyber threats.³⁷ They outlined specific Indicators of Compromise (IOC) that organizations should look out for when dealing with such issues.³⁸ While these efforts focus on strengthening defences through cybersecurity frameworks like the ATT&amp;CK Matrix³⁹ and the Cyber Kill Chain,⁴⁰ the emphasis on legal actions against perpetrators remains limited, highlighting the reliance on government intervention.\n\nThe increase in cyber espionage against private actors underscores the limited legal tools available to these entities to address such threats. Although violations of the law are prosecuted by the government, and protective measures are disseminated through Canadian agencies, private actors do not legally possess the tools to address these threats.⁴¹ This does not mean, however, that there are no avenues for private actors to pursue threat actors that have attacked them. In fact, in 2020, the CSE, acknowledged the commercial availability of advanced cyber tools, indicating a shift towards empowering the private sector in cyber defence.⁴²\n\nHowever, the lack of specific legislation governing the private sector's involvement in tracking and responding to foreign espionage activities leaves a significant gap in Canada's cybersecurity strategy.⁴³ The concept of Active Cyber Defence (ACD), defined as a non-governmental response to cyber threats that has effects outside the defender's own network,⁴⁴ highlights the emerging debate on how private entities can and should respond to cyber threats.\n\nCanada's legal framework grants significant authority to government agencies in addressing cyber espionage, but the effectiveness of these measures is limited by international challenges. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has the authority to identify and",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n12\n\nprosecute cyber espionage under section 12.1 of the CSIS Act, which allows for ‘reasonable and proportionate’ measures to reduce threats to national security.⁴⁵ Additionally, the SOIA under section 19 criminalizes economic espionage, with severe penalties, though its deterrence is limited by the difficulty in prosecuting foreign actors.⁴⁶ There is an implicit delineation between the legal prosecution of political cyber espionage and economic cyber espionage, whereby CSIS deals with the former, focusing on threats to national security, while the Cyber Centre in Canada deals with the latter. While the penalty is significant, its deterrent effect is limited, as the majority of such acts are perpetrated by foreign actors who remain virtually immune from extradition and prosecution due to the complexities of international law. This underscores the challenges discussed earlier regarding the limitations of the current international legal framework in effectively addressing cross-border cyber espionage.\n\nTo understand how Canada’s legal frameworks counter potential foreign threats related to cyber espionage, this paper will analyze three pivotal cases. These cases demonstrate the application of legal mechanisms, particularly in business and immigration law, to prevent entities and individuals associated with or suspected of cyber espionage from conducting business or entering Canada. Each case offers insight into legal methods and considerations applied when addressing cyber espionage to strike a balance between national security interests and individual rights. Case 1 outlines the legal method pursued when businesses pose the threat of conducting or facilitating cyber espionage. Case 2 outlines the legal method and factors that are accounted for when individuals are being considered for entry into Canada in relation to cyber espionage concerns. Case 3 outlines concerns with inadmissibility of foreign actors fearing persecution.",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n13\n\nCase 1: China Mobile Communications Group Co Ltd v Canada (Attorney General) (2021)⁴⁷\n\nThe applicants, China Mobile Communications Group Co., Ltd., China Mobile International (Canada) Inc., and China Mobile International (UK) Limited, sought to stay an order under the Investment Canada Act, requiring China Mobile to divest its interest in its Canadian business, CMI Canada, due to identified national security risks pertaining to cyber espionage.⁴⁸ The Federal Court denied the applicants’ motion for a stay. The court stated that it had notable concerns about CMI Canada’s potential facilitation of espionage and foreign interference activities by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) based on sufficient evidence provided by the respondents, which included reports from the CSE and CSIS, indicating the PRC’s involvement in cyber threats. Thus, the court concluded that the public interest harms outweighed the potential harm to the applicants. Stated differently, the public harms associated with the PRC’s opportunity to use its indirect control over CMI Canada to facilitate espionage and foreign interference activities in Canada were significantly greater than the harm that the applicants established they would suffer if the stay was not granted.\n\nCase 2: Geng v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023⁴⁹\n\nLiping Geng challenged the decision of an Immigration Officer to refuse his application for permanent residence under the Family Class, rendering him inadmissible under paragraph 34(1)(f) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The Security Screening Branch/CSIS and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)/National Security Screening Division (NSSD) raised concerns about Geng’s employment at the Luoyang Foreign Languages Institute (LFLI) and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) being linked to espionage activities. Geng had a Canadian wife and daughter, frequently traveled between Canada and China, and maintained that he did not hold a military rank.",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n14\n\nThe Federal Court found in favor of Mr. Geng in this immigration case, concluding that the Immigration Officer’s decision to deny admission to the 68-year-old retired language professor was unreasonable and lacked justification, transparency, and intelligibility. The court emphasized the severe consequences of the decision on the applicant, who had been previously admitted to Canada multiple times, including obtaining citizenship.\n\nCase 3: Yihdego v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2020⁵⁰\n\nMr. Abel Nahusenay Yihdego, a citizen of Ethiopia, sought refugee protection in Canada, claiming persecution by his previous employer, the Information Network Security Agency (INSA), due to his refusal to join its decryption department, which was allegedly engaged in espionage. The Immigration Division (ID) found Mr. Yihdego inadmissible to Canada for being associated with an organization believed to engage in espionage against Canada’s interests. The decision by the ID was subjected to judicial review by the Federal Court, where the court rules in favor of Mr. Yihdego, deeming the ID’s decision unreasonable. The court held that the ID erred in considering Charter values in defining “Canada’s interests” and questioned the rationale behind concluding that espionage against a Canadian ally was against Canada’s interests. The judgment allowed Mr. Yihdego’s application for judicial review, sending the matter back to another panel of the ID for reconsideration. The court also proposed a question of general importance related to the inadmissibility of a person to Canada under specific circumstances outlined in the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act*.\n\nIn these cases, legal mechanisms were instrumental in addressing potential foreign threats by scrutinizing business activities and immigration applications, preventing individuals and entities linked to cyber espionage from operating within Canada.",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n15\n\n# U.S. Cybersecurity Framework\n\nThe U.S., Canada's largest economic and trading partner, is at the forefront of efforts to address international aspects of cyber security.^[51]^ This stems from its private and public sector being the target of cyber espionage attacks – both political and economic – from various foreign actors. According to General Keith B. Alexander, head of the U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, these cyber \"attacks have resulted in the 'greatest transfer of wealth in history'.\"^[52]^\n\nThe U.S. Cyber Command was created to use information and communications technology (ICT) and the internet as weapons to defend the Defense Department.^[53]^ In 2011, their international cyber defense strategy entailed \"all necessary means consistent with International Law used to respond to hostile cyberspace acts\".^[54]^ The U.S.'s approach to cybersecurity was further enhanced by the introduction of the Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act (ACDC Act), a bill proposed by U.S. Congressman Tom Graves. This legislation aims to legalize certain cyber security practices or, at least, clarify their legality. This bill responded to demands for the legalization of more aggressive measures in order to allow victims of cyber intrusions to defend themselves against malicious actors.^[55]^ This less than comprehensive legislation allows individuals who have sought non-legal (i.e. ACD) methods of tracking attackers to not be penalized, and obtain support from government organizations for advancing national security.\n\nAn example of the complexities in cybersecurity law is the case of Shawn Carpenter, a cybersecurity analyst who used his company's data to trace a \"hack\" server in China and provided the information to the FBI in 2003.^[56]^ Although Carpenter was fired for violating company policies, he successfully sued for wrongful termination and won.^[57]^ This incident",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n16\n\ndemonstrates the double-edged sword that cyberspace creates with uncertainty concerning which laws take precedence over others for the purposes of national security against foreign threats.\n\nEven when the U.S. has identified foreign individuals conducting cyber espionage activities within their national systems, they are unable to prosecute them due to the lack of agreements within extradition treaties. For instance, in 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice publicly charged five Chinese nationals for engaging in corporate espionage against U.S. corporations.^[58]^ Most of the accused were part of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. However, under the terms of the U.S.- Hong Kong Extradition Treaty,\n\nChina can refuse to extradite a person within its borders if “surrender implicates the defense, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy of the People’s Republic of China,”\n\nwhich renders prosecution of these accused impossible. This is despite the fact that Chinese actors have conducted approximately 39 cyber espionage operations within the U.S. between 2003 and 2013, with an annual estimated loss of $600 billion revenue of the U.S.^[59]^\n\nLegal mechanisms also exist under immigration law to prevent potential foreign threats from enacting businesses or entering the U.S. for the purposes of cyber espionage. The case below underscores the challenges in prosecuting foreign entities for cyber espionage activities, especially when the alleged actions span multiple jurisdictions, highlighting the complex interplay between national security, international law, and the limitations of domestic legal systems in addressing transnational cyber threats.",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n17\n\nCase 1: John DOE, also known as Kidane, Appellant v The FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA, Appellee⁶⁰\n\nIn 2017, the appellant, John Doe, using the pseudonym “Kidane,” claimed that he was deceived into downloading a computer program that allowed the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia to spy on him from abroad. Kidane wanted to sue Ethiopia, but foreign states are generally immune from lawsuits unless an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) applies. Kidane invoked the FSIA’s exception for noncommercial torts, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that this exception only applies to torts that occur entirely within the U.S. Since Kidane alleged a transnational tort, the court affirmed the district court’s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The case involved claims under the Wiretap Act and the Maryland common law tort of intrusion upon seclusion, both of which were dismissed by the district court. The court’s decision was based on the premise that the entire tort, including the alleged spying, did not occur solely within the U.S.\n\nThus, legal principles, such as those outlined in the FSIA, play a crucial role in addressing these concerns. FSIA typically provides foreign states with immunity from lawsuits in domestic courts, except under specific exceptions.\n\nPart III. Assessment of Law\n\nInternational law, while fruitful in creating an area for non-state entities to combat cyber espionage attacks, remains ineffective in prosecuting foreign entities for domestic attacks within both Canada and the U.S. As seen in Doe, domestic law cannot apply to prosecute foreign governments regardless of evidence of attribution.⁶¹ Within Canada, even while tracing espionage activities to a Russian state-sponsored group, APT29, Canada was unable to achieve prosecution, but rather highlighted cybersecurity measures that Canadian organizations can",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n18\n\nutilize to protect themselves against such attacks. Further to this point, while both Canada and the U.S. have specific legislation to prosecute violations of cyber espionage, the avenues are prohibited as per international law. For instance, section 19 of the SOIA prohibits economic espionage, while CSIS possesses the authority to identify and prosecute violations of cyber espionage, but neither can adequately protect against foreign actors due to the lack of extradition treaties. On the other hand, despite the U.S. having actively pursued legal actions against foreign individuals engaging in cyber espionage, difficulties in prosecution arise due to extradition treaties, as seen in the example of the U.S.-Hong Kong Extradition Treaty. Thus, states are required to opt for security measures due to lack of extradition treaties governing attribution of cyber espionage due to states' unwillingness to create such treaties as a result of their own involvement in cyber espionage activities.\n\nA comparison of Canadian and the U.S. legal frameworks reveals their distinct approaches to cyber espionage. While the U.S. has actively addressed cybersecurity threats both in the public and private sectors, Canada has yet to implement direct legal avenues. The U.S. has established and implemented legislation like the ACDC Act to legalize certain cybersecurity practices to clarify the measures that targeted private organizations are able to pursue, while Canada has yet to do so. Canada has, however, increased protective measures and actively engaged in providing recommendations to non-state entities to enhance their cybersecurity frameworks. This demonstrates the initiative taken by the U.S. to engage the private sector in responding to threats more aggressively. Canada has not yet initiated the legalization of a non-governmental response to cyber threats, which may result in the overburdening of the criminal justice system in addressing the increased espionage threats to state and non-state actors.",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n19\n\nHowever, Canadian Immigration Law does mitigate threats of cyber espionage by refusing to permit foreign individuals and/or foreign organizations who may be involved in espionage to continue their activities domestically. This can be seen in *China Mobile* 62 where the organization was divested on the basis of it working under the PRC to conduct cyber espionage operations that threaten national security. These laws, though, are subject to rigorous legal scrutiny as seen in the case of *Yihdego* and *Geng* which ruled in favor of the appellants on the basis that the Immigration Division was unreasonable in their ruling of their association with organizations that operated to conduct cyber espionage.63 Similarly, the U.S. also frequently dismisses individuals under section 212 of the *Immigration and Nationality Act* due to suspicion of espionage, subversion or threat activities to national security.\n\nThus, both Canada and the U.S. actively address cybersecurity challenges, but there are notable differences in their legal frameworks, responses to private sector involvement, and the use of immigration law as a deterrent against cyber threats.\n\n## Part IV. Proposition for Legal Frameworks\n\nThe evaluation of international, Canadian and U.S. legal frameworks suggests recommendations for the improvement of international and Canadian frameworks for the purpose of enhancing Canada's national security. While the U.S. legal framework may have imperfections of its own, that is not covered within the scope of this paper.\n\n## Recommendations for International Law\n\nThe issue in international law resides not within the rules that it adopts, but rather in its ability to implement and enforce these principles. Considering this, a unique legal framework for cyber espionage, akin to international human rights or environmental law, could be established for more realistic prosecution measures.",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n20\n\nRecommendation #1. Establishing a Multilateral Treaty for Domestic Enforcement of Anti-Cyber Espionage Laws\n\nThis recommendation proposes the creation of a multilateral treaty that would allow for the domestic enforcement of anti-cyber espionage laws. The primary objective is to address the challenges in holding individuals accountable for cyber espionage, especially when these activities occur across international borders. The primary challenge includes the reluctance of states to extradite their citizens for cybercrimes committed abroad, largely due to the pervasive nature of state-sponsored cyber espionage. This recommendation acknowledges the complexity of international relations and cyber operations, where national interests often prevent the accountability of individuals involved in cyber espionage.\n\nDrawing on Harold Koh’s Transnational Legal Process theory, the internalization of international law into domestic law would actualize in three stages: interaction (whereby states, international organizations, legal experts and other stakeholders would begin discussions and negotiations on the creation of a multilateral treaty), interpretation (whereby these entities come together to clarify the obligations, legal enforcement mechanisms and scope of the treaties), and finally internalization (whereby signatory states adopt the treaty’s provisions into their national legal systems and establish mechanisms for prosecution).64 Koh’s theory is utilized to emphasize the importance of integrating international norms into domestic legal systems, and is particularly relevant here because it outlines a process through which international law can be internalized at the domestic level, ensuring that states not only adopt but also enforce these norms within their jurisdictions. The outlined stages underscore the necessity for coordinated international effort to address the gaps in current legal mechanisms concerning cyber espionage.",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n21\n\nAdopting this recommendation allows for the addressing of the limitations of existing extradition treaties, which are often ineffective in the context of cyber espionage. Extradition processes are hindered by political considerations, state sovereignty concerns, and the pervasive involvement of state-sponsored actors in cyber operations. A multilateral treaty that allows for domestic prosecution within the country of origin presents a more feasible and effective solution. This approach aims to enhance accountability while respecting state sovereignty, a balance that is crucial in international law. By incorporating compulsory jurisdictional clauses, such a treaty would provide a legal framework for prosecuting cyber espionage that transcends national borders.\n\nThis approach also aligns with the growing consensus among legal scholars that traditional methods of international law enforcement are insufficient to tackle the complexities of cybercrime and espionage. Scholars like Asaf Lubin and Russell Buchan have discussed the limitations of current international law in addressing cyber espionage. Lubin has highlighted the challenges in achieving international consensus on extradition for cyber crimes due to the geopolitical implications of state-sponsored activities. Buchan, on the other hand, has argued for the necessity of developing new legal frameworks that can address the unique challenges posed by cyber operations. This recommendation aligns with their views by proposing a multilateral treaty as a viable alternative to the current state of affairs, offering a practical and forward-thinking solution that addresses the gaps identified by these experts.\n\nThus, this recommendation recognizes the limitations of current legal mechanisms and the necessity for states to collaborate in creating norms and laws that reflect the realities of the digital age. Implementing such a treaty would require a significant diplomatic effort, consensus-building, and the willingness of states to enforce these laws domestically against their citizens. It",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n22\n\nrepresents a forward-thinking approach to international cybersecurity, emphasizing the importance of legal frameworks in maintaining global digital security and justice.\n\n## Recommendation #2. Implementing International Accountability for Non-State Cyber Actors through Organizational Deterrence\n\nThis recommendation proposes leveraging international organizations, such as the United Nations (UN) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), to enforce accountability on non-state actors involved in cyber violations, a move beyond the traditional state-centric model of international law. This could take effect in the form of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) publicly denouncing states that support or fail to act against non-state cyber actors. The reputational damage from such denunciations can be a powerful deterrent; the UN Security Council (UNSC) passes binding resolutions that impose sanctions on states that are found to harbor or support non-state cyber actors. These sanctions could range from economic penalties to restrictions on participation in international activities; the ICJ could contribute through legal adjudication by issuing advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by the UNGA, UNSC, or other authorized international organs. Such opinions on the legality of states' actions or inactions regarding cyber activities can influence international law and state behavior. States could bring cases against other states they allege are responsible for cyber violations through support or harboring of non-state actors. A judgment against a state in such a case could lead to direct legal consequences for the state and set precedents that deter future violations. Thus, this approach suggests using public denunciation as a tool for deterrence, identifying non-state actors by their associated state, names, and other identifiable information to hold them accountable on the international stage.",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n23\n\nThe core of this strategy lies in the use of general deterrence, where the public calling out of these actors would lead to tangible consequences. These could include economic sanctions, arms embargoes, or even expulsion from international bodies against the states harboring or indirectly supporting such actors. The premise is that by imposing reputational damage and potential economic or political penalties, both the perpetrators and their host states would be discouraged from engaging in or condoning cyber violations due to the heightened risks of international condemnation and isolation. These have been proven effective in other contexts. For instance, UN sanctions, when well-implemented, have been used to curb behaviors like nuclear proliferation and terrorism. Although the effectiveness of sanctions and public denunciations can vary, historical evidence shows that they can lead to meaningful consequences, such as economic or political isolation of offending states. For example, the sanctions imposed by the UN on North Korea, including economic sanctions and arms embargoes, have aimed to curtail the country's nuclear ambitions by exerting pressure through international isolation and economic restrictions.65 This demonstrates how similar strategies could be applied to the realm of cyber violations.\n\nThis approach acknowledges the complexities and limitations of attributing cyber activities to specific actors but leverages the global community's collective power to enforce norms and maintain cyber peace. It reflects a pragmatic understanding that in the digital age, where state and non-state boundaries blur in cyber operations, traditional methods of accountability may need to be supplemented with broader, more inclusive strategies that can adapt to the dynamic and interconnected nature of global cybersecurity threats.\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of such measures depends on the willingness of the international community to enforce them uniformly and the ability to adapt these tools to the",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n24\n\ndynamic nature of cyber threats. Sanctions and public denunciations, while potentially powerful, can sometimes be circumvented or rendered ineffective by the resilience of non-state actors or the protective actions of state sponsors. Nevertheless, the proposal represents a significant step towards strengthening global cyber governance and ensuring that non-state cyber actors are held accountable on the international stage.\n\n## Recommendations for Canadian Domestic Law\n\nRecommendation #1. Establishing a National Open-Source Database for Enhanced Cyber Espionage Defence in Canada\n\nThis recommendation proposes the creation of a national open-source database to list foreign entities known to have targeted Canada through cyber espionage. This initiative would mirror the approach used by Public Safety Canada for terrorist entities, including details such as the reasoning for their listing, dates of listing, and review dates.⁶⁶ The aim is to enable non-governmental entities, including businesses and organizations, to better protect themselves against foreign cyber threats by: avoiding collaboration with listed entities; exercising increased caution when dealing with businesses associated with these entities; and utilizing general Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) for heightened cybersecurity vigilance.\n\nThis database allows for the addressing of the existing gaps in Canada’s cybersecurity defences by shifting from a reactive to a proactive stance against cyber threats. Currently, non-state actors often lack the necessary information to adequately protect themselves against sophisticated cyber threats. By making detailed information about known cyber threat actors publicly accessible, the database empowers businesses and organizations to take preventive measures, reducing their vulnerability to espionage. This approach not only enhances the overall",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n25\n\ncybersecurity posture of non-state actors but also alleviates the burden on government resources, allowing them to focus on more complex or high-level threats.\n\nDespite challenges such as the adaptability of threat actors, who may change names or methods to evade detection, and the need for regular updates and maintenance, the database represents a shift towards a proactive defence strategy, essential in the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber threats. Publicly listing entities involved in cyber espionage would act as a deterrent, signaling Canada's intolerance of such activities. Additionally, the database would establish a legal basis for prosecuting cyber espionage and disrupt the operations of listed entities by discouraging Canadian businesses from engaging with them, making this approach a robust solution to the challenges posed by cyber espionage.\n\n## Recommendation #2. Strengthening Cybersecurity Through Legislative Mandates: A Proposal for Enhanced Data Protection in Canada\n\nThis recommendation urges the adoption of stringent legislative measures in Canada to compel organizations to implement robust cybersecurity practices, particularly those handling sensitive data across sectors such as government, research, and healthcare. Given the provinces' constitutional jurisdiction over property and civil rights as outlined in sections 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, this approach allows legislation to be finely tailored to the specific needs and conditions of each region, addressing local differences effectively, particularly in diverse sectors.\n\nDrawing on insights from legal experts with a background in cybersecurity, there is a consensus on the necessity for more specific Information Technology (IT) and data protection regulations.[67] Despite the expectation for organizations to maintain high standards of privacy and security, gaps and inconsistencies in their cybersecurity measures are evident, underscoring the",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n26\n\nneed for enforceable legal standards.⁶⁸ For instance, the Capital One Data Breach of 2019, which exposed the data of over 100 million Capital One customers in the U.S. and 6 million in Canada, was a direct result of a misconfigured web application firewall.⁶⁹ This incident shows how a hacker could exploit such a vulnerability to access customer data stored on a cloud server. Similarly, the 2019 Desjardins Group Data Leak, affecting 4.2 million members of the Quebec-based credit union, was caused by an insider threat, leaking sensitive information including names, addresses, birthdates, and social insurance numbers.⁷⁰ These examples underscore the critical need for regulations that not only mandate regular security assessments of cloud environments and configurations but also emphasize internal security measures, access controls, and employee training to detect and prevent insider threats.\n\nThis proposal calls for the enactment of provincial laws that mandate organizations to periodically update their cybersecurity protocols to thwart unauthorized access by third parties, potentially jeopardizing their data integrity. This approach is bolstered by the aforementioned examples, which despite substantial investment in data protection, have experienced significant breaches. These instances highlight the pervasive challenge of cybersecurity and the inadequacy of voluntary compliance in safeguarding against data breaches.\n\nBy instituting specific legal requirements for cybersecurity, the recommendation aims to create a uniform baseline of security measures that all organizations must meet, thereby reducing the likelihood of opportunistic cyberattacks exploiting systemic vulnerabilities. While acknowledging that no legislative measure can entirely eliminate the risk of targeted cyberattacks, the proposed laws are intended to significantly reduce the incidence of such breaches by mandating proactive security measures. In effect, this legal mandate would serve as a deterrent against potential attackers while ensuring that organizations are held accountable for",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n27\n\nthe protection of sensitive data, thereby enhancing the overall cybersecurity posture of Canadian entities. Moreover, considering cybersecurity’s overlap with both telecommunications (federal jurisdiction) and property rights (provincial jurisdiction), a coordinated effort between federal and provincial governments is essential to cover all aspects of cybersecurity effectively. This layered approach could mitigate the risk of cyberattacks by ensuring no aspect of cybersecurity is overlooked due to jurisdictional limitations.\n\n## Recommendation #3. Implementing a Structured Active Cyber Defence Framework for Canada: A Strategy for Empowering Private Entities\n\nThis recommendation advocates for Canada to adopt a legislative approach akin to the U.S.’ ACDC Act, allowing specified private entities to engage in Active Cyber Defense (ACD) activities against cyber threats. The rationale behind this suggestion is to enhance the cybersecurity posture of Canadian organizations by legalizing certain proactive defence measures that enable them to deter, detect, and respond to malicious cyber activities effectively. The emphasis on stricter cybersecurity laws is to mitigate the risks of opportunistic cyber attacks that exploit security vulnerabilities, while also acknowledging that even the most robust security measures may not fully prevent targeted cyber espionage or attacks.\n\nBy selecting specific private entities for conducting ACD, the recommendation aims to create a controlled environment where such activities are regulated and monitored to prevent abuse or unintended consequences. This approach seeks to strike a balance between empowering organizations to defend themselves and ensuring that such measures do not cross ethical or legal boundaries, potentially causing harm to innocent parties or escalating cyber conflicts. Essential to this approach is the establishment of clear limits and parameters for entities eligible to conduct",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n28\n\nACD, including criteria such as cybersecurity maturity, certification and accreditation, purpose and proportionality of actions, oversight and reporting obligations, legal and ethical training, collaboration with law enforcement, liability and accountability, and mechanisms for revocation of authorization if needed.\n\nAs cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated, relying solely on passive defence measures is no longer sufficient. The ACDC Act in the U.S. has been proposed as a means to empower private entities to defend themselves more aggressively against cyberattacks. This Canadian adaptation would similarly provide organizations with the legal tools to protect their networks proactively, potentially reducing the incidence of successful cyber intrusions. The case of Shawn Carpenter, as discussed earlier, highlights the practical benefits of such an approach. Carpenter, a cybersecurity analyst, used his employer's resources to trace a cyber intrusion back to its source, which led to the identification of hackers working for a foreign government. Despite his success, Carpenter was fired for unauthorized use of company resources, illustrating the need for legal protection for individuals who take proactive measures to defend their organizations. This case highlights how individuals or entities, when given the legal authority and proper oversight, can contribute to national cyber defence efforts without resorting to vigilantism or exceeding their legal rights. Thus, by providing a legal framework for ACD, this recommendation would encourage cybersecurity professionals to engage in necessary defence actions without fear of job loss or legal repercussions, thereby contributing to broader national security efforts.\n\nIncorporating these guidelines ensures that the empowered entities act within a framework that safeguards against misuse while enabling effective defence against cyber threats. Thus, this recommendation proposes a structured legal mechanism for Canada to enable selected",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n29\n\nprivate entities to actively participate in cyber defence, drawing inspiration from the U.S. experience to tailor a system that accommodates Canadian legal and ethical standards. This approach aims to enhance the overall resilience of Canada’s cyber infrastructure by incorporating the capabilities and resources of the private sector into the national cyber defence strategy, under a framework that ensures accountability, legality, and proportionality of actions, fostering a more secure digital environment for Canada.\n\nThe strength of such a legislation lies in its ability to empower private entities to take a more active role in cybersecurity, filling a critical gap in Canada’s current defence strategy. Challenges such as the risk of escalating cyber conflicts or potential legal and ethical violations must be carefully managed. Concerns about mistaken attribution and the risk of targeting innocent third parties or nation-states, with serious geopolitical consequences, have been raised. Nevertheless, adopting this recommendation provides a structured and regulated approach to active cyber defence, ensuring actions are taken within a legal and ethical framework. By learning from the U.S. experience, Canada can develop a system that aligns with its own legal standards, ultimately strengthening the resilience of its cyber infrastructure. This approach strikes a critical balance between proactive defence and the need for accountability, legality, and proportionality, making it a progressive step in protecting Canada’s digital landscape.\n\n## Part V. Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the assessment of legal frameworks in both Canada and the U.S. reveals the complexities and challenges associated with combating cyber espionage. While international law lays the foundation for addressing cyber threats, its limitations become apparent when attempting to prosecute foreign entities for domestic attacks, as seen in Doe.71 Both Canada and the U.S. have specific legislation to combat cyber espionage, but avenues for prosecution are",
    "Canadian Law Review | Volume 3\n30\n\noften hampered by international law and extradition challenges. Notably, the U.S. has taken a more proactive approach by implementing the Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act to clarify and legalize certain cybersecurity practices, encouraging private sector involvement in responding to threats. Canada, on the other hand, has yet to implement similar direct legal avenues for non-governmental responses, relying more on protective measures and recommendations for non-state entities. The use of immigration law as a deterrent against cyber threats is a shared approach between both countries, as demonstrated in cases such as China Mobile, Geng, and Yihdego.72 Both Canada and the U.S. actively address cybersecurity challenges through legal mechanisms, though differences exist in their frameworks, responses to private sector involvement, and the utilization of immigration law. Proposing improvements to the legal frameworks, the paper suggests recommendations for both international and Canadian domestic laws. For international law, the creation of a multilateral treaty enforcing anti-cyber espionage laws into domestic law is proposed, providing a higher level of accountability. Additionally, the suggestion to engage international organizations in enforcing accountability upon non-state cyber actors broadens the scope of responsibility mechanisms, enriching the traditional state-centric model without directly contesting it. For Canadian domestic law, recommendations include the creation of a national open-source database to track foreign entities involved in cyber espionage, enhancing non-governmental entities’ ability to protect themselves. Mandating specific laws to ensure organizations implement stricter cybersecurity measures and designating selected private entities to conduct Active Cyber Defence against threat actors would bolster Canada’s cybersecurity defences. Addressing the evolving threat landscape of cyber espionage requires a multifaceted approach involving international collaboration, legal advances, and proactive measures at the national level. Implementing these recommendations can contribute to a more",

It meticulously explores the definitions, objectives, and key players in cyber espionage, scrutinizing the efficacy of prevailing laws against the backdrop of global legal constraints. Proposing a robust strategy for legal reform, it advocates for the establishment of international treaties, the creation of a national cyber espionage database, and the implementation of targeted cyber security protocols. This analysis underscores the imperative for a holistic strategy, incorporating international cooperation and legal innovation, to safeguard national security from the pervasive threat of cyber espionage.
