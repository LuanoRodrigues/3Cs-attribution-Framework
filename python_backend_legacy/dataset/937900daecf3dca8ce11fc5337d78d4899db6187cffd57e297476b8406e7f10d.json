It analyses the possibility to recognize a cyber-attack as an act of international aggression and shows existing difficulties at the present state of the international debate. It then turns to the traditional notion of state responsibility for lack of due diligence as a source of state's responsibility for cyber-attacks. Such due diligence should be guaranteed through sufficient criminal law regulations that are properly executed in order to effectively prevent and prosecute electronic attacks. In this context the article posits that an international debate is required with the aim of establishing international guidelines. The results of such a debate should than allow for the harmonization of national criminal law regulations. Although the author points to the need for an international debate on the system for protection against cyber-attacks on states' key electronic infrastructure, she also emphasizes already existing international obligations for states to take responsibility for attacks conducted from their territory.\n\n## 1. INTERNATIONAL ATTACKS IN CYBERSPACE\n\nThe 21st century has brought with it new forms of international aggression. One of the reasons for this inglorious evolution has been the creation and expansion of the world wide electronic network – the Internet.

Therefore the security of such crucial elements of national infrastructure as state airports and power supplies has become only as secure as the information technology used to operate them. States are now vulnerable in new ways, thus new means of state protection are called for.\n\nThis new category of risks to state security has been integrated into an already existing definition of the term Information Warfare (IW). This term has historically been used to describe actions undertaken in order to “disrupt the communications of an opponent” and give him a false image of reality,¹ however the 21st century has now given this term a whole new meaning, with a wider and more diverse scope than ever before.²\n\nRecent attacks conducted with the use of the internet (cyber-attacks) onto the key information structures of sovereign states, such as 2007 attack on Estonia³\n\n¹ D. Delibasis, *The Right to National Self-defence: In Information Warfare Operations*, Arena Books, Bury St Edmunds: 2007, p. 25.\n\n² Electronic attacks were a crucial factor in the Gulf War in 1991 (*Ibidem*, p. 31 ff.). However, IW took on a new, more comprehensive shape after the 9/11 attacks. According to the US Defence Department plan by the codename of Virtual Battlefield, all actions and attacks can be initiated with the use of an advanced electronic system (*Ibidem*, p. 35 ff.). What is more, presently the most advanced and comprehensive system of defence against cyber-attackers belongs to the US Department of Defence, due to the fact that the US military security system that is the target of most cyber-attacks worldwide. The average number of cyber-attacks upon US national defence system computers grew from slightly over 200 in 1994 up to over 40.000 by the end of 2002. That data however may not be regarded as accurate, since according to the U.S. Defence Information Systems Agency only one out of 150 attacks can actually be identified (*Ibidem*, p. 38 ff.). The cost of repairing the damage caused by cyber-attacks grew to over 100 million USD in the second half of 2009, as estimated by the US Defence Department (see *100 milionów dolarów za naprawę szkód wyrządzonych przez cyberprzestępców* (100 million dollars to repair damages caused by cyber-criminals), Gazeta Wyborcza 04.04.2009, <http: 1,85253,6478435,100_millionow_dolarow_za_naprawe_szkod_wyrzadzonych.html=\"\" conclusion=\"\" de=\"\" et=\"\" technique=\"\" technique.=\"\" national=\"\" of=\"\" order=\"\" order.=\"\" public=\"\" repair=\"\" rechrologie.gazeta.pl=\"\" re.=\"\" te=\"\" tec=\"\" using=\"\" wayrządzonych.html=\"\"> accessed 28 April 2010).\n\n³ Before April 2007 Estonia prided itself on being one of the most “wired” countries in the world (due to which it was nicknamed eStonia). In April 2007 the electronic infrastructure of Estonia became the target of a synchronised attack by hackers, operating primarily from Russian territory. Estonia blamed Russia for initiating and supporting those attacks (1 Traynor, *Russia accused of unleashing cyberwar to disable Estonia*, The Guardian, 17.05.2007 <http: 17=\"\" 2007=\"\" may=\"\" may=\"\" topstories3.russia=\"\" world=\"\" www.guardian.co.uk=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010). According to Russian authorities, the attacks were a civil initiative; although coordinated by a youth organisation, supported by the Kremlin, called “Nashi” (“Ours”), who claimed credit for the attack, stating however that it had no support from national authorities</http:></http:>",

In the electronic era, the global community is therefore only as safe as the technology it uses. Since the development of the international community is aimed at building an international information society (that goal is explicitly recognized by, e.g. the European Union in its 2010 agenda),⁶ the issue of cyber-security and legally permitted self-defence against cyber-attacks is of growing and urgent importance. Its meaning is enhanced by the alarming declarations of the authorities of some countries regarded as most probable targets or authors of such an attack. For example Russian government representatives expressly declare they feel authorised to use nuclear force in response to cyber-attacks. Also both the Clinton and Bush administrations compared the threats caused by cyber-attacks to those resulting from the use of traditional weapons of mass destruction.⁷\n\n(Ch.

The recent statement of one of Prime Minister Putin’s closest colleagues could be regarded as claiming credit for the attack also by Russian authorities (R.

These attacks were aimed at Pentagon databases and the confidential information contained therein. Again Russian authorities distanced themselves from the attacks (Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 40).\n\n⁵ The codename Solar Sunrise was adopted for a series of attacks conducted in February of 1998 aimed at secret electronic data of the United States. Using sniffers (programmes searching electronic records without the awareness of the database administrators) on US Air Force computers, unknown culprits broke into the databases. IP analysis traced all the attacks to a service provider in Texas. Further investigation however showed, that that Texas provider was himself a victim of an attack, initiated from Israeli territory. Israeli authorities initiated a criminal investigation against the attackers, which resulted in identifying and punishing the perpetrators (Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 41).\n\n⁶ i2010 is the EU policy framework for the information society and media.

The author attempts to define the legal character of cyber-attacks, in particular whether such attacks may be regarded as constituting acts of international aggression. Should they constitute “armed attacks”, they would allow a recourse to measures foreseen by the international legal order, including armed self-defence as envisioned by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter (UNC).¹¹ It is also important to establish whether the attacked sovereign is entitled to reparations, and if so – when a cyber-attack can be attributed to a state and its authorities. Since there is not yet any particular international regulation on that matter, presently one has to apply already existing international law mechanisms to this new and unique situation. The author attempts to identify possible new mechanisms as well as required modifications to existing ones.\n\n⁸ Russia, next to China, is the country most often accused of cyber-attacks, recently also against Georgia (R. Synovitz, *Georgian Government Accuses Russia Of Waging «Cyberwarfare»*, Radio Free Europe, 12.08.2008 <http: 1190477.html=\"\" commi=\"\" content=\"\" georgian_government_accuses_russia_of_cyberwar=\"\" www.rferl.org=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010; N.

Russian authorities continuously refuse to take action against the perpetrators.\n\n⁹ China’s role in cyberwarfare in rapidly increasing. According to the US Congress Committee, China is the sole national power able to threaten US cybersecurity defences, causing therefore a real threat to all other states, not in possession of the technology and infrastructure to withstand a potential attack (*2008 Report To the Congress Of the U.S.-China Economic And Security Review Commission*, p. 9, November 2008, http://www.uscc.gov). China is also alleged to be the initiator of most breaches of national database protection systems and stealing protected data. Chinese authorities however deny any responsibility for the attacks or any connection with the hackers.\n\n¹⁰ According to Shackelford, over 120 states are investing in electronic infrastructure which allows for the exercise of cyberwarfare (Shackelford, *supra* note 3, p. 12).\n\n¹¹ Charter of the United Nations, 26 June, 1945, available at <http: charter=\"\" documents=\"\" en=\"\" www.un.org=\"\"></http:></http:>",

DEFINITION OF AGGRESSION AND CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nAccording to Article 2 Paragraph 4 of the UNC “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state”. Although interfering with national databases, archives or electronic infrastructure may certainly be qualified as “using force”, the general nature of the prohibition in Article 2 Paragraph 4 contains very few practical means of protecting one’s sovereignty against attacks by another state. The narrow scope of responses is established in to Article 51 UNC, which confirms the right of states to resort to self-defence only if they are subject to “an armed attack.” Therefore the legality of an armed response in self-defence against a cyber-attack would be determined based on the legal possibility to qualify cyber-attacks as “armed attacks”.\n\nThe UNC does not provide a definition of “an armed attack”. The term closest to “an armed attack” as defined by the UN is “aggression”, therefore when attempting to define “an armed attack” the definition of “aggression” must be examined. According to the definition of aggression in the UN in resolution 3314,¹² in principle both invasion and an attack against a state’s territory may be qualified as an act of aggression. A state may also be subject to a counter-attack when it opens its territory to the armed forces of an aggressor or supports the sending of armed bands or groups exercising armed force. The above indicates that Resolution 3314 cannot be relied on to qualify an attack on a state’s key infrastructure through its electronic network as an act of international aggression, since it does not constitute a physical invasion of state territory with the traditional means of armed force. Such a conclusion is confirmed by indications made in the General Assembly travaux préparatoires accompanying resolution 3314, where it was explicitly said that any other act outside the scope defined, such as ones resulting in economic consequences, may not be regarded as acts of international aggression.¹³\n\nThe scope of the legal exercise of “armed force” allowed by international law may be defined only when using the definition of “aggression”. As shown above “aggression” is defined very narrowly and the allowed use of armed self-defence\n\n¹² Article 3 of the Nations General Assembly Resolution 3314 (XXIX). Definition of Aggression.\n\n¹³ According to Czaplinski and Wyrozumska, such a narrowing of the scope of the definition was intentional and resulted from the rejection of Brazil’s proposal to include economic attacks as part of the definition of international aggression (W. Czaplinski, A. Wyrozumska, Prawo międzynarodowe publiczne. Zagadnienia systemowe (Public international law. Systemic issues), CH Beck, Warszawa: 1999, p. 486).",

Since cyber-attacks fall outside this narrow scope, they may not be relied on as grounds for an internationally legitimate armed self-defence, contrary to the numerous statements made by national authorities.\n\nHowever, the term \"use of force\", prohibited by Article 2 Paragraph 4 of the UNC, has been defined extensively in a sequence of other UN documents and its scope is much broader. When categorizing cyber-attacks in the context of international law this definition may prove very useful.\n\nThe Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations recognizes any acts of intervention, direct or indirect, \"for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State\" as a violation of international law. It explicitly defines as illegal not only armed intervention, but \"all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements\". According to its terms, \"no State may use or encourage the use of economic political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind\" (emphasis added). A similar requirement is provided by the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, which in Article 32 stipulates that \"no State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights\" (emphasis added).\n\nThese documents would allow for an interpretation that interference with a state's critical electronic infrastructure would fall within the \"any other type of measures to coerce another State\" and therefore constitute a breach of a legally binding international obligation. Such a breach may be demonstrated especially when the measures used were aimed at \"coercing another State in order to obtain from it the subordination\" (in the case of attack against Estonia, such subordination would mean the reversal of the decision relocating the Red Army soldiers monument from the centre of Tallinn to its outskirts) or \"to secure from it advantages of any kind\" (e.g. the \"advantages\" to any state flowing from the theft of another state's secrets).\n\nTherefore a cyber-attack may easily be regarded as a breach of an international obligation, but at the same time it cannot be regarded as an act of armed\n\n14 UN General Assembly Resolution 2625 (XXV) from October 24, 1970.\n15 Ibidem, Preamble, point 1.\n16 Ibidem.\n17 General Assembly Resolution 3281 (XXIX) from December 12, 1974.",

However, the opposite conclusion may be drawn from the statements of some U.S. legal scholars,¹⁹ as well as U.S.²⁰ and Russian authorities,²¹ who declare the availability of all self-defence mechanisms, including a nuclear response, to any cyber-attack.\n\n# 3. PRINCIPLES OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERNATIONALLY WRONGFUL ACTS – A BRIEF SUMMARY\n\nAs explained above, while cyber-attacks can hardly be regarded as constituting “acts of aggression,” they may be regarded as breaches of universal international obligations, resulting in state responsibility therefore.\n\nThe principles for state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts were initially established by the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1927 in the\n\n¹⁸ The only action taken by the NATO parties in reaction to the Estonia attack was the creation of a Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, the actions of which are headed by Estonia (M. Chudziński, *Estonia poprowadzi NATO do cyberwojny* (Estonia will lead NATO into cyberwar), Gazeta Wyborcza, 2.04.2008 <http: 1,90339,5081266.html=\"\" technique=\"\" technique,=\"\" technologie.gazeta.pl=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010).\n\n¹⁹ Some arguments to the contrary are presented by D. Delibasis, showing that the character of an armed attack should be defined rather by the consequence it brings than the sort of weapons used to conduct it (Delibasis, *supra* note 1., p. 17 ff., see also, D. Delibasis, *State Use of Force in Cyberspace for Self-Defence: A New Challenge for a New Century*, 8 Peace Conflict and Development: An Interdisciplinary Journal 13 (2006), where the author analyses the application of the law of war to conflicts in cyberspace).\n\n²⁰ Such an extensive interpretation of Article 51 of the UNC was presented by the one of the officials from the US Defence Department, who believes that a wide scale cyber-attack may be regarded as justification for a traditional armed response (Department of Defence, Office of General Counsel, *An Assessment Of International Legal Issues In Information Operations*, May 1999, p. 20 <http: awc=\"\" awcgate=\"\" dod-io-legal=\"\" dod-io-legal.pdf=\"\" www.au.af.mil=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010). The Department representative went on to say that there is no certainty regarding the application of international law principles in cyberspace. He referred to Article 51 of the UNC and stated that according to its provisions a cyber-attack would have to be regarded as an “armed attack” in order to allow for an armed self defence. However regarding the scale of a cyber-attack, even if it does not constitute an armed attack, it always endangers state security. Therefore the consequences of a cyber-attack are much more important than the means used for conducting it (*Ibidem*, p. 22).\n\n²¹ “An attack against the telecommunications and electronic power industries of Russia would, by virtue of its catastrophic consequences, completely overlap with the use of weapons of mass destruction. (...) Russia reserves the right to respond to an information warfare attack with nuclear weapons” (see, Shackelford, *supra* note 3, p. 28).</http:></http:>",

Over time international law practice elaborated a set of framework principles establishing states’ responsibility under international law. These principles require the ascertainment of three prerequisites.²³ First, there must be a breach of an international obligation and harm to a state interest protected by law.²⁴ Second, the harmful result must be attributable to a state and its authorities.²⁵ International law foresees a number of exceptions to this principle, the occurrence of which allows a state to free itself from any responsibility. Therefore in order for a state to be held responsible, a third negative prerequisite must be met: none of these particular exceptions can apply.²⁶\n\nArticle 3 of the International Law Commission (ILC) Draft Articles describes in more detail the elements of an internationally wrongful act of a state. An act may be regarded as internationally wrongful when the harmful action or omission is attributable to the a state under international law and at the same time that conduct constitutes a breach of an international obligation. The term of “constituting a breach of an international obligation” was further defined by the International Court of Justice in the Barcelona Traction decision.²⁷ The Court distinguished two groups of international obligations of a state. The first category consists of *erga omnes* obligations, which in principle result from peremptory norms (*jus cogens*), or in other words, norms that the state is obliged to fulfil towards the international community as a whole. The second group of international obligations are those which bind states bilaterally – *inter partes* – and result only from a consensual agreements (usually written, but sometimes also customary) among or between the particular parties involved.\n\n²² *France v. Turkey* (the Lotus Case), PCIJ [1927], PCIJ Reports, series A, No. 10.\n\n²³ It has to be emphasized that that there is no international, global organization safeguarding these principles. These rules, as all of international customary law, are the result of the common practice of states and it is the states themselves that decide on the way to resolve disputes resulting from the differences in their perception or application. So far these principles have only been reduced to writing in a draft of an international treaty done by the International Law Commission: Of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility: Titles and texts of articles adopted by the Drafting Committee, International Law Commission, A/CN.4/L.472; further referred to as the ILC Draft Articles.).\n\n²⁴ Ibidem, Art. 3.\n\n²⁵ Ibidem, Art. 5.\n\n²⁶ Ibidem, Chapter V.\n\n²⁷ *Barcelona Traction*, Light and Power Company, Limited, Belgium v.

A state may escape international responsibility for particular reasons foreseen by international law, and in order to be held responsible, no such reasons may appear. Those grounds, enumerated in Chapter V of the ILC Draft Articles include: consent validly given by a state (article 29), countermeasures in respect of an internationally wrongful act (article 30), force majeure and fortuitous events (article 31), extreme distress, required for the purpose of saving human life (article 32), state of necessity (article 33) and self-defence, in accordance with Article 51 of the UNC (article 34).\n\nConsequently, in order to establish the international responsibility of a state for executing or ordering the execution of a cyber-attack it is necessary, as a first step, to show the international rule that such an attack violates. The second step of the analysis consists in attributing such an action to a particular state.\n\nLinking a cyber-attack to the breach of an international norm is rather simple. As explained above, Article 2(4) of the UNC prohibits the use of force in international relations and is regarded as a peremptory norm. On the basis of the already cited UN documents (i.e. the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States) one may qualify attacks on key state infrastructures conducted through electronic means as \"any other type of measure to coerce another State\" (emphasis added), therefore constituting a breach of international law.\n\nWhat is more difficult, however, is the attribution of a cyber-attack to a particular state, i.e. one that initiated it or permitted it. As mentioned above, a state may be held responsible for its own actions (actions of its organs) as well as the actions of private persons acting on its behalf or order. Given the present state of technological development, determining the physical localization of a computer from which a cyber-attack was conducted is not extensively difficult. However, the very\n\n²⁸ Art. 5 of the ILC Draft Articles. Traditionally acts of state were regarded as those executed directly by its government or head of state, or on their direct order. Presently a state may be held responsible also for acts of its parliament or judicial branch. When responsibility for the acts of its legislative body is considered, a state may be held responsible for its actions as well as omissions (e.g. not providing a sufficient protection of the rights of state nationals or residents).\n\n²⁹ Ibidem, Articles 7 and 8.",

Such an assumption would be unwarranted, since a state cannot be held responsible for the actions of all its residents operating hardware or software located within its territory. In the traditional notion of state responsibility, a state is only be responsible for those of its residents it explicitly authorizes to act on its behalf. Proving a formal link between a state resident and a state authority in the case of cyber-attacks might be exceedingly difficult and thus negate the possibility of any reparations.³⁰\n\nHowever, a state can also be held responsible for a breach of an international obligation not only for its actions but for its omissions, i.e. for not preventing a particular attack to take place.\n\n# 4. ATTRIBUTION OF A CYBER-ATTACK TO A STATE\n\nBoth the legal doctrine and judicial interpretation make clear that a state may be held responsible not only for its actions, but also for its omissions, in particular for the failure to exercise due diligence.³¹ Such an interpretation finds support in the wording of Article 14(3) of the ILC Draft Articles, which provides that a state may be held responsible for the conduct of organs of an insurrectional movement, if such an attribution is legitimate under international law. As explained by Crawford in his commentary to the ILC Draft Articles,³² this article refers to a situation in which a state is in “breach of its obligation to prevent a given event”. Such an obligation is usually formulated as an obligation to render best efforts, calling for a state to take all “reasonable and necessary” measures in order to prevent a given event, however, without warranting that such an event will not occur.\n\n³⁰ Both Russian and Chinese authorities consistently deny any formal links with the cyber-attackers.\n\n³¹ Czaplinski and Wyrozumska give an example of breach of the due diligence standard via neglect to take up measures aimed at protecting particular persons or objects from attacks, combined with refusal to punish the perpetrators of such attacks and an explicit support of such acts aimed at harming the interests of third states or persons (Czaplinski and Wyrozumska, supra note 13, p. 436). All these prerequisites are fulfilled in the case of the Estonia attacks, particularly in the light of the recent announcement by Russian authorities admitting their initial support for the actions of the “Nashi” organization; see also I. Brownlie, *System of the Law of Nations, Part I, State responsibility*, Oxford University Press, Oxford: 1983, p. 45), where the author points to a legal mechanism for the establishment of state responsible for an act based on its omission and a breach of international law resulting from it.\n\n³² J.

According to the ICJ decision, Iranian authorities may be held responsible for having “failed to take appropriate steps”, where such steps were evidently necessary. The Court found that the “inaction” of Iranian authorities was contrary to its international obligations to protect the US diplomatic personnel. This inaction constituted therefore a breach of an international obligation of Iran towards the USA, resulting from the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.³⁶ As correctly pointed out by Bratspies and Miller, the Court found that the due diligence standard must be unfulfilled in order to attribute state responsibility to the actions of natural persons.³⁷\n\nThe very same legal construction could be used in the case of a state not providing sufficient international protection from cyber-attacks conducted by its residents from its territory. A *jus cogens* norm obliging governments to protect the sovereignty and integrity of other states results not only from Article 2 (4) UNC, but also from a peremptory customary principle of the same substance. Such an obligation may be understood as encompassing both an intolerability of any active intrusion into the internal affairs of another state, as well as a due diligence requirement to prevent such an intrusion into foreign sovereignty from one’s own territory. As correctly pointed out by Vark, this produces an obligation on the part of any state from whose territory an internationally wrongful act is conducted to cooperate with the victim state in a manner necessary to eliminate the harmful act, or – if it may not be prevented – its consequences.³⁸ Therefore if a state itself is not capable of protecting the interests of another sovereign, it may not allow for private persons acting from within its territory to inflict damage or create danger to that sovereign while protected by the inflicting state’s\n\n³³ Brownlie, *supra* note 31, pp. 162–163.\n³⁴ See also footnote 3.\n³⁵ *United States of America v.

Under such an interpretation Russia’s refusal to prosecute the perpetrators of the attack against Estonia would constitute an internationally wrongful act, while Israeli involvement and punishment of the actors behind the Solar Sunrise incident exonerates that state from international responsibility.\n\n# 5. THE NEED FOR INTERNATIONAL REGULATION OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nIn the light of the above considerations, the practical solution to the urgent problem of legal categorization of attacks on state sovereignty conducted with the use of internet would be to initiate an international debate on the applicability of traditional state responsibility principles to this new category of threats to international peace and security. In light of the statements made by national authorities from countries that are susceptible to if not subject to cyber-attacks (i.e. allowing for nuclear response to cyberwarfare), such a debate seems to be essential. In particular there is a need for an international consensus on the criteria which have to be fulfilled by a state in order to avoid international responsibility for lack of due diligence in protecting other sovereigns from cyber-attacks.³⁹ Such an accord would alleviate the possibility of dangerous reactions by particular states in response to cyber-threats to their sovereignty. Such a debate should be initiated by determining the legal character of cyber-attacks and categorizing them, while stipulating the countermeasures available to the states attacked. In the course of such a debate, the principles for allowable self-defence against cyber-attacks should be set (e.g. would preventive measures be allowed? If so, of what character?). The second crucial issue would be to establish the standards for releasing a state from international responsibility for not providing due diligence: would the adoption of specific provisions in national criminal laws be sufficient, or rather would state authorities be required to effectively initiate a criminal investigation? It should be also clarified whether a due diligence standard can be set post factum – after an attack has already taken place.\n\nThe analysis provided in this article may serve as a starting point for such a debate. It seems clear that state responsibility must be based on a due diligence requirement rather than the obligation to show a formal link between the state authorities and the actions of actual perpetrators.

It analyses the possibility to recognize a cyber-attack as an act of international aggression and shows existing difficulties at the present state of the international debate. It then turns to the traditional notion of state responsibility for lack of due diligence as a source of state's responsibility for cyber-attacks. Such due diligence should be guaranteed through sufficient criminal law regulations that are properly executed in order to effectively prevent and prosecute electronic attacks. In this context the article posits that an international debate is required with the aim of establishing international guidelines. The results of such a debate should than allow for the harmonization of national criminal law regulations. Although the author points to the need for an international debate on the system for protection against cyber-attacks on states' key electronic infrastructure, she also emphasizes already existing international obligations for states to take responsibility for attacks conducted from their territory.\n## 1. INTERNATIONAL ATTACKS IN CYBERSPACE\nThe 21st century has brought with it new forms of international aggression. One of the reasons for this inglorious evolution has been the creation and expansion of the world wide electronic network – the Internet. Global international\n* Joanna Kulesza, Ph.D. is an assistant professor, Chair of International Law and International Relations, Faculty of Law and Administration, University of Łódź, Poland.\nJoanna Kulesza\ndevelopment has resulted not only in e-administration and e-government, but also in computer-controlled power plants, computer operated flight and airport control systems, and the massive popularity of on-line banking, both for private individuals and international companies. Therefore the security of such crucial elements of national infrastructure as state airports and power supplies has become only as secure as the information technology used to operate them. States are now vulnerable in new ways, thus new means of state protection are called for.\nThis new category of risks to state security has been integrated into an already existing definition of the term Information Warfare (IW). This term has historically been used to describe actions undertaken in order to “disrupt the communications of an opponent” and give him a false image of reality,¹ however the 21st century has now given this term a whole new meaning, with a wider and more diverse scope than ever before.²\nRecent attacks conducted with the use of the internet (cyber-attacks) onto the key information structures of sovereign states, such as 2007 attack on Estonia³\n¹ D. Delibasis, *The Right to National Self-defence: In Information Warfare Operations*, Arena Books, Bury St Edmunds: 2007, p. 25.\n² Electronic attacks were a crucial factor in the Gulf War in 1991 (*Ibidem*, p. 31 ff.). However, IW took on a new, more comprehensive shape after the 9/11 attacks. According to the US Defence Department plan by the codename of Virtual Battlefield, all actions and attacks can be initiated with the use of an advanced electronic system (*Ibidem*, p. 35 ff.). What is more, presently the most advanced and comprehensive system of defence against cyber-attackers belongs to the US Department of Defence, due to the fact that the US military security system that is the target of most cyber-attacks worldwide. The average number of cyber-attacks upon US national defence system computers grew from slightly over 200 in 1994 up to over 40.000 by the end of 2002. That data however may not be regarded as accurate, since according to the U.S. Defence Information Systems Agency only one out of 150 attacks can actually be identified (*Ibidem*, p. 38 ff.). The cost of repairing the damage caused by cyber-attacks grew to over 100 million USD in the second half of 2009, as estimated by the US Defence Department (see *100 milionów dolarów za naprawę szkód wyrządzonych przez cyberprzestępców* (100 million dollars to repair damages caused by cyber-criminals), Gazeta Wyborcza 04.04.2009, <http: 1,85253,6478435,100_millionow_dolarow_za_naprawe_szkod_wyrzadzonych.html=\"\" conclusion=\"\" de=\"\" et=\"\" technique=\"\" technique.=\"\" national=\"\" of=\"\" order=\"\" order.=\"\" public=\"\" repair=\"\" rechrologie.gazeta.pl=\"\" re.=\"\" te=\"\" tec=\"\" using=\"\" wayrządzonych.html=\"\"> accessed 28 April 2010).\n³ Before April 2007 Estonia prided itself on being one of the most “wired” countries in the world (due to which it was nicknamed eStonia). In April 2007 the electronic infrastructure of Estonia became the target of a synchronised attack by hackers, operating primarily from Russian territory. Estonia blamed Russia for initiating and supporting those attacks (1 Traynor, *Russia accused of unleashing cyberwar to disable Estonia*, The Guardian, 17.05.2007 <http: 17=\"\" 2007=\"\" may=\"\" may=\"\" topstories3.russia=\"\" world=\"\" www.guardian.co.uk=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010). According to Russian authorities, the attacks were a civil initiative; although coordinated by a youth organisation, supported by the Kremlin, called “Nashi” (“Ours”), who claimed credit for the attack, stating however that it had no support from national authorities</http:></http:>\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n141\nor the increasing number of intrusions into the United States' electronic infrastructure, attributed to both state authorities⁴ and nationals,⁵ show the gravity of the danger brought about by this new category of IW – cyber-warfare. In the electronic era, the global community is therefore only as safe as the technology it uses. Since the development of the international community is aimed at building an international information society (that goal is explicitly recognized by, e.g. the European Union in its 2010 agenda),⁶ the issue of cyber-security and legally permitted self-defence against cyber-attacks is of growing and urgent importance. Its meaning is enhanced by the alarming declarations of the authorities of some countries regarded as most probable targets or authors of such an attack. For example Russian government representatives expressly declare they feel authorised to use nuclear force in response to cyber-attacks. Also both the Clinton and Bush administrations compared the threats caused by cyber-attacks to those resulting from the use of traditional weapons of mass destruction.⁷\n(Ch. Clover, Kremlin-backed group behind Estonia cyber blitz, Financial Times, 11.03.2009 <http: 0=\"\" 57536d5a-0ddc-11de-8ea3-0000779fd2ac.html=\"\" cms=\"\" s=\"\" www.ft.com=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010). The recent statement of one of Prime Minister Putin’s closest colleagues could be regarded as claiming credit for the attack also by Russian authorities (R.

These attacks were aimed at Pentagon databases and the confidential information contained therein. Again Russian authorities distanced themselves from the attacks (Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 40).\n⁵ The codename Solar Sunrise was adopted for a series of attacks conducted in February of 1998 aimed at secret electronic data of the United States. Using sniffers (programmes searching electronic records without the awareness of the database administrators) on US Air Force computers, unknown culprits broke into the databases. IP analysis traced all the attacks to a service provider in Texas. Further investigation however showed, that that Texas provider was himself a victim of an attack, initiated from Israeli territory. Israeli authorities initiated a criminal investigation against the attackers, which resulted in identifying and punishing the perpetrators (Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 41).\n⁶ i2010 is the EU policy framework for the information society and media.

The author attempts to define the legal character of cyber-attacks, in particular whether such attacks may be regarded as constituting acts of international aggression. Should they constitute “armed attacks”, they would allow a recourse to measures foreseen by the international legal order, including armed self-defence as envisioned by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter (UNC).¹¹ It is also important to establish whether the attacked sovereign is entitled to reparations, and if so – when a cyber-attack can be attributed to a state and its authorities. Since there is not yet any particular international regulation on that matter, presently one has to apply already existing international law mechanisms to this new and unique situation. The author attempts to identify possible new mechanisms as well as required modifications to existing ones.\n⁸ Russia, next to China, is the country most often accused of cyber-attacks, recently also against Georgia (R. Synovitz, *Georgian Government Accuses Russia Of Waging «Cyberwarfare»*, Radio Free Europe, 12.08.2008 <http: 1190477.html=\"\" commi=\"\" content=\"\" georgian_government_accuses_russia_of_cyberwar=\"\" www.rferl.org=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010; N.

Russian authorities continuously refuse to take action against the perpetrators.\n⁹ China’s role in cyberwarfare in rapidly increasing. According to the US Congress Committee, China is the sole national power able to threaten US cybersecurity defences, causing therefore a real threat to all other states, not in possession of the technology and infrastructure to withstand a potential attack (*2008 Report To the Congress Of the U.S.-China Economic And Security Review Commission*, p. 9, November 2008, http://www.uscc.gov). China is also alleged to be the initiator of most breaches of national database protection systems and stealing protected data. Chinese authorities however deny any responsibility for the attacks or any connection with the hackers.\n¹⁰ According to Shackelford, over 120 states are investing in electronic infrastructure which allows for the exercise of cyberwarfare (Shackelford, *supra* note 3, p. 12).\n¹¹ Charter of the United Nations, 26 June, 1945, available at <http: charter=\"\" documents=\"\" en=\"\" www.un.org=\"\"></http:></http:>\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n143\n# 2. DEFINITION OF AGGRESSION AND CYBER-ATTACKS\nAccording to Article 2 Paragraph 4 of the UNC “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state”. Although interfering with national databases, archives or electronic infrastructure may certainly be qualified as “using force”, the general nature of the prohibition in Article 2 Paragraph 4 contains very few practical means of protecting one’s sovereignty against attacks by another state. The narrow scope of responses is established in to Article 51 UNC, which confirms the right of states to resort to self-defence only if they are subject to “an armed attack.” Therefore the legality of an armed response in self-defence against a cyber-attack would be determined based on the legal possibility to qualify cyber-attacks as “armed attacks”.\nThe UNC does not provide a definition of “an armed attack”. The term closest to “an armed attack” as defined by the UN is “aggression”, therefore when attempting to define “an armed attack” the definition of “aggression” must be examined. According to the definition of aggression in the UN in resolution 3314,¹² in principle both invasion and an attack against a state’s territory may be qualified as an act of aggression. A state may also be subject to a counter-attack when it opens its territory to the armed forces of an aggressor or supports the sending of armed bands or groups exercising armed force. The above indicates that Resolution 3314 cannot be relied on to qualify an attack on a state’s key infrastructure through its electronic network as an act of international aggression, since it does not constitute a physical invasion of state territory with the traditional means of armed force. Such a conclusion is confirmed by indications made in the General Assembly travaux préparatoires accompanying resolution 3314, where it was explicitly said that any other act outside the scope defined, such as ones resulting in economic consequences, may not be regarded as acts of international aggression.¹³\nThe scope of the legal exercise of “armed force” allowed by international law may be defined only when using the definition of “aggression”. As shown above “aggression” is defined very narrowly and the allowed use of armed self-defence\n¹² Article 3 of the Nations General Assembly Resolution 3314 (XXIX). Definition of Aggression.\n¹³ According to Czaplinski and Wyrozumska, such a narrowing of the scope of the definition was intentional and resulted from the rejection of Brazil’s proposal to include economic attacks as part of the definition of international aggression (W. Czaplinski, A. Wyrozumska, Prawo międzynarodowe publiczne. Zagadnienia systemowe (Public international law. Systemic issues), CH Beck, Warszawa: 1999, p. 486).\nJoanna Kulesza\nis excluded against any attacks outside its scope. Since cyber-attacks fall outside this narrow scope, they may not be relied on as grounds for an internationally legitimate armed self-defence, contrary to the numerous statements made by national authorities.\nHowever, the term \"use of force\", prohibited by Article 2 Paragraph 4 of the UNC, has been defined extensively in a sequence of other UN documents and its scope is much broader. When categorizing cyber-attacks in the context of international law this definition may prove very useful.\nThe Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations recognizes any acts of intervention, direct or indirect, \"for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State\" as a violation of international law. It explicitly defines as illegal not only armed intervention, but \"all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements\". According to its terms, \"no State may use or encourage the use of economic political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind\" (emphasis added). A similar requirement is provided by the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, which in Article 32 stipulates that \"no State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights\" (emphasis added).\nThese documents would allow for an interpretation that interference with a state's critical electronic infrastructure would fall within the \"any other type of measures to coerce another State\" and therefore constitute a breach of a legally binding international obligation. Such a breach may be demonstrated especially when the measures used were aimed at \"coercing another State in order to obtain from it the subordination\" (in the case of attack against Estonia, such subordination would mean the reversal of the decision relocating the Red Army soldiers monument from the centre of Tallinn to its outskirts) or \"to secure from it advantages of any kind\" (e.g. the \"advantages\" to any state flowing from the theft of another state's secrets).\nTherefore a cyber-attack may easily be regarded as a breach of an international obligation, but at the same time it cannot be regarded as an act of armed\n14 UN General Assembly Resolution 2625 (XXV) from October 24, 1970.\n15 Ibidem, Preamble, point 1.\n16 Ibidem.\n17 General Assembly Resolution 3281 (XXIX) from December 12, 1974.\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n145\naggression justifying the self-defence measures foreseen by the UNC (such an interpretation explains the response of the NATO countries to the Estonia attacks, when no action¹⁸ against Russia was undertaken in 2007). However, the opposite conclusion may be drawn from the statements of some U.S. legal scholars,¹⁹ as well as U.S.²⁰ and Russian authorities,²¹ who declare the availability of all self-defence mechanisms, including a nuclear response, to any cyber-attack.\n# 3. PRINCIPLES OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERNATIONALLY WRONGFUL ACTS – A BRIEF SUMMARY\nAs explained above, while cyber-attacks can hardly be regarded as constituting “acts of aggression,” they may be regarded as breaches of universal international obligations, resulting in state responsibility therefore.\nThe principles for state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts were initially established by the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1927 in the\n¹⁸ The only action taken by the NATO parties in reaction to the Estonia attack was the creation of a Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, the actions of which are headed by Estonia (M. Chudziński, *Estonia poprowadzi NATO do cyberwojny* (Estonia will lead NATO into cyberwar), Gazeta Wyborcza, 2.04.2008 <http: 1,90339,5081266.html=\"\" technique=\"\" technique,=\"\" technologie.gazeta.pl=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010).\n¹⁹ Some arguments to the contrary are presented by D. Delibasis, showing that the character of an armed attack should be defined rather by the consequence it brings than the sort of weapons used to conduct it (Delibasis, *supra* note 1., p. 17 ff., see also, D. Delibasis, *State Use of Force in Cyberspace for Self-Defence: A New Challenge for a New Century*, 8 Peace Conflict and Development: An Interdisciplinary Journal 13 (2006), where the author analyses the application of the law of war to conflicts in cyberspace).\n²⁰ Such an extensive interpretation of Article 51 of the UNC was presented by the one of the officials from the US Defence Department, who believes that a wide scale cyber-attack may be regarded as justification for a traditional armed response (Department of Defence, Office of General Counsel, *An Assessment Of International Legal Issues In Information Operations*, May 1999, p. 20 <http: awc=\"\" awcgate=\"\" dod-io-legal=\"\" dod-io-legal.pdf=\"\" www.au.af.mil=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010). The Department representative went on to say that there is no certainty regarding the application of international law principles in cyberspace. He referred to Article 51 of the UNC and stated that according to its provisions a cyber-attack would have to be regarded as an “armed attack” in order to allow for an armed self defence. However regarding the scale of a cyber-attack, even if it does not constitute an armed attack, it always endangers state security. Therefore the consequences of a cyber-attack are much more important than the means used for conducting it (*Ibidem*, p. 22).\n²¹ “An attack against the telecommunications and electronic power industries of Russia would, by virtue of its catastrophic consequences, completely overlap with the use of weapons of mass destruction. (...) Russia reserves the right to respond to an information warfare attack with nuclear weapons” (see, Shackelford, *supra* note 3, p. 28).</http:></http:>\nJoanna Kulesza\nLotus case.²² The Court asserted that international law acknowledges the rule of state responsibility for breach of international obligations and the duty to indemnify for any damage resulting from such breach. Over time international law practice elaborated a set of framework principles establishing states’ responsibility under international law. These principles require the ascertainment of three prerequisites.²³ First, there must be a breach of an international obligation and harm to a state interest protected by law.²⁴ Second, the harmful result must be attributable to a state and its authorities.²⁵ International law foresees a number of exceptions to this principle, the occurrence of which allows a state to free itself from any responsibility. Therefore in order for a state to be held responsible, a third negative prerequisite must be met: none of these particular exceptions can apply.²⁶\nArticle 3 of the International Law Commission (ILC) Draft Articles describes in more detail the elements of an internationally wrongful act of a state. An act may be regarded as internationally wrongful when the harmful action or omission is attributable to the a state under international law and at the same time that conduct constitutes a breach of an international obligation. The term of “constituting a breach of an international obligation” was further defined by the International Court of Justice in the Barcelona Traction decision.²⁷ The Court distinguished two groups of international obligations of a state. The first category consists of *erga omnes* obligations, which in principle result from peremptory norms (*jus cogens*), or in other words, norms that the state is obliged to fulfil towards the international community as a whole. The second group of international obligations are those which bind states bilaterally – *inter partes* – and result only from a consensual agreements (usually written, but sometimes also customary) among or between the particular parties involved.\n²² *France v. Turkey* (the Lotus Case), PCIJ [1927], PCIJ Reports, series A, No. 10.\n²³ It has to be emphasized that that there is no international, global organization safeguarding these principles. These rules, as all of international customary law, are the result of the common practice of states and it is the states themselves that decide on the way to resolve disputes resulting from the differences in their perception or application. So far these principles have only been reduced to writing in a draft of an international treaty done by the International Law Commission: Of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility: Titles and texts of articles adopted by the Drafting Committee, International Law Commission, A/CN.4/L.472; further referred to as the ILC Draft Articles.).\n²⁴ Ibidem, Art. 3.\n²⁵ Ibidem, Art. 5.\n²⁶ Ibidem, Chapter V.\n²⁷ *Barcelona Traction*, Light and Power Company, Limited, Belgium v. Spain, [1970] ICJ Rep 174.\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n147\nArticle 3 the ILC Draft Articles also stipulates that an act may be attributed to a state when it is conducted by a representative of a state organ²⁸ or a person acting on its behalf.²⁹\nAs mentioned above, the mechanism of international state responsibility also involves a negative prerequisite. A state may escape international responsibility for particular reasons foreseen by international law, and in order to be held responsible, no such reasons may appear. Those grounds, enumerated in Chapter V of the ILC Draft Articles include: consent validly given by a state (article 29), countermeasures in respect of an internationally wrongful act (article 30), force majeure and fortuitous events (article 31), extreme distress, required for the purpose of saving human life (article 32), state of necessity (article 33) and self-defence, in accordance with Article 51 of the UNC (article 34).\nConsequently, in order to establish the international responsibility of a state for executing or ordering the execution of a cyber-attack it is necessary, as a first step, to show the international rule that such an attack violates. The second step of the analysis consists in attributing such an action to a particular state.\nLinking a cyber-attack to the breach of an international norm is rather simple. As explained above, Article 2(4) of the UNC prohibits the use of force in international relations and is regarded as a peremptory norm. On the basis of the already cited UN documents (i.e. the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States) one may qualify attacks on key state infrastructures conducted through electronic means as \"any other type of measure to coerce another State\" (emphasis added), therefore constituting a breach of international law.\nWhat is more difficult, however, is the attribution of a cyber-attack to a particular state, i.e. one that initiated it or permitted it. As mentioned above, a state may be held responsible for its own actions (actions of its organs) as well as the actions of private persons acting on its behalf or order. Given the present state of technological development, determining the physical localization of a computer from which a cyber-attack was conducted is not extensively difficult. However, the very\n²⁸ Art. 5 of the ILC Draft Articles. Traditionally acts of state were regarded as those executed directly by its government or head of state, or on their direct order. Presently a state may be held responsible also for acts of its parliament or judicial branch. When responsibility for the acts of its legislative body is considered, a state may be held responsible for its actions as well as omissions (e.g. not providing a sufficient protection of the rights of state nationals or residents).\n²⁹ Ibidem, Articles 7 and 8.\nJoanna Kulesza\nfact of physical localization of a computer used for a cyber-attack does not (and should not) allow for attributing that cyber-attack to a particular state. Such an assumption would be unwarranted, since a state cannot be held responsible for the actions of all its residents operating hardware or software located within its territory. In the traditional notion of state responsibility, a state is only be responsible for those of its residents it explicitly authorizes to act on its behalf. Proving a formal link between a state resident and a state authority in the case of cyber-attacks might be exceedingly difficult and thus negate the possibility of any reparations.³⁰\nHowever, a state can also be held responsible for a breach of an international obligation not only for its actions but for its omissions, i.e. for not preventing a particular attack to take place.\n# 4. ATTRIBUTION OF A CYBER-ATTACK TO A STATE\nBoth the legal doctrine and judicial interpretation make clear that a state may be held responsible not only for its actions, but also for its omissions, in particular for the failure to exercise due diligence.³¹ Such an interpretation finds support in the wording of Article 14(3) of the ILC Draft Articles, which provides that a state may be held responsible for the conduct of organs of an insurrectional movement, if such an attribution is legitimate under international law. As explained by Crawford in his commentary to the ILC Draft Articles,³² this article refers to a situation in which a state is in “breach of its obligation to prevent a given event”. Such an obligation is usually formulated as an obligation to render best efforts, calling for a state to take all “reasonable and necessary” measures in order to prevent a given event, however, without warranting that such an event will not occur.\n³⁰ Both Russian and Chinese authorities consistently deny any formal links with the cyber-attackers.\n³¹ Czaplinski and Wyrozumska give an example of breach of the due diligence standard via neglect to take up measures aimed at protecting particular persons or objects from attacks, combined with refusal to punish the perpetrators of such attacks and an explicit support of such acts aimed at harming the interests of third states or persons (Czaplinski and Wyrozumska, supra note 13, p. 436). All these prerequisites are fulfilled in the case of the Estonia attacks, particularly in the light of the recent announcement by Russian authorities admitting their initial support for the actions of the “Nashi” organization; see also I. Brownlie, *System of the Law of Nations, Part I, State responsibility*, Oxford University Press, Oxford: 1983, p. 45), where the author points to a legal mechanism for the establishment of state responsible for an act based on its omission and a breach of international law resulting from it.\n³² J. Crawford (ed.), *The International Law Commission’s articles on state responsibility: introduction, text, and commentaries*, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge: 2002, p. 140.\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n149\nThis doctrine identifies state responsibility for actions of quasi-legal persons as an example of such a situation.³³ This may be also directly applied to the action of the “Nashi” organization in the case of the Estonia attacks, where the state of Russia did not prevent the attacks and took no measures to prevent them.³⁴\nIn international jurisprudence this mechanism is best reflected in the ICJ case concerning the United States diplomatic and consular staff in Teheran.³⁵ In its decision the ICJ found, that although the storming of the U.S. embassy in Teheran may not be attributed to Iran, such finding does not free that state from responsibility. According to the ICJ decision, Iranian authorities may be held responsible for having “failed to take appropriate steps”, where such steps were evidently necessary. The Court found that the “inaction” of Iranian authorities was contrary to its international obligations to protect the US diplomatic personnel. This inaction constituted therefore a breach of an international obligation of Iran towards the USA, resulting from the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.³⁶ As correctly pointed out by Bratspies and Miller, the Court found that the due diligence standard must be unfulfilled in order to attribute state responsibility to the actions of natural persons.³⁷\nThe very same legal construction could be used in the case of a state not providing sufficient international protection from cyber-attacks conducted by its residents from its territory. A *jus cogens* norm obliging governments to protect the sovereignty and integrity of other states results not only from Article 2 (4) UNC, but also from a peremptory customary principle of the same substance. Such an obligation may be understood as encompassing both an intolerability of any active intrusion into the internal affairs of another state, as well as a due diligence requirement to prevent such an intrusion into foreign sovereignty from one’s own territory. As correctly pointed out by Vark, this produces an obligation on the part of any state from whose territory an internationally wrongful act is conducted to cooperate with the victim state in a manner necessary to eliminate the harmful act, or – if it may not be prevented – its consequences.³⁸ Therefore if a state itself is not capable of protecting the interests of another sovereign, it may not allow for private persons acting from within its territory to inflict damage or create danger to that sovereign while protected by the inflicting state’s\n³³ Brownlie, *supra* note 31, pp. 162–163.\n³⁴ See also footnote 3.\n³⁵ *United States of America v.

Vark, *State Responsibility for Private Armed Groups in the Context of Terrorism*, Juridica International XI/2006, p. 192.\nJoanna Kulesza\nimmunity. Under such an interpretation Russia’s refusal to prosecute the perpetrators of the attack against Estonia would constitute an internationally wrongful act, while Israeli involvement and punishment of the actors behind the Solar Sunrise incident exonerates that state from international responsibility.\n# 5. THE NEED FOR INTERNATIONAL REGULATION OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\nIn the light of the above considerations, the practical solution to the urgent problem of legal categorization of attacks on state sovereignty conducted with the use of internet would be to initiate an international debate on the applicability of traditional state responsibility principles to this new category of threats to international peace and security. In light of the statements made by national authorities from countries that are susceptible to if not subject to cyber-attacks (i.e. allowing for nuclear response to cyberwarfare), such a debate seems to be essential. In particular there is a need for an international consensus on the criteria which have to be fulfilled by a state in order to avoid international responsibility for lack of due diligence in protecting other sovereigns from cyber-attacks.³⁹ Such an accord would alleviate the possibility of dangerous reactions by particular states in response to cyber-threats to their sovereignty. Such a debate should be initiated by determining the legal character of cyber-attacks and categorizing them, while stipulating the countermeasures available to the states attacked. In the course of such a debate, the principles for allowable self-defence against cyber-attacks should be set (e.g. would preventive measures be allowed? If so, of what character?). The second crucial issue would be to establish the standards for releasing a state from international responsibility for not providing due diligence: would the adoption of specific provisions in national criminal laws be sufficient, or rather would state authorities be required to effectively initiate a criminal investigation? It should be also clarified whether a due diligence standard can be set post factum – after an attack has already taken place.\nThe analysis provided in this article may serve as a starting point for such a debate. It seems clear that state responsibility must be based on a due diligence requirement rather than the obligation to show a formal link between the state authorities and the actions of actual perpetrators. An important element of any international accord on international responsibility for cyber-attacks would be\n³⁹ Within such a discussion the principle of proportionality might also be discussed in order to ascertain the scope of counter-measures permitted to a state.\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n151\na debate on the international jurisdiction principles to be applied to acts conducted through the Internet.⁴⁰ Only such an accord will prevent reliance on far-fetched analogies to existing international regimes and contradictory national regulations.⁴¹ Such an international consensus could provide the basis for a wider international agreement on the limits of state jurisdiction and competence in cyberspace. An international regulatory framework for cyberspace already falls within the scope of some international organizations, including the UN, through its agenda the Internet Governance Forum (IGF). The IGF could be used as a forum for elaborating a satisfactory consensus on the issues discussed herein.⁴² Without a functioning mechanism for state responsibility for attacks conducted from its territory through the internet against other sovereigns, the worst case scenario is the unilateral interpretation of the self-defence clause of the UNC by each state, resulting in real-world armed conflict. Such a potentially catastrophic event should be prevented by all means possible.\n⁴⁰ As with all activities in cyberspace, resort to traditional jurisdictional principles is bound to result in legal chaos, particularly should authorities decide to call upon the effects or the protective principle. For more on the issue of the application of traditional jurisdiction principles to cyberspace and its consequences, see: J. Kulesza, Internet Governance and the Jurisdiction of States; Justification of the Need For an International Regulation of Cyberspace; third annual meeting of the Global Internet Governance Academic Network (GigaNet), Hyderabad, India, December 2008 <http: papers.cfm?abstract_id=\"1445452\" papers.ssrn.com=\"\" sol3=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010.\n⁴¹ An example of such a far-reaching analogy was presented by Shackelford, (Shackelford, supra note 3, p. 27 ff), e.g. through drawing a parallel with the diplomatic law regime, law of the sea, or telecommunications regulations. Even though those regimes may provide a good example of how a consensus on the issue discussed may be shaped, their analogical application could lead to unpredictable results.\n⁴² This would, however, require serious organisational changes, as the present, open forum scheme has not fulfilled the tasks assigned to it.

It analyses the possibility to recognize a cyber-attack as an act of international aggression and shows existing difficulties at the present state of the international debate. It then turns to the traditional notion of state responsibility for lack of due diligence as a source of state's responsibility for cyber-attacks. Such due diligence should be guaranteed through sufficient criminal law regulations that are properly executed in order to effectively prevent and prosecute electronic attacks. In this context the article posits that an international debate is required with the aim of establishing international guidelines. The results of such a debate should than allow for the harmonization of national criminal law regulations. Although the author points to the need for an international debate on the system for protection against cyber-attacks on states' key electronic infrastructure, she also emphasizes already existing international obligations for states to take responsibility for attacks conducted from their territory.\n## 1. INTERNATIONAL ATTACKS IN CYBERSPACE\nThe 21st century has brought with it new forms of international aggression. One of the reasons for this inglorious evolution has been the creation and expansion of the world wide electronic network – the Internet. Global international\n* Joanna Kulesza, Ph.D. is an assistant professor, Chair of International Law and International Relations, Faculty of Law and Administration, University of Łódź, Poland.\nJoanna Kulesza\ndevelopment has resulted not only in e-administration and e-government, but also in computer-controlled power plants, computer operated flight and airport control systems, and the massive popularity of on-line banking, both for private individuals and international companies. Therefore the security of such crucial elements of national infrastructure as state airports and power supplies has become only as secure as the information technology used to operate them. States are now vulnerable in new ways, thus new means of state protection are called for.\nThis new category of risks to state security has been integrated into an already existing definition of the term Information Warfare (IW). This term has historically been used to describe actions undertaken in order to “disrupt the communications of an opponent” and give him a false image of reality, however the 21st century has now given this term a whole new meaning, with a wider and more diverse scope than ever before.\nRecent attacks conducted with the use of the internet (cyber-attacks) onto the key information structures of sovereign states, such as 2007 attack on Estonia\n D. Delibasis, *The Right to National Self-defence: In Information Warfare Operations*, Arena Books, Bury St Edmunds: 2007, p. 25.\n Electronic attacks were a crucial factor in the Gulf War in 1991 (*Ibidem*, p. 31 ff.). However, IW took on a new, more comprehensive shape after the 9/11 attacks. According to the US Defence Department plan by the codename of Virtual Battlefield, all actions and attacks can be initiated with the use of an advanced electronic system (*Ibidem*, p. 35 ff.). What is more, presently the most advanced and comprehensive system of defence against cyber-attackers belongs to the US Department of Defence, due to the fact that the US military security system that is the target of most cyber-attacks worldwide. The average number of cyber-attacks upon US national defence system computers grew from slightly over 200 in 1994 up to over 40.000 by the end of 2002. That data however may not be regarded as accurate, since according to the U.S. Defence Information Systems Agency only one out of 150 attacks can actually be identified (*Ibidem*, p. 38 ff.). The cost of repairing the damage caused by cyber-attacks grew to over 100 million USD in the second half of 2009, as estimated by the US Defence Department (see *100 milionów dolarów za naprawę szkód wyrządzonych przez cyberprzestępców* (100 million dollars to repair damages caused by cyber-criminals), Gazeta Wyborcza 04.04.2009, <http: 1,85253,6478435,100_millionow_dolarow_za_naprawe_szkod_wyrzadzonych.html=\"\" conclusion=\"\" de=\"\" et=\"\" technique=\"\" technique.=\"\" national=\"\" of=\"\" order=\"\" order.=\"\" public=\"\" repair=\"\" rechrologie.gazeta.pl=\"\" re.=\"\" te=\"\" tec=\"\" using=\"\" wayrządzonych.html=\"\"> accessed 28 April 2010).\n Before April 2007 Estonia prided itself on being one of the most “wired” countries in the world (due to which it was nicknamed eStonia). In April 2007 the electronic infrastructure of Estonia became the target of a synchronised attack by hackers, operating primarily from Russian territory. Estonia blamed Russia for initiating and supporting those attacks (1 Traynor, *Russia accused of unleashing cyberwar to disable Estonia*, The Guardian, 17.05.2007 <http: 17=\"\" 2007=\"\" may=\"\" may=\"\" topstories3.russia=\"\" world=\"\" www.guardian.co.uk=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010). According to Russian authorities, the attacks were a civil initiative; although coordinated by a youth organisation, supported by the Kremlin, called “Nashi” (“Ours”), who claimed credit for the attack, stating however that it had no support from national authorities</http:></http:>\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n\n(Ch.

The recent statement of one of Prime Minister Putin’s closest colleagues could be regarded as claiming credit for the attack also by Russian authorities (R.

These attacks were aimed at Pentagon databases and the confidential information contained therein. Again Russian authorities distanced themselves from the attacks (Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 40).\n The codename Solar Sunrise was adopted for a series of attacks conducted in February of 1998 aimed at secret electronic data of the United States. Using sniffers (programmes searching electronic records without the awareness of the database administrators) on US Air Force computers, unknown culprits broke into the databases. IP analysis traced all the attacks to a service provider in Texas. Further investigation however showed, that that Texas provider was himself a victim of an attack, initiated from Israeli territory. Israeli authorities initiated a criminal investigation against the attackers, which resulted in identifying and punishing the perpetrators (Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 41).\n i2010 is the EU policy framework for the information society and media.

The author attempts to define the legal character of cyber-attacks, in particular whether such attacks may be regarded as constituting acts of international aggression. Should they constitute “armed attacks”, they would allow a recourse to measures foreseen by the international legal order, including armed self-defence as envisioned by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter (UNC). It is also important to establish whether the attacked sovereign is entitled to reparations, and if so – when a cyber-attack can be attributed to a state and its authorities. Since there is not yet any particular international regulation on that matter, presently one has to apply already existing international law mechanisms to this new and unique situation. The author attempts to identify possible new mechanisms as well as required modifications to existing ones.\n Russia, next to China, is the country most often accused of cyber-attacks, recently also against Georgia (R. Synovitz, *Georgian Government Accuses Russia Of Waging «Cyberwarfare»*, Radio Free Europe, 12.08.2008 <http: 1190477.html=\"\" commi=\"\" content=\"\" georgian_government_accuses_russia_of_cyberwar=\"\" www.rferl.org=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010; N.

Russian authorities continuously refuse to take action against the perpetrators.\n China’s role in cyberwarfare in rapidly increasing. According to the US Congress Committee, China is the sole national power able to threaten US cybersecurity defences, causing therefore a real threat to all other states, not in possession of the technology and infrastructure to withstand a potential attack (*2008 Report To the Congress Of the U.S.-China Economic And Security Review Commission*, p. 9, November 2008, http://www.uscc.gov). China is also alleged to be the initiator of most breaches of national database protection systems and stealing protected data. Chinese authorities however deny any responsibility for the attacks or any connection with the hackers.\n According to Shackelford, over 120 states are investing in electronic infrastructure which allows for the exercise of cyberwarfare (Shackelford, *supra* note 3, p. 12).\n Charter of the United Nations, 26 June, 1945, available at <http: charter=\"\" documents=\"\" en=\"\" www.un.org=\"\"></http:></http:>\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n\nAccording to Article 2 Paragraph 4 of the UNC “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state”. Although interfering with national databases, archives or electronic infrastructure may certainly be qualified as “using force”, the general nature of the prohibition in Article 2 Paragraph 4 contains very few practical means of protecting one’s sovereignty against attacks by another state. The narrow scope of responses is established in to Article 51 UNC, which confirms the right of states to resort to self-defence only if they are subject to “an armed attack.” Therefore the legality of an armed response in self-defence against a cyber-attack would be determined based on the legal possibility to qualify cyber-attacks as “armed attacks”.\nThe UNC does not provide a definition of “an armed attack”. The term closest to “an armed attack” as defined by the UN is “aggression”, therefore when attempting to define “an armed attack” the definition of “aggression” must be examined. According to the definition of aggression in the UN in resolution 3314, in principle both invasion and an attack against a state’s territory may be qualified as an act of aggression. A state may also be subject to a counter-attack when it opens its territory to the armed forces of an aggressor or supports the sending of armed bands or groups exercising armed force. The above indicates that Resolution 3314 cannot be relied on to qualify an attack on a state’s key infrastructure through its electronic network as an act of international aggression, since it does not constitute a physical invasion of state territory with the traditional means of armed force. Such a conclusion is confirmed by indications made in the General Assembly travaux préparatoires accompanying resolution 3314, where it was explicitly said that any other act outside the scope defined, such as ones resulting in economic consequences, may not be regarded as acts of international aggression.\nThe scope of the legal exercise of “armed force” allowed by international law may be defined only when using the definition of “aggression”. As shown above “aggression” is defined very narrowly and the allowed use of armed self-defence\n Article 3 of the Nations General Assembly Resolution 3314 (XXIX). Definition of Aggression.\n According to Czaplinski and Wyrozumska, such a narrowing of the scope of the definition was intentional and resulted from the rejection of Brazil’s proposal to include economic attacks as part of the definition of international aggression (W. Czaplinski, A. Wyrozumska, Prawo międzynarodowe publiczne. Zagadnienia systemowe (Public international law. Systemic issues), CH Beck, Warszawa: 1999, p. 486).\nJoanna Kulesza\nis excluded against any attacks outside its scope. Since cyber-attacks fall outside this narrow scope, they may not be relied on as grounds for an internationally legitimate armed self-defence, contrary to the numerous statements made by national authorities.\nHowever, the term \"use of force\", prohibited by Article 2 Paragraph 4 of the UNC, has been defined extensively in a sequence of other UN documents and its scope is much broader. When categorizing cyber-attacks in the context of international law this definition may prove very useful.\nThe Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations recognizes any acts of intervention, direct or indirect, \"for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State\" as a violation of international law. It explicitly defines as illegal not only armed intervention, but \"all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements\". According to its terms, \"no State may use or encourage the use of economic political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind\" (emphasis added). A similar requirement is provided by the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, which in Article 32 stipulates that \"no State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights\" (emphasis added).\nThese documents would allow for an interpretation that interference with a state's critical electronic infrastructure would fall within the \"any other type of measures to coerce another State\" and therefore constitute a breach of a legally binding international obligation. Such a breach may be demonstrated especially when the measures used were aimed at \"coercing another State in order to obtain from it the subordination\" (in the case of attack against Estonia, such subordination would mean the reversal of the decision relocating the Red Army soldiers monument from the centre of Tallinn to its outskirts) or \"to secure from it advantages of any kind\" (e.g. the \"advantages\" to any state flowing from the theft of another state's secrets).\nTherefore a cyber-attack may easily be regarded as a breach of an international obligation, but at the same time it cannot be regarded as an act of armed\n\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n\n# 3. PRINCIPLES OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERNATIONALLY WRONGFUL ACTS – A BRIEF SUMMARY\nAs explained above, while cyber-attacks can hardly be regarded as constituting “acts of aggression,” they may be regarded as breaches of universal international obligations, resulting in state responsibility therefore.\nThe principles for state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts were initially established by the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1927 in the\n The only action taken by the NATO parties in reaction to the Estonia attack was the creation of a Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, the actions of which are headed by Estonia (M. Chudziński, *Estonia poprowadzi NATO do cyberwojny* (Estonia will lead NATO into cyberwar), Gazeta Wyborcza, 2.04.2008 <http: 1,90339,5081266.html=\"\" technique=\"\" technique,=\"\" technologie.gazeta.pl=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010).\n Some arguments to the contrary are presented by D. Delibasis, showing that the character of an armed attack should be defined rather by the consequence it brings than the sort of weapons used to conduct it (Delibasis, *supra* note 1., p. 17 ff., see also, D. Delibasis, *State Use of Force in Cyberspace for Self-Defence: A New Challenge for a New Century*, 8 Peace Conflict and Development: An Interdisciplinary Journal 13 (2006), where the author analyses the application of the law of war to conflicts in cyberspace).\n Such an extensive interpretation of Article 51 of the UNC was presented by the one of the officials from the US Defence Department, who believes that a wide scale cyber-attack may be regarded as justification for a traditional armed response (Department of Defence, Office of General Counsel, *An Assessment Of International Legal Issues In Information Operations*, May 1999, p. 20 <http: awc=\"\" awcgate=\"\" dod-io-legal=\"\" dod-io-legal.pdf=\"\" www.au.af.mil=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010). The Department representative went on to say that there is no certainty regarding the application of international law principles in cyberspace. He referred to Article 51 of the UNC and stated that according to its provisions a cyber-attack would have to be regarded as an “armed attack” in order to allow for an armed self defence. However regarding the scale of a cyber-attack, even if it does not constitute an armed attack, it always endangers state security. Therefore the consequences of a cyber-attack are much more important than the means used for conducting it (*Ibidem*, p. 22).\n “An attack against the telecommunications and electronic power industries of Russia would, by virtue of its catastrophic consequences, completely overlap with the use of weapons of mass destruction. (...) Russia reserves the right to respond to an information warfare attack with nuclear weapons” (see, Shackelford, *supra* note 3, p. 28).</http:></http:>\nJoanna Kulesza\nLotus case. The Court asserted that international law acknowledges the rule of state responsibility for breach of international obligations and the duty to indemnify for any damage resulting from such breach. Over time international law practice elaborated a set of framework principles establishing states’ responsibility under international law. These principles require the ascertainment of three prerequisites. First, there must be a breach of an international obligation and harm to a state interest protected by law. Second, the harmful result must be attributable to a state and its authorities. International law foresees a number of exceptions to this principle, the occurrence of which allows a state to free itself from any responsibility. Therefore in order for a state to be held responsible, a third negative prerequisite must be met: none of these particular exceptions can apply.\nArticle 3 of the International Law Commission (ILC) Draft Articles describes in more detail the elements of an internationally wrongful act of a state. An act may be regarded as internationally wrongful when the harmful action or omission is attributable to the a state under international law and at the same time that conduct constitutes a breach of an international obligation. The term of “constituting a breach of an international obligation” was further defined by the International Court of Justice in the Barcelona Traction decision. The Court distinguished two groups of international obligations of a state. The first category consists of *erga omnes* obligations, which in principle result from peremptory norms (*jus cogens*), or in other words, norms that the state is obliged to fulfil towards the international community as a whole. The second group of international obligations are those which bind states bilaterally – *inter partes* – and result only from a consensual agreements (usually written, but sometimes also customary) among or between the particular parties involved.\n *France v. Turkey* (the Lotus Case), PCIJ [1927], PCIJ Reports, series A, No. 10.\n It has to be emphasized that that there is no international, global organization safeguarding these principles. These rules, as all of international customary law, are the result of the common practice of states and it is the states themselves that decide on the way to resolve disputes resulting from the differences in their perception or application. So far these principles have only been reduced to writing in a draft of an international treaty done by the International Law Commission: Of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility: Titles and texts of articles adopted by the Drafting Committee, International Law Commission, A/CN.4/L.472; further referred to as the ILC Draft Articles.).\n Ibidem, Art. 3.\n Ibidem, Art. 5.\n Ibidem, Chapter V.\n *Barcelona Traction*, Light and Power Company, Limited, Belgium v. Spain, [1970] ICJ Rep 174.\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n\nAs mentioned above, the mechanism of international state responsibility also involves a negative prerequisite. A state may escape international responsibility for particular reasons foreseen by international law, and in order to be held responsible, no such reasons may appear. Those grounds, enumerated in Chapter V of the ILC Draft Articles include: consent validly given by a state (article 29), countermeasures in respect of an internationally wrongful act (article 30), force majeure and fortuitous events (article 31), extreme distress, required for the purpose of saving human life (article 32), state of necessity (article 33) and self-defence, in accordance with Article 51 of the UNC (article 34).\nConsequently, in order to establish the international responsibility of a state for executing or ordering the execution of a cyber-attack it is necessary, as a first step, to show the international rule that such an attack violates. The second step of the analysis consists in attributing such an action to a particular state.\nLinking a cyber-attack to the breach of an international norm is rather simple. As explained above, Article 2(4) of the UNC prohibits the use of force in international relations and is regarded as a peremptory norm. On the basis of the already cited UN documents (i.e. the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States) one may qualify attacks on key state infrastructures conducted through electronic means as \"any other type of measure to coerce another State\" (emphasis added), therefore constituting a breach of international law.\nWhat is more difficult, however, is the attribution of a cyber-attack to a particular state, i.e. one that initiated it or permitted it. As mentioned above, a state may be held responsible for its own actions (actions of its organs) as well as the actions of private persons acting on its behalf or order. Given the present state of technological development, determining the physical localization of a computer from which a cyber-attack was conducted is not extensively difficult. However, the very\n Art. 5 of the ILC Draft Articles. Traditionally acts of state were regarded as those executed directly by its government or head of state, or on their direct order. Presently a state may be held responsible also for acts of its parliament or judicial branch. When responsibility for the acts of its legislative body is considered, a state may be held responsible for its actions as well as omissions (e.g. not providing a sufficient protection of the rights of state nationals or residents).\n Ibidem, Articles 7 and 8.\nJoanna Kulesza\nfact of physical localization of a computer used for a cyber-attack does not (and should not) allow for attributing that cyber-attack to a particular state. Such an assumption would be unwarranted, since a state cannot be held responsible for the actions of all its residents operating hardware or software located within its territory. In the traditional notion of state responsibility, a state is only be responsible for those of its residents it explicitly authorizes to act on its behalf. Proving a formal link between a state resident and a state authority in the case of cyber-attacks might be exceedingly difficult and thus negate the possibility of any reparations.\nHowever, a state can also be held responsible for a breach of an international obligation not only for its actions but for its omissions, i.e. for not preventing a particular attack to take place.\n# 4. ATTRIBUTION OF A CYBER-ATTACK TO A STATE\nBoth the legal doctrine and judicial interpretation make clear that a state may be held responsible not only for its actions, but also for its omissions, in particular for the failure to exercise due diligence. Such an interpretation finds support in the wording of Article 14(3) of the ILC Draft Articles, which provides that a state may be held responsible for the conduct of organs of an insurrectional movement, if such an attribution is legitimate under international law. As explained by Crawford in his commentary to the ILC Draft Articles, this article refers to a situation in which a state is in “breach of its obligation to prevent a given event”. Such an obligation is usually formulated as an obligation to render best efforts, calling for a state to take all “reasonable and necessary” measures in order to prevent a given event, however, without warranting that such an event will not occur.\n Both Russian and Chinese authorities consistently deny any formal links with the cyber-attackers.\n Czaplinski and Wyrozumska give an example of breach of the due diligence standard via neglect to take up measures aimed at protecting particular persons or objects from attacks, combined with refusal to punish the perpetrators of such attacks and an explicit support of such acts aimed at harming the interests of third states or persons (Czaplinski and Wyrozumska, supra note 13, p. 436). All these prerequisites are fulfilled in the case of the Estonia attacks, particularly in the light of the recent announcement by Russian authorities admitting their initial support for the actions of the “Nashi” organization; see also I. Brownlie, *System of the Law of Nations, Part I, State responsibility*, Oxford University Press, Oxford: 1983, p. 45), where the author points to a legal mechanism for the establishment of state responsible for an act based on its omission and a breach of international law resulting from it.\n J. Crawford (ed.), *The International Law Commission’s articles on state responsibility: introduction, text, and commentaries*, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge: 2002, p. 140.\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n\nIn international jurisprudence this mechanism is best reflected in the ICJ case concerning the United States diplomatic and consular staff in Teheran. In its decision the ICJ found, that although the storming of the U.S. embassy in Teheran may not be attributed to Iran, such finding does not free that state from responsibility. According to the ICJ decision, Iranian authorities may be held responsible for having “failed to take appropriate steps”, where such steps were evidently necessary. The Court found that the “inaction” of Iranian authorities was contrary to its international obligations to protect the US diplomatic personnel. This inaction constituted therefore a breach of an international obligation of Iran towards the USA, resulting from the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. As correctly pointed out by Bratspies and Miller, the Court found that the due diligence standard must be unfulfilled in order to attribute state responsibility to the actions of natural persons.\nThe very same legal construction could be used in the case of a state not providing sufficient international protection from cyber-attacks conducted by its residents from its territory. A *jus cogens* norm obliging governments to protect the sovereignty and integrity of other states results not only from Article 2 (4) UNC, but also from a peremptory customary principle of the same substance. Such an obligation may be understood as encompassing both an intolerability of any active intrusion into the internal affairs of another state, as well as a due diligence requirement to prevent such an intrusion into foreign sovereignty from one’s own territory. As correctly pointed out by Vark, this produces an obligation on the part of any state from whose territory an internationally wrongful act is conducted to cooperate with the victim state in a manner necessary to eliminate the harmful act, or – if it may not be prevented – its consequences. Therefore if a state itself is not capable of protecting the interests of another sovereign, it may not allow for private persons acting from within its territory to inflict damage or create danger to that sovereign while protected by the inflicting state’s\n Brownlie, *supra* note 31, pp. 162–163.\n See also footnote 3.\n *United States of America v.

Under such an interpretation Russia’s refusal to prosecute the perpetrators of the attack against Estonia would constitute an internationally wrongful act, while Israeli involvement and punishment of the actors behind the Solar Sunrise incident exonerates that state from international responsibility.\n# 5. THE NEED FOR INTERNATIONAL REGULATION OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\nIn the light of the above considerations, the practical solution to the urgent problem of legal categorization of attacks on state sovereignty conducted with the use of internet would be to initiate an international debate on the applicability of traditional state responsibility principles to this new category of threats to international peace and security. In light of the statements made by national authorities from countries that are susceptible to if not subject to cyber-attacks (i.e. allowing for nuclear response to cyberwarfare), such a debate seems to be essential. In particular there is a need for an international consensus on the criteria which have to be fulfilled by a state in order to avoid international responsibility for lack of due diligence in protecting other sovereigns from cyber-attacks. Such an accord would alleviate the possibility of dangerous reactions by particular states in response to cyber-threats to their sovereignty. Such a debate should be initiated by determining the legal character of cyber-attacks and categorizing them, while stipulating the countermeasures available to the states attacked. In the course of such a debate, the principles for allowable self-defence against cyber-attacks should be set (e.g. would preventive measures be allowed? If so, of what character?). The second crucial issue would be to establish the standards for releasing a state from international responsibility for not providing due diligence: would the adoption of specific provisions in national criminal laws be sufficient, or rather would state authorities be required to effectively initiate a criminal investigation? It should be also clarified whether a due diligence standard can be set post factum – after an attack has already taken place.\nThe analysis provided in this article may serve as a starting point for such a debate. It seems clear that state responsibility must be based on a due diligence requirement rather than the obligation to show a formal link between the state authorities and the actions of actual perpetrators. An important element of any international accord on international responsibility for cyber-attacks would be\n Within such a discussion the principle of proportionality might also be discussed in order to ascertain the scope of counter-measures permitted to a state.\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n\n As with all activities in cyberspace, resort to traditional jurisdictional principles is bound to result in legal chaos, particularly should authorities decide to call upon the effects or the protective principle. For more on the issue of the application of traditional jurisdiction principles to cyberspace and its consequences, see: J.

Even though those regimes may provide a good example of how a consensus on the issue discussed may be shaped, their analogical application could lead to unpredictable results.\n This would, however, require serious organisational changes, as the present, open forum scheme has not fulfilled the tasks assigned to it.

It analyses the possibility to recognize a cyber-attack as an act of international aggression and shows existing difficulties at the present state of the international debate. It then turns to the traditional notion of state responsibility for lack of due diligence as a source of state's responsibility for cyber-attacks. Such due diligence should be guaranteed through sufficient criminal law regulations that are properly executed in order to effectively prevent and prosecute electronic attacks. In this context the article posits that an international debate is required with the aim of establishing international guidelines. The results of such a debate should than allow for the harmonization of national criminal law regulations. Although the author points to the need for an international debate on the system for protection against cyber-attacks on states' key electronic infrastructure, she also emphasizes already existing international obligations for states to take responsibility for attacks conducted from their territory.\n## 1. INTERNATIONAL ATTACKS IN CYBERSPACE\nThe 21st century has brought with it new forms of international aggression. One of the reasons for this inglorious evolution has been the creation and expansion of the world wide electronic network – the Internet. Global international\n* Joanna Kulesza, Ph.D. is an assistant professor, Chair of International Law and International Relations, Faculty of Law and Administration, University of Łódź, Poland.\nJoanna Kulesza\ndevelopment has resulted not only in e-administration and e-government, but also in computer-controlled power plants, computer operated flight and airport control systems, and the massive popularity of on-line banking, both for private individuals and international companies. Therefore the security of such crucial elements of national infrastructure as state airports and power supplies has become only as secure as the information technology used to operate them. States are now vulnerable in new ways, thus new means of state protection are called for.\nThis new category of risks to state security has been integrated into an already existing definition of the term Information Warfare (IW). This term has historically been used to describe actions undertaken in order to “disrupt the communications of an opponent” and give him a false image of reality, however the 21st century has now given this term a whole new meaning, with a wider and more diverse scope than ever before.\nRecent attacks conducted with the use of the internet (cyber-attacks) onto the key information structures of sovereign states, such as 2007 attack on Estonia\n D. Delibasis, *The Right to National Self-defence: In Information Warfare Operations*, Arena Books, Bury St Edmunds: 2007, p. 25.\n Electronic attacks were a crucial factor in the Gulf War in 1991 (*Ibidem*, p. 31 ff.). However, IW took on a new, more comprehensive shape after the 9/11 attacks. According to the US Defence Department plan by the codename of Virtual Battlefield, all actions and attacks can be initiated with the use of an advanced electronic system (*Ibidem*, p. 35 ff.). What is more, presently the most advanced and comprehensive system of defence against cyber-attackers belongs to the US Department of Defence, due to the fact that the US military security system that is the target of most cyber-attacks worldwide. The average number of cyber-attacks upon US national defence system computers grew from slightly over 200 in 1994 up to over 40.000 by the end of 2002. That data however may not be regarded as accurate, since according to the U.S. Defence Information Systems Agency only one out of 150 attacks can actually be identified (*Ibidem*, p. 38 ff.). The cost of repairing the damage caused by cyber-attacks grew to over 100 million USD in the second half of 2009, as estimated by the US Defence Department (see *100 milionów dolarów za naprawę szkód wyrządzonych przez cyberprzestępców* (100 million dollars to repair damages caused by cyber-criminals), Gazeta Wyborcza 04.04.2009, <http: 1,85253,6478435,100_millionow_dolarow_za_naprawe_szkod_wyrzadzonych.html=\"\" conclusion=\"\" de=\"\" et=\"\" technique=\"\" technique.=\"\" national=\"\" of=\"\" order=\"\" order.=\"\" public=\"\" repair=\"\" rechrologie.gazeta.pl=\"\" re.=\"\" te=\"\" tec=\"\" using=\"\" wayrządzonych.html=\"\"> accessed 28 April 2010).\n Before April 2007 Estonia prided itself on being one of the most “wired” countries in the world (due to which it was nicknamed eStonia). In April 2007 the electronic infrastructure of Estonia became the target of a synchronised attack by hackers, operating primarily from Russian territory. Estonia blamed Russia for initiating and supporting those attacks (1 Traynor, *Russia accused of unleashing cyberwar to disable Estonia*, The Guardian, 17.05.2007 <http: 17=\"\" 2007=\"\" may=\"\" may=\"\" topstories3.russia=\"\" world=\"\" www.guardian.co.uk=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010). According to Russian authorities, the attacks were a civil initiative; although coordinated by a youth organisation, supported by the Kremlin, called “Nashi” (“Ours”), who claimed credit for the attack, stating however that it had no support from national authorities</http:></http:>\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n\n(Ch.

The recent statement of one of Prime Minister Putin’s closest colleagues could be regarded as claiming credit for the attack also by Russian authorities (R.

These attacks were aimed at Pentagon databases and the confidential information contained therein. Again Russian authorities distanced themselves from the attacks (Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 40).\n The codename Solar Sunrise was adopted for a series of attacks conducted in February of 1998 aimed at secret electronic data of the United States. Using sniffers (programmes searching electronic records without the awareness of the database administrators) on US Air Force computers, unknown culprits broke into the databases. IP analysis traced all the attacks to a service provider in Texas. Further investigation however showed, that that Texas provider was himself a victim of an attack, initiated from Israeli territory. Israeli authorities initiated a criminal investigation against the attackers, which resulted in identifying and punishing the perpetrators (Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 41).\n i2010 is the EU policy framework for the information society and media.

The author attempts to define the legal character of cyber-attacks, in particular whether such attacks may be regarded as constituting acts of international aggression. Should they constitute “armed attacks”, they would allow a recourse to measures foreseen by the international legal order, including armed self-defence as envisioned by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter (UNC). It is also important to establish whether the attacked sovereign is entitled to reparations, and if so – when a cyber-attack can be attributed to a state and its authorities. Since there is not yet any particular international regulation on that matter, presently one has to apply already existing international law mechanisms to this new and unique situation. The author attempts to identify possible new mechanisms as well as required modifications to existing ones.\n Russia, next to China, is the country most often accused of cyber-attacks, recently also against Georgia (R. Synovitz, *Georgian Government Accuses Russia Of Waging «Cyberwarfare»*, Radio Free Europe, 12.08.2008 <http: 1190477.html=\"\" commi=\"\" content=\"\" georgian_government_accuses_russia_of_cyberwar=\"\" www.rferl.org=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010; N.

Russian authorities continuously refuse to take action against the perpetrators.\n China’s role in cyberwarfare in rapidly increasing. According to the US Congress Committee, China is the sole national power able to threaten US cybersecurity defences, causing therefore a real threat to all other states, not in possession of the technology and infrastructure to withstand a potential attack (*2008 Report To the Congress Of the U.S.-China Economic And Security Review Commission*, p. 9, November 2008, http://www.uscc.gov). China is also alleged to be the initiator of most breaches of national database protection systems and stealing protected data. Chinese authorities however deny any responsibility for the attacks or any connection with the hackers.\n According to Shackelford, over 120 states are investing in electronic infrastructure which allows for the exercise of cyberwarfare (Shackelford, *supra* note 3, p. 12).\n Charter of the United Nations, 26 June, 1945, available at <http: charter=\"\" documents=\"\" en=\"\" www.un.org=\"\"></http:></http:>\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n\nAccording to Article 2 Paragraph 4 of the UNC “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state”. Although interfering with national databases, archives or electronic infrastructure may certainly be qualified as “using force”, the general nature of the prohibition in Article 2 Paragraph 4 contains very few practical means of protecting one’s sovereignty against attacks by another state. The narrow scope of responses is established in to Article 51 UNC, which confirms the right of states to resort to self-defence only if they are subject to “an armed attack.” Therefore the legality of an armed response in self-defence against a cyber-attack would be determined based on the legal possibility to qualify cyber-attacks as “armed attacks”.\nThe UNC does not provide a definition of “an armed attack”. The term closest to “an armed attack” as defined by the UN is “aggression”, therefore when attempting to define “an armed attack” the definition of “aggression” must be examined. According to the definition of aggression in the UN in resolution 3314, in principle both invasion and an attack against a state’s territory may be qualified as an act of aggression. A state may also be subject to a counter-attack when it opens its territory to the armed forces of an aggressor or supports the sending of armed bands or groups exercising armed force. The above indicates that Resolution 3314 cannot be relied on to qualify an attack on a state’s key infrastructure through its electronic network as an act of international aggression, since it does not constitute a physical invasion of state territory with the traditional means of armed force. Such a conclusion is confirmed by indications made in the General Assembly travaux préparatoires accompanying resolution 3314, where it was explicitly said that any other act outside the scope defined, such as ones resulting in economic consequences, may not be regarded as acts of international aggression.\nThe scope of the legal exercise of “armed force” allowed by international law may be defined only when using the definition of “aggression”. As shown above “aggression” is defined very narrowly and the allowed use of armed self-defence\n Article 3 of the Nations General Assembly Resolution 3314 (XXIX). Definition of Aggression.\n According to Czaplinski and Wyrozumska, such a narrowing of the scope of the definition was intentional and resulted from the rejection of Brazil’s proposal to include economic attacks as part of the definition of international aggression (W. Czaplinski, A. Wyrozumska, Prawo międzynarodowe publiczne. Zagadnienia systemowe (Public international law. Systemic issues), CH Beck, Warszawa: 1999, p. 486).\nJoanna Kulesza\nis excluded against any attacks outside its scope. Since cyber-attacks fall outside this narrow scope, they may not be relied on as grounds for an internationally legitimate armed self-defence, contrary to the numerous statements made by national authorities.\nHowever, the term \"use of force\", prohibited by Article 2 Paragraph 4 of the UNC, has been defined extensively in a sequence of other UN documents and its scope is much broader. When categorizing cyber-attacks in the context of international law this definition may prove very useful.\nThe Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations recognizes any acts of intervention, direct or indirect, \"for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State\" as a violation of international law. It explicitly defines as illegal not only armed intervention, but \"all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements\". According to its terms, \"no State may use or encourage the use of economic political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind\" (emphasis added). A similar requirement is provided by the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, which in Article 32 stipulates that \"no State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights\" (emphasis added).\nThese documents would allow for an interpretation that interference with a state's critical electronic infrastructure would fall within the \"any other type of measures to coerce another State\" and therefore constitute a breach of a legally binding international obligation. Such a breach may be demonstrated especially when the measures used were aimed at \"coercing another State in order to obtain from it the subordination\" (in the case of attack against Estonia, such subordination would mean the reversal of the decision relocating the Red Army soldiers monument from the centre of Tallinn to its outskirts) or \"to secure from it advantages of any kind\" (e.g. the \"advantages\" to any state flowing from the theft of another state's secrets).\nTherefore a cyber-attack may easily be regarded as a breach of an international obligation, but at the same time it cannot be regarded as an act of armed\n\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n\n# 3. PRINCIPLES OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERNATIONALLY WRONGFUL ACTS – A BRIEF SUMMARY\nAs explained above, while cyber-attacks can hardly be regarded as constituting “acts of aggression,” they may be regarded as breaches of universal international obligations, resulting in state responsibility therefore.\nThe principles for state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts were initially established by the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1927 in the\n The only action taken by the NATO parties in reaction to the Estonia attack was the creation of a Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, the actions of which are headed by Estonia (M. Chudziński, *Estonia poprowadzi NATO do cyberwojny* (Estonia will lead NATO into cyberwar), Gazeta Wyborcza, 2.04.2008 <http: 1,90339,5081266.html=\"\" technique=\"\" technique,=\"\" technologie.gazeta.pl=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010).\n Some arguments to the contrary are presented by D. Delibasis, showing that the character of an armed attack should be defined rather by the consequence it brings than the sort of weapons used to conduct it (Delibasis, *supra* note 1., p. 17 ff., see also, D. Delibasis, *State Use of Force in Cyberspace for Self-Defence: A New Challenge for a New Century*, 8 Peace Conflict and Development: An Interdisciplinary Journal 13 (2006), where the author analyses the application of the law of war to conflicts in cyberspace).\n Such an extensive interpretation of Article 51 of the UNC was presented by the one of the officials from the US Defence Department, who believes that a wide scale cyber-attack may be regarded as justification for a traditional armed response (Department of Defence, Office of General Counsel, *An Assessment Of International Legal Issues In Information Operations*, May 1999, p. 20 <http: awc=\"\" awcgate=\"\" dod-io-legal=\"\" dod-io-legal.pdf=\"\" www.au.af.mil=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010). The Department representative went on to say that there is no certainty regarding the application of international law principles in cyberspace. He referred to Article 51 of the UNC and stated that according to its provisions a cyber-attack would have to be regarded as an “armed attack” in order to allow for an armed self defence. However regarding the scale of a cyber-attack, even if it does not constitute an armed attack, it always endangers state security. Therefore the consequences of a cyber-attack are much more important than the means used for conducting it (*Ibidem*, p. 22).\n “An attack against the telecommunications and electronic power industries of Russia would, by virtue of its catastrophic consequences, completely overlap with the use of weapons of mass destruction. (...) Russia reserves the right to respond to an information warfare attack with nuclear weapons” (see, Shackelford, *supra* note 3, p. 28).</http:></http:>\nJoanna Kulesza\nLotus case. The Court asserted that international law acknowledges the rule of state responsibility for breach of international obligations and the duty to indemnify for any damage resulting from such breach. Over time international law practice elaborated a set of framework principles establishing states’ responsibility under international law. These principles require the ascertainment of three prerequisites. First, there must be a breach of an international obligation and harm to a state interest protected by law. Second, the harmful result must be attributable to a state and its authorities. International law foresees a number of exceptions to this principle, the occurrence of which allows a state to free itself from any responsibility. Therefore in order for a state to be held responsible, a third negative prerequisite must be met: none of these particular exceptions can apply.\nArticle 3 of the International Law Commission (ILC) Draft Articles describes in more detail the elements of an internationally wrongful act of a state. An act may be regarded as internationally wrongful when the harmful action or omission is attributable to the a state under international law and at the same time that conduct constitutes a breach of an international obligation. The term of “constituting a breach of an international obligation” was further defined by the International Court of Justice in the Barcelona Traction decision. The Court distinguished two groups of international obligations of a state. The first category consists of *erga omnes* obligations, which in principle result from peremptory norms (*jus cogens*), or in other words, norms that the state is obliged to fulfil towards the international community as a whole. The second group of international obligations are those which bind states bilaterally – *inter partes* – and result only from a consensual agreements (usually written, but sometimes also customary) among or between the particular parties involved.\n *France v. Turkey* (the Lotus Case), PCIJ [1927], PCIJ Reports, series A, No. 10.\n It has to be emphasized that that there is no international, global organization safeguarding these principles. These rules, as all of international customary law, are the result of the common practice of states and it is the states themselves that decide on the way to resolve disputes resulting from the differences in their perception or application. So far these principles have only been reduced to writing in a draft of an international treaty done by the International Law Commission: Of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility: Titles and texts of articles adopted by the Drafting Committee, International Law Commission, A/CN.4/L.472; further referred to as the ILC Draft Articles.).\n Ibidem, Art. 3.\n Ibidem, Art. 5.\n Ibidem, Chapter V.\n *Barcelona Traction*, Light and Power Company, Limited, Belgium v. Spain, [1970] ICJ Rep 174.\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n\nAs mentioned above, the mechanism of international state responsibility also involves a negative prerequisite. A state may escape international responsibility for particular reasons foreseen by international law, and in order to be held responsible, no such reasons may appear. Those grounds, enumerated in Chapter V of the ILC Draft Articles include: consent validly given by a state (article 29), countermeasures in respect of an internationally wrongful act (article 30), force majeure and fortuitous events (article 31), extreme distress, required for the purpose of saving human life (article 32), state of necessity (article 33) and self-defence, in accordance with Article 51 of the UNC (article 34).\nConsequently, in order to establish the international responsibility of a state for executing or ordering the execution of a cyber-attack it is necessary, as a first step, to show the international rule that such an attack violates. The second step of the analysis consists in attributing such an action to a particular state.\nLinking a cyber-attack to the breach of an international norm is rather simple. As explained above, Article 2(4) of the UNC prohibits the use of force in international relations and is regarded as a peremptory norm. On the basis of the already cited UN documents (i.e. the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States) one may qualify attacks on key state infrastructures conducted through electronic means as \"any other type of measure to coerce another State\" (emphasis added), therefore constituting a breach of international law.\nWhat is more difficult, however, is the attribution of a cyber-attack to a particular state, i.e. one that initiated it or permitted it. As mentioned above, a state may be held responsible for its own actions (actions of its organs) as well as the actions of private persons acting on its behalf or order. Given the present state of technological development, determining the physical localization of a computer from which a cyber-attack was conducted is not extensively difficult. However, the very\n Art. 5 of the ILC Draft Articles. Traditionally acts of state were regarded as those executed directly by its government or head of state, or on their direct order. Presently a state may be held responsible also for acts of its parliament or judicial branch. When responsibility for the acts of its legislative body is considered, a state may be held responsible for its actions as well as omissions (e.g. not providing a sufficient protection of the rights of state nationals or residents).\n Ibidem, Articles 7 and 8.\nJoanna Kulesza\nfact of physical localization of a computer used for a cyber-attack does not (and should not) allow for attributing that cyber-attack to a particular state. Such an assumption would be unwarranted, since a state cannot be held responsible for the actions of all its residents operating hardware or software located within its territory. In the traditional notion of state responsibility, a state is only be responsible for those of its residents it explicitly authorizes to act on its behalf. Proving a formal link between a state resident and a state authority in the case of cyber-attacks might be exceedingly difficult and thus negate the possibility of any reparations.\nHowever, a state can also be held responsible for a breach of an international obligation not only for its actions but for its omissions, i.e. for not preventing a particular attack to take place.\n# 4. ATTRIBUTION OF A CYBER-ATTACK TO A STATE\nBoth the legal doctrine and judicial interpretation make clear that a state may be held responsible not only for its actions, but also for its omissions, in particular for the failure to exercise due diligence. Such an interpretation finds support in the wording of Article 14(3) of the ILC Draft Articles, which provides that a state may be held responsible for the conduct of organs of an insurrectional movement, if such an attribution is legitimate under international law. As explained by Crawford in his commentary to the ILC Draft Articles, this article refers to a situation in which a state is in “breach of its obligation to prevent a given event”. Such an obligation is usually formulated as an obligation to render best efforts, calling for a state to take all “reasonable and necessary” measures in order to prevent a given event, however, without warranting that such an event will not occur.\n Both Russian and Chinese authorities consistently deny any formal links with the cyber-attackers.\n Czaplinski and Wyrozumska give an example of breach of the due diligence standard via neglect to take up measures aimed at protecting particular persons or objects from attacks, combined with refusal to punish the perpetrators of such attacks and an explicit support of such acts aimed at harming the interests of third states or persons (Czaplinski and Wyrozumska, supra note 13, p. 436). All these prerequisites are fulfilled in the case of the Estonia attacks, particularly in the light of the recent announcement by Russian authorities admitting their initial support for the actions of the “Nashi” organization; see also I. Brownlie, *System of the Law of Nations, Part I, State responsibility*, Oxford University Press, Oxford: 1983, p. 45), where the author points to a legal mechanism for the establishment of state responsible for an act based on its omission and a breach of international law resulting from it.\n J. Crawford (ed.), *The International Law Commission’s articles on state responsibility: introduction, text, and commentaries*, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge: 2002, p. 140.\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n\nIn international jurisprudence this mechanism is best reflected in the ICJ case concerning the United States diplomatic and consular staff in Teheran. In its decision the ICJ found, that although the storming of the U.S. embassy in Teheran may not be attributed to Iran, such finding does not free that state from responsibility. According to the ICJ decision, Iranian authorities may be held responsible for having “failed to take appropriate steps”, where such steps were evidently necessary. The Court found that the “inaction” of Iranian authorities was contrary to its international obligations to protect the US diplomatic personnel. This inaction constituted therefore a breach of an international obligation of Iran towards the USA, resulting from the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. As correctly pointed out by Bratspies and Miller, the Court found that the due diligence standard must be unfulfilled in order to attribute state responsibility to the actions of natural persons.\nThe very same legal construction could be used in the case of a state not providing sufficient international protection from cyber-attacks conducted by its residents from its territory. A *jus cogens* norm obliging governments to protect the sovereignty and integrity of other states results not only from Article 2 (4) UNC, but also from a peremptory customary principle of the same substance. Such an obligation may be understood as encompassing both an intolerability of any active intrusion into the internal affairs of another state, as well as a due diligence requirement to prevent such an intrusion into foreign sovereignty from one’s own territory. As correctly pointed out by Vark, this produces an obligation on the part of any state from whose territory an internationally wrongful act is conducted to cooperate with the victim state in a manner necessary to eliminate the harmful act, or – if it may not be prevented – its consequences. Therefore if a state itself is not capable of protecting the interests of another sovereign, it may not allow for private persons acting from within its territory to inflict damage or create danger to that sovereign while protected by the inflicting state’s\n Brownlie, *supra* note 31, pp. 162–163.\n See also footnote 3.\n *United States of America v. Iran (Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran)*, [1980] ICJ Rep 3.\n *Ibidem*, p. 29.\n M. Bratspies, A.

Vark, *State Responsibility for Private Armed Groups in the Context of Terrorism*, Juridica International XI/2006, p. 192.\nJoanna Kulesza\nimmunity. Under such an interpretation Russia’s refusal to prosecute the perpetrators of the attack against Estonia would constitute an internationally wrongful act, while Israeli involvement and punishment of the actors behind the Solar Sunrise incident exonerates that state from international responsibility.\n# 5. THE NEED FOR INTERNATIONAL REGULATION OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\nIn the light of the above considerations, the practical solution to the urgent problem of legal categorization of attacks on state sovereignty conducted with the use of internet would be to initiate an international debate on the applicability of traditional state responsibility principles to this new category of threats to international peace and security. In light of the statements made by national authorities from countries that are susceptible to if not subject to cyber-attacks (i.e. allowing for nuclear response to cyberwarfare), such a debate seems to be essential. In particular there is a need for an international consensus on the criteria which have to be fulfilled by a state in order to avoid international responsibility for lack of due diligence in protecting other sovereigns from cyber-attacks. Such an accord would alleviate the possibility of dangerous reactions by particular states in response to cyber-threats to their sovereignty. Such a debate should be initiated by determining the legal character of cyber-attacks and categorizing them, while stipulating the countermeasures available to the states attacked. In the course of such a debate, the principles for allowable self-defence against cyber-attacks should be set (e.g. would preventive measures be allowed? If so, of what character?). The second crucial issue would be to establish the standards for releasing a state from international responsibility for not providing due diligence: would the adoption of specific provisions in national criminal laws be sufficient, or rather would state authorities be required to effectively initiate a criminal investigation? It should be also clarified whether a due diligence standard can be set post factum – after an attack has already taken place.\nThe analysis provided in this article may serve as a starting point for such a debate. It seems clear that state responsibility must be based on a due diligence requirement rather than the obligation to show a formal link between the state authorities and the actions of actual perpetrators. An important element of any international accord on international responsibility for cyber-attacks would be\n Within such a discussion the principle of proportionality might also be discussed in order to ascertain the scope of counter-measures permitted to a state.\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n\n As with all activities in cyberspace, resort to traditional jurisdictional principles is bound to result in legal chaos, particularly should authorities decide to call upon the effects or the protective principle. For more on the issue of the application of traditional jurisdiction principles to cyberspace and its consequences, see: J. Kulesza, Internet Governance and the Jurisdiction of States; Justification of the Need For an International Regulation of Cyberspace; third annual meeting of the Global Internet Governance Academic Network (GigaNet), Hyderabad, India, December 2008 <http: papers.cfm?abstract_id=\"1445452\" papers.ssrn.com=\"\" sol3=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010.\n An example of such a far-reaching analogy was presented by Shackelford, (Shackelford, supra note 3, p. 27 ff), e.g. through drawing a parallel with the diplomatic law regime, law of the sea, or telecommunications regulations. Even though those regimes may provide a good example of how a consensus on the issue discussed may be shaped, their analogical application could lead to unpredictable results.\n This would, however, require serious organisational changes, as the present, open forum scheme has not fulfilled the tasks assigned to it.

It analyses the possibility to recognize a cyber-attack as an act of international aggression and shows existing difficulties at the present state of the international debate. It then turns to the traditional notion of state responsibility for lack of due diligence as a source of state's responsibility for cyber-attacks. Such due diligence should be guaranteed through sufficient criminal law regulations that are properly executed in order to effectively prevent and prosecute electronic attacks. In this context the article posits that an international debate is required with the aim of establishing international guidelines. The results of such a debate should than allow for the harmonization of national criminal law regulations. Although the author points to the need for an international debate on the system for protection against cyber-attacks on states' key electronic infrastructure, she also emphasizes already existing international obligations for states to take responsibility for attacks conducted from their territory.\n## 1. INTERNATIONAL ATTACKS IN CYBERSPACE\nThe 21st century has brought with it new forms of international aggression. One of the reasons for this inglorious evolution has been the creation and expansion of the world wide electronic network – the Internet. Global international\n* Joanna Kulesza, Ph.D. is an assistant professor, Chair of International Law and International Relations, Faculty of Law and Administration, University of Łódź, Poland.\nJoanna Kulesza\ndevelopment has resulted not only in e-administration and e-government, but also in computer-controlled power plants, computer operated flight and airport control systems, and the massive popularity of on-line banking, both for private individuals and international companies. Therefore the security of such crucial elements of national infrastructure as state airports and power supplies has become only as secure as the information technology used to operate them. States are now vulnerable in new ways, thus new means of state protection are called for.\nThis new category of risks to state security has been integrated into an already existing definition of the term Information Warfare (IW). This term has historically been used to describe actions undertaken in order to “disrupt the communications of an opponent” and give him a false image of reality, however the 21st century has now given this term a whole new meaning, with a wider and more diverse scope than ever before.\nRecent attacks conducted with the use of the internet (cyber-attacks) onto the key information structures of sovereign states, such as 2007 attack on Estonia\n D. Delibasis, *The Right to National Self-defence: In Information Warfare Operations*, Arena Books, Bury St Edmunds: 2007, p. 25.\n Electronic attacks were a crucial factor in the Gulf War in 1991 (*Ibidem*, p. 31 ff.). However, IW took on a new, more comprehensive shape after the 9/11 attacks. According to the US Defence Department plan by the codename of Virtual Battlefield, all actions and attacks can be initiated with the use of an advanced electronic system (*Ibidem*, p. 35 ff.). What is more, presently the most advanced and comprehensive system of defence against cyber-attackers belongs to the US Department of Defence, due to the fact that the US military security system that is the target of most cyber-attacks worldwide. The average number of cyber-attacks upon US national defence system computers grew from slightly over 200 in 1994 up to over 40.000 by the end of 2002. That data however may not be regarded as accurate, since according to the U.S. Defence Information Systems Agency only one out of 150 attacks can actually be identified (*Ibidem*, p. 38 ff.). The cost of repairing the damage caused by cyber-attacks grew to over 100 million USD in the second half of 2009, as estimated by the US Defence Department (see *100 milionów dolarów za naprawę szkód wyrządzonych przez cyberprzestępców* (100 million dollars to repair damages caused by cyber-criminals), Gazeta Wyborcza 04.04.2009, <http: 1,85253,6478435,100_millionow_dolarow_za_naprawe_szkod_wyrzadzonych.html=\"\" conclusion=\"\" de=\"\" et=\"\" technique=\"\" technique.=\"\" national=\"\" of=\"\" order=\"\" order.=\"\" public=\"\" repair=\"\" rechrologie.gazeta.pl=\"\" re.=\"\" te=\"\" tec=\"\" using=\"\" wayrządzonych.html=\"\"> accessed 28 April 2010).\n Before April 2007 Estonia prided itself on being one of the most “wired” countries in the world (due to which it was nicknamed eStonia). In April 2007 the electronic infrastructure of Estonia became the target of a synchronised attack by hackers, operating primarily from Russian territory. Estonia blamed Russia for initiating and supporting those attacks (1 Traynor, *Russia accused of unleashing cyberwar to disable Estonia*, The Guardian, 17.05.2007 <http: 17=\"\" 2007=\"\" may=\"\" may=\"\" topstories3.russia=\"\" world=\"\" www.guardian.co.uk=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010). According to Russian authorities, the attacks were a civil initiative; although coordinated by a youth organisation, supported by the Kremlin, called “Nashi” (“Ours”), who claimed credit for the attack, stating however that it had no support from national authorities</http:></http:>\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n\n(Ch. Clover, Kremlin-backed group behind Estonia cyber blitz, Financial Times, 11.03.2009 <http: 0=\"\" 57536d5a-0ddc-11de-8ea3-0000779fd2ac.html=\"\" cms=\"\" s=\"\" www.ft.com=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010). The recent statement of one of Prime Minister Putin’s closest colleagues could be regarded as claiming credit for the attack also by Russian authorities (R.

These attacks were aimed at Pentagon databases and the confidential information contained therein. Again Russian authorities distanced themselves from the attacks (Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 40).\n The codename Solar Sunrise was adopted for a series of attacks conducted in February of 1998 aimed at secret electronic data of the United States. Using sniffers (programmes searching electronic records without the awareness of the database administrators) on US Air Force computers, unknown culprits broke into the databases. IP analysis traced all the attacks to a service provider in Texas. Further investigation however showed, that that Texas provider was himself a victim of an attack, initiated from Israeli territory. Israeli authorities initiated a criminal investigation against the attackers, which resulted in identifying and punishing the perpetrators (Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 41).\n i2010 is the EU policy framework for the information society and media.

The author attempts to define the legal character of cyber-attacks, in particular whether such attacks may be regarded as constituting acts of international aggression. Should they constitute “armed attacks”, they would allow a recourse to measures foreseen by the international legal order, including armed self-defence as envisioned by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter (UNC). It is also important to establish whether the attacked sovereign is entitled to reparations, and if so – when a cyber-attack can be attributed to a state and its authorities. Since there is not yet any particular international regulation on that matter, presently one has to apply already existing international law mechanisms to this new and unique situation. The author attempts to identify possible new mechanisms as well as required modifications to existing ones.\n Russia, next to China, is the country most often accused of cyber-attacks, recently also against Georgia (R. Synovitz, *Georgian Government Accuses Russia Of Waging «Cyberwarfare»*, Radio Free Europe, 12.08.2008 <http: 1190477.html=\"\" commi=\"\" content=\"\" georgian_government_accuses_russia_of_cyberwar=\"\" www.rferl.org=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010; N. Shachtman, *Top Georgian Official: Moscow Cyber Attacked Us – We Just Can’t Prove It*, Wired Magazine 11.03.2009 <http: 03=\"\" 2009=\"\" georgia-blames=\"\" dangerroom=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></http:> accessed 29 April 2010. Russian authorities continuously refuse to take action against the perpetrators.\n China’s role in cyberwarfare in rapidly increasing. According to the US Congress Committee, China is the sole national power able to threaten US cybersecurity defences, causing therefore a real threat to all other states, not in possession of the technology and infrastructure to withstand a potential attack (*2008 Report To the Congress Of the U.S.-China Economic And Security Review Commission*, p. 9, November 2008, http://www.uscc.gov). China is also alleged to be the initiator of most breaches of national database protection systems and stealing protected data. Chinese authorities however deny any responsibility for the attacks or any connection with the hackers.\n According to Shackelford, over 120 states are investing in electronic infrastructure which allows for the exercise of cyberwarfare (Shackelford, *supra* note 3, p. 12).\n Charter of the United Nations, 26 June, 1945, available at <http: charter=\"\" documents=\"\" en=\"\" www.un.org=\"\"></http:></http:>\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n\nAccording to Article 2 Paragraph 4 of the UNC “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state”. Although interfering with national databases, archives or electronic infrastructure may certainly be qualified as “using force”, the general nature of the prohibition in Article 2 Paragraph 4 contains very few practical means of protecting one’s sovereignty against attacks by another state. The narrow scope of responses is established in to Article 51 UNC, which confirms the right of states to resort to self-defence only if they are subject to “an armed attack.” Therefore the legality of an armed response in self-defence against a cyber-attack would be determined based on the legal possibility to qualify cyber-attacks as “armed attacks”.\nThe UNC does not provide a definition of “an armed attack”. The term closest to “an armed attack” as defined by the UN is “aggression”, therefore when attempting to define “an armed attack” the definition of “aggression” must be examined. According to the definition of aggression in the UN in resolution 3314, in principle both invasion and an attack against a state’s territory may be qualified as an act of aggression. A state may also be subject to a counter-attack when it opens its territory to the armed forces of an aggressor or supports the sending of armed bands or groups exercising armed force. The above indicates that Resolution 3314 cannot be relied on to qualify an attack on a state’s key infrastructure through its electronic network as an act of international aggression, since it does not constitute a physical invasion of state territory with the traditional means of armed force. Such a conclusion is confirmed by indications made in the General Assembly travaux préparatoires accompanying resolution 3314, where it was explicitly said that any other act outside the scope defined, such as ones resulting in economic consequences, may not be regarded as acts of international aggression.\nThe scope of the legal exercise of “armed force” allowed by international law may be defined only when using the definition of “aggression”. As shown above “aggression” is defined very narrowly and the allowed use of armed self-defence\n Article 3 of the Nations General Assembly Resolution 3314 (XXIX). Definition of Aggression.\n According to Czaplinski and Wyrozumska, such a narrowing of the scope of the definition was intentional and resulted from the rejection of Brazil’s proposal to include economic attacks as part of the definition of international aggression (W.

Systemic issues), CH Beck, Warszawa: 1999, p. 486).\nJoanna Kulesza\nis excluded against any attacks outside its scope. Since cyber-attacks fall outside this narrow scope, they may not be relied on as grounds for an internationally legitimate armed self-defence, contrary to the numerous statements made by national authorities.\nHowever, the term \"use of force\", prohibited by Article 2 Paragraph 4 of the UNC, has been defined extensively in a sequence of other UN documents and its scope is much broader. When categorizing cyber-attacks in the context of international law this definition may prove very useful.\nThe Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations recognizes any acts of intervention, direct or indirect, \"for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State\" as a violation of international law. It explicitly defines as illegal not only armed intervention, but \"all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements\". According to its terms, \"no State may use or encourage the use of economic political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind\" (emphasis added). A similar requirement is provided by the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, which in Article 32 stipulates that \"no State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights\" (emphasis added).\nThese documents would allow for an interpretation that interference with a state's critical electronic infrastructure would fall within the \"any other type of measures to coerce another State\" and therefore constitute a breach of a legally binding international obligation. Such a breach may be demonstrated especially when the measures used were aimed at \"coercing another State in order to obtain from it the subordination\" (in the case of attack against Estonia, such subordination would mean the reversal of the decision relocating the Red Army soldiers monument from the centre of Tallinn to its outskirts) or \"to secure from it advantages of any kind\" (e.g. the \"advantages\" to any state flowing from the theft of another state's secrets).\nTherefore a cyber-attack may easily be regarded as a breach of an international obligation, but at the same time it cannot be regarded as an act of armed\n\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n\n# 3. PRINCIPLES OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERNATIONALLY WRONGFUL ACTS – A BRIEF SUMMARY\nAs explained above, while cyber-attacks can hardly be regarded as constituting “acts of aggression,” they may be regarded as breaches of universal international obligations, resulting in state responsibility therefore.\nThe principles for state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts were initially established by the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1927 in the\n The only action taken by the NATO parties in reaction to the Estonia attack was the creation of a Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, the actions of which are headed by Estonia (M. Chudziński, *Estonia poprowadzi NATO do cyberwojny* (Estonia will lead NATO into cyberwar), Gazeta Wyborcza, 2.04.2008 <http: 1,90339,5081266.html=\"\" technique=\"\" technique,=\"\" technologie.gazeta.pl=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010).\n Some arguments to the contrary are presented by D. Delibasis, showing that the character of an armed attack should be defined rather by the consequence it brings than the sort of weapons used to conduct it (Delibasis, *supra* note 1., p. 17 ff., see also, D. Delibasis, *State Use of Force in Cyberspace for Self-Defence: A New Challenge for a New Century*, 8 Peace Conflict and Development: An Interdisciplinary Journal 13 (2006), where the author analyses the application of the law of war to conflicts in cyberspace).\n Such an extensive interpretation of Article 51 of the UNC was presented by the one of the officials from the US Defence Department, who believes that a wide scale cyber-attack may be regarded as justification for a traditional armed response (Department of Defence, Office of General Counsel, *An Assessment Of International Legal Issues In Information Operations*, May 1999, p. 20 <http: awc=\"\" awcgate=\"\" dod-io-legal=\"\" dod-io-legal.pdf=\"\" www.au.af.mil=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010). The Department representative went on to say that there is no certainty regarding the application of international law principles in cyberspace. He referred to Article 51 of the UNC and stated that according to its provisions a cyber-attack would have to be regarded as an “armed attack” in order to allow for an armed self defence. However regarding the scale of a cyber-attack, even if it does not constitute an armed attack, it always endangers state security. Therefore the consequences of a cyber-attack are much more important than the means used for conducting it (*Ibidem*, p. 22).\n “An attack against the telecommunications and electronic power industries of Russia would, by virtue of its catastrophic consequences, completely overlap with the use of weapons of mass destruction. (...) Russia reserves the right to respond to an information warfare attack with nuclear weapons” (see, Shackelford, *supra* note 3, p. 28).</http:></http:>\nJoanna Kulesza\nLotus case. The Court asserted that international law acknowledges the rule of state responsibility for breach of international obligations and the duty to indemnify for any damage resulting from such breach. Over time international law practice elaborated a set of framework principles establishing states’ responsibility under international law. These principles require the ascertainment of three prerequisites. First, there must be a breach of an international obligation and harm to a state interest protected by law. Second, the harmful result must be attributable to a state and its authorities. International law foresees a number of exceptions to this principle, the occurrence of which allows a state to free itself from any responsibility. Therefore in order for a state to be held responsible, a third negative prerequisite must be met: none of these particular exceptions can apply.\nArticle 3 of the International Law Commission (ILC) Draft Articles describes in more detail the elements of an internationally wrongful act of a state. An act may be regarded as internationally wrongful when the harmful action or omission is attributable to the a state under international law and at the same time that conduct constitutes a breach of an international obligation. The term of “constituting a breach of an international obligation” was further defined by the International Court of Justice in the Barcelona Traction decision. The Court distinguished two groups of international obligations of a state. The first category consists of *erga omnes* obligations, which in principle result from peremptory norms (*jus cogens*), or in other words, norms that the state is obliged to fulfil towards the international community as a whole. The second group of international obligations are those which bind states bilaterally – *inter partes* – and result only from a consensual agreements (usually written, but sometimes also customary) among or between the particular parties involved.\n *France v. Turkey* (the Lotus Case), PCIJ [1927], PCIJ Reports, series A, No. 10.\n It has to be emphasized that that there is no international, global organization safeguarding these principles. These rules, as all of international customary law, are the result of the common practice of states and it is the states themselves that decide on the way to resolve disputes resulting from the differences in their perception or application. So far these principles have only been reduced to writing in a draft of an international treaty done by the International Law Commission: Of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility: Titles and texts of articles adopted by the Drafting Committee, International Law Commission, A/CN.4/L.472; further referred to as the ILC Draft Articles.).\n Ibidem, Art. 3.\n Ibidem, Art. 5.\n Ibidem, Chapter V.\n *Barcelona Traction*, Light and Power Company, Limited, Belgium v. Spain, [1970] ICJ Rep 174.\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n\nAs mentioned above, the mechanism of international state responsibility also involves a negative prerequisite. A state may escape international responsibility for particular reasons foreseen by international law, and in order to be held responsible, no such reasons may appear. Those grounds, enumerated in Chapter V of the ILC Draft Articles include: consent validly given by a state (article 29), countermeasures in respect of an internationally wrongful act (article 30), force majeure and fortuitous events (article 31), extreme distress, required for the purpose of saving human life (article 32), state of necessity (article 33) and self-defence, in accordance with Article 51 of the UNC (article 34).\nConsequently, in order to establish the international responsibility of a state for executing or ordering the execution of a cyber-attack it is necessary, as a first step, to show the international rule that such an attack violates. The second step of the analysis consists in attributing such an action to a particular state.\nLinking a cyber-attack to the breach of an international norm is rather simple. As explained above, Article 2(4) of the UNC prohibits the use of force in international relations and is regarded as a peremptory norm. On the basis of the already cited UN documents (i.e. the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States) one may qualify attacks on key state infrastructures conducted through electronic means as \"any other type of measure to coerce another State\" (emphasis added), therefore constituting a breach of international law.\nWhat is more difficult, however, is the attribution of a cyber-attack to a particular state, i.e. one that initiated it or permitted it. As mentioned above, a state may be held responsible for its own actions (actions of its organs) as well as the actions of private persons acting on its behalf or order. Given the present state of technological development, determining the physical localization of a computer from which a cyber-attack was conducted is not extensively difficult. However, the very\n Art. 5 of the ILC Draft Articles. Traditionally acts of state were regarded as those executed directly by its government or head of state, or on their direct order. Presently a state may be held responsible also for acts of its parliament or judicial branch. When responsibility for the acts of its legislative body is considered, a state may be held responsible for its actions as well as omissions (e.g. not providing a sufficient protection of the rights of state nationals or residents).\n Ibidem, Articles 7 and 8.\nJoanna Kulesza\nfact of physical localization of a computer used for a cyber-attack does not (and should not) allow for attributing that cyber-attack to a particular state. Such an assumption would be unwarranted, since a state cannot be held responsible for the actions of all its residents operating hardware or software located within its territory. In the traditional notion of state responsibility, a state is only be responsible for those of its residents it explicitly authorizes to act on its behalf. Proving a formal link between a state resident and a state authority in the case of cyber-attacks might be exceedingly difficult and thus negate the possibility of any reparations.\nHowever, a state can also be held responsible for a breach of an international obligation not only for its actions but for its omissions, i.e. for not preventing a particular attack to take place.\n# 4. ATTRIBUTION OF A CYBER-ATTACK TO A STATE\nBoth the legal doctrine and judicial interpretation make clear that a state may be held responsible not only for its actions, but also for its omissions, in particular for the failure to exercise due diligence. Such an interpretation finds support in the wording of Article 14(3) of the ILC Draft Articles, which provides that a state may be held responsible for the conduct of organs of an insurrectional movement, if such an attribution is legitimate under international law. As explained by Crawford in his commentary to the ILC Draft Articles, this article refers to a situation in which a state is in “breach of its obligation to prevent a given event”. Such an obligation is usually formulated as an obligation to render best efforts, calling for a state to take all “reasonable and necessary” measures in order to prevent a given event, however, without warranting that such an event will not occur.\n Both Russian and Chinese authorities consistently deny any formal links with the cyber-attackers.\n Czaplinski and Wyrozumska give an example of breach of the due diligence standard via neglect to take up measures aimed at protecting particular persons or objects from attacks, combined with refusal to punish the perpetrators of such attacks and an explicit support of such acts aimed at harming the interests of third states or persons (Czaplinski and Wyrozumska, supra note 13, p. 436). All these prerequisites are fulfilled in the case of the Estonia attacks, particularly in the light of the recent announcement by Russian authorities admitting their initial support for the actions of the “Nashi” organization; see also I. Brownlie, *System of the Law of Nations, Part I, State responsibility*, Oxford University Press, Oxford: 1983, p. 45), where the author points to a legal mechanism for the establishment of state responsible for an act based on its omission and a breach of international law resulting from it.\n J. Crawford (ed.), *The International Law Commission’s articles on state responsibility: introduction, text, and commentaries*, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge: 2002, p. 140.\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n\nIn international jurisprudence this mechanism is best reflected in the ICJ case concerning the United States diplomatic and consular staff in Teheran. In its decision the ICJ found, that although the storming of the U.S. embassy in Teheran may not be attributed to Iran, such finding does not free that state from responsibility. According to the ICJ decision, Iranian authorities may be held responsible for having “failed to take appropriate steps”, where such steps were evidently necessary. The Court found that the “inaction” of Iranian authorities was contrary to its international obligations to protect the US diplomatic personnel. This inaction constituted therefore a breach of an international obligation of Iran towards the USA, resulting from the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. As correctly pointed out by Bratspies and Miller, the Court found that the due diligence standard must be unfulfilled in order to attribute state responsibility to the actions of natural persons.\nThe very same legal construction could be used in the case of a state not providing sufficient international protection from cyber-attacks conducted by its residents from its territory. A *jus cogens* norm obliging governments to protect the sovereignty and integrity of other states results not only from Article 2 (4) UNC, but also from a peremptory customary principle of the same substance. Such an obligation may be understood as encompassing both an intolerability of any active intrusion into the internal affairs of another state, as well as a due diligence requirement to prevent such an intrusion into foreign sovereignty from one’s own territory. As correctly pointed out by Vark, this produces an obligation on the part of any state from whose territory an internationally wrongful act is conducted to cooperate with the victim state in a manner necessary to eliminate the harmful act, or – if it may not be prevented – its consequences. Therefore if a state itself is not capable of protecting the interests of another sovereign, it may not allow for private persons acting from within its territory to inflict damage or create danger to that sovereign while protected by the inflicting state’s\n Brownlie, *supra* note 31, pp. 162–163.\n See also footnote 3.\n *United States of America v.

Under such an interpretation Russia’s refusal to prosecute the perpetrators of the attack against Estonia would constitute an internationally wrongful act, while Israeli involvement and punishment of the actors behind the Solar Sunrise incident exonerates that state from international responsibility.\n# 5. THE NEED FOR INTERNATIONAL REGULATION OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\nIn the light of the above considerations, the practical solution to the urgent problem of legal categorization of attacks on state sovereignty conducted with the use of internet would be to initiate an international debate on the applicability of traditional state responsibility principles to this new category of threats to international peace and security. In light of the statements made by national authorities from countries that are susceptible to if not subject to cyber-attacks (i.e. allowing for nuclear response to cyberwarfare), such a debate seems to be essential. In particular there is a need for an international consensus on the criteria which have to be fulfilled by a state in order to avoid international responsibility for lack of due diligence in protecting other sovereigns from cyber-attacks. Such an accord would alleviate the possibility of dangerous reactions by particular states in response to cyber-threats to their sovereignty. Such a debate should be initiated by determining the legal character of cyber-attacks and categorizing them, while stipulating the countermeasures available to the states attacked. In the course of such a debate, the principles for allowable self-defence against cyber-attacks should be set (e.g. would preventive measures be allowed? If so, of what character?). The second crucial issue would be to establish the standards for releasing a state from international responsibility for not providing due diligence: would the adoption of specific provisions in national criminal laws be sufficient, or rather would state authorities be required to effectively initiate a criminal investigation? It should be also clarified whether a due diligence standard can be set post factum – after an attack has already taken place.\nThe analysis provided in this article may serve as a starting point for such a debate. It seems clear that state responsibility must be based on a due diligence requirement rather than the obligation to show a formal link between the state authorities and the actions of actual perpetrators. An important element of any international accord on international responsibility for cyber-attacks would be\n Within such a discussion the principle of proportionality might also be discussed in order to ascertain the scope of counter-measures permitted to a state.\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n\n As with all activities in cyberspace, resort to traditional jurisdictional principles is bound to result in legal chaos, particularly should authorities decide to call upon the effects or the protective principle. For more on the issue of the application of traditional jurisdiction principles to cyberspace and its consequences, see: J. Kulesza, Internet Governance and the Jurisdiction of States; Justification of the Need For an International Regulation of Cyberspace; third annual meeting of the Global Internet Governance Academic Network (GigaNet), Hyderabad, India, December 2008 <http: papers.cfm?abstract_id=\"1445452\" papers.ssrn.com=\"\" sol3=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010.\n An example of such a far-reaching analogy was presented by Shackelford, (Shackelford, supra note 3, p. 27 ff), e.g. through drawing a parallel with the diplomatic law regime, law of the sea, or telecommunications regulations. Even though those regimes may provide a good example of how a consensus on the issue discussed may be shaped, their analogical application could lead to unpredictable results.\n This would, however, require serious organisational changes, as the present, open forum scheme has not fulfilled the tasks assigned to it.

It analyses the possibility to recognize a cyber-attack as an act of international aggression and shows existing difficulties at the present state of the international debate. It then turns to the traditional notion of state responsibility for lack of due diligence as a source of state's responsibility for cyber-attacks. Such due diligence should be guaranteed through sufficient criminal law regulations that are properly executed in order to effectively prevent and prosecute electronic attacks. In this context the article posits that an international debate is required with the aim of establishing international guidelines. The results of such a debate should than allow for the harmonization of national criminal law regulations. Although the author points to the need for an international debate on the system for protection against cyber-attacks on states' key electronic infrastructure, she also emphasizes already existing international obligations for states to take responsibility for attacks conducted from their territory.\n## 1. INTERNATIONAL ATTACKS IN CYBERSPACE\nThe 21st century has brought with it new forms of international aggression. One of the reasons for this inglorious evolution has been the creation and expansion of the world wide electronic network – the Internet. Global international\n* Joanna Kulesza, Ph.D. is an assistant professor, Chair of International Law and International Relations, Faculty of Law and Administration, University of Łódź, Poland.\nJoanna Kulesza\ndevelopment has resulted not only in e-administration and e-government, but also in computer-controlled power plants, computer operated flight and airport control systems, and the massive popularity of on-line banking, both for private individuals and international companies. Therefore the security of such crucial elements of national infrastructure as state airports and power supplies has become only as secure as the information technology used to operate them. States are now vulnerable in new ways, thus new means of state protection are called for.\nThis new category of risks to state security has been integrated into an already existing definition of the term Information Warfare (IW). This term has historically been used to describe actions undertaken in order to “disrupt the communications of an opponent” and give him a false image of reality,¹ however the 21st century has now given this term a whole new meaning, with a wider and more diverse scope than ever before.²\nRecent attacks conducted with the use of the internet (cyber-attacks) onto the key information structures of sovereign states, such as 2007 attack on Estonia³\n¹ D. Delibasis, *The Right to National Self-defence: In Information Warfare Operations*, Arena Books, Bury St Edmunds: 2007, p. 25.\n² Electronic attacks were a crucial factor in the Gulf War in 1991 (*Ibidem*, p. 31 ff.). However, IW took on a new, more comprehensive shape after the 9/11 attacks. According to the US Defence Department plan by the codename of Virtual Battlefield, all actions and attacks can be initiated with the use of an advanced electronic system (*Ibidem*, p. 35 ff.). What is more, presently the most advanced and comprehensive system of defence against cyber-attackers belongs to the US Department of Defence, due to the fact that the US military security system that is the target of most cyber-attacks worldwide. The average number of cyber-attacks upon US national defence system computers grew from slightly over 200 in 1994 up to over 40.000 by the end of 2002. That data however may not be regarded as accurate, since according to the U.S. Defence Information Systems Agency only one out of 150 attacks can actually be identified (*Ibidem*, p. 38 ff.). The cost of repairing the damage caused by cyber-attacks grew to over 100 million USD in the second half of 2009, as estimated by the US Defence Department (see *100 milionów dolarów za naprawę szkód wyrządzonych przez cyberprzestępców* (100 million dollars to repair damages caused by cyber-criminals), Gazeta Wyborcza 04.04.2009, <http: 1,85253,6478435,100_millionow_dolarow_za_naprawe_szkod_wyrzadzonych.html=\"\" conclusion=\"\" de=\"\" et=\"\" technique=\"\" technique.=\"\" national=\"\" of=\"\" order=\"\" order.=\"\" public=\"\" repair=\"\" rechrologie.gazeta.pl=\"\" re.=\"\" te=\"\" tec=\"\" using=\"\" wayrządzonych.html=\"\"> accessed 28 April 2010).\n³ Before April 2007 Estonia prided itself on being one of the most “wired” countries in the world (due to which it was nicknamed eStonia). In April 2007 the electronic infrastructure of Estonia became the target of a synchronised attack by hackers, operating primarily from Russian territory. Estonia blamed Russia for initiating and supporting those attacks (1 Traynor, *Russia accused of unleashing cyberwar to disable Estonia*, The Guardian, 17.05.2007 <http: 17=\"\" 2007=\"\" may=\"\" may=\"\" topstories3.russia=\"\" world=\"\" www.guardian.co.uk=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010). According to Russian authorities, the attacks were a civil initiative; although coordinated by a youth organisation, supported by the Kremlin, called “Nashi” (“Ours”), who claimed credit for the attack, stating however that it had no support from national authorities</http:></http:>\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n141\nor the increasing number of intrusions into the United States' electronic infrastructure, attributed to both state authorities⁴ and nationals,⁵ show the gravity of the danger brought about by this new category of IW – cyber-warfare. In the electronic era, the global community is therefore only as safe as the technology it uses. Since the development of the international community is aimed at building an international information society (that goal is explicitly recognized by, e.g. the European Union in its 2010 agenda),⁶ the issue of cyber-security and legally permitted self-defence against cyber-attacks is of growing and urgent importance. Its meaning is enhanced by the alarming declarations of the authorities of some countries regarded as most probable targets or authors of such an attack. For example Russian government representatives expressly declare they feel authorised to use nuclear force in response to cyber-attacks. Also both the Clinton and Bush administrations compared the threats caused by cyber-attacks to those resulting from the use of traditional weapons of mass destruction.⁷\n(Ch. Clover, Kremlin-backed group behind Estonia cyber blitz, Financial Times, 11.03.2009 <http: 0=\"\" 57536d5a-0ddc-11de-8ea3-0000779fd2ac.html=\"\" cms=\"\" s=\"\" www.ft.com=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010). The recent statement of one of Prime Minister Putin’s closest colleagues could be regarded as claiming credit for the attack also by Russian authorities (R.

These attacks were aimed at Pentagon databases and the confidential information contained therein. Again Russian authorities distanced themselves from the attacks (Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 40).\n⁵ The codename Solar Sunrise was adopted for a series of attacks conducted in February of 1998 aimed at secret electronic data of the United States. Using sniffers (programmes searching electronic records without the awareness of the database administrators) on US Air Force computers, unknown culprits broke into the databases. IP analysis traced all the attacks to a service provider in Texas. Further investigation however showed, that that Texas provider was himself a victim of an attack, initiated from Israeli territory. Israeli authorities initiated a criminal investigation against the attackers, which resulted in identifying and punishing the perpetrators (Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 41).\n⁶ i2010 is the EU policy framework for the information society and media.

The author attempts to define the legal character of cyber-attacks, in particular whether such attacks may be regarded as constituting acts of international aggression. Should they constitute “armed attacks”, they would allow a recourse to measures foreseen by the international legal order, including armed self-defence as envisioned by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter (UNC).¹¹ It is also important to establish whether the attacked sovereign is entitled to reparations, and if so – when a cyber-attack can be attributed to a state and its authorities. Since there is not yet any particular international regulation on that matter, presently one has to apply already existing international law mechanisms to this new and unique situation. The author attempts to identify possible new mechanisms as well as required modifications to existing ones.\n⁸ Russia, next to China, is the country most often accused of cyber-attacks, recently also against Georgia (R. Synovitz, *Georgian Government Accuses Russia Of Waging «Cyberwarfare»*, Radio Free Europe, 12.08.2008 <http: 1190477.html=\"\" commi=\"\" content=\"\" georgian_government_accuses_russia_of_cyberwar=\"\" www.rferl.org=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010; N.

Russian authorities continuously refuse to take action against the perpetrators.\n⁹ China’s role in cyberwarfare in rapidly increasing. According to the US Congress Committee, China is the sole national power able to threaten US cybersecurity defences, causing therefore a real threat to all other states, not in possession of the technology and infrastructure to withstand a potential attack (*2008 Report To the Congress Of the U.S.-China Economic And Security Review Commission*, p. 9, November 2008, http://www.uscc.gov). China is also alleged to be the initiator of most breaches of national database protection systems and stealing protected data. Chinese authorities however deny any responsibility for the attacks or any connection with the hackers.\n¹⁰ According to Shackelford, over 120 states are investing in electronic infrastructure which allows for the exercise of cyberwarfare (Shackelford, *supra* note 3, p. 12).\n¹¹ Charter of the United Nations, 26 June, 1945, available at <http: charter=\"\" documents=\"\" en=\"\" www.un.org=\"\"></http:></http:>\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n143\n# 2. DEFINITION OF AGGRESSION AND CYBER-ATTACKS\nAccording to Article 2 Paragraph 4 of the UNC “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state”. Although interfering with national databases, archives or electronic infrastructure may certainly be qualified as “using force”, the general nature of the prohibition in Article 2 Paragraph 4 contains very few practical means of protecting one’s sovereignty against attacks by another state. The narrow scope of responses is established in to Article 51 UNC, which confirms the right of states to resort to self-defence only if they are subject to “an armed attack.” Therefore the legality of an armed response in self-defence against a cyber-attack would be determined based on the legal possibility to qualify cyber-attacks as “armed attacks”.\nThe UNC does not provide a definition of “an armed attack”. The term closest to “an armed attack” as defined by the UN is “aggression”, therefore when attempting to define “an armed attack” the definition of “aggression” must be examined. According to the definition of aggression in the UN in resolution 3314,¹² in principle both invasion and an attack against a state’s territory may be qualified as an act of aggression. A state may also be subject to a counter-attack when it opens its territory to the armed forces of an aggressor or supports the sending of armed bands or groups exercising armed force. The above indicates that Resolution 3314 cannot be relied on to qualify an attack on a state’s key infrastructure through its electronic network as an act of international aggression, since it does not constitute a physical invasion of state territory with the traditional means of armed force. Such a conclusion is confirmed by indications made in the General Assembly travaux préparatoires accompanying resolution 3314, where it was explicitly said that any other act outside the scope defined, such as ones resulting in economic consequences, may not be regarded as acts of international aggression.¹³\nThe scope of the legal exercise of “armed force” allowed by international law may be defined only when using the definition of “aggression”. As shown above “aggression” is defined very narrowly and the allowed use of armed self-defence\n¹² Article 3 of the Nations General Assembly Resolution 3314 (XXIX). Definition of Aggression.\n¹³ According to Czaplinski and Wyrozumska, such a narrowing of the scope of the definition was intentional and resulted from the rejection of Brazil’s proposal to include economic attacks as part of the definition of international aggression (W. Czaplinski, A. Wyrozumska, Prawo międzynarodowe publiczne. Zagadnienia systemowe (Public international law. Systemic issues), CH Beck, Warszawa: 1999, p. 486).\nJoanna Kulesza\nis excluded against any attacks outside its scope. Since cyber-attacks fall outside this narrow scope, they may not be relied on as grounds for an internationally legitimate armed self-defence, contrary to the numerous statements made by national authorities.\nHowever, the term \"use of force\", prohibited by Article 2 Paragraph 4 of the UNC, has been defined extensively in a sequence of other UN documents and its scope is much broader. When categorizing cyber-attacks in the context of international law this definition may prove very useful.\nThe Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations recognizes any acts of intervention, direct or indirect, \"for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State\" as a violation of international law. It explicitly defines as illegal not only armed intervention, but \"all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements\". According to its terms, \"no State may use or encourage the use of economic political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind\" (emphasis added). A similar requirement is provided by the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, which in Article 32 stipulates that \"no State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights\" (emphasis added).\nThese documents would allow for an interpretation that interference with a state's critical electronic infrastructure would fall within the \"any other type of measures to coerce another State\" and therefore constitute a breach of a legally binding international obligation. Such a breach may be demonstrated especially when the measures used were aimed at \"coercing another State in order to obtain from it the subordination\" (in the case of attack against Estonia, such subordination would mean the reversal of the decision relocating the Red Army soldiers monument from the centre of Tallinn to its outskirts) or \"to secure from it advantages of any kind\" (e.g. the \"advantages\" to any state flowing from the theft of another state's secrets).\nTherefore a cyber-attack may easily be regarded as a breach of an international obligation, but at the same time it cannot be regarded as an act of armed\n14 UN General Assembly Resolution 2625 (XXV) from October 24, 1970.\n15 Ibidem, Preamble, point 1.\n16 Ibidem.\n17 General Assembly Resolution 3281 (XXIX) from December 12, 1974.\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n145\naggression justifying the self-defence measures foreseen by the UNC (such an interpretation explains the response of the NATO countries to the Estonia attacks, when no action¹⁸ against Russia was undertaken in 2007). However, the opposite conclusion may be drawn from the statements of some U.S. legal scholars,¹⁹ as well as U.S.²⁰ and Russian authorities,²¹ who declare the availability of all self-defence mechanisms, including a nuclear response, to any cyber-attack.\n# 3. PRINCIPLES OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERNATIONALLY WRONGFUL ACTS – A BRIEF SUMMARY\nAs explained above, while cyber-attacks can hardly be regarded as constituting “acts of aggression,” they may be regarded as breaches of universal international obligations, resulting in state responsibility therefore.\nThe principles for state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts were initially established by the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1927 in the\n¹⁸ The only action taken by the NATO parties in reaction to the Estonia attack was the creation of a Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, the actions of which are headed by Estonia (M. Chudziński, *Estonia poprowadzi NATO do cyberwojny* (Estonia will lead NATO into cyberwar), Gazeta Wyborcza, 2.04.2008 <http: 1,90339,5081266.html=\"\" technique=\"\" technique,=\"\" technologie.gazeta.pl=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010).\n¹⁹ Some arguments to the contrary are presented by D. Delibasis, showing that the character of an armed attack should be defined rather by the consequence it brings than the sort of weapons used to conduct it (Delibasis, *supra* note 1., p. 17 ff., see also, D. Delibasis, *State Use of Force in Cyberspace for Self-Defence: A New Challenge for a New Century*, 8 Peace Conflict and Development: An Interdisciplinary Journal 13 (2006), where the author analyses the application of the law of war to conflicts in cyberspace).\n²⁰ Such an extensive interpretation of Article 51 of the UNC was presented by the one of the officials from the US Defence Department, who believes that a wide scale cyber-attack may be regarded as justification for a traditional armed response (Department of Defence, Office of General Counsel, *An Assessment Of International Legal Issues In Information Operations*, May 1999, p. 20 <http: awc=\"\" awcgate=\"\" dod-io-legal=\"\" dod-io-legal.pdf=\"\" www.au.af.mil=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010). The Department representative went on to say that there is no certainty regarding the application of international law principles in cyberspace. He referred to Article 51 of the UNC and stated that according to its provisions a cyber-attack would have to be regarded as an “armed attack” in order to allow for an armed self defence. However regarding the scale of a cyber-attack, even if it does not constitute an armed attack, it always endangers state security. Therefore the consequences of a cyber-attack are much more important than the means used for conducting it (*Ibidem*, p. 22).\n²¹ “An attack against the telecommunications and electronic power industries of Russia would, by virtue of its catastrophic consequences, completely overlap with the use of weapons of mass destruction. (...) Russia reserves the right to respond to an information warfare attack with nuclear weapons” (see, Shackelford, *supra* note 3, p. 28).</http:></http:>\nJoanna Kulesza\nLotus case.²² The Court asserted that international law acknowledges the rule of state responsibility for breach of international obligations and the duty to indemnify for any damage resulting from such breach. Over time international law practice elaborated a set of framework principles establishing states’ responsibility under international law. These principles require the ascertainment of three prerequisites.²³ First, there must be a breach of an international obligation and harm to a state interest protected by law.²⁴ Second, the harmful result must be attributable to a state and its authorities.²⁵ International law foresees a number of exceptions to this principle, the occurrence of which allows a state to free itself from any responsibility. Therefore in order for a state to be held responsible, a third negative prerequisite must be met: none of these particular exceptions can apply.²⁶\nArticle 3 of the International Law Commission (ILC) Draft Articles describes in more detail the elements of an internationally wrongful act of a state. An act may be regarded as internationally wrongful when the harmful action or omission is attributable to the a state under international law and at the same time that conduct constitutes a breach of an international obligation. The term of “constituting a breach of an international obligation” was further defined by the International Court of Justice in the Barcelona Traction decision.²⁷ The Court distinguished two groups of international obligations of a state. The first category consists of *erga omnes* obligations, which in principle result from peremptory norms (*jus cogens*), or in other words, norms that the state is obliged to fulfil towards the international community as a whole. The second group of international obligations are those which bind states bilaterally – *inter partes* – and result only from a consensual agreements (usually written, but sometimes also customary) among or between the particular parties involved.\n²² *France v. Turkey* (the Lotus Case), PCIJ , PCIJ Reports, series A, No. 10.\n²³ It has to be emphasized that that there is no international, global organization safeguarding these principles. These rules, as all of international customary law, are the result of the common practice of states and it is the states themselves that decide on the way to resolve disputes resulting from the differences in their perception or application. So far these principles have only been reduced to writing in a draft of an international treaty done by the International Law Commission: Of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility: Titles and texts of articles adopted by the Drafting Committee, International Law Commission, A/CN.4/L.472; further referred to as the ILC Draft Articles.).\n²⁴ Ibidem, Art. 3.\n²⁵ Ibidem, Art. 5.\n²⁶ Ibidem, Chapter V.\n²⁷ *Barcelona Traction*, Light and Power Company, Limited, Belgium v. Spain,  ICJ Rep 174.\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n147\nArticle 3 the ILC Draft Articles also stipulates that an act may be attributed to a state when it is conducted by a representative of a state organ²⁸ or a person acting on its behalf.²⁹\nAs mentioned above, the mechanism of international state responsibility also involves a negative prerequisite. A state may escape international responsibility for particular reasons foreseen by international law, and in order to be held responsible, no such reasons may appear. Those grounds, enumerated in Chapter V of the ILC Draft Articles include: consent validly given by a state (article 29), countermeasures in respect of an internationally wrongful act (article 30), force majeure and fortuitous events (article 31), extreme distress, required for the purpose of saving human life (article 32), state of necessity (article 33) and self-defence, in accordance with Article 51 of the UNC (article 34).\nConsequently, in order to establish the international responsibility of a state for executing or ordering the execution of a cyber-attack it is necessary, as a first step, to show the international rule that such an attack violates. The second step of the analysis consists in attributing such an action to a particular state.\nLinking a cyber-attack to the breach of an international norm is rather simple. As explained above, Article 2(4) of the UNC prohibits the use of force in international relations and is regarded as a peremptory norm. On the basis of the already cited UN documents (i.e. the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States) one may qualify attacks on key state infrastructures conducted through electronic means as \"any other type of measure to coerce another State\" (emphasis added), therefore constituting a breach of international law.\nWhat is more difficult, however, is the attribution of a cyber-attack to a particular state, i.e. one that initiated it or permitted it. As mentioned above, a state may be held responsible for its own actions (actions of its organs) as well as the actions of private persons acting on its behalf or order. Given the present state of technological development, determining the physical localization of a computer from which a cyber-attack was conducted is not extensively difficult. However, the very\n²⁸ Art. 5 of the ILC Draft Articles. Traditionally acts of state were regarded as those executed directly by its government or head of state, or on their direct order. Presently a state may be held responsible also for acts of its parliament or judicial branch. When responsibility for the acts of its legislative body is considered, a state may be held responsible for its actions as well as omissions (e.g. not providing a sufficient protection of the rights of state nationals or residents).\n²⁹ Ibidem, Articles 7 and 8.\nJoanna Kulesza\nfact of physical localization of a computer used for a cyber-attack does not (and should not) allow for attributing that cyber-attack to a particular state. Such an assumption would be unwarranted, since a state cannot be held responsible for the actions of all its residents operating hardware or software located within its territory. In the traditional notion of state responsibility, a state is only be responsible for those of its residents it explicitly authorizes to act on its behalf. Proving a formal link between a state resident and a state authority in the case of cyber-attacks might be exceedingly difficult and thus negate the possibility of any reparations.³⁰\nHowever, a state can also be held responsible for a breach of an international obligation not only for its actions but for its omissions, i.e. for not preventing a particular attack to take place.\n# 4. ATTRIBUTION OF A CYBER-ATTACK TO A STATE\nBoth the legal doctrine and judicial interpretation make clear that a state may be held responsible not only for its actions, but also for its omissions, in particular for the failure to exercise due diligence.³¹ Such an interpretation finds support in the wording of Article 14(3) of the ILC Draft Articles, which provides that a state may be held responsible for the conduct of organs of an insurrectional movement, if such an attribution is legitimate under international law. As explained by Crawford in his commentary to the ILC Draft Articles,³² this article refers to a situation in which a state is in “breach of its obligation to prevent a given event”. Such an obligation is usually formulated as an obligation to render best efforts, calling for a state to take all “reasonable and necessary” measures in order to prevent a given event, however, without warranting that such an event will not occur.\n³⁰ Both Russian and Chinese authorities consistently deny any formal links with the cyber-attackers.\n³¹ Czaplinski and Wyrozumska give an example of breach of the due diligence standard via neglect to take up measures aimed at protecting particular persons or objects from attacks, combined with refusal to punish the perpetrators of such attacks and an explicit support of such acts aimed at harming the interests of third states or persons (Czaplinski and Wyrozumska, supra note 13, p. 436). All these prerequisites are fulfilled in the case of the Estonia attacks, particularly in the light of the recent announcement by Russian authorities admitting their initial support for the actions of the “Nashi” organization; see also I. Brownlie, *System of the Law of Nations, Part I, State responsibility*, Oxford University Press, Oxford: 1983, p. 45), where the author points to a legal mechanism for the establishment of state responsible for an act based on its omission and a breach of international law resulting from it.\n³² J. Crawford (ed.), *The International Law Commission’s articles on state responsibility: introduction, text, and commentaries*, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge: 2002, p. 140.\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n149\nThis doctrine identifies state responsibility for actions of quasi-legal persons as an example of such a situation.³³ This may be also directly applied to the action of the “Nashi” organization in the case of the Estonia attacks, where the state of Russia did not prevent the attacks and took no measures to prevent them.³⁴\nIn international jurisprudence this mechanism is best reflected in the ICJ case concerning the United States diplomatic and consular staff in Teheran.³⁵ In its decision the ICJ found, that although the storming of the U.S. embassy in Teheran may not be attributed to Iran, such finding does not free that state from responsibility. According to the ICJ decision, Iranian authorities may be held responsible for having “failed to take appropriate steps”, where such steps were evidently necessary. The Court found that the “inaction” of Iranian authorities was contrary to its international obligations to protect the US diplomatic personnel. This inaction constituted therefore a breach of an international obligation of Iran towards the USA, resulting from the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.³⁶ As correctly pointed out by Bratspies and Miller, the Court found that the due diligence standard must be unfulfilled in order to attribute state responsibility to the actions of natural persons.³⁷\nThe very same legal construction could be used in the case of a state not providing sufficient international protection from cyber-attacks conducted by its residents from its territory. A *jus cogens* norm obliging governments to protect the sovereignty and integrity of other states results not only from Article 2 (4) UNC, but also from a peremptory customary principle of the same substance. Such an obligation may be understood as encompassing both an intolerability of any active intrusion into the internal affairs of another state, as well as a due diligence requirement to prevent such an intrusion into foreign sovereignty from one’s own territory. As correctly pointed out by Vark, this produces an obligation on the part of any state from whose territory an internationally wrongful act is conducted to cooperate with the victim state in a manner necessary to eliminate the harmful act, or – if it may not be prevented – its consequences.³⁸ Therefore if a state itself is not capable of protecting the interests of another sovereign, it may not allow for private persons acting from within its territory to inflict damage or create danger to that sovereign while protected by the inflicting state’s\n³³ Brownlie, *supra* note 31, pp. 162–163.\n³⁴ See also footnote 3.\n³⁵ *United States of America v. Iran (Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran)*,  ICJ Rep 3.\n³⁶ *Ibidem*, p. 29.\n³⁷ M. Bratspies, A.

Vark, *State Responsibility for Private Armed Groups in the Context of Terrorism*, Juridica International XI/2006, p. 192.\nJoanna Kulesza\nimmunity. Under such an interpretation Russia’s refusal to prosecute the perpetrators of the attack against Estonia would constitute an internationally wrongful act, while Israeli involvement and punishment of the actors behind the Solar Sunrise incident exonerates that state from international responsibility.\n# 5. THE NEED FOR INTERNATIONAL REGULATION OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\nIn the light of the above considerations, the practical solution to the urgent problem of legal categorization of attacks on state sovereignty conducted with the use of internet would be to initiate an international debate on the applicability of traditional state responsibility principles to this new category of threats to international peace and security. In light of the statements made by national authorities from countries that are susceptible to if not subject to cyber-attacks (i.e. allowing for nuclear response to cyberwarfare), such a debate seems to be essential. In particular there is a need for an international consensus on the criteria which have to be fulfilled by a state in order to avoid international responsibility for lack of due diligence in protecting other sovereigns from cyber-attacks.³⁹ Such an accord would alleviate the possibility of dangerous reactions by particular states in response to cyber-threats to their sovereignty. Such a debate should be initiated by determining the legal character of cyber-attacks and categorizing them, while stipulating the countermeasures available to the states attacked. In the course of such a debate, the principles for allowable self-defence against cyber-attacks should be set (e.g. would preventive measures be allowed? If so, of what character?). The second crucial issue would be to establish the standards for releasing a state from international responsibility for not providing due diligence: would the adoption of specific provisions in national criminal laws be sufficient, or rather would state authorities be required to effectively initiate a criminal investigation? It should be also clarified whether a due diligence standard can be set post factum – after an attack has already taken place.\nThe analysis provided in this article may serve as a starting point for such a debate. It seems clear that state responsibility must be based on a due diligence requirement rather than the obligation to show a formal link between the state authorities and the actions of actual perpetrators. An important element of any international accord on international responsibility for cyber-attacks would be\n³⁹ Within such a discussion the principle of proportionality might also be discussed in order to ascertain the scope of counter-measures permitted to a state.\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n151\na debate on the international jurisdiction principles to be applied to acts conducted through the Internet.⁴⁰ Only such an accord will prevent reliance on far-fetched analogies to existing international regimes and contradictory national regulations.⁴¹ Such an international consensus could provide the basis for a wider international agreement on the limits of state jurisdiction and competence in cyberspace. An international regulatory framework for cyberspace already falls within the scope of some international organizations, including the UN, through its agenda the Internet Governance Forum (IGF). The IGF could be used as a forum for elaborating a satisfactory consensus on the issues discussed herein.⁴² Without a functioning mechanism for state responsibility for attacks conducted from its territory through the internet against other sovereigns, the worst case scenario is the unilateral interpretation of the self-defence clause of the UNC by each state, resulting in real-world armed conflict. Such a potentially catastrophic event should be prevented by all means possible.\n⁴⁰ As with all activities in cyberspace, resort to traditional jurisdictional principles is bound to result in legal chaos, particularly should authorities decide to call upon the effects or the protective principle. For more on the issue of the application of traditional jurisdiction principles to cyberspace and its consequences, see: J. Kulesza, Internet Governance and the Jurisdiction of States; Justification of the Need For an International Regulation of Cyberspace; third annual meeting of the Global Internet Governance Academic Network (GigaNet), Hyderabad, India, December 2008 <http: papers.cfm?abstract_id=\"1445452\" papers.ssrn.com=\"\" sol3=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010.\n⁴¹ An example of such a far-reaching analogy was presented by Shackelford, (Shackelford, supra note 3, p. 27 ff), e.g. through drawing a parallel with the diplomatic law regime, law of the sea, or telecommunications regulations. Even though those regimes may provide a good example of how a consensus on the issue discussed may be shaped, their analogical application could lead to unpredictable results.\n⁴² This would, however, require serious organisational changes, as the present, open forum scheme has not fulfilled the tasks assigned to it.

It analyses the possibility to recognize a cyber-attack as an act of international aggression and shows existing difficulties at the present state of the international debate. It then turns to the traditional notion of state responsibility for lack of due diligence as a source of state's responsibility for cyber-attacks. Such due diligence should be guaranteed through sufficient criminal law regulations that are properly executed in order to effectively prevent and prosecute electronic attacks. In this context the article posits that an international debate is required with the aim of establishing international guidelines. The results of such a debate should than allow for the harmonization of national criminal law regulations. Although the author points to the need for an international debate on the system for protection against cyber-attacks on states' key electronic infrastructure, she also emphasizes already existing international obligations for states to take responsibility for attacks conducted from their territory.\n## 1. INTERNATIONAL ATTACKS IN CYBERSPACE The 21st century has brought with it new forms of international aggression. One of the reasons for this inglorious evolution has been the creation and expansion of the world wide electronic network – the Internet. Global international * Joanna Kulesza, Ph.D. is an assistant professor, Chair of International Law and International Relations, Faculty of Law and Administration, University of Łódź, Poland.\nJoanna Kulesza development has resulted not only in e-administration and e-government, but also in computer-controlled power plants, computer operated flight and airport control systems, and the massive popularity of on-line banking, both for private individuals and international companies. Therefore the security of such crucial elements of national infrastructure as state airports and power supplies has become only as secure as the information technology used to operate them. States are now vulnerable in new ways, thus new means of state protection are called for.\nThis new category of risks to state security has been integrated into an already existing definition of the term Information Warfare (IW). This term has historically been used to describe actions undertaken in order to “disrupt the communications of an opponent” and give him a false image of reality,¹ however the 21st century has now given this term a whole new meaning, with a wider and more diverse scope than ever before.² Recent attacks conducted with the use of the internet (cyber-attacks) onto the key information structures of sovereign states, such as 2007 attack on Estonia³ ¹ D. Delibasis, *The Right to National Self-defence: In Information Warfare Operations*, Arena Books, Bury St Edmunds: 2007, p. 25.\n² Electronic attacks were a crucial factor in the Gulf War in 1991 (*Ibidem*, p. 31 ff.). However, IW took on a new, more comprehensive shape after the 9/11 attacks. According to the US Defence Department plan by the codename of Virtual Battlefield, all actions and attacks can be initiated with the use of an advanced electronic system (*Ibidem*, p. 35 ff.). What is more, presently the most advanced and comprehensive system of defence against cyber-attackers belongs to the US Department of Defence, due to the fact that the US military security system that is the target of most cyber-attacks worldwide. The average number of cyber-attacks upon US national defence system computers grew from slightly over 200 in 1994 up to over 40.000 by the end of 2002. That data however may not be regarded as accurate, since according to the U.S. Defence Information Systems Agency only one out of 150 attacks can actually be identified (*Ibidem*, p. 38 ff.). The cost of repairing the damage caused by cyber-attacks grew to over 100 million USD in the second half of 2009, as estimated by the US Defence Department (see *100 milionów dolarów za naprawę szkód wyrządzonych przez cyberprzestępców* (100 million dollars to repair damages caused by cyber-criminals), Gazeta Wyborcza 04.04.2009, <http: 1,85253,6478435,100_millionow_dolarow_za_naprawe_szkod_wyrzadzonych.html=\"\"conclusion=\"\"de=\"\"et=\"\"technique=\"\"technique.=\"\"national=\"\"of=\"\"order=\"\"order.=\"\"public=\"\"repair=\"\"rechrologie.gazeta.pl=\"\"re.=\"\"te=\"\"tec=\"\"using=\"\"wayrządzonych.html=\"\"> accessed 28 April 2010).\n³ Before April 2007 Estonia prided itself on being one of the most “wired” countries in the world (due to which it was nicknamed eStonia). In April 2007 the electronic infrastructure of Estonia became the target of a synchronised attack by hackers, operating primarily from Russian territory. Estonia blamed Russia for initiating and supporting those attacks (1 Traynor, *Russia accused of unleashing cyberwar to disable Estonia*, The Guardian, 17.05.2007 <http: 17=\"\"2007=\"\"may=\"\"may=\"\"topstories3.russia=\"\"world=\"\"www.guardian.co.uk=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010). According to Russian authorities, the attacks were a civil initiative; although coordinated by a youth organisation, supported by the Kremlin, called “Nashi” (“Ours”), who claimed credit for the attack, stating however that it had no support from national authorities</http:></http:> STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND...\n\n(Ch.

The recent statement of one of Prime Minister Putin’s closest colleagues could be regarded as claiming credit for the attack also by Russian authorities (R.

These attacks were aimed at Pentagon databases and the confidential information contained therein. Again Russian authorities distanced themselves from the attacks (Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 40).\n⁵ The codename Solar Sunrise was adopted for a series of attacks conducted in February of 1998 aimed at secret electronic data of the United States. Using sniffers (programmes searching electronic records without the awareness of the database administrators) on US Air Force computers, unknown culprits broke into the databases. IP analysis traced all the attacks to a service provider in Texas. Further investigation however showed, that that Texas provider was himself a victim of an attack, initiated from Israeli territory. Israeli authorities initiated a criminal investigation against the attackers, which resulted in identifying and punishing the perpetrators (Delibasis, supra note 1, p. 41).\n⁶ i2010 is the EU policy framework for the information society and media.

The author attempts to define the legal character of cyber-attacks, in particular whether such attacks may be regarded as constituting acts of international aggression. Should they constitute “armed attacks”, they would allow a recourse to measures foreseen by the international legal order, including armed self-defence as envisioned by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter (UNC).¹¹ It is also important to establish whether the attacked sovereign is entitled to reparations, and if so – when a cyber-attack can be attributed to a state and its authorities. Since there is not yet any particular international regulation on that matter, presently one has to apply already existing international law mechanisms to this new and unique situation. The author attempts to identify possible new mechanisms as well as required modifications to existing ones.\n⁸ Russia, next to China, is the country most often accused of cyber-attacks, recently also against Georgia (R.

Shachtman, *Top Georgian Official: Moscow Cyber Attacked Us – We Just Can’t Prove It*, Wired Magazine 11.03.2009 <http: 03=\"\"2009=\"\"georgia-blames=\"\"dangerroom=\"\"www.wired.com=\"\"></http:> accessed 29 April 2010. Russian authorities continuously refuse to take action against the perpetrators.\n⁹ China’s role in cyberwarfare in rapidly increasing. According to the US Congress Committee, China is the sole national power able to threaten US cybersecurity defences, causing therefore a real threat to all other states, not in possession of the technology and infrastructure to withstand a potential attack (*2008 Report To the Congress Of the U.S.-China Economic And Security Review Commission*, p. 9, November 2008, http://www.uscc.gov). China is also alleged to be the initiator of most breaches of national database protection systems and stealing protected data. Chinese authorities however deny any responsibility for the attacks or any connection with the hackers.\n¹⁰ According to Shackelford, over 120 states are investing in electronic infrastructure which allows for the exercise of cyberwarfare (Shackelford, *supra* note 3, p. 12).\n¹¹ Charter of the United Nations, 26 June, 1945, available at <http: charter=\"\"documents=\"\"en=\"\"www.un.org=\"\"></http:></http:> STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND...\n\nAccording to Article 2 Paragraph 4 of the UNC “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state”. Although interfering with national databases, archives or electronic infrastructure may certainly be qualified as “using force”, the general nature of the prohibition in Article 2 Paragraph 4 contains very few practical means of protecting one’s sovereignty against attacks by another state. The narrow scope of responses is established in to Article 51 UNC, which confirms the right of states to resort to self-defence only if they are subject to “an armed attack.” Therefore the legality of an armed response in self-defence against a cyber-attack would be determined based on the legal possibility to qualify cyber-attacks as “armed attacks”.\nThe UNC does not provide a definition of “an armed attack”. The term closest to “an armed attack” as defined by the UN is “aggression”, therefore when attempting to define “an armed attack” the definition of “aggression” must be examined. According to the definition of aggression in the UN in resolution 3314,¹² in principle both invasion and an attack against a state’s territory may be qualified as an act of aggression. A state may also be subject to a counter-attack when it opens its territory to the armed forces of an aggressor or supports the sending of armed bands or groups exercising armed force. The above indicates that Resolution 3314 cannot be relied on to qualify an attack on a state’s key infrastructure through its electronic network as an act of international aggression, since it does not constitute a physical invasion of state territory with the traditional means of armed force. Such a conclusion is confirmed by indications made in the General Assembly travaux préparatoires accompanying resolution 3314, where it was explicitly said that any other act outside the scope defined, such as ones resulting in economic consequences, may not be regarded as acts of international aggression.¹³ The scope of the legal exercise of “armed force” allowed by international law may be defined only when using the definition of “aggression”. As shown above “aggression” is defined very narrowly and the allowed use of armed self-defence ¹² Article 3 of the Nations General Assembly Resolution 3314 (XXIX). Definition of Aggression.\n¹³ According to Czaplinski and Wyrozumska, such a narrowing of the scope of the definition was intentional and resulted from the rejection of Brazil’s proposal to include economic attacks as part of the definition of international aggression (W. Czaplinski, A. Wyrozumska, Prawo międzynarodowe publiczne. Zagadnienia systemowe (Public international law. Systemic issues), CH Beck, Warszawa: 1999, p. 486).\nJoanna Kulesza is excluded against any attacks outside its scope. Since cyber-attacks fall outside this narrow scope, they may not be relied on as grounds for an internationally legitimate armed self-defence, contrary to the numerous statements made by national authorities.\nHowever, the term\"use of force\", prohibited by Article 2 Paragraph 4 of the UNC, has been defined extensively in a sequence of other UN documents and its scope is much broader. When categorizing cyber-attacks in the context of international law this definition may prove very useful.\nThe Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations recognizes any acts of intervention, direct or indirect,\"for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State\"as a violation of international law. It explicitly defines as illegal not only armed intervention, but\"all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements\". According to its terms,\"no State may use or encourage the use of economic political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind\"(emphasis added). A similar requirement is provided by the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, which in Article 32 stipulates that\"no State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights\"(emphasis added).\nThese documents would allow for an interpretation that interference with a state's critical electronic infrastructure would fall within the\"any other type of measures to coerce another State\"and therefore constitute a breach of a legally binding international obligation. Such a breach may be demonstrated especially when the measures used were aimed at\"coercing another State in order to obtain from it the subordination\"(in the case of attack against Estonia, such subordination would mean the reversal of the decision relocating the Red Army soldiers monument from the centre of Tallinn to its outskirts) or\"to secure from it advantages of any kind\"(e.g. the\"advantages\"to any state flowing from the theft of another state's secrets).\nTherefore a cyber-attack may easily be regarded as a breach of an international obligation, but at the same time it cannot be regarded as an act of armed STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND...\n\n# 3. PRINCIPLES OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERNATIONALLY WRONGFUL ACTS – A BRIEF SUMMARY\nAs explained above, while cyber-attacks can hardly be regarded as constituting “acts of aggression,” they may be regarded as breaches of universal international obligations, resulting in state responsibility therefore.\nThe principles for state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts were initially established by the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1927 in the\n¹⁸ The only action taken by the NATO parties in reaction to the Estonia attack was the creation of a Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, the actions of which are headed by Estonia (M. Chudziński, *Estonia poprowadzi NATO do cyberwojny* (Estonia will lead NATO into cyberwar), Gazeta Wyborcza, 2.04.2008 <http: 1,90339,5081266.html=\"\" technique=\"\" technique,=\"\" technologie.gazeta.pl=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010).\n¹⁹ Some arguments to the contrary are presented by D. Delibasis, showing that the character of an armed attack should be defined rather by the consequence it brings than the sort of weapons used to conduct it (Delibasis, *supra* note 1., p. 17 ff., see also, D. Delibasis, *State Use of Force in Cyberspace for Self-Defence: A New Challenge for a New Century*, 8 Peace Conflict and Development: An Interdisciplinary Journal 13 (2006), where the author analyses the application of the law of war to conflicts in cyberspace).\n²⁰ Such an extensive interpretation of Article 51 of the UNC was presented by the one of the officials from the US Defence Department, who believes that a wide scale cyber-attack may be regarded as justification for a traditional armed response (Department of Defence, Office of General Counsel, *An Assessment Of International Legal Issues In Information Operations*, May 1999, p. 20 <http: awc=\"\" awcgate=\"\" dod-io-legal=\"\" dod-io-legal.pdf=\"\" www.au.af.mil=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010). The Department representative went on to say that there is no certainty regarding the application of international law principles in cyberspace. He referred to Article 51 of the UNC and stated that according to its provisions a cyber-attack would have to be regarded as an “armed attack” in order to allow for an armed self defence. However regarding the scale of a cyber-attack, even if it does not constitute an armed attack, it always endangers state security. Therefore the consequences of a cyber-attack are much more important than the means used for conducting it (*Ibidem*, p. 22).\n²¹ “An attack against the telecommunications and electronic power industries of Russia would, by virtue of its catastrophic consequences, completely overlap with the use of weapons of mass destruction. (...) Russia reserves the right to respond to an information warfare attack with nuclear weapons” (see, Shackelford, *supra* note 3, p. 28).</http:></http:>\nJoanna Kulesza\nLotus case.²² The Court asserted that international law acknowledges the rule of state responsibility for breach of international obligations and the duty to indemnify for any damage resulting from such breach. Over time international law practice elaborated a set of framework principles establishing states’ responsibility under international law. These principles require the ascertainment of three prerequisites.²³ First, there must be a breach of an international obligation and harm to a state interest protected by law.²⁴ Second, the harmful result must be attributable to a state and its authorities.²⁵ International law foresees a number of exceptions to this principle, the occurrence of which allows a state to free itself from any responsibility. Therefore in order for a state to be held responsible, a third negative prerequisite must be met: none of these particular exceptions can apply.²⁶\nArticle 3 of the International Law Commission (ILC) Draft Articles describes in more detail the elements of an internationally wrongful act of a state. An act may be regarded as internationally wrongful when the harmful action or omission is attributable to the a state under international law and at the same time that conduct constitutes a breach of an international obligation. The term of “constituting a breach of an international obligation” was further defined by the International Court of Justice in the Barcelona Traction decision.²⁷ The Court distinguished two groups of international obligations of a state. The first category consists of *erga omnes* obligations, which in principle result from peremptory norms (*jus cogens*), or in other words, norms that the state is obliged to fulfil towards the international community as a whole. The second group of international obligations are those which bind states bilaterally – *inter partes* – and result only from a consensual agreements (usually written, but sometimes also customary) among or between the particular parties involved.\n²² *France v. Turkey* (the Lotus Case), PCIJ [1927], PCIJ Reports, series A, No. 10.\n²³ It has to be emphasized that that there is no international, global organization safeguarding these principles. These rules, as all of international customary law, are the result of the common practice of states and it is the states themselves that decide on the way to resolve disputes resulting from the differences in their perception or application. So far these principles have only been reduced to writing in a draft of an international treaty done by the International Law Commission: Of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility: Titles and texts of articles adopted by the Drafting Committee, International Law Commission, A/CN.4/L.472; further referred to as the ILC Draft Articles.).\n²⁴ Ibidem, Art. 3.\n²⁵ Ibidem, Art. 5.\n²⁶ Ibidem, Chapter V.\n²⁷ *Barcelona Traction*, Light and Power Company, Limited, Belgium v. Spain, [1970] ICJ Rep 174.\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ...\n\nAs mentioned above, the mechanism of international state responsibility also involves a negative prerequisite. A state may escape international responsibility for particular reasons foreseen by international law, and in order to be held responsible, no such reasons may appear. Those grounds, enumerated in Chapter V of the ILC Draft Articles include: consent validly given by a state (article 29), countermeasures in respect of an internationally wrongful act (article 30), force majeure and fortuitous events (article 31), extreme distress, required for the purpose of saving human life (article 32), state of necessity (article 33) and self-defence, in accordance with Article 51 of the UNC (article 34).\nConsequently, in order to establish the international responsibility of a state for executing or ordering the execution of a cyber-attack it is necessary, as a first step, to show the international rule that such an attack violates. The second step of the analysis consists in attributing such an action to a particular state.\nLinking a cyber-attack to the breach of an international norm is rather simple. As explained above, Article 2(4) of the UNC prohibits the use of force in international relations and is regarded as a peremptory norm. On the basis of the already cited UN documents (i.e. the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States) one may qualify attacks on key state infrastructures conducted through electronic means as\"any other type of measure to coerce another State\"(emphasis added), therefore constituting a breach of international law.\nWhat is more difficult, however, is the attribution of a cyber-attack to a particular state, i.e. one that initiated it or permitted it. As mentioned above, a state may be held responsible for its own actions (actions of its organs) as well as the actions of private persons acting on its behalf or order. Given the present state of technological development, determining the physical localization of a computer from which a cyber-attack was conducted is not extensively difficult. However, the very ²⁸ Art. 5 of the ILC Draft Articles. Traditionally acts of state were regarded as those executed directly by its government or head of state, or on their direct order. Presently a state may be held responsible also for acts of its parliament or judicial branch. When responsibility for the acts of its legislative body is considered, a state may be held responsible for its actions as well as omissions (e.g. not providing a sufficient protection of the rights of state nationals or residents).\n²⁹ Ibidem, Articles 7 and 8.\nJoanna Kulesza fact of physical localization of a computer used for a cyber-attack does not (and should not) allow for attributing that cyber-attack to a particular state. Such an assumption would be unwarranted, since a state cannot be held responsible for the actions of all its residents operating hardware or software located within its territory. In the traditional notion of state responsibility, a state is only be responsible for those of its residents it explicitly authorizes to act on its behalf. Proving a formal link between a state resident and a state authority in the case of cyber-attacks might be exceedingly difficult and thus negate the possibility of any reparations.³⁰ However, a state can also be held responsible for a breach of an international obligation not only for its actions but for its omissions, i.e. for not preventing a particular attack to take place.\n# 4. ATTRIBUTION OF A CYBER-ATTACK TO A STATE Both the legal doctrine and judicial interpretation make clear that a state may be held responsible not only for its actions, but also for its omissions, in particular for the failure to exercise due diligence.³¹ Such an interpretation finds support in the wording of Article 14(3) of the ILC Draft Articles, which provides that a state may be held responsible for the conduct of organs of an insurrectional movement, if such an attribution is legitimate under international law. As explained by Crawford in his commentary to the ILC Draft Articles,³² this article refers to a situation in which a state is in “breach of its obligation to prevent a given event”. Such an obligation is usually formulated as an obligation to render best efforts, calling for a state to take all “reasonable and necessary” measures in order to prevent a given event, however, without warranting that such an event will not occur.\n³⁰ Both Russian and Chinese authorities consistently deny any formal links with the cyber-attackers.\n³¹ Czaplinski and Wyrozumska give an example of breach of the due diligence standard via neglect to take up measures aimed at protecting particular persons or objects from attacks, combined with refusal to punish the perpetrators of such attacks and an explicit support of such acts aimed at harming the interests of third states or persons (Czaplinski and Wyrozumska, supra note 13, p. 436). All these prerequisites are fulfilled in the case of the Estonia attacks, particularly in the light of the recent announcement by Russian authorities admitting their initial support for the actions of the “Nashi” organization; see also I. Brownlie, *System of the Law of Nations, Part I, State responsibility*, Oxford University Press, Oxford: 1983, p. 45), where the author points to a legal mechanism for the establishment of state responsible for an act based on its omission and a breach of international law resulting from it.\n³² J. Crawford (ed.), *The International Law Commission’s articles on state responsibility: introduction, text, and commentaries*, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge: 2002, p. 140.\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND...\n\nIn international jurisprudence this mechanism is best reflected in the ICJ case concerning the United States diplomatic and consular staff in Teheran.³⁵ In its decision the ICJ found, that although the storming of the U.S. embassy in Teheran may not be attributed to Iran, such finding does not free that state from responsibility. According to the ICJ decision, Iranian authorities may be held responsible for having “failed to take appropriate steps”, where such steps were evidently necessary. The Court found that the “inaction” of Iranian authorities was contrary to its international obligations to protect the US diplomatic personnel. This inaction constituted therefore a breach of an international obligation of Iran towards the USA, resulting from the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.³⁶ As correctly pointed out by Bratspies and Miller, the Court found that the due diligence standard must be unfulfilled in order to attribute state responsibility to the actions of natural persons.³⁷ The very same legal construction could be used in the case of a state not providing sufficient international protection from cyber-attacks conducted by its residents from its territory. A *jus cogens* norm obliging governments to protect the sovereignty and integrity of other states results not only from Article 2 (4) UNC, but also from a peremptory customary principle of the same substance. Such an obligation may be understood as encompassing both an intolerability of any active intrusion into the internal affairs of another state, as well as a due diligence requirement to prevent such an intrusion into foreign sovereignty from one’s own territory. As correctly pointed out by Vark, this produces an obligation on the part of any state from whose territory an internationally wrongful act is conducted to cooperate with the victim state in a manner necessary to eliminate the harmful act, or – if it may not be prevented – its consequences.³⁸ Therefore if a state itself is not capable of protecting the interests of another sovereign, it may not allow for private persons acting from within its territory to inflict damage or create danger to that sovereign while protected by the inflicting state’s ³³ Brownlie, *supra* note 31, pp. 162–163.\n³⁴ See also footnote 3.\n³⁵ *United States of America v. Iran (Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran)*, [1980] ICJ Rep 3.\n³⁶ *Ibidem*, p. 29.\n³⁷ M. Bratspies, A. Miller, *Transboundary harm in international law: lessons from the Trail Smelter arbitration*, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge: 2006, p. 233.\n³⁸ R. Vark, *State Responsibility for Private Armed Groups in the Context of Terrorism*, Juridica International XI/2006, p. 192.\nJoanna Kulesza immunity. Under such an interpretation Russia’s refusal to prosecute the perpetrators of the attack against Estonia would constitute an internationally wrongful act, while Israeli involvement and punishment of the actors behind the Solar Sunrise incident exonerates that state from international responsibility.\n# 5. THE NEED FOR INTERNATIONAL REGULATION OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS In the light of the above considerations, the practical solution to the urgent problem of legal categorization of attacks on state sovereignty conducted with the use of internet would be to initiate an international debate on the applicability of traditional state responsibility principles to this new category of threats to international peace and security. In light of the statements made by national authorities from countries that are susceptible to if not subject to cyber-attacks (i.e. allowing for nuclear response to cyberwarfare), such a debate seems to be essential. In particular there is a need for an international consensus on the criteria which have to be fulfilled by a state in order to avoid international responsibility for lack of due diligence in protecting other sovereigns from cyber-attacks.³⁹ Such an accord would alleviate the possibility of dangerous reactions by particular states in response to cyber-threats to their sovereignty. Such a debate should be initiated by determining the legal character of cyber-attacks and categorizing them, while stipulating the countermeasures available to the states attacked. In the course of such a debate, the principles for allowable self-defence against cyber-attacks should be set (e.g. would preventive measures be allowed? If so, of what character?). The second crucial issue would be to establish the standards for releasing a state from international responsibility for not providing due diligence: would the adoption of specific provisions in national criminal laws be sufficient, or rather would state authorities be required to effectively initiate a criminal investigation? It should be also clarified whether a due diligence standard can be set post factum – after an attack has already taken place.\nThe analysis provided in this article may serve as a starting point for such a debate. It seems clear that state responsibility must be based on a due diligence requirement rather than the obligation to show a formal link between the state authorities and the actions of actual perpetrators. An important element of any international accord on international responsibility for cyber-attacks would be ³⁹ Within such a discussion the principle of proportionality might also be discussed in order to ascertain the scope of counter-measures permitted to a state.\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND...\n\n⁴⁰ As with all activities in cyberspace, resort to traditional jurisdictional principles is bound to result in legal chaos, particularly should authorities decide to call upon the effects or the protective principle. For more on the issue of the application of traditional jurisdiction principles to cyberspace and its consequences, see: J. Kulesza, Internet Governance and the Jurisdiction of States; Justification of the Need For an International Regulation of Cyberspace; third annual meeting of the Global Internet Governance Academic Network (GigaNet), Hyderabad, India, December 2008 <http: papers.cfm?abstract_id=\"1445452\"papers.ssrn.com=\"\"sol3=\"\"> accessed 29 April 2010.\n⁴¹ An example of such a far-reaching analogy was presented by Shackelford, (Shackelford, supra note 3, p. 27 ff), e.g. through drawing a parallel with the diplomatic law regime, law of the sea, or telecommunications regulations. Even though those regimes may provide a good example of how a consensus on the issue discussed may be shaped, their analogical application could lead to unpredictable results.\n⁴² This would, however, require serious organisational changes, as the present, open forum scheme has not fulfilled the tasks assigned to it.

It analyses the possibility to recognize a cyber-attack as an act of international aggression and shows existing difficulties at the present state of the international debate. It then turns to the traditional notion of state responsibility for lack of due diligence as a source of state's responsibility for cyber-attacks. Such due diligence should be guaranteed through sufficient criminal law regulations that are properly executed in order to effectively prevent and prosecute electronic attacks. In this context the article posits that an international debate is required with the aim of establishing international guidelines. The results of such a debate should than allow for the harmonization of national criminal law regulations. Although the author points to the need for an international debate on the system for protection against cyber-attacks on states' key electronic infrastructure, she also emphasizes already existing international obligations for states to take responsibility for attacks conducted from their territory.",
