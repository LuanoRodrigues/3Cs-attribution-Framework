The rationale for China's restrictive stance is partly endogenous, determined primarily by its philosophy and military strategy of self-restraint, and partly exogenous, influenced by its decisive position in the Security Council. The challenges posed by cyber operations to the use of force are mainly evident in the difficulties of attribution, the evolving means, aims, and effects of cyber-warfare, and the legal ambiguities arising from the asymmetry of offensive and defensive costs. China's stance in cyberspace will be significantly affected by its traditional approach, which stems from the resilience of established rules, strategic inheritance, and tactical cautiousness.\n# KEYWORDS\nuse of force; cyberspace; self-defence; China; jus ad bellum\n# Introduction\nWar and peace are the eternal themes of mankind. After the Second World War, the international community for the first time made the prohibition of the use of force as one of the fundamental principles of international law, thereby establishing a new international order. Simply put, the status quo of the normative framework for the law on the use of force can be summarized as 'one principle with two exceptions'. Under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and customary international law, states should refrain from the use or threat of force in international relations. But there are two exceptions to this principle. The first is the use of force authorized by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. This is the embodiment of the collective security mechanism established by the UN. The other exception is the victim state exercises its inherent right of self-defence.\nThis normative framework of 'one principle with two exceptions' forms the starting point for scholarly discussion of the law of the use of force. The connotation of international law related to jus ad bellum, as a typically high political field that touches on the survival and fundamental interests of states, is much more complicated in reality. As self-interest subjects, states would choose to clarify the principle and exceptions of the law of the non-use of force in extensive or restrictive way under different circumstances, and even put forward propositions beyond the existing normative framework. Therefore, the controversy over the law on the use of force has persisted since the day the regime was established, making this area one of the most contentious bodies of law. $^{1}$\nThe emergence of cyber technology and the proliferation of cyber warfare threats have further complicated the situation.

The growing strategic significance of cyberspace for nation-states has led to intense discussions over international rules pertaining to cyberwarfare, particularly jus ad bellum. As early as 2007, Estonia suffered a cyber-attack against its critical infrastructures, and in 2008, Russia was alleged to conduct cyber operations in the military conflict with Georgia. In 2010, Iran's nuclear facilities were severely damaged by a malicious worm known as Stuxnet. Later in 2019, Venezuela claimed its power grid was attacked by cyber means. A growing number of incidents have added urgency to the clarification of international law on the non-use of force in cyberspace. In addition to these sporadic incidents, there has been a general trend to formally establish cyber forces, strengthen cyber defense capabilities, and update military strategies. With the development of practice, the question of whether and how the principle of non-use of force should be applied to cyberspace has been frequently asked. Within the framework of the United Nations, general preliminary agreements have been reached so far, but much remains to be resolved.\nIt is well-known that China has hewed consistently a rather restrictive interpretation of the law on the use of force. However, the analysis of its international law stances, especially the logic and reasoning, needs to be strengthened, such as China's understanding of what constitutes the use of force and under what circumstances the right to self-defence can be exercised. In addition, how China, an extremely important state actor as well as stakeholder in the cyber domain, conceives of jus ad bellum in cyberspace is understandably a great concern for other States.\nThis paper explores the formation and evolution of China's traditionally restrictive normative stance on the non-use of force. Building on this foundation, it examines China's position on the use of force in cyberspace, incorporating an analysis of the unique characteristics of this domain. Furthermore, the paper assesses whether China's approach to the use of force in cyberspace is undergoing a historical shift—from a restrictive doctrine to a more pragmatically flexible stance. It is therefore divided into four parts. After quickly revisiting the current legal framework on the use of force, the second part demonstrates China's restrictive interpretation of jus ad bellum, and a general wariness towards the use of force outside the UN framework. Subsequently, the third part analyzes the challenges posed by ICTs to the application of the law on the use of force in cyberspace, and after navigating China's position on this issue and its reasoning, points out that although China still holds a restrictive position on the whole, the possibility of a shift towards a more flexible and pragmatic direction cannot be ruled out. Finally, a preliminary conclusion will be briefly presented.\n## The Chinese Restrictive Approach to the Law on the Use of Force\nRegarding the jus ad bellum, China has always taken a restrictive approach, that is, it believes that the prohibition of the use of force as a principle should be strictly observed, and exceptions should be minimized. This part examines the formation, consistency and evolution of China's normative position from an empirical perspective, and analyzes why China has basically adhered to this restrictive interpretation for more than half a century, and whether China's inclination has shifted in the context of the new era.\n##\nJOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA\n#\n# The Formation and Evolution of the Chinese Approach on the Use of Force\nFirst of all, China's interpretation of the principle prohibiting the use of force will be briefly presented based on its domestic regulations and corresponding statements. Secondly, China's position on exceptions to this prohibition will be examined through both its words and deeds, along with its stance with regard to the proposition of using force outside the framework of the UN Charter.\n# China's Restrictive Position on the Principle of Non-Use of Force\nWith regard to China's understanding of the principle of non-use of force, China's view is consistent with the framework of the UN and the main stream of international law. From 1949 to 1971, China was largely excluded from the international community based on ideological antagonism and the international situation. In the meantime, China's understanding of the use of force has largely been analyzed in the light of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence that it proposed in the 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement. The Five principles of Peaceful Coexistence, includes the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, has been committed to promoting and implementing by the Chinese government throughout the whole process. It was recently reaffirmed in the Foreign Relations Law. Since People's Republic of China obtained its lawful seat in the United Nations, the Chinese government's public statements repeatedly emphasize the importance of Article 2(4)'s prohibition on the threat or use of force. From the perspective of international law, China's position can be deconstructed from the following aspects.\nFirst, China emphasizes the central and even monopolistic role of the UN collective security mechanism, especially the Security Council, on the use of force. In other words, the use of force by states is prohibited absent Security Council authorization with the sole exception of self-defense.[11] Secondly, China reckons that Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the use of force among sovereign States and also applies in the military conflicts between States and nations seeking self-determination. For instance, Article 4 of the Foreign Relations Law stipulates that China 'opposes the use of force or threat of force in international relations'. The legal argument here is that the prohibition applies only to the use of force by states against other states, thus does not affect the right of States to use force to maintain national security and order within their domestic jurisdiction.[12] Therefore, given the position of the Chinese Government, which is that Taiwan is part of China's sacred territory,[13] the nature of the Taiwan question 'is purely an internal matter for China'.[14] Thirdly, the Chinese government confines 'force' in Art. 2(4) of the UN Charter to military force and thus economic or political coercion is excluded. Additionally, Unlike the United States, which tends not to strictly distinguish between the use of force and armed attack,[15] China believes that only the most serious form of use of force constitutes an armed attack, which is in line with the conclusion given by the ICJ in the Nicaragua vs. the United States case.[16] In summary, China's attitude towards jus ad bellum falls squally on the side of restrictive camp, and it is largely consistent over the half past century.\n8Shengzu Wang, History of International Relations[国际关系史], Vol. 8 (World Knowledge Press 1995).\n9Tieya Wang, International Law in China: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives (Martinus Nijhoff Publishers 1990).\n10Law on Foreign Relations of the People's Republic of China, 2023.\n11The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, 'Position Paper of the People's Republic of China on the UN Reforms' (7 June 2005) <https: 200506=\"\" 2005year_675849=\"\" 20050607_9288805.s=\"\" 22005=\"\" 22gylhg_675873=\"\" 674904=\"\" zit_674979=\"\" jiliao_674904=\"\" jywzt_675099=\"\" jwz1hg_675873=\"\" www.fmprc.gov.cn=\"\" ziliao_674904=\"\">\n12Kinmin Ma, 使用武力法:发展与挑战[‘The Law of Use of Force: Development and Challenges’] (2013) Chinese Yearbook of International Law.\n13 Constitution of the People's Republic of China, 2018.\n14 China, 'The Taiwan Question and China's Reunification in the New Era' (10 August 2022) <http: 10=\"\" 2022-08=\"\" content_78365819.html=\"\" english.scio.gov.cn=\"\" whitepapers=\"\">\n15 Harold Hongju Koh, 'International Law in Cyberspace' [2012] 54 Harvard International Law Journal Online 1-12.\n16 Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

SHI\n# Restrictive Interpretation of Exceptions to the Principle of Non-Use of Force\nConsistent with its formalist interpretation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, China maintains a restrictive position on exceptions to the principle of non-use of force, asserting that only two exceptions are recognized. The first is when the Security Council authorizes the use of force under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, and the second is when a state exercises its right to self-defense.[17] The Security Council's authorization is a typical manifestation of the collective security system established by the United Nations and is generally uncontroversial in international law. However, as an inherent right of the states, self-defense has always been a subject of debate. Furthermore, the use of force outside the UN system has gained traction, particularly under the banners of humanitarian intervention and the Responsibility to Protect (R2P). This section will examine China's position on the right to self-defense and its perspective on the use of force beyond the UN framework.\nSelf-Defence. As sovereign States' inherent right, self-defence is indisputably constituted the legal exceptions to the non-use of force principle. Article 51 of UN Charter is a right-confirmation clause rather than a right-grant clause.[18] It can be considered that treaty law and customary rule on the right of self-defence exist in parallel.[19] Regarding China's stance on self-defence, both deeds and words need to be examined.\nThe three typical incidents of China's use of force occurred during a period when China was completely excluded from the United Nations, namely, the intervention in the Korean War in the 1950s; the border dispute and conflict between China and India in  $1962^{20}$ ; the Sino-Soviet Union Zhenbao (Damanskii) Island Incident in 1969. Some Chinese scholars render that China's intervention in Korean War could be characterized as the exercise of the right of self-defense,[21] but there was no explicit invocation by the Chinese government, although it repeatedly stressed that its involvement in Korean War was a just war.[22] China's participation in the Korean War can be analyzed in the light of the following considerations. China's intervention came at the request and express consent of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In addition, China chose to aid the DPRK in the name of the 'People's Volunteers Army'[23] instead of the People's Liberation Army.\nWith the exception of Korean war, other situations involving use of force were clearly defined by China as 'self-defense counterattacks',[24] otherwise as exercises of the right to self-defence. From 1971 to 1990, China's discussions regarding the use of force and its exceptions in the Security Council were limited, largely due to its domestic policies and the atmosphere of the Cold War. Additionally, the 1979 border conflict with Vietnam was officially characterized by the Chinese government as an act of self-defense. This characterization is evident in China's submission of a formal letter to the\n17The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China (n 11).\n18Christian Henderson, The Use of Force and International Law (Cambridge University Press 2018)\n19Chris O'Meara, 'Reconceptualising the Right of Self-Defence against \"Imminent\" Armed Attacks' [2022] 9(2) Journal on the Use of Force and International Law 278-323.\n20Ashley J.

Since then, China's discussions in the Security Council and other international forums regarding the legality of the use of force and its exceptions have gradually transitioned from limited participation to active engagement. The Position Paper of the People's Republic of China on United Nations Reforms, released in 2005 (hereinafter '2005 Position Paper'), serves as a landmark document, as it provides the most detailed illustration of China's position on jus ad bellum to date. It stipulated as follows: 'We are of the view that Article 51 of the Charter should neither be amended nor reinterpreted. The Charter lays down explicit provisions on the use of force, i.e. use of force shall not be resorted to without the authorization of the Security Council with the exception of self-defense under armed attack. Whether an urgent threat exists should be determined and handled with prudence by the Security Council in accordance with Chapter 7 of the Charter and in light of the specific situation'.[26]\nThis 2005 position paper conveys precisely China's restrictive interpretation of the right to self-defense and provides a very cautious and conservative answer to two major disputes about the exercise of self-defense, namely, when and to whom the right of self-defense should be exercised. Compared to the relatively new position in 2021,[27] China's stance on the right to self-defense remains largely consistent.\nIt is highly controversial whether the exercise of the right to self-defense should be interpreted strictly in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, which states that 'under armed attack' is a necessary prerequisite, or whether it can be exercised more flexibly in anticipation of imminent or even just potential threats. Regarding temporal requirements, China maintains an open yet extremely cautious approach. On the one hand, it consistently rejects the concept of 'preventive self-defense',[28] recently associated with the 'Bush Doctrine',[29] which China views as an abuse of the right to self-defense and thus emphasis 'no state should ... use force arbitrarily in the name of preventive self-defence'.[30] On the other hand, China is also skeptical about the notion of 'anticipatory self-defense', which is called the Caroline doctrine[31] under customary international law, according to which a state is required to prove that its use of force in response to a threat which was 'instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation'. The 2005 position paper using the phrase 'self-defense under armed attack',[32] seems to lead to the conclusion that the Chinese government adopted a narrow understanding, which is in line with the plain meaning and the negotiating history of Article 51, especially with the provision 'if an armed attack occurs'.[33] Nevertheless, it does not entirely dismiss the potential for exercising the right to self-defense against imminent threats under customary international law.[34]\nIn addition, to whom the right of self-defense should be exercised, that is, the target requirement, also generates debates. Article 51 of the UN Charter does not specifically stipulate that the self-\n25UN SC, 'Letter Dated 17 February 1979 from the Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council', 1979, UN Doc.

In that vein, therefore, self-defence cannot be exercised against non-state actors unless the 'armed attack' conducted by this non-state actors are attributable to another sovereign state under the law of state responsibility. $^{36}$  The ICJ in the Wall Advisory Opinion held that Article 51 of the UN Charter 'recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self-defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State'. $^{37}$  China appears to be a little ambivalent on this point, as it voted in favour of the Security Council resolutions on the use of force against al-Qaeda after 9/11. $^{38}$  Yet it still deeply worries about the abuse of the right to self-defence as an exception to the prohibition of the use of force, and it emphasizes that \"The use of force against non-state actors in the territory of another state, which is for the purpose of self-defence, shall be subject to the consent of the state concerned ... no state should interfere in other's internal affairs under the cloak of 'counter-terrorism'. $^{39}$  This also echoes China's three principles of UN peacekeeping, namely, consent of the parties, impartiality and non-use of force except in self-defense and defense of the mandate. $^{40}$\nAssertions of the Use of Force Outside the Collective Security System. After the end of the Cold War, discussions emerged regarding the justification of using force outside the framework of the United Nations in extreme circumstances. This debate is particularly represented by the theory of humanitarian intervention and, later, the Responsibility to Protect (R2P). Humanitarian intervention is a doctrine that advocates for intervention to protect citizens from the oppression of their own government,[41] allowing for unilateral force to be employed to protect human rights in another state.[42] The concept of R2P was developed as an alternative to humanitarian intervention and was coined by a commission established by the Canadian government after the controversial NATO airstrikes against the former Yugoslavia in 1999.[43] Generally, China's acceptance of the R2P concept is significantly higher than that of humanitarian intervention.\nAs for the humanitarian intervention, it can be said that China, together with many developing states, opposes this idea.[44] It is true that China's approach to humanitarian intervention, and to the use of force in the broader sense, is profoundly influenced by its position on the principle of sovereignty under the UN Charter.[45] A case in point is China's response to NATO's military intervention in Kosovo in 1999, during which it repeatedly stressed in the UN discussions that 'Kosovo is an inherent part of the territory of the former Yugoslavia',[46] and rendered external intervention, particular through the use of force, would amount to the 'internationalization of a domestic issue'.[47] From China's perspective, Serbia was defending its sovereignty against internal challenges, a position that China almost certainly viewed with sympathy given its own internal challenges to\n35Kimberley N Trapp, 'Can Non-State Actors Mount an Armed Attack?' in Marc Weller (ed), The Oxford Handbook of the Use of Force in International Law (Oxford University Press 2015).\n36UN GA, 'Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts', 2002, UN Doc.

China has also acquiesced in or actively supported a number of more limited humanitarian interventions, including in Haiti,⁴⁹ Somalia,⁵⁰ Bosnia,⁵¹ East Timor,⁵² etc. From these resolutions on humanitarian grounds for which China provided limited support, the Chinese government's essential requirements for humanitarian intervention have become increasingly clear, namely, authorization of Security Council and the consent of the host state.⁵³\nMeanwhile, China has demonstrated a significant shift in its position on sovereignty by accepting the basic tenets of the R2P. For example, the 2005 Position Paper includes the concept of R2P.⁵⁴ Yet it appears that China soon realized that it went too far.⁵⁵ Therefore, China changed its tune during the debates on the first UN General Assembly resolution on R2P in 2009, contending that the R2P remained 'a concept' and did not constitute 'a norm of international law'.⁵⁶ Furthermore, China warned that the implementation of R2P 'should not contravene the principle of state sovereignty and non-intervention in the internal affairs of States' and that the R2P should be prevented from 'becoming a kind of humanitarian intervention'.⁵⁷ Unlike some western states that focus on the third pillar of R2P, Responsibility to React, China attaches special weight to the other two pillars, i.e. Responsibility to Prevent and Responsibility to Rebuild,⁵⁸ which are the main reasons why R2P could be quickly accepted by those traditionally opposing humanitarian interventions at the 2005 World Summit.⁵⁹\nChina's position on R2P can be roughly analyzed by its shift of attitude from Libya to Syria in the voting and argumentation of Security Council resolutions.⁶⁰ China abstained from the voting on resolution 1973 (2011),⁶¹ and notably did not block the pass of this resolution although it has 'serious difficulty with parts of the resolution'.⁶² Three crucial aspects of this highly unusual, perhaps exceptional, confluence of factors is considered.⁶³ The first key factor that influenced international action in Libya was 'the clarity and immediacy of the threat to the civilian population'.⁶⁴ The second and most crucial factor that provided the impetus for military action in Libya was the presence of regional consensus on the need for external intervention.⁶⁵ The third important trigger was 'the defection of members of the Gaddafi government'.⁶⁶ However, China was concerned with the actual implementation of the Resolution 1973 by\n⁴⁸ Jonathan Davis, 'From Ideology to Pragmatism: China's Position on Humanitarian Intervention in the Post-Cold War Era' [2011] 44(2) Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law 217–283.\n⁴⁹ UN SC, 'Provisional Verbatim Record of the 3238th Meeting', 1993, UN Doc.S/PV.3238.\n⁵⁰ UN SC, 'Provisional Verbatim Record of the 3145th Meeting', 1992, UN Doc.S/PV.3145.\n⁵¹ UN SC, 'Security Council the 3461st Meeting', 1994, UN Doc.

For instance, it stated that ‘we are not in favor of any arbitrary interpretation of the Council's resolutions or of any actions going beyond those mandated'. China believed that its lenient approach to Libya worsened the situation and does not want a repeat in Syria. Thus, three separate Western-supported draft resolutions proposing non-forcible measures against the Assad regime had been vetoed by Russia and China.\nTo sum up, China's attitude towards concepts such as humanitarian intervention and R2P, which revise the traditional principles of non-use of force and sovereignty, is no longer as rigid as it used to be. China's approach to the issue is case-by-case, shifting from an initially ideological focus to a more pragmatic approach.\n### The Restrictive Approach Revisited: Consistency and Rationale\nChina's position on the use of force in international law has remained remarkably consistent over the past half-century, reflecting its broader transition from an outsider to an active participant in the international legal order. Despite profound shifts in global politics and China's evolving role on the world stage, its restrictive interpretation of jus ad bellum has endured, with steadfast adherence to the principle of non-use of force and a high threshold for exceptions. As China's global influence expands, its legal stance on the use of force will become increasingly significant. China's foreign policy has evolved from a strategy of biding its time to ‘advancing towards the center of the world stage'. While its foreign policy has evolved—shifting emphasis toward sovereignty and non-intervention rather than an absolute prohibition on force—its foundational approach remains unchanged. Understanding the rationale behind this persistent restrictivism requires an analysis from three key dimensions: internal formation, external influence, and objective morality.\nOn the one hand, China's restrictive approach is partly endogenous, shaped by its philosophy, its tradition of self-restraint, and its post-strike military strategy. These internal factors have fostered a long-standing commitment to limiting the use of force as a means of conflict resolution. China, as a quintessential agrarian civilization, operates within a governance framework that is inherently inward-looking, prioritizing land cultivation, territorial integrity, resource stability, and self-sufficiency. This model fosters a worldview that emphasizes continuity, tradition, and social order, rather than external expansion or aggressive engagement with foreign entities. Unlike maritime civilizations, which historically pursued expansion through conquest and overseas dominance, agrarian economies do not rely on external plunder for economic development. As a result, China lacks the inherent impetus for territorial expansion and have no enduring tradition of long-distance military expeditions. Furthermore, agrarian civilizations often perceive interaction with the outside world as a potential risk rather than an opportunity, leading to policies characterized by controlled trade and strict border defense. A notable historical example is the construction of the Great Wall, which was designed not for expansion, but for defense against external incursions.\n1. 67 Hanqin Xue, Chinese Contemporary Perspectives on International Law: History, Culture and International Law (Martinus Nijhoff 2012).\n1. 68 UN SC, ‘Security Council, 66th Year: 6528th Meeting', 4 May 2011, UN Doc.

Sima Law says that ‘though a country is now strong, bellicosity will lead to its ruin(国虽大, 好战必亡)’. For the surrounding ethnic groups, it has advocated ‘In practicing the rules of propriety, it is harmony that is prized(以和为贵, 以礼为固)’. Because of its self-perception as the superior state of China, it will hardly actively attack unless there is a threat to the tributary system and there is a need for restoration of peace. Even in its philosophy of war, China has always advocated ‘the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting(不战而屈人之兵)’. China possesses a defense-oriented strategy. It keeps to the stance that ‘we will not attack unless we are attacked, but we will surely counterattack if attacked’. Though met with debate, a typical example of this is China’s strategic posture regarding the nuclear weapons. In 1964, after its first nuclear test, China made the declaration that its nuclear development was solely for self-defence. China unconditionally committed itself to the non-use or threat of use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon States and to the non-first use of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances. Since its first National Defence White Paper in 1998, China has been adhering to the ‘principles of defense, self-defense and post-strike response’. This post-strike military position and its related philosophy of war have largely influenced China’s approach to the non-use of force.\nOn the other hand, the rationales for China's restrictive stance are partly exogenous, including China's decisive position in the Security Council and its options for minimizing risk in an anarchic international community. As one of the five permanent members, China bears a primary responsibility in ensuring international peace and security. China's advocacy on the dominant role of UN Security Council has closely related to its role as one of the permanent members, of which it has veto power. In this way, China can be sure that, at least under the framework of the United Nations, the Security Council will not make a resolution on the use of force to its disadvantage. Especially after witnessing the tragic consequences of unilateral military action and the abuse of the right to self-defense, China has affirmed that the restrictionist position is the best solution to safeguarding national interests, grounded in instrumental rationality and utilitarianism.\nAdditionally, morality and legitimacy play a crucial role. As a victim of war and the first country to sign the UN Charter, China sincerely and in good faith believes that the pursuit of peace is an objective that must never be compromised. The restrictive approach faithfully based on the UN Charter, objectively provides predictability in international behaviours and serves as a robust guarantee of international peace.\n# The Hesitating Power: Dilemmas Concerning the Application of Jus Ad Bellum in Cyberspace\nWith the process of de-sovereignty to re-sovereignty of cyberspace, the strategic significance of this domain is increasing annually, and the threats emanating from the cyberspace have profoundly impacted international relations.

In addition to advancements made under the UN, several countries have issued position papers outlining how international law applies to cyberspace through unilateral statements. All of these statements reference jus ad bellum in the context of cyberspace. Dozens of states have adopted the doctrine of scale and effects as criteria for determining what constitutes the use of force in cyberspace. Some have proposed progressive propositions such as anticipatory self-defense, cumulative self-defense, and self-defense against cyberattacks launched by non-state actors. At this critical juncture for clarifying and updating the rules, China appears to be in no rush to issue a unilateral declaration to clarify its position on the regulations governing the use of force in cyberspace.\nThe following discussion will unfold in three steps. First, the challenges posed by cyber operations to the existing framework of rules regarding the use of force will be elucidated. Second, China's stance on the law governing the use of force in cyberspace will be examined, along with an analysis of the considerations underlying China's general position in light of its domestic cyber strategy and the evolution of laws related to cyberspace. Finally, whether China's relevant stance in cyberspace would witness a historical shift from restrictionism to a more pragmatic flexibility will be explored.\n### The Challenges Posed by Cyber Operations to the Law on the Use of Force\nIt has to be acknowledged the international law regarding jus ad bellum per se is controversial within traditional physical domain. Cyberspace is often perceived as a homomorphic map of the physical domain, and this issue persists. In addition to the previously mentioned complexities, the unique characteristics of cyberspace further exacerbate the situation.\nFirstly, the application of cyber military technology has challenged modern theories of warfare. There exists a reciprocal relationship between military technology and theories of warfare. Cyberattacks no longer concentrate solely on the destruction of living forces and tangible assets, normally do not involve physical incursions into territory, and lack the apparent intensity and violence characteristic of kinetic warfare. This challenges fundamental assumptions regarding subject identification, real-world physical consequences, and civil-military distinctions. The damage caused by a cyberattack can be both tangible and intangible, including disruptions to financial markets, functional failures, and data loss. Furthermore, cyberattacks may be difficult for the victim states to detect. Additionally, the consequences of cyberattacks are often unpredictable and challenging to control. International law has yet to provide mature answers on how to evaluate intangible damages within the framework of jus ad bellum.\nSecondly, cyberattacks present dual challenges of technical and legal attribution. Due to the interconnectedness and anonymity of the cyberspace, attribution faces both technical and legal hurdles, raising questions about the object of the right to self-defense in cyberspace. States that conduct cyberattacks often intentionally evade accountability by employing proxy warfare or utilizing non-state actors as the actual perpetrators through outsourcing or contracting, thereby concealing their involvement. In notable cyberattacks that have garnered significant attention from the international community, such as the Estonian incident in 2007 and the Stuxnet in 2010, various clues have emerged, yet no country has ever acknowledged its participation. The existing legal framework for attribution, based on the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally\nWrongful Acts, struggles to effectively address the complexities of attribution in cyberspace, leading to ongoing debates about whether the right to self-defense extends to non-state actors.\nThirdly, the asymmetric cost dynamics between offensive and defensive cyber operations have given rise to a bidirectional deterrence effect. At the same time, the limited effectiveness of ex-post defensive measures in mitigating the impact of cyberattacks has further weakened mutual trust among sovereign states, exacerbating tensions in the international cybersecurity landscape. This situation poses significant challenges regarding the timing and limitations of states' exercise of the right to self-defense. In contrast to traditional kinetic weapons, particularly nuclear arms, the costs associated with the creation, research, and production of cyber weapons are relatively low. Additionally, the expenses related to reproduction and replacement are more affordable. Countries with robust cyber capabilities often rely heavily on digital networks for governance and management, making them more vulnerable to cyberattacks—a phenomenon known as the ‘glass house dilemma'. Plus, the consequences inflicted by cyberattacks may be temporary or permanent, direct or indirect, tangible or intangible, and can even exceed the perpetrator's control. However, it is certain that the erosion of the victim state's authority and the diminishing trust of its citizens are inevitable outcomes. All of this underscores the reality that the costs of defending against and responding to cyberattacks—whether they are ongoing or have already concluded—can be substantial and disproportionate. Thus, it is challenging for states to determine when to respond and how to navigate the constraints of necessity and proportionality in their responses. In short, this is likely to lead to a generalization of the right to self-defense. Claims such as anticipatory self-defense and cumulative self-defense with response to cyber-attacks have begun to emerge, challenging the established legal framework of jus ad bellum.\nThe three challenges outlined above demonstrate that the military application of cyber technology poses significant difficulties for the existing framework governing the non-use of force. This situation is not putting old wine in a new bottle but highlights the urgent need for a collaborative response among states. Without such cooperation, certain cyber operations may remain ambiguous under international law due to unclear definitions. This ambiguity undermines the predictability of norms in cyberspace and threatens the long-term stability of the cyber environment.\n### China's Cautious Stance on the Use of Force in Cyberspace and Its Strategic Considerations\nChina's stance on the use of force in cyberspace remains conservative thus is prima facie consistent with its restrictive approach in physical domain. Without providing any substantive clarification on the operational level, China declared a firm attitude towards the peaceful use of cyberspace. It has stressed on many occasions that all countries should adhere to the principle of non-use of force enshrined in the UN Charter in the cyber context. For instance, the joint Sino-Russian proposal for an International Code of Conduct for Information Security in 2011 stated that ‘to settle any dispute resulting from the application of the code through peaceful means and to refrain from the threat or use of force'. In addition, the 2017 International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace clearly stipulated that ‘China is dedicated to promoting each party in effectively complying with the basic international relationship rules such as ... refraining from use or threat of force'. However, China has been vague about what defines the use of cyber force and the specific circumstances under which it may invoke the right to self-defense in response to cyberattacks.\n12 YUNG AND Z. SHI\nThis partially because of the resilience of the existing *jus ad bellum* rules. The rules governing the non-use of force are not meant to be domain-specific, as ICJ has opined that Articles 2(4) and 51 of the UN Charter regarding the prohibition on use of force and self-defence, respectively, apply to ‘any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed’.⁸⁹ From the point of view of effective interpretation, it is submitted that the system of laws and regulations on the non-use of force itself has resilience. Although the cyberspace is artificial, it is still closely related to the traditional domain, and the existing rules can be extended to apply to the cyberspace. Thus, there is no legal vacuum. In terms of cost, China’s (or any other states’) position cannot be completely divorced from the existing framework.\nCompared to Western countries, China is currently less inclined to express a definitive stance on this issue. It perceives a troubling trend in the discourse that emphasizes exceptions rather than fundamental principles, with some states attempting to lower the threshold for triggering the right to self-defence in cyberspace. Although China places significant importance on the peaceful use of cyberspace, it believes that excessive discussion regarding the right to resort to force—particularly in the name of self-defence—could have potential negative impact on international peace and security, aggravating an arms race and leading to the militarization of cyberspace.⁹⁰ Thus, the Chinese government is skeptical of the intense debate surrounding exceptions that justify the use of cyber force, contending that Western countries are cherry-picking on this issue. For example, China emphasized the ‘overemphasis on making exceptions for cyber warfare or self-defense, while the non-use of force principle has been marginalized’ and ‘the risk of sliding towards the militarization of cyberspace’.⁹¹ In its submission to the UN Open-ended Working Group, China stated that ‘state should focus on… refraining from the use or threat of use of force. Willful use of force… should be prevented. The applicability of… *jus ad bellum* needs to be handled with prudence’.⁹²\nIt should be admitted that most States now recognize, albeit to different degrees, that it is unhelpful to rely on the military paradigm as the first port of call when analyzing inter-state malicious cyber operations.⁹³ Yet the complexity of the disagreement on the application of *jus ad bellum* lies in the fact that the debate has been very much politicized, from a legal point of view, there does not seem to be a compelling reason why the existing *jus ad bellum* cannot be applied to cyberspace.\nChina’s principled caution does not indicate a lack of concern regarding the issue. On the contrary, as a latecomer to international law, China now has the opportunity to play a significant role in shaping international law in a field that is still in its formative stages. China exhibits ambivalence toward the relevant factors, opting to use non-legal reasoning to minimize excessive discussion and avoid making premature decisions.\nChina’s current restrictive stance on the use of force in cyberspace can be understood from several key perspectives. First, the unique characteristics of cyberspace indeed present challenges to the application of existing frameworks, resulting in significant legal uncertainty. Second, there is insufficient state practice and *opinio juris* to effectively test and verify whether a cyber action constitutes the use of force or an armed attack. Countries have not yet established what rules are generally accepted by the international community, or even what rules would be advantageous for their own interests. Therefore, making a definitive statement at this time may be premature. Thirdly, because of the digital divide related to cyber technology and the soft power of international law-making between China and Western countries, coupled with the growing concerns regarding the\n⁸⁹ Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, International Court of Justice, Advisory Opinion’ 1996 226.\n⁹⁰ Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization(AALCO), ‘Verbatim Record of the Fifty Fourth Annual Session’, 2015, Doc.

Just as China explained at the 2019 annual meeting of the Asian-African Legal Cooperation Organization, ‘given the “digital gap” between developing and the developed countries, developing countries in general will be in a disadvantaged position in the discussion and development of such rules, it will be difficult to ensure the rules are fair and equitable'. Nevertheless, as an emerging power seeking to influence the development of international law in cyberspace, China's principled official rhetoric regarding of the jus ad bellum in cyberspace may also serve a bargaining leverage in the formulation of international law regulating the use of cyber force.\nEven in the absence of detailed and specific legal rules governing cyber hostile acts in peacetime, states remain bound by three fundamental principles of international law, each carrying increasing normative weight: state sovereignty, non-intervention, and non-use of force. Therefore, China's cautious approach to the use of force in cyberspace stems not only from the aforementioned lack of established practice, strategic continuity, and tactical prudence, but also from a profound commitment to cyber sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention. From China's perspective, most—if not all—contemporary cyberattacks fall short of constituting a use of force and can be more appropriately addressed within the existing framework of cyber sovereignty and non-intervention.\nIn conclusion, it is reasonable to assume that China's restrictive approach to jus ad bellum could materially affect its position on when a cyberattack constitutes the use of force and under what circumstances the right of self-defense can be exercised against a cyberattack. As a typical proponent of multilateralism, China would certainly continue to firmly uphold the integrity and the authority of the UN, which function as the core of the international collective security mechanism. However, this does not imply that China's stance is inflexible and rigid. In light of the characteristics of cyberspace, where its position may evolve be examined.\n### Towards a More Pragmatic Chinese Approach to the Law on Use of Force in Cyberspace?\nWhile cyber operations present a triple challenge to the application of jus ad bellum, the extent to which these challenges are likely to influence China's approach to the law on the use of force in cyberspace is worth re-examining. The following will be discussed from four aspects: attribution, the object of exercising the right of self-defense, the threshold of use of force or armed attack, and the time and limitation of exercising the right of self-defense.\nThe difficulty of attribution due to anonymity in cyberspace can indeed lead to the erosion of international mutual trust, which has a negative impact on the overall cybersecurity. However, fundamentally, this is only a temporary technical obstacle, which will eventually be overcome with technological progress, or a corresponding international response mechanism will be established, so it does not constitute a fundamental subversion of the legal logic of attribution in international law. In addition, as an important element of state responsibility, if the attribution is arbitrarily changed because of the characteristics of a certain field, it will obviously do more harm than good to the maintenance of international order and the predictability of international norms. Therefore, it is unlikely that China will adjust its position on the challenge posed by cyber attribution to the law of the use of force.\nBased on the cognition of the issue of cyber attribution, China will most likely not change its restrictive position on whether the object of exercising the right of self-defense in cyberspace can be extended to non-state actors. Once attribution is resolved, responding to malicious cyberattacks by\nnon-state actors becomes to a large extent a matter of combating cybercrime and international judicial cooperation, which does not necessarily involve the use of force issue, and it is also possible to seek the consent of the territorial State or invoke the principle of due diligence to involve the territorial State and transit State in the fight against cybercriminals or cyberterrorist organizations.\nGiven this, the real challenge lies in the means and methods of cyberattacks, which have fundamentally challenged the traditional theories of warfare. No longer solely focused on the destruction of living forces and physical assets, one significant consequence of cyberattacks is that they create certain confusion to defining the threshold for the use of force or armed attack. This confusion manifests both qualitatively and quantitatively. From a qualitative perspective, the damage caused by cyberattacks can have both physical and non-physical consequences. The current ‘consequence-based' standard proposed by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations is indeed reasonable in this context. When physical consequences can be explained by analogy, it becomes easier to determine whether a cyber operation meets the threshold for the use of force or armed attack. However, this framework struggles to adequately assess cyberattacks that lack physical consequences. Some scholars have argued that disruptive cyber operations may fall under the scope of Article 2(4) if the resulting disruption is ‘significant enough to affect state security', but this interpretation is inherently arbitrary. A more radical interpretation expands the definition of the use of force to include non-destructive cyber operations against critical national infrastructure. However, this ‘target-based' interpretation excessively broadens the threshold, which is not conducive to maintaining peace and security. It also undermines the applicability and integrity of the principles of cyber sovereignty and non-intervention. On the quantitative side, the challenge is more pronounced in defining damage. Non-physical damage is particularly difficult to quantify objectively, and measuring the direct and indirect impacts of cyberattacks presents a complex issue. If the definition of damage cannot be accurately established, how can we ensure that the requirements of necessity and proportionality in the right of self-defense are fulfilled in good faith? In this context, a shift from consequence-based to a convergence of consequence-based, goal-based and function-based criteria is not unacceptable to China.\nBeyond the question of what constitutes the threshold for the use of force, another potential turning point is that the post-attack response is unlikely to be satisfactory. The ineffectiveness of ex-post defense will challenge the temporal requirements for exercising the self-defense. Due to the asymmetric costs associated with cyber offence and defense, the victim country not only faces the burden of implementing general defense measures at a high cost but may also have to endure significant expenses with minimal success in its ex-post response. Therefore, it raises the question of whether it is feasible to flexibly adjust the timing of self-defense against armed cyber-attacks. While the wording of the UN Charter advocates for ex-post defense, there may be room for broader interpretation within customary international law.\nChina has yet to comment on the issue, but it will need to do so sooner or later. As China's cyber capabilities expand globally, so do its overseas interests that require protection, which may lead China to adopt a more open stance on the jus ad bellum. On April 2024, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has set up three new arms, the Aerospace Force, Cyberspace Force, and Information Support Force to serve alongside the existing Joint Logistics Support Force. In the short term, it is highly unlikely that China will issue unilateral statements to clarify its detailed position on the use of force in cyberspace. However, should such a statement be made, it will likely address the use of force\nand the right to self-defense. To date, no state that has issued such a statement has overlooked this issue. Even if China were to make a unilateral declaration regarding the applicability of international law in cyberspace, it is improbable that it would elaborate beyond affirming the prohibition on the use of force. More pragmatically, China's approach to the use of force in cyberspace is likely to be reflected in its responses to individual cyber incidents or operations, as well as in discussions within the UN framework. Just as mentioned in the 2005 Position Paper “given the varying causes and nature of crises, it is both unrealistic and hugely controversial to formulate a one-fits-all rule or criterion on the use of force. Whether to use force or not should be decided by the Security Council in light of the reality of cyber incidents on a case-by-case basis. It remains to be seen whether adaptation will be made by China to the application of specific rules in cyberspace, such as ease up on the right of anticipatory self-defence or endorse a convergence of consequence-based, goal-based and function-based approach on determine the use of force.\n## Conclusion\nThis article elaborates on China's position regarding the jus ad bellum by examining its state practices and official statements. It also explores the extent to which China's approach in the emerging domain of cyberspace may be influenced by, or differ from, its traditional stance. The rationales for China's restrictive stance are partly endogenous, determined primarily by China's philosophy of war and its military strategy of self-restraint, and partly exogenous, including China's decisive position in the UN Security Council and its options for minimizing risk in an anarchic international community.\nChina's conservative stance will most likely continue in cyberspace, but it also faces a dilemma. On the one hand, international lawmaking in cyberspace is under way, and China is finally no longer the rule-taker but a rule-maker. It certainly wants to play a more substantive role and not miss the opportunity. As a potential victim of cyberattacks, it certainly wants to preserve and clarify the right to response against perpetrators, and sticking to rigid traditional positions may not be helpful in protecting national interests, including an increasing number of overseas interests. On the other hand, if the relevant restrictive interpretation is adjusted, the relevant rules may be abused and misinterpreted at will. In the overall unfriendly environment and the situation where, Chinese discourse is not dominant, Chinese legal and natural persons may be subjected to cyber attacks in the name of the right to self-defense, which may further deteriorate international relations in cyberspace. In this sense, China would basically maintain the ‘wait and see' approach regarding the jus ad bellum in cyberspace and continue its overall restrictive understanding of the relevant rules in cyberspace, however, facing the increasing frequency of cyber-attacks, the possibility that China would adopt a more flexible understanding of some specific rules cannot be completely ruled out.\nOur grateful thanks to the Editor and three anonymous reviewers for the journal for their astute comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.\n## Disclosure Statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).",

The rationale for China's restrictive stance is partly endogenous, determined primarily by its philosophy and military strategy of self-restraint, and partly exogenous, influenced by its decisive position in the Security Council. The challenges posed by cyber operations to the use of force are mainly evident in the difficulties of attribution, the evolving means, aims, and effects of cyber-warfare, and the legal ambiguities arising from the asymmetry of offensive and defensive costs. China's stance in cyberspace will be significantly affected by its traditional approach, which stems from the resilience of established rules, strategic inheritance, and tactical cautiousness.\n# KEYWORDS\nuse of force; cyberspace; self-defence; China; jus ad bellum\n# Introduction\nWar and peace are the eternal themes of mankind. After the Second World War, the international community for the first time made the prohibition of the use of force as one of the fundamental principles of international law, thereby establishing a new international order. Simply put, the status quo of the normative framework for the law on the use of force can be summarized as 'one principle with two exceptions'. Under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and customary international law, states should refrain from the use or threat of force in international relations. But there are two exceptions to this principle. The first is the use of force authorized by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. This is the embodiment of the collective security mechanism established by the UN. The other exception is the victim state exercises its inherent right of self-defence.\nThis normative framework of 'one principle with two exceptions' forms the starting point for scholarly discussion of the law of the use of force. The connotation of international law related to jus ad bellum, as a typically high political field that touches on the survival and fundamental interests of states, is much more complicated in reality. As self-interest subjects, states would choose to clarify the principle and exceptions of the law of the non-use of force in extensive or restrictive way under different circumstances, and even put forward propositions beyond the existing normative framework. Therefore, the controversy over the law on the use of force has persisted since the day the regime was established, making this area one of the most contentious bodies of law. $^{1}$\nThe emergence of cyber technology and the proliferation of cyber warfare threats have further complicated the situation.

The growing strategic significance of cyberspace for nation-states has led to intense discussions over international rules pertaining to cyberwarfare, particularly jus ad bellum. As early as 2007, Estonia suffered a cyber-attack against its critical infrastructures, and in 2008, Russia was alleged to conduct cyber operations in the military conflict with Georgia. In 2010, Iran's nuclear facilities were severely damaged by a malicious worm known as Stuxnet. Later in 2019, Venezuela claimed its power grid was attacked by cyber means. A growing number of incidents have added urgency to the clarification of international law on the non-use of force in cyberspace. In addition to these sporadic incidents, there has been a general trend to formally establish cyber forces, strengthen cyber defense capabilities, and update military strategies. With the development of practice, the question of whether and how the principle of non-use of force should be applied to cyberspace has been frequently asked. Within the framework of the United Nations, general preliminary agreements have been reached so far, but much remains to be resolved.\nIt is well-known that China has hewed consistently a rather restrictive interpretation of the law on the use of force. However, the analysis of its international law stances, especially the logic and reasoning, needs to be strengthened, such as China's understanding of what constitutes the use of force and under what circumstances the right to self-defence can be exercised. In addition, how China, an extremely important state actor as well as stakeholder in the cyber domain, conceives of jus ad bellum in cyberspace is understandably a great concern for other States.\nThis paper explores the formation and evolution of China's traditionally restrictive normative stance on the non-use of force. Building on this foundation, it examines China's position on the use of force in cyberspace, incorporating an analysis of the unique characteristics of this domain. Furthermore, the paper assesses whether China's approach to the use of force in cyberspace is undergoing a historical shift—from a restrictive doctrine to a more pragmatically flexible stance. It is therefore divided into four parts. After quickly revisiting the current legal framework on the use of force, the second part demonstrates China's restrictive interpretation of jus ad bellum, and a general wariness towards the use of force outside the UN framework. Subsequently, the third part analyzes the challenges posed by ICTs to the application of the law on the use of force in cyberspace, and after navigating China's position on this issue and its reasoning, points out that although China still holds a restrictive position on the whole, the possibility of a shift towards a more flexible and pragmatic direction cannot be ruled out. Finally, a preliminary conclusion will be briefly presented.\n## The Chinese Restrictive Approach to the Law on the Use of Force\nRegarding the jus ad bellum, China has always taken a restrictive approach, that is, it believes that the prohibition of the use of force as a principle should be strictly observed, and exceptions should be minimized. This part examines the formation, consistency and evolution of China's normative position from an empirical perspective, and analyzes why China has basically adhered to this restrictive interpretation for more than half a century, and whether China's inclination has shifted in the context of the new era.\n##\nJOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA\n#\n# The Formation and Evolution of the Chinese Approach on the Use of Force\nFirst of all, China's interpretation of the principle prohibiting the use of force will be briefly presented based on its domestic regulations and corresponding statements. Secondly, China's position on exceptions to this prohibition will be examined through both its words and deeds, along with its stance with regard to the proposition of using force outside the framework of the UN Charter.\n# China's Restrictive Position on the Principle of Non-Use of Force\nWith regard to China's understanding of the principle of non-use of force, China's view is consistent with the framework of the UN and the main stream of international law. From 1949 to 1971, China was largely excluded from the international community based on ideological antagonism and the international situation. In the meantime, China's understanding of the use of force has largely been analyzed in the light of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence that it proposed in the 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement. The Five principles of Peaceful Coexistence, includes the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, has been committed to promoting and implementing by the Chinese government throughout the whole process. It was recently reaffirmed in the Foreign Relations Law. Since People's Republic of China obtained its lawful seat in the United Nations, the Chinese government's public statements repeatedly emphasize the importance of Article 2(4)'s prohibition on the threat or use of force. From the perspective of international law, China's position can be deconstructed from the following aspects.\nFirst, China emphasizes the central and even monopolistic role of the UN collective security mechanism, especially the Security Council, on the use of force. In other words, the use of force by states is prohibited absent Security Council authorization with the sole exception of self-defense.[11] Secondly, China reckons that Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the use of force among sovereign States and also applies in the military conflicts between States and nations seeking self-determination. For instance, Article 4 of the Foreign Relations Law stipulates that China 'opposes the use of force or threat of force in international relations'. The legal argument here is that the prohibition applies only to the use of force by states against other states, thus does not affect the right of States to use force to maintain national security and order within their domestic jurisdiction.[12] Therefore, given the position of the Chinese Government, which is that Taiwan is part of China's sacred territory,[13] the nature of the Taiwan question 'is purely an internal matter for China'.[14] Thirdly, the Chinese government confines 'force' in Art. 2(4) of the UN Charter to military force and thus economic or political coercion is excluded. Additionally, Unlike the United States, which tends not to strictly distinguish between the use of force and armed attack,[15] China believes that only the most serious form of use of force constitutes an armed attack, which is in line with the conclusion given by the ICJ in the Nicaragua vs. the United States case.[16] In summary, China's attitude towards jus ad bellum falls squally on the side of restrictive camp, and it is largely consistent over the half past century.\n8Shengzu Wang, History of International Relations[国际关系史], Vol. 8 (World Knowledge Press 1995).\n9Tieya Wang, International Law in China: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives (Martinus Nijhoff Publishers 1990).\n10Law on Foreign Relations of the People's Republic of China, 2023.\n11The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, 'Position Paper of the People's Republic of China on the UN Reforms' (7 June 2005) <https: 200506=\"\" 2005year_675849=\"\" 20050607_9288805.s=\"\" 22005=\"\" 22gylhg_675873=\"\" 674904=\"\" zit_674979=\"\" jiliao_674904=\"\" jywzt_675099=\"\" jwz1hg_675873=\"\" www.fmprc.gov.cn=\"\" ziliao_674904=\"\">\n12Kinmin Ma, 使用武力法:发展与挑战[‘The Law of Use of Force: Development and Challenges’] (2013) Chinese Yearbook of International Law.\n\n#\nY. YING AND Z. SHI\n# Restrictive Interpretation of Exceptions to the Principle of Non-Use of Force\nConsistent with its formalist interpretation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, China maintains a restrictive position on exceptions to the principle of non-use of force, asserting that only two exceptions are recognized. The first is when the Security Council authorizes the use of force under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, and the second is when a state exercises its right to self-defense.[17] The Security Council's authorization is a typical manifestation of the collective security system established by the United Nations and is generally uncontroversial in international law. However, as an inherent right of the states, self-defense has always been a subject of debate. Furthermore, the use of force outside the UN system has gained traction, particularly under the banners of humanitarian intervention and the Responsibility to Protect (R2P). This section will examine China's position on the right to self-defense and its perspective on the use of force beyond the UN framework.\nSelf-Defence. As sovereign States' inherent right, self-defence is indisputably constituted the legal exceptions to the non-use of force principle. Article 51 of UN Charter is a right-confirmation clause rather than a right-grant clause.[18] It can be considered that treaty law and customary rule on the right of self-defence exist in parallel.[19] Regarding China's stance on self-defence, both deeds and words need to be examined.\nThe three typical incidents of China's use of force occurred during a period when China was completely excluded from the United Nations, namely, the intervention in the Korean War in the 1950s; the border dispute and conflict between China and India in  $1962^{20}$ ; the Sino-Soviet Union Zhenbao (Damanskii) Island Incident in 1969. Some Chinese scholars render that China's intervention in Korean War could be characterized as the exercise of the right of self-defense,[21] but there was no explicit invocation by the Chinese government, although it repeatedly stressed that its involvement in Korean War was a just war.[22] China's participation in the Korean War can be analyzed in the light of the following considerations. China's intervention came at the request and express consent of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In addition, China chose to aid the DPRK in the name of the 'People's Volunteers Army'[23] instead of the People's Liberation Army.\nWith the exception of Korean war, other situations involving use of force were clearly defined by China as 'self-defense counterattacks',[24] otherwise as exercises of the right to self-defence. From 1971 to 1990, China's discussions regarding the use of force and its exceptions in the Security Council were limited, largely due to its domestic policies and the atmosphere of the Cold War. Additionally, the 1979 border conflict with Vietnam was officially characterized by the Chinese government as an act of self-defense. This characterization is evident in China's submission of a formal letter to the\n17The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China (n 11).\n18Christian Henderson, The Use of Force and International Law (Cambridge University Press 2018)\n19Chris O'Meara, 'Reconceptualising the Right of Self-Defence against \"Imminent\" Armed Attacks' [2022] 9(2) Journal on the Use of Force and International Law 278-323.\n20Ashley J.

Since then, China's discussions in the Security Council and other international forums regarding the legality of the use of force and its exceptions have gradually transitioned from limited participation to active engagement. The Position Paper of the People's Republic of China on United Nations Reforms, released in 2005 (hereinafter '2005 Position Paper'), serves as a landmark document, as it provides the most detailed illustration of China's position on jus ad bellum to date. It stipulated as follows: 'We are of the view that Article 51 of the Charter should neither be amended nor reinterpreted. The Charter lays down explicit provisions on the use of force, i.e. use of force shall not be resorted to without the authorization of the Security Council with the exception of self-defense under armed attack. Whether an urgent threat exists should be determined and handled with prudence by the Security Council in accordance with Chapter 7 of the Charter and in light of the specific situation'.[26]\nThis 2005 position paper conveys precisely China's restrictive interpretation of the right to self-defense and provides a very cautious and conservative answer to two major disputes about the exercise of self-defense, namely, when and to whom the right of self-defense should be exercised. Compared to the relatively new position in 2021,[27] China's stance on the right to self-defense remains largely consistent.\nIt is highly controversial whether the exercise of the right to self-defense should be interpreted strictly in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, which states that 'under armed attack' is a necessary prerequisite, or whether it can be exercised more flexibly in anticipation of imminent or even just potential threats. Regarding temporal requirements, China maintains an open yet extremely cautious approach. On the one hand, it consistently rejects the concept of 'preventive self-defense',[28] recently associated with the 'Bush Doctrine',[29] which China views as an abuse of the right to self-defense and thus emphasis 'no state should ... use force arbitrarily in the name of preventive self-defence'.[30] On the other hand, China is also skeptical about the notion of 'anticipatory self-defense', which is called the Caroline doctrine[31] under customary international law, according to which a state is required to prove that its use of force in response to a threat which was 'instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation'. The 2005 position paper using the phrase 'self-defense under armed attack',[32] seems to lead to the conclusion that the Chinese government adopted a narrow understanding, which is in line with the plain meaning and the negotiating history of Article 51, especially with the provision 'if an armed attack occurs'.[33] Nevertheless, it does not entirely dismiss the potential for exercising the right to self-defense against imminent threats under customary international law.[34]\nIn addition, to whom the right of self-defense should be exercised, that is, the target requirement, also generates debates.

In that vein, therefore, self-defence cannot be exercised against non-state actors unless the 'armed attack' conducted by this non-state actors are attributable to another sovereign state under the law of state responsibility. $^{36}$  The ICJ in the Wall Advisory Opinion held that Article 51 of the UN Charter 'recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self-defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State'. $^{37}$  China appears to be a little ambivalent on this point, as it voted in favour of the Security Council resolutions on the use of force against al-Qaeda after 9/11. $^{38}$  Yet it still deeply worries about the abuse of the right to self-defence as an exception to the prohibition of the use of force, and it emphasizes that \"The use of force against non-state actors in the territory of another state, which is for the purpose of self-defence, shall be subject to the consent of the state concerned ... no state should interfere in other's internal affairs under the cloak of 'counter-terrorism'. $^{39}$  This also echoes China's three principles of UN peacekeeping, namely, consent of the parties, impartiality and non-use of force except in self-defense and defense of the mandate. $^{40}$\nAssertions of the Use of Force Outside the Collective Security System. After the end of the Cold War, discussions emerged regarding the justification of using force outside the framework of the United Nations in extreme circumstances. This debate is particularly represented by the theory of humanitarian intervention and, later, the Responsibility to Protect (R2P). Humanitarian intervention is a doctrine that advocates for intervention to protect citizens from the oppression of their own government,[41] allowing for unilateral force to be employed to protect human rights in another state.[42] The concept of R2P was developed as an alternative to humanitarian intervention and was coined by a commission established by the Canadian government after the controversial NATO airstrikes against the former Yugoslavia in 1999.[43] Generally, China's acceptance of the R2P concept is significantly higher than that of humanitarian intervention.\nAs for the humanitarian intervention, it can be said that China, together with many developing states, opposes this idea.[44] It is true that China's approach to humanitarian intervention, and to the use of force in the broader sense, is profoundly influenced by its position on the principle of sovereignty under the UN Charter.[45] A case in point is China's response to NATO's military intervention in Kosovo in 1999, during which it repeatedly stressed in the UN discussions that 'Kosovo is an inherent part of the territory of the former Yugoslavia',[46] and rendered external intervention, particular through the use of force, would amount to the 'internationalization of a domestic issue'.[47] From China's perspective, Serbia was defending its sovereignty against internal challenges, a position that China almost certainly viewed with sympathy given its own internal challenges to\n35Kimberley N Trapp, 'Can Non-State Actors Mount an Armed Attack?' in Marc Weller (ed), The Oxford Handbook of the Use of Force in International Law (Oxford University Press 2015).\n36UN GA, 'Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts', 2002, UN Doc.

Even so, the Chinese government does not take a negative view of all security Council resolutions on humanitarian grounds. China has also acquiesced in or actively supported a number of more limited humanitarian interventions, including in Haiti, Somalia, Bosnia, East Timor, etc. From these resolutions on humanitarian grounds for which China provided limited support, the Chinese government's essential requirements for humanitarian intervention have become increasingly clear, namely, authorization of Security Council and the consent of the host state.\nMeanwhile, China has demonstrated a significant shift in its position on sovereignty by accepting the basic tenets of the R2P. For example, the 2005 Position Paper includes the concept of R2P. Yet it appears that China soon realized that it went too far. Therefore, China changed its tune during the debates on the first UN General Assembly resolution on R2P in 2009, contending that the R2P remained 'a concept' and did not constitute 'a norm of international law'. Furthermore, China warned that the implementation of R2P 'should not contravene the principle of state sovereignty and non-intervention in the internal affairs of States' and that the R2P should be prevented from 'becoming a kind of humanitarian intervention'. Unlike some western states that focus on the third pillar of R2P, Responsibility to React, China attaches special weight to the other two pillars, i.e. Responsibility to Prevent and Responsibility to Rebuild, which are the main reasons why R2P could be quickly accepted by those traditionally opposing humanitarian interventions at the 2005 World Summit.\nChina's position on R2P can be roughly analyzed by its shift of attitude from Libya to Syria in the voting and argumentation of Security Council resolutions. China abstained from the voting on resolution 1973 (2011), and notably did not block the pass of this resolution although it has 'serious difficulty with parts of the resolution'. Three crucial aspects of this highly unusual, perhaps exceptional, confluence of factors is considered. The first key factor that influenced international action in Libya was 'the clarity and immediacy of the threat to the civilian population'. The second and most crucial factor that provided the impetus for military action in Libya was the presence of regional consensus on the need for external intervention. The third important trigger was 'the defection of members of the Gaddafi government'. However, China was concerned with the actual implementation of the Resolution 1973 by\n Jonathan Davis, 'From Ideology to Pragmatism: China's Position on Humanitarian Intervention in the Post-Cold War Era' [2011] 44(2) Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law 217–283.\n UN SC, 'Provisional Verbatim Record of the 3238th Meeting', 1993, UN Doc.S/PV.3238.\n UN SC, 'Provisional Verbatim Record of the 3145th Meeting', 1992, UN Doc.S/PV.3145.\n UN SC, 'Security Council the 3461st Meeting', 1994, UN Doc.

For instance, it stated that ‘we are not in favor of any arbitrary interpretation of the Council's resolutions or of any actions going beyond those mandated'. China believed that its lenient approach to Libya worsened the situation and does not want a repeat in Syria. Thus, three separate Western-supported draft resolutions proposing non-forcible measures against the Assad regime had been vetoed by Russia and China.\nTo sum up, China's attitude towards concepts such as humanitarian intervention and R2P, which revise the traditional principles of non-use of force and sovereignty, is no longer as rigid as it used to be. China's approach to the issue is case-by-case, shifting from an initially ideological focus to a more pragmatic approach.\n### The Restrictive Approach Revisited: Consistency and Rationale\nChina's position on the use of force in international law has remained remarkably consistent over the past half-century, reflecting its broader transition from an outsider to an active participant in the international legal order. Despite profound shifts in global politics and China's evolving role on the world stage, its restrictive interpretation of jus ad bellum has endured, with steadfast adherence to the principle of non-use of force and a high threshold for exceptions. As China's global influence expands, its legal stance on the use of force will become increasingly significant. China's foreign policy has evolved from a strategy of biding its time to ‘advancing towards the center of the world stage'. While its foreign policy has evolved—shifting emphasis toward sovereignty and non-intervention rather than an absolute prohibition on force—its foundational approach remains unchanged. Understanding the rationale behind this persistent restrictivism requires an analysis from three key dimensions: internal formation, external influence, and objective morality.\nOn the one hand, China's restrictive approach is partly endogenous, shaped by its philosophy, its tradition of self-restraint, and its post-strike military strategy. These internal factors have fostered a long-standing commitment to limiting the use of force as a means of conflict resolution. China, as a quintessential agrarian civilization, operates within a governance framework that is inherently inward-looking, prioritizing land cultivation, territorial integrity, resource stability, and self-sufficiency. This model fosters a worldview that emphasizes continuity, tradition, and social order, rather than external expansion or aggressive engagement with foreign entities. Unlike maritime civilizations, which historically pursued expansion through conquest and overseas dominance, agrarian economies do not rely on external plunder for economic development. As a result, China lacks the inherent impetus for territorial expansion and have no enduring tradition of long-distance military expeditions. Furthermore, agrarian civilizations often perceive interaction with the outside world as a potential risk rather than an opportunity, leading to policies characterized by controlled trade and strict border defense. A notable historical example is the construction of the Great Wall, which was designed not for expansion, but for defense against external incursions.\n1. 67 Hanqin Xue, Chinese Contemporary Perspectives on International Law: History, Culture and International Law (Martinus Nijhoff 2012).\n1. 68 UN SC, ‘Security Council, 66th Year: 6528th Meeting', 4 May 2011, UN Doc.

Sima Law says that ‘though a country is now strong, bellicosity will lead to its ruin(国虽大, 好战必亡)’. For the surrounding ethnic groups, it has advocated ‘In practicing the rules of propriety, it is harmony that is prized(以和为贵, 以礼为固)’. Because of its self-perception as the superior state of China, it will hardly actively attack unless there is a threat to the tributary system and there is a need for restoration of peace. Even in its philosophy of war, China has always advocated ‘the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting(不战而屈人之兵)’. China possesses a defense-oriented strategy. It keeps to the stance that ‘we will not attack unless we are attacked, but we will surely counterattack if attacked’. Though met with debate, a typical example of this is China’s strategic posture regarding the nuclear weapons. In 1964, after its first nuclear test, China made the declaration that its nuclear development was solely for self-defence. China unconditionally committed itself to the non-use or threat of use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon States and to the non-first use of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances. Since its first National Defence White Paper in 1998, China has been adhering to the ‘principles of defense, self-defense and post-strike response’. This post-strike military position and its related philosophy of war have largely influenced China’s approach to the non-use of force.\nOn the other hand, the rationales for China's restrictive stance are partly exogenous, including China's decisive position in the Security Council and its options for minimizing risk in an anarchic international community. As one of the five permanent members, China bears a primary responsibility in ensuring international peace and security. China's advocacy on the dominant role of UN Security Council has closely related to its role as one of the permanent members, of which it has veto power. In this way, China can be sure that, at least under the framework of the United Nations, the Security Council will not make a resolution on the use of force to its disadvantage. Especially after witnessing the tragic consequences of unilateral military action and the abuse of the right to self-defense, China has affirmed that the restrictionist position is the best solution to safeguarding national interests, grounded in instrumental rationality and utilitarianism.\nAdditionally, morality and legitimacy play a crucial role. As a victim of war and the first country to sign the UN Charter, China sincerely and in good faith believes that the pursuit of peace is an objective that must never be compromised. The restrictive approach faithfully based on the UN Charter, objectively provides predictability in international behaviours and serves as a robust guarantee of international peace.\n# The Hesitating Power: Dilemmas Concerning the Application of Jus Ad Bellum in Cyberspace\nWith the process of de-sovereignty to re-sovereignty of cyberspace, the strategic significance of this domain is increasing annually, and the threats emanating from the cyberspace have profoundly impacted international relations.

In addition to advancements made under the UN, several countries have issued position papers outlining how international law applies to cyberspace through unilateral statements. All of these statements reference jus ad bellum in the context of cyberspace. Dozens of states have adopted the doctrine of scale and effects as criteria for determining what constitutes the use of force in cyberspace. Some have proposed progressive propositions such as anticipatory self-defense, cumulative self-defense, and self-defense against cyberattacks launched by non-state actors. At this critical juncture for clarifying and updating the rules, China appears to be in no rush to issue a unilateral declaration to clarify its position on the regulations governing the use of force in cyberspace.\nThe following discussion will unfold in three steps. First, the challenges posed by cyber operations to the existing framework of rules regarding the use of force will be elucidated. Second, China's stance on the law governing the use of force in cyberspace will be examined, along with an analysis of the considerations underlying China's general position in light of its domestic cyber strategy and the evolution of laws related to cyberspace. Finally, whether China's relevant stance in cyberspace would witness a historical shift from restrictionism to a more pragmatic flexibility will be explored.\n### The Challenges Posed by Cyber Operations to the Law on the Use of Force\nIt has to be acknowledged the international law regarding jus ad bellum per se is controversial within traditional physical domain. Cyberspace is often perceived as a homomorphic map of the physical domain, and this issue persists. In addition to the previously mentioned complexities, the unique characteristics of cyberspace further exacerbate the situation.\nFirstly, the application of cyber military technology has challenged modern theories of warfare. There exists a reciprocal relationship between military technology and theories of warfare. Cyberattacks no longer concentrate solely on the destruction of living forces and tangible assets, normally do not involve physical incursions into territory, and lack the apparent intensity and violence characteristic of kinetic warfare. This challenges fundamental assumptions regarding subject identification, real-world physical consequences, and civil-military distinctions. The damage caused by a cyberattack can be both tangible and intangible, including disruptions to financial markets, functional failures, and data loss. Furthermore, cyberattacks may be difficult for the victim states to detect. Additionally, the consequences of cyberattacks are often unpredictable and challenging to control. International law has yet to provide mature answers on how to evaluate intangible damages within the framework of jus ad bellum.\nSecondly, cyberattacks present dual challenges of technical and legal attribution. Due to the interconnectedness and anonymity of the cyberspace, attribution faces both technical and legal hurdles, raising questions about the object of the right to self-defense in cyberspace. States that conduct cyberattacks often intentionally evade accountability by employing proxy warfare or utilizing non-state actors as the actual perpetrators through outsourcing or contracting, thereby concealing their involvement. In notable cyberattacks that have garnered significant attention from the international community, such as the Estonian incident in 2007 and the Stuxnet in 2010, various clues have emerged, yet no country has ever acknowledged its participation. The existing legal framework for attribution, based on the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally\nWrongful Acts, struggles to effectively address the complexities of attribution in cyberspace, leading to ongoing debates about whether the right to self-defense extends to non-state actors.\nThirdly, the asymmetric cost dynamics between offensive and defensive cyber operations have given rise to a bidirectional deterrence effect. At the same time, the limited effectiveness of ex-post defensive measures in mitigating the impact of cyberattacks has further weakened mutual trust among sovereign states, exacerbating tensions in the international cybersecurity landscape. This situation poses significant challenges regarding the timing and limitations of states' exercise of the right to self-defense. In contrast to traditional kinetic weapons, particularly nuclear arms, the costs associated with the creation, research, and production of cyber weapons are relatively low. Additionally, the expenses related to reproduction and replacement are more affordable. Countries with robust cyber capabilities often rely heavily on digital networks for governance and management, making them more vulnerable to cyberattacks—a phenomenon known as the ‘glass house dilemma'. Plus, the consequences inflicted by cyberattacks may be temporary or permanent, direct or indirect, tangible or intangible, and can even exceed the perpetrator's control. However, it is certain that the erosion of the victim state's authority and the diminishing trust of its citizens are inevitable outcomes. All of this underscores the reality that the costs of defending against and responding to cyberattacks—whether they are ongoing or have already concluded—can be substantial and disproportionate. Thus, it is challenging for states to determine when to respond and how to navigate the constraints of necessity and proportionality in their responses. In short, this is likely to lead to a generalization of the right to self-defense. Claims such as anticipatory self-defense and cumulative self-defense with response to cyber-attacks have begun to emerge, challenging the established legal framework of jus ad bellum.\nThe three challenges outlined above demonstrate that the military application of cyber technology poses significant difficulties for the existing framework governing the non-use of force. This situation is not putting old wine in a new bottle but highlights the urgent need for a collaborative response among states. Without such cooperation, certain cyber operations may remain ambiguous under international law due to unclear definitions. This ambiguity undermines the predictability of norms in cyberspace and threatens the long-term stability of the cyber environment.\n### China's Cautious Stance on the Use of Force in Cyberspace and Its Strategic Considerations\nChina's stance on the use of force in cyberspace remains conservative thus is prima facie consistent with its restrictive approach in physical domain. Without providing any substantive clarification on the operational level, China declared a firm attitude towards the peaceful use of cyberspace. It has stressed on many occasions that all countries should adhere to the principle of non-use of force enshrined in the UN Charter in the cyber context. For instance, the joint Sino-Russian proposal for an International Code of Conduct for Information Security in 2011 stated that ‘to settle any dispute resulting from the application of the code through peaceful means and to refrain from the threat or use of force'. In addition, the 2017 International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace clearly stipulated that ‘China is dedicated to promoting each party in effectively complying with the basic international relationship rules such as ... refraining from use or threat of force'. However, China has been vague about what defines the use of cyber force and the specific circumstances under which it may invoke the right to self-defense in response to cyberattacks.\n\nThis partially because of the resilience of the existing *jus ad bellum* rules. The rules governing the non-use of force are not meant to be domain-specific, as ICJ has opined that Articles 2(4) and 51 of the UN Charter regarding the prohibition on use of force and self-defence, respectively, apply to ‘any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed’. From the point of view of effective interpretation, it is submitted that the system of laws and regulations on the non-use of force itself has resilience. Although the cyberspace is artificial, it is still closely related to the traditional domain, and the existing rules can be extended to apply to the cyberspace. Thus, there is no legal vacuum. In terms of cost, China’s (or any other states’) position cannot be completely divorced from the existing framework.\nCompared to Western countries, China is currently less inclined to express a definitive stance on this issue. It perceives a troubling trend in the discourse that emphasizes exceptions rather than fundamental principles, with some states attempting to lower the threshold for triggering the right to self-defence in cyberspace. Although China places significant importance on the peaceful use of cyberspace, it believes that excessive discussion regarding the right to resort to force—particularly in the name of self-defence—could have potential negative impact on international peace and security, aggravating an arms race and leading to the militarization of cyberspace. Thus, the Chinese government is skeptical of the intense debate surrounding exceptions that justify the use of cyber force, contending that Western countries are cherry-picking on this issue. For example, China emphasized the ‘overemphasis on making exceptions for cyber warfare or self-defense, while the non-use of force principle has been marginalized’ and ‘the risk of sliding towards the militarization of cyberspace’. In its submission to the UN Open-ended Working Group, China stated that ‘state should focus on… refraining from the use or threat of use of force. Willful use of force… should be prevented. The applicability of… *jus ad bellum* needs to be handled with prudence’.\nIt should be admitted that most States now recognize, albeit to different degrees, that it is unhelpful to rely on the military paradigm as the first port of call when analyzing inter-state malicious cyber operations. Yet the complexity of the disagreement on the application of *jus ad bellum* lies in the fact that the debate has been very much politicized, from a legal point of view, there does not seem to be a compelling reason why the existing *jus ad bellum* cannot be applied to cyberspace.\nChina’s principled caution does not indicate a lack of concern regarding the issue. On the contrary, as a latecomer to international law, China now has the opportunity to play a significant role in shaping international law in a field that is still in its formative stages. China exhibits ambivalence toward the relevant factors, opting to use non-legal reasoning to minimize excessive discussion and avoid making premature decisions.\nChina’s current restrictive stance on the use of force in cyberspace can be understood from several key perspectives. First, the unique characteristics of cyberspace indeed present challenges to the application of existing frameworks, resulting in significant legal uncertainty. Second, there is insufficient state practice and *opinio juris* to effectively test and verify whether a cyber action constitutes the use of force or an armed attack. Countries have not yet established what rules are generally accepted by the international community, or even what rules would be advantageous for their own interests. Therefore, making a definitive statement at this time may be premature. Thirdly, because of the digital divide related to cyber technology and the soft power of international law-making between China and Western countries, coupled with the growing concerns regarding the\n Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, International Court of Justice, Advisory Opinion’ 1996 226.\n Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization(AALCO), ‘Verbatim Record of the Fifty Fourth Annual Session’, 2015, Doc.

Just as China explained at the 2019 annual meeting of the Asian-African Legal Cooperation Organization, ‘given the “digital gap” between developing and the developed countries, developing countries in general will be in a disadvantaged position in the discussion and development of such rules, it will be difficult to ensure the rules are fair and equitable'. Nevertheless, as an emerging power seeking to influence the development of international law in cyberspace, China's principled official rhetoric regarding of the jus ad bellum in cyberspace may also serve a bargaining leverage in the formulation of international law regulating the use of cyber force.\nEven in the absence of detailed and specific legal rules governing cyber hostile acts in peacetime, states remain bound by three fundamental principles of international law, each carrying increasing normative weight: state sovereignty, non-intervention, and non-use of force. Therefore, China's cautious approach to the use of force in cyberspace stems not only from the aforementioned lack of established practice, strategic continuity, and tactical prudence, but also from a profound commitment to cyber sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention. From China's perspective, most—if not all—contemporary cyberattacks fall short of constituting a use of force and can be more appropriately addressed within the existing framework of cyber sovereignty and non-intervention.\nIn conclusion, it is reasonable to assume that China's restrictive approach to jus ad bellum could materially affect its position on when a cyberattack constitutes the use of force and under what circumstances the right of self-defense can be exercised against a cyberattack. As a typical proponent of multilateralism, China would certainly continue to firmly uphold the integrity and the authority of the UN, which function as the core of the international collective security mechanism. However, this does not imply that China's stance is inflexible and rigid. In light of the characteristics of cyberspace, where its position may evolve be examined.\n### Towards a More Pragmatic Chinese Approach to the Law on Use of Force in Cyberspace?\nWhile cyber operations present a triple challenge to the application of jus ad bellum, the extent to which these challenges are likely to influence China's approach to the law on the use of force in cyberspace is worth re-examining. The following will be discussed from four aspects: attribution, the object of exercising the right of self-defense, the threshold of use of force or armed attack, and the time and limitation of exercising the right of self-defense.\nThe difficulty of attribution due to anonymity in cyberspace can indeed lead to the erosion of international mutual trust, which has a negative impact on the overall cybersecurity. However, fundamentally, this is only a temporary technical obstacle, which will eventually be overcome with technological progress, or a corresponding international response mechanism will be established, so it does not constitute a fundamental subversion of the legal logic of attribution in international law. In addition, as an important element of state responsibility, if the attribution is arbitrarily changed because of the characteristics of a certain field, it will obviously do more harm than good to the maintenance of international order and the predictability of international norms. Therefore, it is unlikely that China will adjust its position on the challenge posed by cyber attribution to the law of the use of force.\nBased on the cognition of the issue of cyber attribution, China will most likely not change its restrictive position on whether the object of exercising the right of self-defense in cyberspace can be extended to non-state actors. Once attribution is resolved, responding to malicious cyberattacks by\nnon-state actors becomes to a large extent a matter of combating cybercrime and international judicial cooperation, which does not necessarily involve the use of force issue, and it is also possible to seek the consent of the territorial State or invoke the principle of due diligence to involve the territorial State and transit State in the fight against cybercriminals or cyberterrorist organizations.\nGiven this, the real challenge lies in the means and methods of cyberattacks, which have fundamentally challenged the traditional theories of warfare. No longer solely focused on the destruction of living forces and physical assets, one significant consequence of cyberattacks is that they create certain confusion to defining the threshold for the use of force or armed attack. This confusion manifests both qualitatively and quantitatively. From a qualitative perspective, the damage caused by cyberattacks can have both physical and non-physical consequences. The current ‘consequence-based' standard proposed by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations is indeed reasonable in this context. When physical consequences can be explained by analogy, it becomes easier to determine whether a cyber operation meets the threshold for the use of force or armed attack. However, this framework struggles to adequately assess cyberattacks that lack physical consequences. Some scholars have argued that disruptive cyber operations may fall under the scope of Article 2(4) if the resulting disruption is ‘significant enough to affect state security', but this interpretation is inherently arbitrary. A more radical interpretation expands the definition of the use of force to include non-destructive cyber operations against critical national infrastructure. However, this ‘target-based' interpretation excessively broadens the threshold, which is not conducive to maintaining peace and security. It also undermines the applicability and integrity of the principles of cyber sovereignty and non-intervention. On the quantitative side, the challenge is more pronounced in defining damage. Non-physical damage is particularly difficult to quantify objectively, and measuring the direct and indirect impacts of cyberattacks presents a complex issue. If the definition of damage cannot be accurately established, how can we ensure that the requirements of necessity and proportionality in the right of self-defense are fulfilled in good faith? In this context, a shift from consequence-based to a convergence of consequence-based, goal-based and function-based criteria is not unacceptable to China.\nBeyond the question of what constitutes the threshold for the use of force, another potential turning point is that the post-attack response is unlikely to be satisfactory. The ineffectiveness of ex-post defense will challenge the temporal requirements for exercising the self-defense. Due to the asymmetric costs associated with cyber offence and defense, the victim country not only faces the burden of implementing general defense measures at a high cost but may also have to endure significant expenses with minimal success in its ex-post response. Therefore, it raises the question of whether it is feasible to flexibly adjust the timing of self-defense against armed cyber-attacks. While the wording of the UN Charter advocates for ex-post defense, there may be room for broader interpretation within customary international law.\nChina has yet to comment on the issue, but it will need to do so sooner or later. As China's cyber capabilities expand globally, so do its overseas interests that require protection, which may lead China to adopt a more open stance on the jus ad bellum. On April 2024, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has set up three new arms, the Aerospace Force, Cyberspace Force, and Information Support Force to serve alongside the existing Joint Logistics Support Force. In the short term, it is highly unlikely that China will issue unilateral statements to clarify its detailed position on the use of force in cyberspace. However, should such a statement be made, it will likely address the use of force\nand the right to self-defense. To date, no state that has issued such a statement has overlooked this issue. Even if China were to make a unilateral declaration regarding the applicability of international law in cyberspace, it is improbable that it would elaborate beyond affirming the prohibition on the use of force. More pragmatically, China's approach to the use of force in cyberspace is likely to be reflected in its responses to individual cyber incidents or operations, as well as in discussions within the UN framework. Just as mentioned in the 2005 Position Paper “given the varying causes and nature of crises, it is both unrealistic and hugely controversial to formulate a one-fits-all rule or criterion on the use of force. Whether to use force or not should be decided by the Security Council in light of the reality of cyber incidents on a case-by-case basis. It remains to be seen whether adaptation will be made by China to the application of specific rules in cyberspace, such as ease up on the right of anticipatory self-defence or endorse a convergence of consequence-based, goal-based and function-based approach on determine the use of force.\n## Conclusion\nThis article elaborates on China's position regarding the jus ad bellum by examining its state practices and official statements. It also explores the extent to which China's approach in the emerging domain of cyberspace may be influenced by, or differ from, its traditional stance. The rationales for China's restrictive stance are partly endogenous, determined primarily by China's philosophy of war and its military strategy of self-restraint, and partly exogenous, including China's decisive position in the UN Security Council and its options for minimizing risk in an anarchic international community.\nChina's conservative stance will most likely continue in cyberspace, but it also faces a dilemma. On the one hand, international lawmaking in cyberspace is under way, and China is finally no longer the rule-taker but a rule-maker. It certainly wants to play a more substantive role and not miss the opportunity. As a potential victim of cyberattacks, it certainly wants to preserve and clarify the right to response against perpetrators, and sticking to rigid traditional positions may not be helpful in protecting national interests, including an increasing number of overseas interests. On the other hand, if the relevant restrictive interpretation is adjusted, the relevant rules may be abused and misinterpreted at will. In the overall unfriendly environment and the situation where, Chinese discourse is not dominant, Chinese legal and natural persons may be subjected to cyber attacks in the name of the right to self-defense, which may further deteriorate international relations in cyberspace. In this sense, China would basically maintain the ‘wait and see' approach regarding the jus ad bellum in cyberspace and continue its overall restrictive understanding of the relevant rules in cyberspace, however, facing the increasing frequency of cyber-attacks, the possibility that China would adopt a more flexible understanding of some specific rules cannot be completely ruled out.\nOur grateful thanks to the Editor and three anonymous reviewers for the journal for their astute comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.\n## Disclosure Statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).",

      "# China's Restrictive Position on the Principle of Non-Use of Force With regard to China's understanding of the principle of non-use of force, China's view is consistent with the framework of the UN and the main stream of international law. From 1949 to 1971, China was largely excluded from the international community based on ideological antagonism and the international situation. In the meantime, China's understanding of the use of force has largely been analyzed in the light of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence that it proposed in the 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement. The Five principles of Peaceful Coexistence, includes the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, has been committed to promoting and implementing by the Chinese government throughout the whole process. It was recently reaffirmed in the Foreign Relations Law. Since People's Republic of China obtained its lawful seat in the United Nations, the Chinese government's public statements repeatedly emphasize the importance of Article 2(4)'s prohibition on the threat or use of force. From the perspective of international law, China's position can be deconstructed from the following aspects."

The rationale for China's restrictive stance is partly endogenous, determined primarily by its philosophy and military strategy of self-restraint, and partly exogenous, influenced by its decisive position in the Security Council. The challenges posed by cyber operations to the use of force are mainly evident in the difficulties of attribution, the evolving means, aims, and effects of cyber-warfare, and the legal ambiguities arising from the asymmetry of offensive and defensive costs. China's stance in cyberspace will be significantly affected by its traditional approach, which stems from the resilience of established rules, strategic inheritance, and tactical cautiousness.",

As early as 2007, Estonia suffered a cyber-attack against its critical infrastructures, and in 2008, Russia was alleged to conduct cyber operations in the military conflict with Georgia. In 2010, Iran's nuclear facilities were severely damaged by a malicious worm known as Stuxnet. Later in 2019, Venezuela claimed its power grid was attacked by cyber means. A growing number of incidents have added urgency to the clarification of international law on the non-use of force in cyberspace. In addition to these sporadic incidents, there has been a general trend to formally establish cyber forces, strengthen cyber defense capabilities, and update military strategies. With the development of practice, the question of whether and how the principle of non-use of force should be applied to cyberspace has been frequently asked. Within the framework of the United Nations, general preliminary agreements have been reached so far, but much remains to be resolved.\nIt is well-known that China has hewed consistently a rather restrictive interpretation of the law on the use of force. However, the analysis of its international law stances, especially the logic and reasoning, needs to be strengthened, such as China's understanding of what constitutes the use of force and under what circumstances the right to self-defence can be exercised. In addition, how China, an extremely important state actor as well as stakeholder in the cyber domain, conceives of jus ad bellum in cyberspace is understandably a great concern for other States.\nThis paper explores the formation and evolution of China's traditionally restrictive normative stance on the non-use of force. Building on this foundation, it examines China's position on the use of force in cyberspace, incorporating an analysis of the unique characteristics of this domain. Furthermore, the paper assesses whether China's approach to the use of force in cyberspace is undergoing a historical shift—from a restrictive doctrine to a more pragmatically flexible stance. It is therefore divided into four parts. After quickly revisiting the current legal framework on the use of force, the second part demonstrates China's restrictive interpretation of jus ad bellum, and a general wariness towards the use of force outside the UN framework. Subsequently, the third part analyzes the challenges posed by ICTs to the application of the law on the use of force in cyberspace, and after navigating China's position on this issue and its reasoning, points out that although China still holds a restrictive position on the whole, the possibility of a shift towards a more flexible and pragmatic direction cannot be ruled out. Finally, a preliminary conclusion will be briefly presented.\n## The Chinese Restrictive Approach to the Law on the Use of Force Regarding the jus ad bellum, China has always taken a restrictive approach, that is, it believes that the prohibition of the use of force as a principle should be strictly observed, and exceptions should be minimized. This part examines the formation, consistency and evolution of China's normative position from an empirical perspective, and analyzes why China has basically adhered to this restrictive interpretation for more than half a century, and whether China's inclination has shifted in the context of the new era.\n## JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA # # The Formation and Evolution of the Chinese Approach on the Use of Force First of all, China's interpretation of the principle prohibiting the use of force will be briefly presented based on its domestic regulations and corresponding statements. Secondly, China's position on exceptions to this prohibition will be examined through both its words and deeds, along with its stance with regard to the proposition of using force outside the framework of the UN Charter.",
    "# China's Restrictive Position on the Principle of Non-Use of Force With regard to China's understanding of the principle of non-use of force, China's view is consistent with the framework of the UN and the main stream of international law. From 1949 to 1971, China was largely excluded from the international community based on ideological antagonism and the international situation. In the meantime, China's understanding of the use of force has largely been analyzed in the light of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence that it proposed in the 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement. The Five principles of Peaceful Coexistence, includes the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, has been committed to promoting and implementing by the Chinese government throughout the whole process. It was recently reaffirmed in the Foreign Relations Law. Since People's Republic of China obtained its lawful seat in the United Nations, the Chinese government's public statements repeatedly emphasize the importance of Article 2(4)'s prohibition on the threat or use of force. From the perspective of international law, China's position can be deconstructed from the following aspects.": "First, China emphasizes the central and even monopolistic role of the UN collective security mechanism, especially the Security Council, on the use of force. In other words, the use of force by states is prohibited absent Security Council authorization with the sole exception of self-defense.[11] Secondly, China reckons that Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the use of force among sovereign States and also applies in the military conflicts between States and nations seeking self-determination. For instance, Article 4 of the Foreign Relations Law stipulates that China 'opposes the use of force or threat of force in international relations'. The legal argument here is that the prohibition applies only to the use of force by states against other states, thus does not affect the right of States to use force to maintain national security and order within their domestic jurisdiction.[12] Therefore, given the position of the Chinese Government, which is that Taiwan is part of China's sacred territory,[13] the nature of the Taiwan question 'is purely an internal matter for China'.[14] Thirdly, the Chinese government confines 'force' in Art. 2(4) of the UN Charter to military force and thus economic or political coercion is excluded. Additionally, Unlike the United States, which tends not to strictly distinguish between the use of force and armed attack,[15] China believes that only the most serious form of use of force constitutes an armed attack, which is in line with the conclusion given by the ICJ in the Nicaragua vs. the United States case.[16] In summary, China's attitude towards jus ad bellum falls squally on the side of restrictive camp, and it is largely consistent over the half past century.\n8Shengzu Wang, History of International Relations[国际关系史], Vol. 8 (World Knowledge Press 1995).\n9Tieya Wang, International Law in China: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives (Martinus Nijhoff Publishers 1990).\n10Law on Foreign Relations of the People's Republic of China, 2023.\n11The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, 'Position Paper of the People's Republic of China on the UN Reforms' (7 June 2005) <https: 200506=\"\"2005year_675849=\"\"20050607_9288805.s=\"\"22005=\"\"22gylhg_675873=\"\"674904=\"\"zit_674979=\"\"jiliao_674904=\"\"jywzt_675099=\"\"jwz1hg_675873=\"\"www.fmprc.gov.cn=\"\"ziliao_674904=\"\"> 12Kinmin Ma, 使用武力法:发展与挑战[‘The Law of Use of Force: Development and Challenges’] (2013) Chinese Yearbook of International Law.",
    "# Y. YING AND Z. SHI # Restrictive Interpretation of Exceptions to the Principle of Non-Use of Force Consistent with its formalist interpretation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, China maintains a restrictive position on exceptions to the principle of non-use of force, asserting that only two exceptions are recognized. The first is when the Security Council authorizes the use of force under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, and the second is when a state exercises its right to self-defense.[17] The Security Council's authorization is a typical manifestation of the collective security system established by the United Nations and is generally uncontroversial in international law. However, as an inherent right of the states, self-defense has always been a subject of debate. Furthermore, the use of force outside the UN system has gained traction, particularly under the banners of humanitarian intervention and the Responsibility to Protect (R2P). This section will examine China's position on the right to self-defense and its perspective on the use of force beyond the UN framework.": "Self-Defence. As sovereign States' inherent right, self-defence is indisputably constituted the legal exceptions to the non-use of force principle. Article 51 of UN Charter is a right-confirmation clause rather than a right-grant clause.[18] It can be considered that treaty law and customary rule on the right of self-defence exist in parallel.[19] Regarding China's stance on self-defence, both deeds and words need to be examined.\nThe three typical incidents of China's use of force occurred during a period when China was completely excluded from the United Nations, namely, the intervention in the Korean War in the 1950s; the border dispute and conflict between China and India in $1962$; the Sino-Soviet Union Zhenbao (Damanskii) Island Incident in 1969. Some Chinese scholars render that China's intervention in Korean War could be characterized as the exercise of the right of self-defense,[21] but there was no explicit invocation by the Chinese government, although it repeatedly stressed that its involvement in Korean War was a just war.[22] China's participation in the Korean War can be analyzed in the light of the following considerations. China's intervention came at the request and express consent of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In addition, China chose to aid the DPRK in the name of the 'People's Volunteers Army'[23] instead of the People's Liberation Army.\nWith the exception of Korean war, other situations involving use of force were clearly defined by China as 'self-defense counterattacks',[24] otherwise as exercises of the right to self-defence. From 1971 to 1990, China's discussions regarding the use of force and its exceptions in the Security Council were limited, largely due to its domestic policies and the atmosphere of the Cold War. Additionally, the 1979 border conflict with Vietnam was officially characterized by the Chinese government as an act of self-defense. This characterization is evident in China's submission of a formal letter to the 17The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China (n 11).\n18Christian Henderson, The Use of Force and International Law (Cambridge University Press 2018) 19Chris O'Meara, 'Reconceptualising the Right of Self-Defence against\"Imminent\"Armed Attacks' [2022] 9(2) Journal on the Use of Force and International Law 278-323.\n20Ashley J.

Since then, China's discussions in the Security Council and other international forums regarding the legality of the use of force and its exceptions have gradually transitioned from limited participation to active engagement. The Position Paper of the People's Republic of China on United Nations Reforms, released in 2005 (hereinafter '2005 Position Paper'), serves as a landmark document, as it provides the most detailed illustration of China's position on jus ad bellum to date. It stipulated as follows: 'We are of the view that Article 51 of the Charter should neither be amended nor reinterpreted. The Charter lays down explicit provisions on the use of force, i.e. use of force shall not be resorted to without the authorization of the Security Council with the exception of self-defense under armed attack. Whether an urgent threat exists should be determined and handled with prudence by the Security Council in accordance with Chapter 7 of the Charter and in light of the specific situation'.[26] This 2005 position paper conveys precisely China's restrictive interpretation of the right to self-defense and provides a very cautious and conservative answer to two major disputes about the exercise of self-defense, namely, when and to whom the right of self-defense should be exercised. Compared to the relatively new position in 2021,[27] China's stance on the right to self-defense remains largely consistent.\nIt is highly controversial whether the exercise of the right to self-defense should be interpreted strictly in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, which states that 'under armed attack' is a necessary prerequisite, or whether it can be exercised more flexibly in anticipation of imminent or even just potential threats. Regarding temporal requirements, China maintains an open yet extremely cautious approach. On the one hand, it consistently rejects the concept of 'preventive self-defense',[28] recently associated with the 'Bush Doctrine',[29] which China views as an abuse of the right to self-defense and thus emphasis 'no state should... use force arbitrarily in the name of preventive self-defence'.[30] On the other hand, China is also skeptical about the notion of 'anticipatory self-defense', which is called the Caroline doctrine[31] under customary international law, according to which a state is required to prove that its use of force in response to a threat which was 'instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation'. The 2005 position paper using the phrase 'self-defense under armed attack',[32] seems to lead to the conclusion that the Chinese government adopted a narrow understanding, which is in line with the plain meaning and the negotiating history of Article 51, especially with the provision 'if an armed attack occurs'.[33] Nevertheless, it does not entirely dismiss the potential for exercising the right to self-defense against imminent threats under customary international law.[34] In addition, to whom the right of self-defense should be exercised, that is, the target requirement, also generates debates.

YING AND Z. SHI defence undertaken by the victim State must be only against another State. However, in traditional view, non-state actors are not seen as the subjects of international law. In that vein, therefore, self-defence cannot be exercised against non-state actors unless the 'armed attack' conducted by this non-state actors are attributable to another sovereign state under the law of state responsibility. The ICJ in the Wall Advisory Opinion held that Article 51 of the UN Charter 'recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self-defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State'. China appears to be a little ambivalent on this point, as it voted in favour of the Security Council resolutions on the use of force against al-Qaeda after 9/11. Yet it still deeply worries about the abuse of the right to self-defence as an exception to the prohibition of the use of force, and it emphasizes that\"The use of force against non-state actors in the territory of another state, which is for the purpose of self-defence, shall be subject to the consent of the state concerned... no state should interfere in other's internal affairs under the cloak of 'counter-terrorism'. This also echoes China's three principles of UN peacekeeping, namely, consent of the parties, impartiality and non-use of force except in self-defense and defense of the mandate. \nAssertions of the Use of Force Outside the Collective Security System. After the end of the Cold War, discussions emerged regarding the justification of using force outside the framework of the United Nations in extreme circumstances. This debate is particularly represented by the theory of humanitarian intervention and, later, the Responsibility to Protect (R2P). Humanitarian intervention is a doctrine that advocates for intervention to protect citizens from the oppression of their own government,[41] allowing for unilateral force to be employed to protect human rights in another state.[42] The concept of R2P was developed as an alternative to humanitarian intervention and was coined by a commission established by the Canadian government after the controversial NATO airstrikes against the former Yugoslavia in 1999.[43] Generally, China's acceptance of the R2P concept is significantly higher than that of humanitarian intervention.\nAs for the humanitarian intervention, it can be said that China, together with many developing states, opposes this idea.[44] It is true that China's approach to humanitarian intervention, and to the use of force in the broader sense, is profoundly influenced by its position on the principle of sovereignty under the UN Charter.[45] A case in point is China's response to NATO's military intervention in Kosovo in 1999, during which it repeatedly stressed in the UN discussions that 'Kosovo is an inherent part of the territory of the former Yugoslavia',[46] and rendered external intervention, particular through the use of force, would amount to the 'internationalization of a domestic issue'.[47] From China's perspective, Serbia was defending its sovereignty against internal challenges, a position that China almost certainly viewed with sympathy given its own internal challenges to 35Kimberley N Trapp, 'Can Non-State Actors Mount an Armed Attack?' in Marc Weller (ed), The Oxford Handbook of the Use of Force in International Law (Oxford University Press 2015).\n36UN GA, 'Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts', 2002, UN Doc.

China has also acquiesced in or actively supported a number of more limited humanitarian interventions, including in Haiti,⁴⁹ Somalia,⁵⁰ Bosnia,⁵¹ East Timor,⁵² etc. From these resolutions on humanitarian grounds for which China provided limited support, the Chinese government's essential requirements for humanitarian intervention have become increasingly clear, namely, authorization of Security Council and the consent of the host state.⁵³ Meanwhile, China has demonstrated a significant shift in its position on sovereignty by accepting the basic tenets of the R2P. For example, the 2005 Position Paper includes the concept of R2P.⁵⁴ Yet it appears that China soon realized that it went too far.⁵⁵ Therefore, China changed its tune during the debates on the first UN General Assembly resolution on R2P in 2009, contending that the R2P remained 'a concept' and did not constitute 'a norm of international law'.⁵⁶ Furthermore, China warned that the implementation of R2P 'should not contravene the principle of state sovereignty and non-intervention in the internal affairs of States' and that the R2P should be prevented from 'becoming a kind of humanitarian intervention'.⁵⁷ Unlike some western states that focus on the third pillar of R2P, Responsibility to React, China attaches special weight to the other two pillars, i.e. Responsibility to Prevent and Responsibility to Rebuild,⁵⁸ which are the main reasons why R2P could be quickly accepted by those traditionally opposing humanitarian interventions at the 2005 World Summit.⁵⁹ China's position on R2P can be roughly analyzed by its shift of attitude from Libya to Syria in the voting and argumentation of Security Council resolutions.⁶⁰ China abstained from the voting on resolution 1973 (2011),⁶¹ and notably did not block the pass of this resolution although it has 'serious difficulty with parts of the resolution'.⁶² Three crucial aspects of this highly unusual, perhaps exceptional, confluence of factors is considered.⁶³ The first key factor that influenced international action in Libya was 'the clarity and immediacy of the threat to the civilian population'.⁶⁴ The second and most crucial factor that provided the impetus for military action in Libya was the presence of regional consensus on the need for external intervention.⁶⁵ The third important trigger was 'the defection of members of the Gaddafi government'.⁶⁶ However, China was concerned with the actual implementation of the Resolution 1973 by ⁴⁸ Jonathan Davis, 'From Ideology to Pragmatism: China's Position on Humanitarian Intervention in the Post-Cold War Era' [2011] 44(2) Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law 217–283.\n⁴⁹ UN SC, 'Provisional Verbatim Record of the 3238th Meeting', 1993, UN Doc.S/PV.3238.\n⁵⁰ UN SC, 'Provisional Verbatim Record of the 3145th Meeting', 1992, UN Doc.S/PV.3145.\n⁵¹ UN SC, 'Security Council the 3461st Meeting', 1994, UN Doc.

For instance, it stated that ‘we are not in favor of any arbitrary interpretation of the Council's resolutions or of any actions going beyond those mandated'. China believed that its lenient approach to Libya worsened the situation and does not want a repeat in Syria. Thus, three separate Western-supported draft resolutions proposing non-forcible measures against the Assad regime had been vetoed by Russia and China.\nTo sum up, China's attitude towards concepts such as humanitarian intervention and R2P, which revise the traditional principles of non-use of force and sovereignty, is no longer as rigid as it used to be. China's approach to the issue is case-by-case, shifting from an initially ideological focus to a more pragmatic approach.\n### The Restrictive Approach Revisited: Consistency and Rationale China's position on the use of force in international law has remained remarkably consistent over the past half-century, reflecting its broader transition from an outsider to an active participant in the international legal order. Despite profound shifts in global politics and China's evolving role on the world stage, its restrictive interpretation of jus ad bellum has endured, with steadfast adherence to the principle of non-use of force and a high threshold for exceptions. As China's global influence expands, its legal stance on the use of force will become increasingly significant. China's foreign policy has evolved from a strategy of biding its time to ‘advancing towards the center of the world stage'. While its foreign policy has evolved—shifting emphasis toward sovereignty and non-intervention rather than an absolute prohibition on force—its foundational approach remains unchanged. Understanding the rationale behind this persistent restrictivism requires an analysis from three key dimensions: internal formation, external influence, and objective morality.\nOn the one hand, China's restrictive approach is partly endogenous, shaped by its philosophy, its tradition of self-restraint, and its post-strike military strategy. These internal factors have fostered a long-standing commitment to limiting the use of force as a means of conflict resolution. China, as a quintessential agrarian civilization, operates within a governance framework that is inherently inward-looking, prioritizing land cultivation, territorial integrity, resource stability, and self-sufficiency. This model fosters a worldview that emphasizes continuity, tradition, and social order, rather than external expansion or aggressive engagement with foreign entities. Unlike maritime civilizations, which historically pursued expansion through conquest and overseas dominance, agrarian economies do not rely on external plunder for economic development. As a result, China lacks the inherent impetus for territorial expansion and have no enduring tradition of long-distance military expeditions. Furthermore, agrarian civilizations often perceive interaction with the outside world as a potential risk rather than an opportunity, leading to policies characterized by controlled trade and strict border defense. A notable historical example is the construction of the Great Wall, which was designed not for expansion, but for defense against external incursions.\nIn addition, Confucian philosophy and historical military doctrines emphasize defensive wars and deterrence rather than preemptive aggression. Sima Law says that ‘though a country is now strong, bellicosity will lead to its ruin(国虽大, 好战必亡)’. For the surrounding ethnic groups, it has advocated ‘In practicing the rules of propriety, it is harmony that is prized(以和为贵, 以礼为固)’. Because of its self-perception as the superior state of China, it will hardly actively attack unless there is a threat to the tributary system and there is a need for restoration of peace. Even in its philosophy of war, China has always advocated ‘the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting(不战而屈人之兵)’. China possesses a defense-oriented strategy. It keeps to the stance that ‘we will not attack unless we are attacked, but we will surely counterattack if attacked’. Though met with debate, a typical example of this is China’s strategic posture regarding the nuclear weapons. In 1964, after its first nuclear test, China made the declaration that its nuclear development was solely for self-defence. China unconditionally committed itself to the non-use or threat of use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon States and to the non-first use of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances. Since its first National Defence White Paper in 1998, China has been adhering to the ‘principles of defense, self-defense and post-strike response’. This post-strike military position and its related philosophy of war have largely influenced China’s approach to the non-use of force.\nOn the other hand, the rationales for China's restrictive stance are partly exogenous, including China's decisive position in the Security Council and its options for minimizing risk in an anarchic international community. As one of the five permanent members, China bears a primary responsibility in ensuring international peace and security. China's advocacy on the dominant role of UN Security Council has closely related to its role as one of the permanent members, of which it has veto power. In this way, China can be sure that, at least under the framework of the United Nations, the Security Council will not make a resolution on the use of force to its disadvantage. Especially after witnessing the tragic consequences of unilateral military action and the abuse of the right to self-defense, China has affirmed that the restrictionist position is the best solution to safeguarding national interests, grounded in instrumental rationality and utilitarianism.\nAdditionally, morality and legitimacy play a crucial role. As a victim of war and the first country to sign the UN Charter, China sincerely and in good faith believes that the pursuit of peace is an objective that must never be compromised. The restrictive approach faithfully based on the UN Charter, objectively provides predictability in international behaviours and serves as a robust guarantee of international peace.",

In addition to advancements made under the UN, several countries have issued position papers outlining how international law applies to cyberspace through unilateral statements. All of these statements reference jus ad bellum in the context of cyberspace. Dozens of states have adopted the doctrine of scale and effects as criteria for determining what constitutes the use of force in cyberspace. Some have proposed progressive propositions such as anticipatory self-defense, cumulative self-defense, and self-defense against cyberattacks launched by non-state actors. At this critical juncture for clarifying and updating the rules, China appears to be in no rush to issue a unilateral declaration to clarify its position on the regulations governing the use of force in cyberspace.\nThe following discussion will unfold in three steps. First, the challenges posed by cyber operations to the existing framework of rules regarding the use of force will be elucidated. Second, China's stance on the law governing the use of force in cyberspace will be examined, along with an analysis of the considerations underlying China's general position in light of its domestic cyber strategy and the evolution of laws related to cyberspace. Finally, whether China's relevant stance in cyberspace would witness a historical shift from restrictionism to a more pragmatic flexibility will be explored.\n### The Challenges Posed by Cyber Operations to the Law on the Use of Force It has to be acknowledged the international law regarding jus ad bellum per se is controversial within traditional physical domain. Cyberspace is often perceived as a homomorphic map of the physical domain, and this issue persists. In addition to the previously mentioned complexities, the unique characteristics of cyberspace further exacerbate the situation.\nFirstly, the application of cyber military technology has challenged modern theories of warfare. There exists a reciprocal relationship between military technology and theories of warfare. Cyberattacks no longer concentrate solely on the destruction of living forces and tangible assets, normally do not involve physical incursions into territory, and lack the apparent intensity and violence characteristic of kinetic warfare. This challenges fundamental assumptions regarding subject identification, real-world physical consequences, and civil-military distinctions. The damage caused by a cyberattack can be both tangible and intangible, including disruptions to financial markets, functional failures, and data loss. Furthermore, cyberattacks may be difficult for the victim states to detect. Additionally, the consequences of cyberattacks are often unpredictable and challenging to control. International law has yet to provide mature answers on how to evaluate intangible damages within the framework of jus ad bellum.\nSecondly, cyberattacks present dual challenges of technical and legal attribution. Due to the interconnectedness and anonymity of the cyberspace, attribution faces both technical and legal hurdles, raising questions about the object of the right to self-defense in cyberspace. States that conduct cyberattacks often intentionally evade accountability by employing proxy warfare or utilizing non-state actors as the actual perpetrators through outsourcing or contracting, thereby concealing their involvement. In notable cyberattacks that have garnered significant attention from the international community, such as the Estonian incident in 2007 and the Stuxnet in 2010, various clues have emerged, yet no country has ever acknowledged its participation. The existing legal framework for attribution, based on the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, struggles to effectively address the complexities of attribution in cyberspace, leading to ongoing debates about whether the right to self-defense extends to non-state actors.\nThirdly, the asymmetric cost dynamics between offensive and defensive cyber operations have given rise to a bidirectional deterrence effect. At the same time, the limited effectiveness of ex-post defensive measures in mitigating the impact of cyberattacks has further weakened mutual trust among sovereign states, exacerbating tensions in the international cybersecurity landscape. This situation poses significant challenges regarding the timing and limitations of states' exercise of the right to self-defense. In contrast to traditional kinetic weapons, particularly nuclear arms, the costs associated with the creation, research, and production of cyber weapons are relatively low. Additionally, the expenses related to reproduction and replacement are more affordable. Countries with robust cyber capabilities often rely heavily on digital networks for governance and management, making them more vulnerable to cyberattacks—a phenomenon known as the ‘glass house dilemma'. Plus, the consequences inflicted by cyberattacks may be temporary or permanent, direct or indirect, tangible or intangible, and can even exceed the perpetrator's control. However, it is certain that the erosion of the victim state's authority and the diminishing trust of its citizens are inevitable outcomes. All of this underscores the reality that the costs of defending against and responding to cyberattacks—whether they are ongoing or have already concluded—can be substantial and disproportionate. Thus, it is challenging for states to determine when to respond and how to navigate the constraints of necessity and proportionality in their responses. In short, this is likely to lead to a generalization of the right to self-defense. Claims such as anticipatory self-defense and cumulative self-defense with response to cyber-attacks have begun to emerge, challenging the established legal framework of jus ad bellum.\nThe three challenges outlined above demonstrate that the military application of cyber technology poses significant difficulties for the existing framework governing the non-use of force. This situation is not putting old wine in a new bottle but highlights the urgent need for a collaborative response among states. Without such cooperation, certain cyber operations may remain ambiguous under international law due to unclear definitions. This ambiguity undermines the predictability of norms in cyberspace and threatens the long-term stability of the cyber environment.\n### China's Cautious Stance on the Use of Force in Cyberspace and Its Strategic Considerations China's stance on the use of force in cyberspace remains conservative thus is prima facie consistent with its restrictive approach in physical domain. Without providing any substantive clarification on the operational level, China declared a firm attitude towards the peaceful use of cyberspace. It has stressed on many occasions that all countries should adhere to the principle of non-use of force enshrined in the UN Charter in the cyber context. For instance, the joint Sino-Russian proposal for an International Code of Conduct for Information Security in 2011 stated that ‘to settle any dispute resulting from the application of the code through peaceful means and to refrain from the threat or use of force'. In addition, the 2017 International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace clearly stipulated that ‘China is dedicated to promoting each party in effectively complying with the basic international relationship rules such as... refraining from use or threat of force'. However, China has been vague about what defines the use of cyber force and the specific circumstances under which it may invoke the right to self-defense in response to cyberattacks.\nThis partially because of the resilience of the existing *jus ad bellum* rules. The rules governing the non-use of force are not meant to be domain-specific, as ICJ has opined that Articles 2(4) and 51 of the UN Charter regarding the prohibition on use of force and self-defence, respectively, apply to ‘any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed’.⁸⁹ From the point of view of effective interpretation, it is submitted that the system of laws and regulations on the non-use of force itself has resilience. Although the cyberspace is artificial, it is still closely related to the traditional domain, and the existing rules can be extended to apply to the cyberspace. Thus, there is no legal vacuum. In terms of cost, China’s (or any other states’) position cannot be completely divorced from the existing framework.\nCompared to Western countries, China is currently less inclined to express a definitive stance on this issue. It perceives a troubling trend in the discourse that emphasizes exceptions rather than fundamental principles, with some states attempting to lower the threshold for triggering the right to self-defence in cyberspace. Although China places significant importance on the peaceful use of cyberspace, it believes that excessive discussion regarding the right to resort to force—particularly in the name of self-defence—could have potential negative impact on international peace and security, aggravating an arms race and leading to the militarization of cyberspace.⁹⁰ Thus, the Chinese government is skeptical of the intense debate surrounding exceptions that justify the use of cyber force, contending that Western countries are cherry-picking on this issue. For example, China emphasized the ‘overemphasis on making exceptions for cyber warfare or self-defense, while the non-use of force principle has been marginalized’ and ‘the risk of sliding towards the militarization of cyberspace’.⁹¹ In its submission to the UN Open-ended Working Group, China stated that ‘state should focus on… refraining from the use or threat of use of force. Willful use of force… should be prevented. The applicability of… *jus ad bellum* needs to be handled with prudence’.⁹² It should be admitted that most States now recognize, albeit to different degrees, that it is unhelpful to rely on the military paradigm as the first port of call when analyzing inter-state malicious cyber operations.⁹³ Yet the complexity of the disagreement on the application of *jus ad bellum* lies in the fact that the debate has been very much politicized, from a legal point of view, there does not seem to be a compelling reason why the existing *jus ad bellum* cannot be applied to cyberspace.\nChina’s principled caution does not indicate a lack of concern regarding the issue. On the contrary, as a latecomer to international law, China now has the opportunity to play a significant role in shaping international law in a field that is still in its formative stages. China exhibits ambivalence toward the relevant factors, opting to use non-legal reasoning to minimize excessive discussion and avoid making premature decisions.\nChina’s current restrictive stance on the use of force in cyberspace can be understood from several key perspectives. First, the unique characteristics of cyberspace indeed present challenges to the application of existing frameworks, resulting in significant legal uncertainty. Second, there is insufficient state practice and *opinio juris* to effectively test and verify whether a cyber action constitutes the use of force or an armed attack. Countries have not yet established what rules are generally accepted by the international community, or even what rules would be advantageous for their own interests. Therefore, making a definitive statement at this time may be premature. Thirdly, because of the digital divide related to cyber technology and the soft power of international law-making between China and Western countries, coupled with the growing concerns regarding the ⁸⁹ Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, International Court of Justice, Advisory Opinion’ 1996 226.\n⁹⁰ Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization(AALCO), ‘Verbatim Record of the Fifty Fourth Annual Session’, 2015, Doc.

Just as China explained at the 2019 annual meeting of the Asian-African Legal Cooperation Organization, ‘given the “digital gap” between developing and the developed countries, developing countries in general will be in a disadvantaged position in the discussion and development of such rules, it will be difficult to ensure the rules are fair and equitable'. Nevertheless, as an emerging power seeking to influence the development of international law in cyberspace, China's principled official rhetoric regarding of the jus ad bellum in cyberspace may also serve a bargaining leverage in the formulation of international law regulating the use of cyber force.\nEven in the absence of detailed and specific legal rules governing cyber hostile acts in peacetime, states remain bound by three fundamental principles of international law, each carrying increasing normative weight: state sovereignty, non-intervention, and non-use of force. Therefore, China's cautious approach to the use of force in cyberspace stems not only from the aforementioned lack of established practice, strategic continuity, and tactical prudence, but also from a profound commitment to cyber sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention. From China's perspective, most—if not all—contemporary cyberattacks fall short of constituting a use of force and can be more appropriately addressed within the existing framework of cyber sovereignty and non-intervention.\nIn conclusion, it is reasonable to assume that China's restrictive approach to jus ad bellum could materially affect its position on when a cyberattack constitutes the use of force and under what circumstances the right of self-defense can be exercised against a cyberattack. As a typical proponent of multilateralism, China would certainly continue to firmly uphold the integrity and the authority of the UN, which function as the core of the international collective security mechanism. However, this does not imply that China's stance is inflexible and rigid. In light of the characteristics of cyberspace, where its position may evolve be examined.\n### Towards a More Pragmatic Chinese Approach to the Law on Use of Force in Cyberspace?\nWhile cyber operations present a triple challenge to the application of jus ad bellum, the extent to which these challenges are likely to influence China's approach to the law on the use of force in cyberspace is worth re-examining. The following will be discussed from four aspects: attribution, the object of exercising the right of self-defense, the threshold of use of force or armed attack, and the time and limitation of exercising the right of self-defense.\nThe difficulty of attribution due to anonymity in cyberspace can indeed lead to the erosion of international mutual trust, which has a negative impact on the overall cybersecurity. However, fundamentally, this is only a temporary technical obstacle, which will eventually be overcome with technological progress, or a corresponding international response mechanism will be established, so it does not constitute a fundamental subversion of the legal logic of attribution in international law. In addition, as an important element of state responsibility, if the attribution is arbitrarily changed because of the characteristics of a certain field, it will obviously do more harm than good to the maintenance of international order and the predictability of international norms. Therefore, it is unlikely that China will adjust its position on the challenge posed by cyber attribution to the law of the use of force.\nBased on the cognition of the issue of cyber attribution, China will most likely not change its restrictive position on whether the object of exercising the right of self-defense in cyberspace can be extended to non-state actors. Once attribution is resolved, responding to malicious cyberattacks by non-state actors becomes to a large extent a matter of combating cybercrime and international judicial cooperation, which does not necessarily involve the use of force issue, and it is also possible to seek the consent of the territorial State or invoke the principle of due diligence to involve the territorial State and transit State in the fight against cybercriminals or cyberterrorist organizations.\nGiven this, the real challenge lies in the means and methods of cyberattacks, which have fundamentally challenged the traditional theories of warfare. No longer solely focused on the destruction of living forces and physical assets, one significant consequence of cyberattacks is that they create certain confusion to defining the threshold for the use of force or armed attack. This confusion manifests both qualitatively and quantitatively. From a qualitative perspective, the damage caused by cyberattacks can have both physical and non-physical consequences. The current ‘consequence-based' standard proposed by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations is indeed reasonable in this context. When physical consequences can be explained by analogy, it becomes easier to determine whether a cyber operation meets the threshold for the use of force or armed attack. However, this framework struggles to adequately assess cyberattacks that lack physical consequences. Some scholars have argued that disruptive cyber operations may fall under the scope of Article 2(4) if the resulting disruption is ‘significant enough to affect state security', but this interpretation is inherently arbitrary. A more radical interpretation expands the definition of the use of force to include non-destructive cyber operations against critical national infrastructure. However, this ‘target-based' interpretation excessively broadens the threshold, which is not conducive to maintaining peace and security. It also undermines the applicability and integrity of the principles of cyber sovereignty and non-intervention. On the quantitative side, the challenge is more pronounced in defining damage. Non-physical damage is particularly difficult to quantify objectively, and measuring the direct and indirect impacts of cyberattacks presents a complex issue. If the definition of damage cannot be accurately established, how can we ensure that the requirements of necessity and proportionality in the right of self-defense are fulfilled in good faith? In this context, a shift from consequence-based to a convergence of consequence-based, goal-based and function-based criteria is not unacceptable to China.\nBeyond the question of what constitutes the threshold for the use of force, another potential turning point is that the post-attack response is unlikely to be satisfactory. The ineffectiveness of ex-post defense will challenge the temporal requirements for exercising the self-defense. Due to the asymmetric costs associated with cyber offence and defense, the victim country not only faces the burden of implementing general defense measures at a high cost but may also have to endure significant expenses with minimal success in its ex-post response. Therefore, it raises the question of whether it is feasible to flexibly adjust the timing of self-defense against armed cyber-attacks. While the wording of the UN Charter advocates for ex-post defense, there may be room for broader interpretation within customary international law.\nChina has yet to comment on the issue, but it will need to do so sooner or later. As China's cyber capabilities expand globally, so do its overseas interests that require protection, which may lead China to adopt a more open stance on the jus ad bellum. On April 2024, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has set up three new arms, the Aerospace Force, Cyberspace Force, and Information Support Force to serve alongside the existing Joint Logistics Support Force. In the short term, it is highly unlikely that China will issue unilateral statements to clarify its detailed position on the use of force in cyberspace. However, should such a statement be made, it will likely address the use of force and the right to self-defense. To date, no state that has issued such a statement has overlooked this issue. Even if China were to make a unilateral declaration regarding the applicability of international law in cyberspace, it is improbable that it would elaborate beyond affirming the prohibition on the use of force. More pragmatically, China's approach to the use of force in cyberspace is likely to be reflected in its responses to individual cyber incidents or operations, as well as in discussions within the UN framework. Just as mentioned in the 2005 Position Paper “given the varying causes and nature of crises, it is both unrealistic and hugely controversial to formulate a one-fits-all rule or criterion on the use of force. Whether to use force or not should be decided by the Security Council in light of the reality of cyber incidents on a case-by-case basis. It remains to be seen whether adaptation will be made by China to the application of specific rules in cyberspace, such as ease up on the right of anticipatory self-defence or endorse a convergence of consequence-based, goal-based and function-based approach on determine the use of force.",
    "## Conclusion This article elaborates on China's position regarding the jus ad bellum by examining its state practices and official statements. It also explores the extent to which China's approach in the emerging domain of cyberspace may be influenced by, or differ from, its traditional stance. The rationales for China's restrictive stance are partly endogenous, determined primarily by China's philosophy of war and its military strategy of self-restraint, and partly exogenous, including China's decisive position in the UN Security Council and its options for minimizing risk in an anarchic international community.": "China's conservative stance will most likely continue in cyberspace, but it also faces a dilemma. On the one hand, international lawmaking in cyberspace is under way, and China is finally no longer the rule-taker but a rule-maker. It certainly wants to play a more substantive role and not miss the opportunity. As a potential victim of cyberattacks, it certainly wants to preserve and clarify the right to response against perpetrators, and sticking to rigid traditional positions may not be helpful in protecting national interests, including an increasing number of overseas interests. On the other hand, if the relevant restrictive interpretation is adjusted, the relevant rules may be abused and misinterpreted at will. In the overall unfriendly environment and the situation where, Chinese discourse is not dominant, Chinese legal and natural persons may be subjected to cyber attacks in the name of the right to self-defense, which may further deteriorate international relations in cyberspace. In this sense, China would basically maintain the ‘wait and see' approach regarding the jus ad bellum in cyberspace and continue its overall restrictive understanding of the relevant rules in cyberspace, however, facing the increasing frequency of cyber-attacks, the possibility that China would adopt a more flexible understanding of some specific rules cannot be completely ruled out.\nOur grateful thanks to the Editor and three anonymous reviewers for the journal for their astute comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.",

The rationale for China's restrictive stance is partly endogenous, determined primarily by its philosophy and military strategy of self-restraint, and partly exogenous, influenced by its decisive position in the Security Council. The challenges posed by cyber operations to the use of force are mainly evident in the difficulties of attribution, the evolving means, aims, and effects of cyber-warfare, and the legal ambiguities arising from the asymmetry of offensive and defensive costs. China's stance in cyberspace will be significantly affected by its traditional approach, which stems from the resilience of established rules, strategic inheritance, and tactical cautiousness.\n# KEYWORDS\nuse of force; cyberspace; self-defence; China; jus ad bellum\n# Introduction\nWar and peace are the eternal themes of mankind. After the Second World War, the international community for the first time made the prohibition of the use of force as one of the fundamental principles of international law, thereby establishing a new international order. Simply put, the status quo of the normative framework for the law on the use of force can be summarized as 'one principle with two exceptions'. Under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and customary international law, states should refrain from the use or threat of force in international relations. But there are two exceptions to this principle. The first is the use of force authorized by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. This is the embodiment of the collective security mechanism established by the UN. The other exception is the victim state exercises its inherent right of self-defence.\nThis normative framework of 'one principle with two exceptions' forms the starting point for scholarly discussion of the law of the use of force. The connotation of international law related to jus ad bellum, as a typically high political field that touches on the survival and fundamental interests of states, is much more complicated in reality. As self-interest subjects, states would choose to clarify the principle and exceptions of the law of the non-use of force in extensive or restrictive way under different circumstances, and even put forward propositions beyond the existing normative framework. Therefore, the controversy over the law on the use of force has persisted since the day the regime was established, making this area one of the most contentious bodies of law. $^{1}$\nThe emergence of cyber technology and the proliferation of cyber warfare threats have further complicated the situation. With the rise and popularization of network technology, cyberspace has\nCONTACT Zehua Shi shizehua@whu.edu.cn Law School, Wuhan University, No. 299 Bayi Road, Wuhan, Hubei, China\n1Monica Hakimi, 'The Jus Ad Bellum's Regulatory Form' [2018] 112(2) American Journal of International Law 151-190.\n© 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group\ngradually become ‘the fifth domain' in addition to land, sea, air space and outer space. The growing strategic significance of cyberspace for nation-states has led to intense discussions over international rules pertaining to cyberwarfare, particularly jus ad bellum. As early as 2007, Estonia suffered a cyber-attack against its critical infrastructures, and in 2008, Russia was alleged to conduct cyber operations in the military conflict with Georgia. In 2010, Iran's nuclear facilities were severely damaged by a malicious worm known as Stuxnet. Later in 2019, Venezuela claimed its power grid was attacked by cyber means. A growing number of incidents have added urgency to the clarification of international law on the non-use of force in cyberspace. In addition to these sporadic incidents, there has been a general trend to formally establish cyber forces, strengthen cyber defense capabilities, and update military strategies. With the development of practice, the question of whether and how the principle of non-use of force should be applied to cyberspace has been frequently asked. Within the framework of the United Nations, general preliminary agreements have been reached so far, but much remains to be resolved.\nIt is well-known that China has hewed consistently a rather restrictive interpretation of the law on the use of force. However, the analysis of its international law stances, especially the logic and reasoning, needs to be strengthened, such as China's understanding of what constitutes the use of force and under what circumstances the right to self-defence can be exercised. In addition, how China, an extremely important state actor as well as stakeholder in the cyber domain, conceives of jus ad bellum in cyberspace is understandably a great concern for other States.\nThis paper explores the formation and evolution of China's traditionally restrictive normative stance on the non-use of force. Building on this foundation, it examines China's position on the use of force in cyberspace, incorporating an analysis of the unique characteristics of this domain. Furthermore, the paper assesses whether China's approach to the use of force in cyberspace is undergoing a historical shift—from a restrictive doctrine to a more pragmatically flexible stance. It is therefore divided into four parts. After quickly revisiting the current legal framework on the use of force, the second part demonstrates China's restrictive interpretation of jus ad bellum, and a general wariness towards the use of force outside the UN framework. Subsequently, the third part analyzes the challenges posed by ICTs to the application of the law on the use of force in cyberspace, and after navigating China's position on this issue and its reasoning, points out that although China still holds a restrictive position on the whole, the possibility of a shift towards a more flexible and pragmatic direction cannot be ruled out. Finally, a preliminary conclusion will be briefly presented.\n## The Chinese Restrictive Approach to the Law on the Use of Force\nRegarding the jus ad bellum, China has always taken a restrictive approach, that is, it believes that the prohibition of the use of force as a principle should be strictly observed, and exceptions should be minimized. This part examines the formation, consistency and evolution of China's normative position from an empirical perspective, and analyzes why China has basically adhered to this restrictive interpretation for more than half a century, and whether China's inclination has shifted in the context of the new era.\n##\nJOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA\n#\n# The Formation and Evolution of the Chinese Approach on the Use of Force\nFirst of all, China's interpretation of the principle prohibiting the use of force will be briefly presented based on its domestic regulations and corresponding statements. Secondly, China's position on exceptions to this prohibition will be examined through both its words and deeds, along with its stance with regard to the proposition of using force outside the framework of the UN Charter.\n# China's Restrictive Position on the Principle of Non-Use of Force\nWith regard to China's understanding of the principle of non-use of force, China's view is consistent with the framework of the UN and the main stream of international law. From 1949 to 1971, China was largely excluded from the international community based on ideological antagonism and the international situation. In the meantime, China's understanding of the use of force has largely been analyzed in the light of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence that it proposed in the 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement. The Five principles of Peaceful Coexistence, includes the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, has been committed to promoting and implementing by the Chinese government throughout the whole process. It was recently reaffirmed in the Foreign Relations Law. Since People's Republic of China obtained its lawful seat in the United Nations, the Chinese government's public statements repeatedly emphasize the importance of Article 2(4)'s prohibition on the threat or use of force. From the perspective of international law, China's position can be deconstructed from the following aspects.\nFirst, China emphasizes the central and even monopolistic role of the UN collective security mechanism, especially the Security Council, on the use of force. In other words, the use of force by states is prohibited absent Security Council authorization with the sole exception of self-defense.[11] Secondly, China reckons that Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the use of force among sovereign States and also applies in the military conflicts between States and nations seeking self-determination. For instance, Article 4 of the Foreign Relations Law stipulates that China 'opposes the use of force or threat of force in international relations'. The legal argument here is that the prohibition applies only to the use of force by states against other states, thus does not affect the right of States to use force to maintain national security and order within their domestic jurisdiction.[12] Therefore, given the position of the Chinese Government, which is that Taiwan is part of China's sacred territory,[13] the nature of the Taiwan question 'is purely an internal matter for China'.[14] Thirdly, the Chinese government confines 'force' in Art. 2(4) of the UN Charter to military force and thus economic or political coercion is excluded. Additionally, Unlike the United States, which tends not to strictly distinguish between the use of force and armed attack,[15] China believes that only the most serious form of use of force constitutes an armed attack, which is in line with the conclusion given by the ICJ in the Nicaragua vs. the United States case.[16] In summary, China's attitude towards jus ad bellum falls squally on the side of restrictive camp, and it is largely consistent over the half past century.\n8Shengzu Wang, History of International Relations[国际关系史], Vol. 8 (World Knowledge Press 1995).\n9Tieya Wang, International Law in China: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives (Martinus Nijhoff Publishers 1990).\n10Law on Foreign Relations of the People's Republic of China, 2023.\n11The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, 'Position Paper of the People's Republic of China on the UN Reforms' (7 June 2005) <https: 200506=\"\" 2005year_675849=\"\" 20050607_9288805.s=\"\" 22005=\"\" 22gylhg_675873=\"\" 674904=\"\" zit_674979=\"\" jiliao_674904=\"\" jywzt_675099=\"\" jwz1hg_675873=\"\" www.fmprc.gov.cn=\"\" ziliao_674904=\"\">\n12Kinmin Ma, 使用武力法:发展与挑战[‘The Law of Use of Force: Development and Challenges’] (2013) Chinese Yearbook of International Law.\n\n#\nY. YING AND Z. SHI\n# Restrictive Interpretation of Exceptions to the Principle of Non-Use of Force\nConsistent with its formalist interpretation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, China maintains a restrictive position on exceptions to the principle of non-use of force, asserting that only two exceptions are recognized. The first is when the Security Council authorizes the use of force under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, and the second is when a state exercises its right to self-defense.[17] The Security Council's authorization is a typical manifestation of the collective security system established by the United Nations and is generally uncontroversial in international law. However, as an inherent right of the states, self-defense has always been a subject of debate. Furthermore, the use of force outside the UN system has gained traction, particularly under the banners of humanitarian intervention and the Responsibility to Protect (R2P). This section will examine China's position on the right to self-defense and its perspective on the use of force beyond the UN framework.\nSelf-Defence. As sovereign States' inherent right, self-defence is indisputably constituted the legal exceptions to the non-use of force principle. Article 51 of UN Charter is a right-confirmation clause rather than a right-grant clause.[18] It can be considered that treaty law and customary rule on the right of self-defence exist in parallel.[19] Regarding China's stance on self-defence, both deeds and words need to be examined.\nThe three typical incidents of China's use of force occurred during a period when China was completely excluded from the United Nations, namely, the intervention in the Korean War in the 1950s; the border dispute and conflict between China and India in  $1962^{20}$ ; the Sino-Soviet Union Zhenbao (Damanskii) Island Incident in 1969. Some Chinese scholars render that China's intervention in Korean War could be characterized as the exercise of the right of self-defense,[21] but there was no explicit invocation by the Chinese government, although it repeatedly stressed that its involvement in Korean War was a just war.[22] China's participation in the Korean War can be analyzed in the light of the following considerations. China's intervention came at the request and express consent of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In addition, China chose to aid the DPRK in the name of the 'People's Volunteers Army'[23] instead of the People's Liberation Army.\nWith the exception of Korean war, other situations involving use of force were clearly defined by China as 'self-defense counterattacks',[24] otherwise as exercises of the right to self-defence. From 1971 to 1990, China's discussions regarding the use of force and its exceptions in the Security Council were limited, largely due to its domestic policies and the atmosphere of the Cold War. Additionally, the 1979 border conflict with Vietnam was officially characterized by the Chinese government as an act of self-defense. This characterization is evident in China's submission of a formal letter to the\n17The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China (n 11).\n18Christian Henderson, The Use of Force and International Law (Cambridge University Press 2018)\n19Chris O'Meara, 'Reconceptualising the Right of Self-Defence against \"Imminent\" Armed Attacks' [2022] 9(2) Journal on the Use of Force and International Law 278-323.\n20Ashley J.

Since then, China's discussions in the Security Council and other international forums regarding the legality of the use of force and its exceptions have gradually transitioned from limited participation to active engagement. The Position Paper of the People's Republic of China on United Nations Reforms, released in 2005 (hereinafter '2005 Position Paper'), serves as a landmark document, as it provides the most detailed illustration of China's position on jus ad bellum to date. It stipulated as follows: 'We are of the view that Article 51 of the Charter should neither be amended nor reinterpreted. The Charter lays down explicit provisions on the use of force, i.e. use of force shall not be resorted to without the authorization of the Security Council with the exception of self-defense under armed attack. Whether an urgent threat exists should be determined and handled with prudence by the Security Council in accordance with Chapter 7 of the Charter and in light of the specific situation'.[26]\nThis 2005 position paper conveys precisely China's restrictive interpretation of the right to self-defense and provides a very cautious and conservative answer to two major disputes about the exercise of self-defense, namely, when and to whom the right of self-defense should be exercised. Compared to the relatively new position in 2021,[27] China's stance on the right to self-defense remains largely consistent.\nIt is highly controversial whether the exercise of the right to self-defense should be interpreted strictly in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, which states that 'under armed attack' is a necessary prerequisite, or whether it can be exercised more flexibly in anticipation of imminent or even just potential threats. Regarding temporal requirements, China maintains an open yet extremely cautious approach. On the one hand, it consistently rejects the concept of 'preventive self-defense',[28] recently associated with the 'Bush Doctrine',[29] which China views as an abuse of the right to self-defense and thus emphasis 'no state should ... use force arbitrarily in the name of preventive self-defence'.[30] On the other hand, China is also skeptical about the notion of 'anticipatory self-defense', which is called the Caroline doctrine[31] under customary international law, according to which a state is required to prove that its use of force in response to a threat which was 'instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation'. The 2005 position paper using the phrase 'self-defense under armed attack',[32] seems to lead to the conclusion that the Chinese government adopted a narrow understanding, which is in line with the plain meaning and the negotiating history of Article 51, especially with the provision 'if an armed attack occurs'.[33] Nevertheless, it does not entirely dismiss the potential for exercising the right to self-defense against imminent threats under customary international law.[34]\nIn addition, to whom the right of self-defense should be exercised, that is, the target requirement, also generates debates. Article 51 of the UN Charter does not specifically stipulate that the self-\n25UN SC, 'Letter Dated 17 February 1979 from the Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council', 1979, UN Doc.

In that vein, therefore, self-defence cannot be exercised against non-state actors unless the 'armed attack' conducted by this non-state actors are attributable to another sovereign state under the law of state responsibility. $^{36}$  The ICJ in the Wall Advisory Opinion held that Article 51 of the UN Charter 'recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self-defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State'. $^{37}$  China appears to be a little ambivalent on this point, as it voted in favour of the Security Council resolutions on the use of force against al-Qaeda after 9/11. $^{38}$  Yet it still deeply worries about the abuse of the right to self-defence as an exception to the prohibition of the use of force, and it emphasizes that \"The use of force against non-state actors in the territory of another state, which is for the purpose of self-defence, shall be subject to the consent of the state concerned ... no state should interfere in other's internal affairs under the cloak of 'counter-terrorism'. $^{39}$  This also echoes China's three principles of UN peacekeeping, namely, consent of the parties, impartiality and non-use of force except in self-defense and defense of the mandate. $^{40}$\nAssertions of the Use of Force Outside the Collective Security System. After the end of the Cold War, discussions emerged regarding the justification of using force outside the framework of the United Nations in extreme circumstances. This debate is particularly represented by the theory of humanitarian intervention and, later, the Responsibility to Protect (R2P). Humanitarian intervention is a doctrine that advocates for intervention to protect citizens from the oppression of their own government,[41] allowing for unilateral force to be employed to protect human rights in another state.[42] The concept of R2P was developed as an alternative to humanitarian intervention and was coined by a commission established by the Canadian government after the controversial NATO airstrikes against the former Yugoslavia in 1999.[43] Generally, China's acceptance of the R2P concept is significantly higher than that of humanitarian intervention.\nAs for the humanitarian intervention, it can be said that China, together with many developing states, opposes this idea.[44] It is true that China's approach to humanitarian intervention, and to the use of force in the broader sense, is profoundly influenced by its position on the principle of sovereignty under the UN Charter.[45] A case in point is China's response to NATO's military intervention in Kosovo in 1999, during which it repeatedly stressed in the UN discussions that 'Kosovo is an inherent part of the territory of the former Yugoslavia',[46] and rendered external intervention, particular through the use of force, would amount to the 'internationalization of a domestic issue'.[47] From China's perspective, Serbia was defending its sovereignty against internal challenges, a position that China almost certainly viewed with sympathy given its own internal challenges to\n35Kimberley N Trapp, 'Can Non-State Actors Mount an Armed Attack?' in Marc Weller (ed), The Oxford Handbook of the Use of Force in International Law (Oxford University Press 2015).\n36UN GA, 'Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts', 2002, UN Doc.

Even so, the Chinese government does not take a negative view of all security Council resolutions on humanitarian grounds. China has also acquiesced in or actively supported a number of more limited humanitarian interventions, including in Haiti, Somalia, Bosnia, East Timor, etc. From these resolutions on humanitarian grounds for which China provided limited support, the Chinese government's essential requirements for humanitarian intervention have become increasingly clear, namely, authorization of Security Council and the consent of the host state.\nMeanwhile, China has demonstrated a significant shift in its position on sovereignty by accepting the basic tenets of the R2P. For example, the 2005 Position Paper includes the concept of R2P. Yet it appears that China soon realized that it went too far. Therefore, China changed its tune during the debates on the first UN General Assembly resolution on R2P in 2009, contending that the R2P remained 'a concept' and did not constitute 'a norm of international law'. Furthermore, China warned that the implementation of R2P 'should not contravene the principle of state sovereignty and non-intervention in the internal affairs of States' and that the R2P should be prevented from 'becoming a kind of humanitarian intervention'. Unlike some western states that focus on the third pillar of R2P, Responsibility to React, China attaches special weight to the other two pillars, i.e. Responsibility to Prevent and Responsibility to Rebuild, which are the main reasons why R2P could be quickly accepted by those traditionally opposing humanitarian interventions at the 2005 World Summit.\nChina's position on R2P can be roughly analyzed by its shift of attitude from Libya to Syria in the voting and argumentation of Security Council resolutions. China abstained from the voting on resolution 1973 (2011), and notably did not block the pass of this resolution although it has 'serious difficulty with parts of the resolution'. Three crucial aspects of this highly unusual, perhaps exceptional, confluence of factors is considered. The first key factor that influenced international action in Libya was 'the clarity and immediacy of the threat to the civilian population'. The second and most crucial factor that provided the impetus for military action in Libya was the presence of regional consensus on the need for external intervention. The third important trigger was 'the defection of members of the Gaddafi government'. However, China was concerned with the actual implementation of the Resolution 1973 by\n Jonathan Davis, 'From Ideology to Pragmatism: China's Position on Humanitarian Intervention in the Post-Cold War Era' [2011] 44(2) Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law 217–283.\n UN SC, 'Provisional Verbatim Record of the 3238th Meeting', 1993, UN Doc.S/PV.3238.\n UN SC, 'Provisional Verbatim Record of the 3145th Meeting', 1992, UN Doc.S/PV.3145.\n UN SC, 'Security Council the 3461st Meeting', 1994, UN Doc.

For instance, it stated that ‘we are not in favor of any arbitrary interpretation of the Council's resolutions or of any actions going beyond those mandated'. China believed that its lenient approach to Libya worsened the situation and does not want a repeat in Syria. Thus, three separate Western-supported draft resolutions proposing non-forcible measures against the Assad regime had been vetoed by Russia and China.\nTo sum up, China's attitude towards concepts such as humanitarian intervention and R2P, which revise the traditional principles of non-use of force and sovereignty, is no longer as rigid as it used to be. China's approach to the issue is case-by-case, shifting from an initially ideological focus to a more pragmatic approach.\n### The Restrictive Approach Revisited: Consistency and Rationale\nChina's position on the use of force in international law has remained remarkably consistent over the past half-century, reflecting its broader transition from an outsider to an active participant in the international legal order. Despite profound shifts in global politics and China's evolving role on the world stage, its restrictive interpretation of jus ad bellum has endured, with steadfast adherence to the principle of non-use of force and a high threshold for exceptions. As China's global influence expands, its legal stance on the use of force will become increasingly significant. China's foreign policy has evolved from a strategy of biding its time to ‘advancing towards the center of the world stage'. While its foreign policy has evolved—shifting emphasis toward sovereignty and non-intervention rather than an absolute prohibition on force—its foundational approach remains unchanged. Understanding the rationale behind this persistent restrictivism requires an analysis from three key dimensions: internal formation, external influence, and objective morality.\nOn the one hand, China's restrictive approach is partly endogenous, shaped by its philosophy, its tradition of self-restraint, and its post-strike military strategy. These internal factors have fostered a long-standing commitment to limiting the use of force as a means of conflict resolution. China, as a quintessential agrarian civilization, operates within a governance framework that is inherently inward-looking, prioritizing land cultivation, territorial integrity, resource stability, and self-sufficiency. This model fosters a worldview that emphasizes continuity, tradition, and social order, rather than external expansion or aggressive engagement with foreign entities. Unlike maritime civilizations, which historically pursued expansion through conquest and overseas dominance, agrarian economies do not rely on external plunder for economic development. As a result, China lacks the inherent impetus for territorial expansion and have no enduring tradition of long-distance military expeditions. Furthermore, agrarian civilizations often perceive interaction with the outside world as a potential risk rather than an opportunity, leading to policies characterized by controlled trade and strict border defense. A notable historical example is the construction of the Great Wall, which was designed not for expansion, but for defense against external incursions.\n1. 67 Hanqin Xue, Chinese Contemporary Perspectives on International Law: History, Culture and International Law (Martinus Nijhoff 2012).\n1. 68 UN SC, ‘Security Council, 66th Year: 6528th Meeting', 4 May 2011, UN Doc.

Sima Law says that ‘though a country is now strong, bellicosity will lead to its ruin(国虽大, 好战必亡)’. For the surrounding ethnic groups, it has advocated ‘In practicing the rules of propriety, it is harmony that is prized(以和为贵, 以礼为固)’. Because of its self-perception as the superior state of China, it will hardly actively attack unless there is a threat to the tributary system and there is a need for restoration of peace. Even in its philosophy of war, China has always advocated ‘the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting(不战而屈人之兵)’. China possesses a defense-oriented strategy. It keeps to the stance that ‘we will not attack unless we are attacked, but we will surely counterattack if attacked’. Though met with debate, a typical example of this is China’s strategic posture regarding the nuclear weapons. In 1964, after its first nuclear test, China made the declaration that its nuclear development was solely for self-defence. China unconditionally committed itself to the non-use or threat of use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon States and to the non-first use of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances. Since its first National Defence White Paper in 1998, China has been adhering to the ‘principles of defense, self-defense and post-strike response’. This post-strike military position and its related philosophy of war have largely influenced China’s approach to the non-use of force.\nOn the other hand, the rationales for China's restrictive stance are partly exogenous, including China's decisive position in the Security Council and its options for minimizing risk in an anarchic international community. As one of the five permanent members, China bears a primary responsibility in ensuring international peace and security. China's advocacy on the dominant role of UN Security Council has closely related to its role as one of the permanent members, of which it has veto power. In this way, China can be sure that, at least under the framework of the United Nations, the Security Council will not make a resolution on the use of force to its disadvantage. Especially after witnessing the tragic consequences of unilateral military action and the abuse of the right to self-defense, China has affirmed that the restrictionist position is the best solution to safeguarding national interests, grounded in instrumental rationality and utilitarianism.\nAdditionally, morality and legitimacy play a crucial role. As a victim of war and the first country to sign the UN Charter, China sincerely and in good faith believes that the pursuit of peace is an objective that must never be compromised. The restrictive approach faithfully based on the UN Charter, objectively provides predictability in international behaviours and serves as a robust guarantee of international peace.\n# The Hesitating Power: Dilemmas Concerning the Application of Jus Ad Bellum in Cyberspace\nWith the process of de-sovereignty to re-sovereignty of cyberspace, the strategic significance of this domain is increasing annually, and the threats emanating from the cyberspace have profoundly impacted international relations.

In addition to advancements made under the UN, several countries have issued position papers outlining how international law applies to cyberspace through unilateral statements. All of these statements reference jus ad bellum in the context of cyberspace. Dozens of states have adopted the doctrine of scale and effects as criteria for determining what constitutes the use of force in cyberspace. Some have proposed progressive propositions such as anticipatory self-defense, cumulative self-defense, and self-defense against cyberattacks launched by non-state actors. At this critical juncture for clarifying and updating the rules, China appears to be in no rush to issue a unilateral declaration to clarify its position on the regulations governing the use of force in cyberspace.\nThe following discussion will unfold in three steps. First, the challenges posed by cyber operations to the existing framework of rules regarding the use of force will be elucidated. Second, China's stance on the law governing the use of force in cyberspace will be examined, along with an analysis of the considerations underlying China's general position in light of its domestic cyber strategy and the evolution of laws related to cyberspace. Finally, whether China's relevant stance in cyberspace would witness a historical shift from restrictionism to a more pragmatic flexibility will be explored.\n### The Challenges Posed by Cyber Operations to the Law on the Use of Force\nIt has to be acknowledged the international law regarding jus ad bellum per se is controversial within traditional physical domain. Cyberspace is often perceived as a homomorphic map of the physical domain, and this issue persists. In addition to the previously mentioned complexities, the unique characteristics of cyberspace further exacerbate the situation.\nFirstly, the application of cyber military technology has challenged modern theories of warfare. There exists a reciprocal relationship between military technology and theories of warfare. Cyberattacks no longer concentrate solely on the destruction of living forces and tangible assets, normally do not involve physical incursions into territory, and lack the apparent intensity and violence characteristic of kinetic warfare. This challenges fundamental assumptions regarding subject identification, real-world physical consequences, and civil-military distinctions. The damage caused by a cyberattack can be both tangible and intangible, including disruptions to financial markets, functional failures, and data loss. Furthermore, cyberattacks may be difficult for the victim states to detect. Additionally, the consequences of cyberattacks are often unpredictable and challenging to control. International law has yet to provide mature answers on how to evaluate intangible damages within the framework of jus ad bellum.\nSecondly, cyberattacks present dual challenges of technical and legal attribution. Due to the interconnectedness and anonymity of the cyberspace, attribution faces both technical and legal hurdles, raising questions about the object of the right to self-defense in cyberspace. States that conduct cyberattacks often intentionally evade accountability by employing proxy warfare or utilizing non-state actors as the actual perpetrators through outsourcing or contracting, thereby concealing their involvement. In notable cyberattacks that have garnered significant attention from the international community, such as the Estonian incident in 2007 and the Stuxnet in 2010, various clues have emerged, yet no country has ever acknowledged its participation. The existing legal framework for attribution, based on the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally\nWrongful Acts, struggles to effectively address the complexities of attribution in cyberspace, leading to ongoing debates about whether the right to self-defense extends to non-state actors.\nThirdly, the asymmetric cost dynamics between offensive and defensive cyber operations have given rise to a bidirectional deterrence effect. At the same time, the limited effectiveness of ex-post defensive measures in mitigating the impact of cyberattacks has further weakened mutual trust among sovereign states, exacerbating tensions in the international cybersecurity landscape. This situation poses significant challenges regarding the timing and limitations of states' exercise of the right to self-defense. In contrast to traditional kinetic weapons, particularly nuclear arms, the costs associated with the creation, research, and production of cyber weapons are relatively low. Additionally, the expenses related to reproduction and replacement are more affordable. Countries with robust cyber capabilities often rely heavily on digital networks for governance and management, making them more vulnerable to cyberattacks—a phenomenon known as the ‘glass house dilemma'. Plus, the consequences inflicted by cyberattacks may be temporary or permanent, direct or indirect, tangible or intangible, and can even exceed the perpetrator's control. However, it is certain that the erosion of the victim state's authority and the diminishing trust of its citizens are inevitable outcomes. All of this underscores the reality that the costs of defending against and responding to cyberattacks—whether they are ongoing or have already concluded—can be substantial and disproportionate. Thus, it is challenging for states to determine when to respond and how to navigate the constraints of necessity and proportionality in their responses. In short, this is likely to lead to a generalization of the right to self-defense. Claims such as anticipatory self-defense and cumulative self-defense with response to cyber-attacks have begun to emerge, challenging the established legal framework of jus ad bellum.\nThe three challenges outlined above demonstrate that the military application of cyber technology poses significant difficulties for the existing framework governing the non-use of force. This situation is not putting old wine in a new bottle but highlights the urgent need for a collaborative response among states. Without such cooperation, certain cyber operations may remain ambiguous under international law due to unclear definitions. This ambiguity undermines the predictability of norms in cyberspace and threatens the long-term stability of the cyber environment.\n### China's Cautious Stance on the Use of Force in Cyberspace and Its Strategic Considerations\nChina's stance on the use of force in cyberspace remains conservative thus is prima facie consistent with its restrictive approach in physical domain. Without providing any substantive clarification on the operational level, China declared a firm attitude towards the peaceful use of cyberspace. It has stressed on many occasions that all countries should adhere to the principle of non-use of force enshrined in the UN Charter in the cyber context. For instance, the joint Sino-Russian proposal for an International Code of Conduct for Information Security in 2011 stated that ‘to settle any dispute resulting from the application of the code through peaceful means and to refrain from the threat or use of force'. In addition, the 2017 International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace clearly stipulated that ‘China is dedicated to promoting each party in effectively complying with the basic international relationship rules such as ... refraining from use or threat of force'. However, China has been vague about what defines the use of cyber force and the specific circumstances under which it may invoke the right to self-defense in response to cyberattacks.\n\nThis partially because of the resilience of the existing *jus ad bellum* rules. The rules governing the non-use of force are not meant to be domain-specific, as ICJ has opined that Articles 2(4) and 51 of the UN Charter regarding the prohibition on use of force and self-defence, respectively, apply to ‘any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed’. From the point of view of effective interpretation, it is submitted that the system of laws and regulations on the non-use of force itself has resilience. Although the cyberspace is artificial, it is still closely related to the traditional domain, and the existing rules can be extended to apply to the cyberspace. Thus, there is no legal vacuum. In terms of cost, China’s (or any other states’) position cannot be completely divorced from the existing framework.\nCompared to Western countries, China is currently less inclined to express a definitive stance on this issue. It perceives a troubling trend in the discourse that emphasizes exceptions rather than fundamental principles, with some states attempting to lower the threshold for triggering the right to self-defence in cyberspace. Although China places significant importance on the peaceful use of cyberspace, it believes that excessive discussion regarding the right to resort to force—particularly in the name of self-defence—could have potential negative impact on international peace and security, aggravating an arms race and leading to the militarization of cyberspace. Thus, the Chinese government is skeptical of the intense debate surrounding exceptions that justify the use of cyber force, contending that Western countries are cherry-picking on this issue. For example, China emphasized the ‘overemphasis on making exceptions for cyber warfare or self-defense, while the non-use of force principle has been marginalized’ and ‘the risk of sliding towards the militarization of cyberspace’. In its submission to the UN Open-ended Working Group, China stated that ‘state should focus on… refraining from the use or threat of use of force. Willful use of force… should be prevented. The applicability of… *jus ad bellum* needs to be handled with prudence’.\nIt should be admitted that most States now recognize, albeit to different degrees, that it is unhelpful to rely on the military paradigm as the first port of call when analyzing inter-state malicious cyber operations. Yet the complexity of the disagreement on the application of *jus ad bellum* lies in the fact that the debate has been very much politicized, from a legal point of view, there does not seem to be a compelling reason why the existing *jus ad bellum* cannot be applied to cyberspace.\nChina’s principled caution does not indicate a lack of concern regarding the issue. On the contrary, as a latecomer to international law, China now has the opportunity to play a significant role in shaping international law in a field that is still in its formative stages. China exhibits ambivalence toward the relevant factors, opting to use non-legal reasoning to minimize excessive discussion and avoid making premature decisions.\nChina’s current restrictive stance on the use of force in cyberspace can be understood from several key perspectives. First, the unique characteristics of cyberspace indeed present challenges to the application of existing frameworks, resulting in significant legal uncertainty. Second, there is insufficient state practice and *opinio juris* to effectively test and verify whether a cyber action constitutes the use of force or an armed attack. Countries have not yet established what rules are generally accepted by the international community, or even what rules would be advantageous for their own interests. Therefore, making a definitive statement at this time may be premature. Thirdly, because of the digital divide related to cyber technology and the soft power of international law-making between China and Western countries, coupled with the growing concerns regarding the\n Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, International Court of Justice, Advisory Opinion’ 1996 226.\n Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization(AALCO), ‘Verbatim Record of the Fifty Fourth Annual Session’, 2015, Doc.

Just as China explained at the 2019 annual meeting of the Asian-African Legal Cooperation Organization, ‘given the “digital gap” between developing and the developed countries, developing countries in general will be in a disadvantaged position in the discussion and development of such rules, it will be difficult to ensure the rules are fair and equitable'. Nevertheless, as an emerging power seeking to influence the development of international law in cyberspace, China's principled official rhetoric regarding of the jus ad bellum in cyberspace may also serve a bargaining leverage in the formulation of international law regulating the use of cyber force.\nEven in the absence of detailed and specific legal rules governing cyber hostile acts in peacetime, states remain bound by three fundamental principles of international law, each carrying increasing normative weight: state sovereignty, non-intervention, and non-use of force. Therefore, China's cautious approach to the use of force in cyberspace stems not only from the aforementioned lack of established practice, strategic continuity, and tactical prudence, but also from a profound commitment to cyber sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention. From China's perspective, most—if not all—contemporary cyberattacks fall short of constituting a use of force and can be more appropriately addressed within the existing framework of cyber sovereignty and non-intervention.\nIn conclusion, it is reasonable to assume that China's restrictive approach to jus ad bellum could materially affect its position on when a cyberattack constitutes the use of force and under what circumstances the right of self-defense can be exercised against a cyberattack. As a typical proponent of multilateralism, China would certainly continue to firmly uphold the integrity and the authority of the UN, which function as the core of the international collective security mechanism. However, this does not imply that China's stance is inflexible and rigid. In light of the characteristics of cyberspace, where its position may evolve be examined.\n### Towards a More Pragmatic Chinese Approach to the Law on Use of Force in Cyberspace?\nWhile cyber operations present a triple challenge to the application of jus ad bellum, the extent to which these challenges are likely to influence China's approach to the law on the use of force in cyberspace is worth re-examining. The following will be discussed from four aspects: attribution, the object of exercising the right of self-defense, the threshold of use of force or armed attack, and the time and limitation of exercising the right of self-defense.\nThe difficulty of attribution due to anonymity in cyberspace can indeed lead to the erosion of international mutual trust, which has a negative impact on the overall cybersecurity. However, fundamentally, this is only a temporary technical obstacle, which will eventually be overcome with technological progress, or a corresponding international response mechanism will be established, so it does not constitute a fundamental subversion of the legal logic of attribution in international law. In addition, as an important element of state responsibility, if the attribution is arbitrarily changed because of the characteristics of a certain field, it will obviously do more harm than good to the maintenance of international order and the predictability of international norms. Therefore, it is unlikely that China will adjust its position on the challenge posed by cyber attribution to the law of the use of force.\nBased on the cognition of the issue of cyber attribution, China will most likely not change its restrictive position on whether the object of exercising the right of self-defense in cyberspace can be extended to non-state actors. Once attribution is resolved, responding to malicious cyberattacks by\nnon-state actors becomes to a large extent a matter of combating cybercrime and international judicial cooperation, which does not necessarily involve the use of force issue, and it is also possible to seek the consent of the territorial State or invoke the principle of due diligence to involve the territorial State and transit State in the fight against cybercriminals or cyberterrorist organizations.\nGiven this, the real challenge lies in the means and methods of cyberattacks, which have fundamentally challenged the traditional theories of warfare. No longer solely focused on the destruction of living forces and physical assets, one significant consequence of cyberattacks is that they create certain confusion to defining the threshold for the use of force or armed attack. This confusion manifests both qualitatively and quantitatively. From a qualitative perspective, the damage caused by cyberattacks can have both physical and non-physical consequences. The current ‘consequence-based' standard proposed by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations is indeed reasonable in this context. When physical consequences can be explained by analogy, it becomes easier to determine whether a cyber operation meets the threshold for the use of force or armed attack. However, this framework struggles to adequately assess cyberattacks that lack physical consequences. Some scholars have argued that disruptive cyber operations may fall under the scope of Article 2(4) if the resulting disruption is ‘significant enough to affect state security', but this interpretation is inherently arbitrary. A more radical interpretation expands the definition of the use of force to include non-destructive cyber operations against critical national infrastructure. However, this ‘target-based' interpretation excessively broadens the threshold, which is not conducive to maintaining peace and security. It also undermines the applicability and integrity of the principles of cyber sovereignty and non-intervention. On the quantitative side, the challenge is more pronounced in defining damage. Non-physical damage is particularly difficult to quantify objectively, and measuring the direct and indirect impacts of cyberattacks presents a complex issue. If the definition of damage cannot be accurately established, how can we ensure that the requirements of necessity and proportionality in the right of self-defense are fulfilled in good faith? In this context, a shift from consequence-based to a convergence of consequence-based, goal-based and function-based criteria is not unacceptable to China.\nBeyond the question of what constitutes the threshold for the use of force, another potential turning point is that the post-attack response is unlikely to be satisfactory. The ineffectiveness of ex-post defense will challenge the temporal requirements for exercising the self-defense. Due to the asymmetric costs associated with cyber offence and defense, the victim country not only faces the burden of implementing general defense measures at a high cost but may also have to endure significant expenses with minimal success in its ex-post response. Therefore, it raises the question of whether it is feasible to flexibly adjust the timing of self-defense against armed cyber-attacks. While the wording of the UN Charter advocates for ex-post defense, there may be room for broader interpretation within customary international law.\nChina has yet to comment on the issue, but it will need to do so sooner or later. As China's cyber capabilities expand globally, so do its overseas interests that require protection, which may lead China to adopt a more open stance on the jus ad bellum. On April 2024, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has set up three new arms, the Aerospace Force, Cyberspace Force, and Information Support Force to serve alongside the existing Joint Logistics Support Force. In the short term, it is highly unlikely that China will issue unilateral statements to clarify its detailed position on the use of force in cyberspace. However, should such a statement be made, it will likely address the use of force\nand the right to self-defense. To date, no state that has issued such a statement has overlooked this issue. Even if China were to make a unilateral declaration regarding the applicability of international law in cyberspace, it is improbable that it would elaborate beyond affirming the prohibition on the use of force. More pragmatically, China's approach to the use of force in cyberspace is likely to be reflected in its responses to individual cyber incidents or operations, as well as in discussions within the UN framework. Just as mentioned in the 2005 Position Paper “given the varying causes and nature of crises, it is both unrealistic and hugely controversial to formulate a one-fits-all rule or criterion on the use of force. Whether to use force or not should be decided by the Security Council in light of the reality of cyber incidents on a case-by-case basis. It remains to be seen whether adaptation will be made by China to the application of specific rules in cyberspace, such as ease up on the right of anticipatory self-defence or endorse a convergence of consequence-based, goal-based and function-based approach on determine the use of force.\n## Conclusion\nThis article elaborates on China's position regarding the jus ad bellum by examining its state practices and official statements. It also explores the extent to which China's approach in the emerging domain of cyberspace may be influenced by, or differ from, its traditional stance. The rationales for China's restrictive stance are partly endogenous, determined primarily by China's philosophy of war and its military strategy of self-restraint, and partly exogenous, including China's decisive position in the UN Security Council and its options for minimizing risk in an anarchic international community.\nChina's conservative stance will most likely continue in cyberspace, but it also faces a dilemma. On the one hand, international lawmaking in cyberspace is under way, and China is finally no longer the rule-taker but a rule-maker. It certainly wants to play a more substantive role and not miss the opportunity. As a potential victim of cyberattacks, it certainly wants to preserve and clarify the right to response against perpetrators, and sticking to rigid traditional positions may not be helpful in protecting national interests, including an increasing number of overseas interests. On the other hand, if the relevant restrictive interpretation is adjusted, the relevant rules may be abused and misinterpreted at will. In the overall unfriendly environment and the situation where, Chinese discourse is not dominant, Chinese legal and natural persons may be subjected to cyber attacks in the name of the right to self-defense, which may further deteriorate international relations in cyberspace. In this sense, China would basically maintain the ‘wait and see' approach regarding the jus ad bellum in cyberspace and continue its overall restrictive understanding of the relevant rules in cyberspace, however, facing the increasing frequency of cyber-attacks, the possibility that China would adopt a more flexible understanding of some specific rules cannot be completely ruled out.\nOur grateful thanks to the Editor and three anonymous reviewers for the journal for their astute comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.\n## Disclosure Statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).",

The rationale for China's restrictive stance is partly endogenous, determined primarily by its philosophy and military strategy of self-restraint, and partly exogenous, influenced by its decisive position in the Security Council. The challenges posed by cyber operations to the use of force are mainly evident in the difficulties of attribution, the evolving means, aims, and effects of cyber-warfare, and the legal ambiguities arising from the asymmetry of offensive and defensive costs. China's stance in cyberspace will be significantly affected by its traditional approach, which stems from the resilience of established rules, strategic inheritance, and tactical cautiousness.\n# KEYWORDS\nuse of force; cyberspace; self-defence; China; jus ad bellum\n# Introduction\nWar and peace are the eternal themes of mankind. After the Second World War, the international community for the first time made the prohibition of the use of force as one of the fundamental principles of international law, thereby establishing a new international order. Simply put, the status quo of the normative framework for the law on the use of force can be summarized as 'one principle with two exceptions'. Under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and customary international law, states should refrain from the use or threat of force in international relations. But there are two exceptions to this principle. The first is the use of force authorized by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. This is the embodiment of the collective security mechanism established by the UN. The other exception is the victim state exercises its inherent right of self-defence.\nThis normative framework of 'one principle with two exceptions' forms the starting point for scholarly discussion of the law of the use of force. The connotation of international law related to jus ad bellum, as a typically high political field that touches on the survival and fundamental interests of states, is much more complicated in reality. As self-interest subjects, states would choose to clarify the principle and exceptions of the law of the non-use of force in extensive or restrictive way under different circumstances, and even put forward propositions beyond the existing normative framework. Therefore, the controversy over the law on the use of force has persisted since the day the regime was established, making this area one of the most contentious bodies of law. $^{1}$\nThe emergence of cyber technology and the proliferation of cyber warfare threats have further complicated the situation. With the rise and popularization of network technology, cyberspace has\nCONTACT Zehua Shi shizehua@whu.edu.cn Law School, Wuhan University, No. 299 Bayi Road, Wuhan, Hubei, China\n1Monica Hakimi, 'The Jus Ad Bellum's Regulatory Form' [2018] 112(2) American Journal of International Law 151-190.\n© 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group\ngradually become ‘the fifth domain' in addition to land, sea, air space and outer space. The growing strategic significance of cyberspace for nation-states has led to intense discussions over international rules pertaining to cyberwarfare, particularly jus ad bellum. As early as 2007, Estonia suffered a cyber-attack against its critical infrastructures, and in 2008, Russia was alleged to conduct cyber operations in the military conflict with Georgia. In 2010, Iran's nuclear facilities were severely damaged by a malicious worm known as Stuxnet. Later in 2019, Venezuela claimed its power grid was attacked by cyber means. A growing number of incidents have added urgency to the clarification of international law on the non-use of force in cyberspace. In addition to these sporadic incidents, there has been a general trend to formally establish cyber forces, strengthen cyber defense capabilities, and update military strategies. With the development of practice, the question of whether and how the principle of non-use of force should be applied to cyberspace has been frequently asked. Within the framework of the United Nations, general preliminary agreements have been reached so far, but much remains to be resolved.\nIt is well-known that China has hewed consistently a rather restrictive interpretation of the law on the use of force. However, the analysis of its international law stances, especially the logic and reasoning, needs to be strengthened, such as China's understanding of what constitutes the use of force and under what circumstances the right to self-defence can be exercised. In addition, how China, an extremely important state actor as well as stakeholder in the cyber domain, conceives of jus ad bellum in cyberspace is understandably a great concern for other States.\nThis paper explores the formation and evolution of China's traditionally restrictive normative stance on the non-use of force. Building on this foundation, it examines China's position on the use of force in cyberspace, incorporating an analysis of the unique characteristics of this domain. Furthermore, the paper assesses whether China's approach to the use of force in cyberspace is undergoing a historical shift—from a restrictive doctrine to a more pragmatically flexible stance. It is therefore divided into four parts. After quickly revisiting the current legal framework on the use of force, the second part demonstrates China's restrictive interpretation of jus ad bellum, and a general wariness towards the use of force outside the UN framework. Subsequently, the third part analyzes the challenges posed by ICTs to the application of the law on the use of force in cyberspace, and after navigating China's position on this issue and its reasoning, points out that although China still holds a restrictive position on the whole, the possibility of a shift towards a more flexible and pragmatic direction cannot be ruled out. Finally, a preliminary conclusion will be briefly presented.\n## The Chinese Restrictive Approach to the Law on the Use of Force\nRegarding the jus ad bellum, China has always taken a restrictive approach, that is, it believes that the prohibition of the use of force as a principle should be strictly observed, and exceptions should be minimized. This part examines the formation, consistency and evolution of China's normative position from an empirical perspective, and analyzes why China has basically adhered to this restrictive interpretation for more than half a century, and whether China's inclination has shifted in the context of the new era.\n##\nJOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA\n#\n# The Formation and Evolution of the Chinese Approach on the Use of Force\nFirst of all, China's interpretation of the principle prohibiting the use of force will be briefly presented based on its domestic regulations and corresponding statements. Secondly, China's position on exceptions to this prohibition will be examined through both its words and deeds, along with its stance with regard to the proposition of using force outside the framework of the UN Charter.\n# China's Restrictive Position on the Principle of Non-Use of Force\nWith regard to China's understanding of the principle of non-use of force, China's view is consistent with the framework of the UN and the main stream of international law. From 1949 to 1971, China was largely excluded from the international community based on ideological antagonism and the international situation. In the meantime, China's understanding of the use of force has largely been analyzed in the light of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence that it proposed in the 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement. The Five principles of Peaceful Coexistence, includes the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, has been committed to promoting and implementing by the Chinese government throughout the whole process. It was recently reaffirmed in the Foreign Relations Law. Since People's Republic of China obtained its lawful seat in the United Nations, the Chinese government's public statements repeatedly emphasize the importance of Article 2(4)'s prohibition on the threat or use of force. From the perspective of international law, China's position can be deconstructed from the following aspects.\nFirst, China emphasizes the central and even monopolistic role of the UN collective security mechanism, especially the Security Council, on the use of force. In other words, the use of force by states is prohibited absent Security Council authorization with the sole exception of self-defense.[11] Secondly, China reckons that Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the use of force among sovereign States and also applies in the military conflicts between States and nations seeking self-determination. For instance, Article 4 of the Foreign Relations Law stipulates that China 'opposes the use of force or threat of force in international relations'. The legal argument here is that the prohibition applies only to the use of force by states against other states, thus does not affect the right of States to use force to maintain national security and order within their domestic jurisdiction.[12] Therefore, given the position of the Chinese Government, which is that Taiwan is part of China's sacred territory,[13] the nature of the Taiwan question 'is purely an internal matter for China'.[14] Thirdly, the Chinese government confines 'force' in Art. 2(4) of the UN Charter to military force and thus economic or political coercion is excluded. Additionally, Unlike the United States, which tends not to strictly distinguish between the use of force and armed attack,[15] China believes that only the most serious form of use of force constitutes an armed attack, which is in line with the conclusion given by the ICJ in the Nicaragua vs. the United States case.[16] In summary, China's attitude towards jus ad bellum falls squally on the side of restrictive camp, and it is largely consistent over the half past century.\n8Shengzu Wang, History of International Relations[国际关系史], Vol. 8 (World Knowledge Press 1995).\n9Tieya Wang, International Law in China: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives (Martinus Nijhoff Publishers 1990).\n10Law on Foreign Relations of the People's Republic of China, 2023.\n11The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, 'Position Paper of the People's Republic of China on the UN Reforms' (7 June 2005) <https: 200506=\"\" 2005year_675849=\"\" 20050607_9288805.s=\"\" 22005=\"\" 22gylhg_675873=\"\" 674904=\"\" zit_674979=\"\" jiliao_674904=\"\" jywzt_675099=\"\" jwz1hg_675873=\"\" www.fmprc.gov.cn=\"\" ziliao_674904=\"\">\n12Kinmin Ma, 使用武力法:发展与挑战[‘The Law of Use of Force: Development and Challenges’] (2013) Chinese Yearbook of International Law.\n\n#\nY. YING AND Z. SHI\n# Restrictive Interpretation of Exceptions to the Principle of Non-Use of Force\nConsistent with its formalist interpretation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, China maintains a restrictive position on exceptions to the principle of non-use of force, asserting that only two exceptions are recognized. The first is when the Security Council authorizes the use of force under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, and the second is when a state exercises its right to self-defense.[17] The Security Council's authorization is a typical manifestation of the collective security system established by the United Nations and is generally uncontroversial in international law. However, as an inherent right of the states, self-defense has always been a subject of debate. Furthermore, the use of force outside the UN system has gained traction, particularly under the banners of humanitarian intervention and the Responsibility to Protect (R2P). This section will examine China's position on the right to self-defense and its perspective on the use of force beyond the UN framework.\nSelf-Defence. As sovereign States' inherent right, self-defence is indisputably constituted the legal exceptions to the non-use of force principle. Article 51 of UN Charter is a right-confirmation clause rather than a right-grant clause.[18] It can be considered that treaty law and customary rule on the right of self-defence exist in parallel.[19] Regarding China's stance on self-defence, both deeds and words need to be examined.\nThe three typical incidents of China's use of force occurred during a period when China was completely excluded from the United Nations, namely, the intervention in the Korean War in the 1950s; the border dispute and conflict between China and India in  $1962^{20}$ ; the Sino-Soviet Union Zhenbao (Damanskii) Island Incident in 1969. Some Chinese scholars render that China's intervention in Korean War could be characterized as the exercise of the right of self-defense,[21] but there was no explicit invocation by the Chinese government, although it repeatedly stressed that its involvement in Korean War was a just war.[22] China's participation in the Korean War can be analyzed in the light of the following considerations. China's intervention came at the request and express consent of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In addition, China chose to aid the DPRK in the name of the 'People's Volunteers Army'[23] instead of the People's Liberation Army.\nWith the exception of Korean war, other situations involving use of force were clearly defined by China as 'self-defense counterattacks',[24] otherwise as exercises of the right to self-defence. From 1971 to 1990, China's discussions regarding the use of force and its exceptions in the Security Council were limited, largely due to its domestic policies and the atmosphere of the Cold War. Additionally, the 1979 border conflict with Vietnam was officially characterized by the Chinese government as an act of self-defense. This characterization is evident in China's submission of a formal letter to the\n17The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China (n 11).\n18Christian Henderson, The Use of Force and International Law (Cambridge University Press 2018)\n19Chris O'Meara, 'Reconceptualising the Right of Self-Defence against \"Imminent\" Armed Attacks' [2022] 9(2) Journal on the Use of Force and International Law 278-323.\n20Ashley J.

Since then, China's discussions in the Security Council and other international forums regarding the legality of the use of force and its exceptions have gradually transitioned from limited participation to active engagement. The Position Paper of the People's Republic of China on United Nations Reforms, released in 2005 (hereinafter '2005 Position Paper'), serves as a landmark document, as it provides the most detailed illustration of China's position on jus ad bellum to date. It stipulated as follows: 'We are of the view that Article 51 of the Charter should neither be amended nor reinterpreted. The Charter lays down explicit provisions on the use of force, i.e. use of force shall not be resorted to without the authorization of the Security Council with the exception of self-defense under armed attack. Whether an urgent threat exists should be determined and handled with prudence by the Security Council in accordance with Chapter 7 of the Charter and in light of the specific situation'.[26]\nThis 2005 position paper conveys precisely China's restrictive interpretation of the right to self-defense and provides a very cautious and conservative answer to two major disputes about the exercise of self-defense, namely, when and to whom the right of self-defense should be exercised. Compared to the relatively new position in 2021,[27] China's stance on the right to self-defense remains largely consistent.\nIt is highly controversial whether the exercise of the right to self-defense should be interpreted strictly in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, which states that 'under armed attack' is a necessary prerequisite, or whether it can be exercised more flexibly in anticipation of imminent or even just potential threats. Regarding temporal requirements, China maintains an open yet extremely cautious approach. On the one hand, it consistently rejects the concept of 'preventive self-defense',[28] recently associated with the 'Bush Doctrine',[29] which China views as an abuse of the right to self-defense and thus emphasis 'no state should ... use force arbitrarily in the name of preventive self-defence'.[30] On the other hand, China is also skeptical about the notion of 'anticipatory self-defense', which is called the Caroline doctrine[31] under customary international law, according to which a state is required to prove that its use of force in response to a threat which was 'instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation'. The 2005 position paper using the phrase 'self-defense under armed attack',[32] seems to lead to the conclusion that the Chinese government adopted a narrow understanding, which is in line with the plain meaning and the negotiating history of Article 51, especially with the provision 'if an armed attack occurs'.[33] Nevertheless, it does not entirely dismiss the potential for exercising the right to self-defense against imminent threats under customary international law.[34]\nIn addition, to whom the right of self-defense should be exercised, that is, the target requirement, also generates debates. Article 51 of the UN Charter does not specifically stipulate that the self-\n25UN SC, 'Letter Dated 17 February 1979 from the Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council', 1979, UN Doc.

In that vein, therefore, self-defence cannot be exercised against non-state actors unless the 'armed attack' conducted by this non-state actors are attributable to another sovereign state under the law of state responsibility. $^{36}$  The ICJ in the Wall Advisory Opinion held that Article 51 of the UN Charter 'recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self-defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State'. $^{37}$  China appears to be a little ambivalent on this point, as it voted in favour of the Security Council resolutions on the use of force against al-Qaeda after 9/11. $^{38}$  Yet it still deeply worries about the abuse of the right to self-defence as an exception to the prohibition of the use of force, and it emphasizes that \"The use of force against non-state actors in the territory of another state, which is for the purpose of self-defence, shall be subject to the consent of the state concerned ... no state should interfere in other's internal affairs under the cloak of 'counter-terrorism'. $^{39}$  This also echoes China's three principles of UN peacekeeping, namely, consent of the parties, impartiality and non-use of force except in self-defense and defense of the mandate. $^{40}$\nAssertions of the Use of Force Outside the Collective Security System. After the end of the Cold War, discussions emerged regarding the justification of using force outside the framework of the United Nations in extreme circumstances. This debate is particularly represented by the theory of humanitarian intervention and, later, the Responsibility to Protect (R2P). Humanitarian intervention is a doctrine that advocates for intervention to protect citizens from the oppression of their own government,[41] allowing for unilateral force to be employed to protect human rights in another state.[42] The concept of R2P was developed as an alternative to humanitarian intervention and was coined by a commission established by the Canadian government after the controversial NATO airstrikes against the former Yugoslavia in 1999.[43] Generally, China's acceptance of the R2P concept is significantly higher than that of humanitarian intervention.\nAs for the humanitarian intervention, it can be said that China, together with many developing states, opposes this idea.[44] It is true that China's approach to humanitarian intervention, and to the use of force in the broader sense, is profoundly influenced by its position on the principle of sovereignty under the UN Charter.[45] A case in point is China's response to NATO's military intervention in Kosovo in 1999, during which it repeatedly stressed in the UN discussions that 'Kosovo is an inherent part of the territory of the former Yugoslavia',[46] and rendered external intervention, particular through the use of force, would amount to the 'internationalization of a domestic issue'.[47] From China's perspective, Serbia was defending its sovereignty against internal challenges, a position that China almost certainly viewed with sympathy given its own internal challenges to\n35Kimberley N Trapp, 'Can Non-State Actors Mount an Armed Attack?' in Marc Weller (ed), The Oxford Handbook of the Use of Force in International Law (Oxford University Press 2015).\n36UN GA, 'Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts', 2002, UN Doc.

Even so, the Chinese government does not take a negative view of all security Council resolutions on humanitarian grounds. China has also acquiesced in or actively supported a number of more limited humanitarian interventions, including in Haiti, Somalia, Bosnia, East Timor, etc. From these resolutions on humanitarian grounds for which China provided limited support, the Chinese government's essential requirements for humanitarian intervention have become increasingly clear, namely, authorization of Security Council and the consent of the host state.\nMeanwhile, China has demonstrated a significant shift in its position on sovereignty by accepting the basic tenets of the R2P. For example, the 2005 Position Paper includes the concept of R2P. Yet it appears that China soon realized that it went too far. Therefore, China changed its tune during the debates on the first UN General Assembly resolution on R2P in 2009, contending that the R2P remained 'a concept' and did not constitute 'a norm of international law'. Furthermore, China warned that the implementation of R2P 'should not contravene the principle of state sovereignty and non-intervention in the internal affairs of States' and that the R2P should be prevented from 'becoming a kind of humanitarian intervention'. Unlike some western states that focus on the third pillar of R2P, Responsibility to React, China attaches special weight to the other two pillars, i.e. Responsibility to Prevent and Responsibility to Rebuild, which are the main reasons why R2P could be quickly accepted by those traditionally opposing humanitarian interventions at the 2005 World Summit.\nChina's position on R2P can be roughly analyzed by its shift of attitude from Libya to Syria in the voting and argumentation of Security Council resolutions. China abstained from the voting on resolution 1973 (2011), and notably did not block the pass of this resolution although it has 'serious difficulty with parts of the resolution'. Three crucial aspects of this highly unusual, perhaps exceptional, confluence of factors is considered. The first key factor that influenced international action in Libya was 'the clarity and immediacy of the threat to the civilian population'. The second and most crucial factor that provided the impetus for military action in Libya was the presence of regional consensus on the need for external intervention. The third important trigger was 'the defection of members of the Gaddafi government'. However, China was concerned with the actual implementation of the Resolution 1973 by\n Jonathan Davis, 'From Ideology to Pragmatism: China's Position on Humanitarian Intervention in the Post-Cold War Era' [2011] 44(2) Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law 217–283.\n UN SC, 'Provisional Verbatim Record of the 3238th Meeting', 1993, UN Doc.S/PV.3238.\n UN SC, 'Provisional Verbatim Record of the 3145th Meeting', 1992, UN Doc.S/PV.3145.\n UN SC, 'Security Council the 3461st Meeting', 1994, UN Doc.

For instance, it stated that ‘we are not in favor of any arbitrary interpretation of the Council's resolutions or of any actions going beyond those mandated'. China believed that its lenient approach to Libya worsened the situation and does not want a repeat in Syria. Thus, three separate Western-supported draft resolutions proposing non-forcible measures against the Assad regime had been vetoed by Russia and China.\nTo sum up, China's attitude towards concepts such as humanitarian intervention and R2P, which revise the traditional principles of non-use of force and sovereignty, is no longer as rigid as it used to be. China's approach to the issue is case-by-case, shifting from an initially ideological focus to a more pragmatic approach.\n### The Restrictive Approach Revisited: Consistency and Rationale\nChina's position on the use of force in international law has remained remarkably consistent over the past half-century, reflecting its broader transition from an outsider to an active participant in the international legal order. Despite profound shifts in global politics and China's evolving role on the world stage, its restrictive interpretation of jus ad bellum has endured, with steadfast adherence to the principle of non-use of force and a high threshold for exceptions. As China's global influence expands, its legal stance on the use of force will become increasingly significant. China's foreign policy has evolved from a strategy of biding its time to ‘advancing towards the center of the world stage'. While its foreign policy has evolved—shifting emphasis toward sovereignty and non-intervention rather than an absolute prohibition on force—its foundational approach remains unchanged. Understanding the rationale behind this persistent restrictivism requires an analysis from three key dimensions: internal formation, external influence, and objective morality.\nOn the one hand, China's restrictive approach is partly endogenous, shaped by its philosophy, its tradition of self-restraint, and its post-strike military strategy. These internal factors have fostered a long-standing commitment to limiting the use of force as a means of conflict resolution. China, as a quintessential agrarian civilization, operates within a governance framework that is inherently inward-looking, prioritizing land cultivation, territorial integrity, resource stability, and self-sufficiency. This model fosters a worldview that emphasizes continuity, tradition, and social order, rather than external expansion or aggressive engagement with foreign entities. Unlike maritime civilizations, which historically pursued expansion through conquest and overseas dominance, agrarian economies do not rely on external plunder for economic development. As a result, China lacks the inherent impetus for territorial expansion and have no enduring tradition of long-distance military expeditions. Furthermore, agrarian civilizations often perceive interaction with the outside world as a potential risk rather than an opportunity, leading to policies characterized by controlled trade and strict border defense. A notable historical example is the construction of the Great Wall, which was designed not for expansion, but for defense against external incursions.\n1. 67 Hanqin Xue, Chinese Contemporary Perspectives on International Law: History, Culture and International Law (Martinus Nijhoff 2012).\n1. 68 UN SC, ‘Security Council, 66th Year: 6528th Meeting', 4 May 2011, UN Doc.

Sima Law says that ‘though a country is now strong, bellicosity will lead to its ruin(国虽大, 好战必亡)’. For the surrounding ethnic groups, it has advocated ‘In practicing the rules of propriety, it is harmony that is prized(以和为贵, 以礼为固)’. Because of its self-perception as the superior state of China, it will hardly actively attack unless there is a threat to the tributary system and there is a need for restoration of peace. Even in its philosophy of war, China has always advocated ‘the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting(不战而屈人之兵)’. China possesses a defense-oriented strategy. It keeps to the stance that ‘we will not attack unless we are attacked, but we will surely counterattack if attacked’. Though met with debate, a typical example of this is China’s strategic posture regarding the nuclear weapons. In 1964, after its first nuclear test, China made the declaration that its nuclear development was solely for self-defence. China unconditionally committed itself to the non-use or threat of use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon States and to the non-first use of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances. Since its first National Defence White Paper in 1998, China has been adhering to the ‘principles of defense, self-defense and post-strike response’. This post-strike military position and its related philosophy of war have largely influenced China’s approach to the non-use of force.\nOn the other hand, the rationales for China's restrictive stance are partly exogenous, including China's decisive position in the Security Council and its options for minimizing risk in an anarchic international community. As one of the five permanent members, China bears a primary responsibility in ensuring international peace and security. China's advocacy on the dominant role of UN Security Council has closely related to its role as one of the permanent members, of which it has veto power. In this way, China can be sure that, at least under the framework of the United Nations, the Security Council will not make a resolution on the use of force to its disadvantage. Especially after witnessing the tragic consequences of unilateral military action and the abuse of the right to self-defense, China has affirmed that the restrictionist position is the best solution to safeguarding national interests, grounded in instrumental rationality and utilitarianism.\nAdditionally, morality and legitimacy play a crucial role. As a victim of war and the first country to sign the UN Charter, China sincerely and in good faith believes that the pursuit of peace is an objective that must never be compromised. The restrictive approach faithfully based on the UN Charter, objectively provides predictability in international behaviours and serves as a robust guarantee of international peace.\n# The Hesitating Power: Dilemmas Concerning the Application of Jus Ad Bellum in Cyberspace\nWith the process of de-sovereignty to re-sovereignty of cyberspace, the strategic significance of this domain is increasing annually, and the threats emanating from the cyberspace have profoundly impacted international relations.

In addition to advancements made under the UN, several countries have issued position papers outlining how international law applies to cyberspace through unilateral statements. All of these statements reference jus ad bellum in the context of cyberspace. Dozens of states have adopted the doctrine of scale and effects as criteria for determining what constitutes the use of force in cyberspace. Some have proposed progressive propositions such as anticipatory self-defense, cumulative self-defense, and self-defense against cyberattacks launched by non-state actors. At this critical juncture for clarifying and updating the rules, China appears to be in no rush to issue a unilateral declaration to clarify its position on the regulations governing the use of force in cyberspace.\nThe following discussion will unfold in three steps. First, the challenges posed by cyber operations to the existing framework of rules regarding the use of force will be elucidated. Second, China's stance on the law governing the use of force in cyberspace will be examined, along with an analysis of the considerations underlying China's general position in light of its domestic cyber strategy and the evolution of laws related to cyberspace. Finally, whether China's relevant stance in cyberspace would witness a historical shift from restrictionism to a more pragmatic flexibility will be explored.\n### The Challenges Posed by Cyber Operations to the Law on the Use of Force\nIt has to be acknowledged the international law regarding jus ad bellum per se is controversial within traditional physical domain. Cyberspace is often perceived as a homomorphic map of the physical domain, and this issue persists. In addition to the previously mentioned complexities, the unique characteristics of cyberspace further exacerbate the situation.\nFirstly, the application of cyber military technology has challenged modern theories of warfare. There exists a reciprocal relationship between military technology and theories of warfare. Cyberattacks no longer concentrate solely on the destruction of living forces and tangible assets, normally do not involve physical incursions into territory, and lack the apparent intensity and violence characteristic of kinetic warfare. This challenges fundamental assumptions regarding subject identification, real-world physical consequences, and civil-military distinctions. The damage caused by a cyberattack can be both tangible and intangible, including disruptions to financial markets, functional failures, and data loss. Furthermore, cyberattacks may be difficult for the victim states to detect. Additionally, the consequences of cyberattacks are often unpredictable and challenging to control. International law has yet to provide mature answers on how to evaluate intangible damages within the framework of jus ad bellum.\nSecondly, cyberattacks present dual challenges of technical and legal attribution. Due to the interconnectedness and anonymity of the cyberspace, attribution faces both technical and legal hurdles, raising questions about the object of the right to self-defense in cyberspace. States that conduct cyberattacks often intentionally evade accountability by employing proxy warfare or utilizing non-state actors as the actual perpetrators through outsourcing or contracting, thereby concealing their involvement. In notable cyberattacks that have garnered significant attention from the international community, such as the Estonian incident in 2007 and the Stuxnet in 2010, various clues have emerged, yet no country has ever acknowledged its participation. The existing legal framework for attribution, based on the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally\nWrongful Acts, struggles to effectively address the complexities of attribution in cyberspace, leading to ongoing debates about whether the right to self-defense extends to non-state actors.\nThirdly, the asymmetric cost dynamics between offensive and defensive cyber operations have given rise to a bidirectional deterrence effect. At the same time, the limited effectiveness of ex-post defensive measures in mitigating the impact of cyberattacks has further weakened mutual trust among sovereign states, exacerbating tensions in the international cybersecurity landscape. This situation poses significant challenges regarding the timing and limitations of states' exercise of the right to self-defense. In contrast to traditional kinetic weapons, particularly nuclear arms, the costs associated with the creation, research, and production of cyber weapons are relatively low. Additionally, the expenses related to reproduction and replacement are more affordable. Countries with robust cyber capabilities often rely heavily on digital networks for governance and management, making them more vulnerable to cyberattacks—a phenomenon known as the ‘glass house dilemma'. Plus, the consequences inflicted by cyberattacks may be temporary or permanent, direct or indirect, tangible or intangible, and can even exceed the perpetrator's control. However, it is certain that the erosion of the victim state's authority and the diminishing trust of its citizens are inevitable outcomes. All of this underscores the reality that the costs of defending against and responding to cyberattacks—whether they are ongoing or have already concluded—can be substantial and disproportionate. Thus, it is challenging for states to determine when to respond and how to navigate the constraints of necessity and proportionality in their responses. In short, this is likely to lead to a generalization of the right to self-defense. Claims such as anticipatory self-defense and cumulative self-defense with response to cyber-attacks have begun to emerge, challenging the established legal framework of jus ad bellum.\nThe three challenges outlined above demonstrate that the military application of cyber technology poses significant difficulties for the existing framework governing the non-use of force. This situation is not putting old wine in a new bottle but highlights the urgent need for a collaborative response among states. Without such cooperation, certain cyber operations may remain ambiguous under international law due to unclear definitions. This ambiguity undermines the predictability of norms in cyberspace and threatens the long-term stability of the cyber environment.\n### China's Cautious Stance on the Use of Force in Cyberspace and Its Strategic Considerations\nChina's stance on the use of force in cyberspace remains conservative thus is prima facie consistent with its restrictive approach in physical domain. Without providing any substantive clarification on the operational level, China declared a firm attitude towards the peaceful use of cyberspace. It has stressed on many occasions that all countries should adhere to the principle of non-use of force enshrined in the UN Charter in the cyber context. For instance, the joint Sino-Russian proposal for an International Code of Conduct for Information Security in 2011 stated that ‘to settle any dispute resulting from the application of the code through peaceful means and to refrain from the threat or use of force'. In addition, the 2017 International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace clearly stipulated that ‘China is dedicated to promoting each party in effectively complying with the basic international relationship rules such as ... refraining from use or threat of force'. However, China has been vague about what defines the use of cyber force and the specific circumstances under which it may invoke the right to self-defense in response to cyberattacks.\n\nThis partially because of the resilience of the existing *jus ad bellum* rules. The rules governing the non-use of force are not meant to be domain-specific, as ICJ has opined that Articles 2(4) and 51 of the UN Charter regarding the prohibition on use of force and self-defence, respectively, apply to ‘any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed’. From the point of view of effective interpretation, it is submitted that the system of laws and regulations on the non-use of force itself has resilience. Although the cyberspace is artificial, it is still closely related to the traditional domain, and the existing rules can be extended to apply to the cyberspace. Thus, there is no legal vacuum. In terms of cost, China’s (or any other states’) position cannot be completely divorced from the existing framework.\nCompared to Western countries, China is currently less inclined to express a definitive stance on this issue. It perceives a troubling trend in the discourse that emphasizes exceptions rather than fundamental principles, with some states attempting to lower the threshold for triggering the right to self-defence in cyberspace. Although China places significant importance on the peaceful use of cyberspace, it believes that excessive discussion regarding the right to resort to force—particularly in the name of self-defence—could have potential negative impact on international peace and security, aggravating an arms race and leading to the militarization of cyberspace. Thus, the Chinese government is skeptical of the intense debate surrounding exceptions that justify the use of cyber force, contending that Western countries are cherry-picking on this issue. For example, China emphasized the ‘overemphasis on making exceptions for cyber warfare or self-defense, while the non-use of force principle has been marginalized’ and ‘the risk of sliding towards the militarization of cyberspace’. In its submission to the UN Open-ended Working Group, China stated that ‘state should focus on… refraining from the use or threat of use of force. Willful use of force… should be prevented. The applicability of… *jus ad bellum* needs to be handled with prudence’.\nIt should be admitted that most States now recognize, albeit to different degrees, that it is unhelpful to rely on the military paradigm as the first port of call when analyzing inter-state malicious cyber operations. Yet the complexity of the disagreement on the application of *jus ad bellum* lies in the fact that the debate has been very much politicized, from a legal point of view, there does not seem to be a compelling reason why the existing *jus ad bellum* cannot be applied to cyberspace.\nChina’s principled caution does not indicate a lack of concern regarding the issue. On the contrary, as a latecomer to international law, China now has the opportunity to play a significant role in shaping international law in a field that is still in its formative stages. China exhibits ambivalence toward the relevant factors, opting to use non-legal reasoning to minimize excessive discussion and avoid making premature decisions.\nChina’s current restrictive stance on the use of force in cyberspace can be understood from several key perspectives. First, the unique characteristics of cyberspace indeed present challenges to the application of existing frameworks, resulting in significant legal uncertainty. Second, there is insufficient state practice and *opinio juris* to effectively test and verify whether a cyber action constitutes the use of force or an armed attack. Countries have not yet established what rules are generally accepted by the international community, or even what rules would be advantageous for their own interests. Therefore, making a definitive statement at this time may be premature. Thirdly, because of the digital divide related to cyber technology and the soft power of international law-making between China and Western countries, coupled with the growing concerns regarding the\n Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, International Court of Justice, Advisory Opinion’ 1996 226.\n Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization(AALCO), ‘Verbatim Record of the Fifty Fourth Annual Session’, 2015, Doc.

Just as China explained at the 2019 annual meeting of the Asian-African Legal Cooperation Organization, ‘given the “digital gap” between developing and the developed countries, developing countries in general will be in a disadvantaged position in the discussion and development of such rules, it will be difficult to ensure the rules are fair and equitable'. Nevertheless, as an emerging power seeking to influence the development of international law in cyberspace, China's principled official rhetoric regarding of the jus ad bellum in cyberspace may also serve a bargaining leverage in the formulation of international law regulating the use of cyber force.\nEven in the absence of detailed and specific legal rules governing cyber hostile acts in peacetime, states remain bound by three fundamental principles of international law, each carrying increasing normative weight: state sovereignty, non-intervention, and non-use of force. Therefore, China's cautious approach to the use of force in cyberspace stems not only from the aforementioned lack of established practice, strategic continuity, and tactical prudence, but also from a profound commitment to cyber sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention. From China's perspective, most—if not all—contemporary cyberattacks fall short of constituting a use of force and can be more appropriately addressed within the existing framework of cyber sovereignty and non-intervention.\nIn conclusion, it is reasonable to assume that China's restrictive approach to jus ad bellum could materially affect its position on when a cyberattack constitutes the use of force and under what circumstances the right of self-defense can be exercised against a cyberattack. As a typical proponent of multilateralism, China would certainly continue to firmly uphold the integrity and the authority of the UN, which function as the core of the international collective security mechanism. However, this does not imply that China's stance is inflexible and rigid. In light of the characteristics of cyberspace, where its position may evolve be examined.\n### Towards a More Pragmatic Chinese Approach to the Law on Use of Force in Cyberspace?\nWhile cyber operations present a triple challenge to the application of jus ad bellum, the extent to which these challenges are likely to influence China's approach to the law on the use of force in cyberspace is worth re-examining. The following will be discussed from four aspects: attribution, the object of exercising the right of self-defense, the threshold of use of force or armed attack, and the time and limitation of exercising the right of self-defense.\nThe difficulty of attribution due to anonymity in cyberspace can indeed lead to the erosion of international mutual trust, which has a negative impact on the overall cybersecurity. However, fundamentally, this is only a temporary technical obstacle, which will eventually be overcome with technological progress, or a corresponding international response mechanism will be established, so it does not constitute a fundamental subversion of the legal logic of attribution in international law. In addition, as an important element of state responsibility, if the attribution is arbitrarily changed because of the characteristics of a certain field, it will obviously do more harm than good to the maintenance of international order and the predictability of international norms. Therefore, it is unlikely that China will adjust its position on the challenge posed by cyber attribution to the law of the use of force.\nBased on the cognition of the issue of cyber attribution, China will most likely not change its restrictive position on whether the object of exercising the right of self-defense in cyberspace can be extended to non-state actors. Once attribution is resolved, responding to malicious cyberattacks by\nnon-state actors becomes to a large extent a matter of combating cybercrime and international judicial cooperation, which does not necessarily involve the use of force issue, and it is also possible to seek the consent of the territorial State or invoke the principle of due diligence to involve the territorial State and transit State in the fight against cybercriminals or cyberterrorist organizations.\nGiven this, the real challenge lies in the means and methods of cyberattacks, which have fundamentally challenged the traditional theories of warfare. No longer solely focused on the destruction of living forces and physical assets, one significant consequence of cyberattacks is that they create certain confusion to defining the threshold for the use of force or armed attack. This confusion manifests both qualitatively and quantitatively. From a qualitative perspective, the damage caused by cyberattacks can have both physical and non-physical consequences. The current ‘consequence-based' standard proposed by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations is indeed reasonable in this context. When physical consequences can be explained by analogy, it becomes easier to determine whether a cyber operation meets the threshold for the use of force or armed attack. However, this framework struggles to adequately assess cyberattacks that lack physical consequences. Some scholars have argued that disruptive cyber operations may fall under the scope of Article 2(4) if the resulting disruption is ‘significant enough to affect state security', but this interpretation is inherently arbitrary. A more radical interpretation expands the definition of the use of force to include non-destructive cyber operations against critical national infrastructure. However, this ‘target-based' interpretation excessively broadens the threshold, which is not conducive to maintaining peace and security. It also undermines the applicability and integrity of the principles of cyber sovereignty and non-intervention. On the quantitative side, the challenge is more pronounced in defining damage. Non-physical damage is particularly difficult to quantify objectively, and measuring the direct and indirect impacts of cyberattacks presents a complex issue. If the definition of damage cannot be accurately established, how can we ensure that the requirements of necessity and proportionality in the right of self-defense are fulfilled in good faith? In this context, a shift from consequence-based to a convergence of consequence-based, goal-based and function-based criteria is not unacceptable to China.\nBeyond the question of what constitutes the threshold for the use of force, another potential turning point is that the post-attack response is unlikely to be satisfactory. The ineffectiveness of ex-post defense will challenge the temporal requirements for exercising the self-defense. Due to the asymmetric costs associated with cyber offence and defense, the victim country not only faces the burden of implementing general defense measures at a high cost but may also have to endure significant expenses with minimal success in its ex-post response. Therefore, it raises the question of whether it is feasible to flexibly adjust the timing of self-defense against armed cyber-attacks. While the wording of the UN Charter advocates for ex-post defense, there may be room for broader interpretation within customary international law.\nChina has yet to comment on the issue, but it will need to do so sooner or later. As China's cyber capabilities expand globally, so do its overseas interests that require protection, which may lead China to adopt a more open stance on the jus ad bellum. On April 2024, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has set up three new arms, the Aerospace Force, Cyberspace Force, and Information Support Force to serve alongside the existing Joint Logistics Support Force. In the short term, it is highly unlikely that China will issue unilateral statements to clarify its detailed position on the use of force in cyberspace. However, should such a statement be made, it will likely address the use of force\nand the right to self-defense. To date, no state that has issued such a statement has overlooked this issue. Even if China were to make a unilateral declaration regarding the applicability of international law in cyberspace, it is improbable that it would elaborate beyond affirming the prohibition on the use of force. More pragmatically, China's approach to the use of force in cyberspace is likely to be reflected in its responses to individual cyber incidents or operations, as well as in discussions within the UN framework. Just as mentioned in the 2005 Position Paper “given the varying causes and nature of crises, it is both unrealistic and hugely controversial to formulate a one-fits-all rule or criterion on the use of force. Whether to use force or not should be decided by the Security Council in light of the reality of cyber incidents on a case-by-case basis. It remains to be seen whether adaptation will be made by China to the application of specific rules in cyberspace, such as ease up on the right of anticipatory self-defence or endorse a convergence of consequence-based, goal-based and function-based approach on determine the use of force.\n## Conclusion\nThis article elaborates on China's position regarding the jus ad bellum by examining its state practices and official statements. It also explores the extent to which China's approach in the emerging domain of cyberspace may be influenced by, or differ from, its traditional stance. The rationales for China's restrictive stance are partly endogenous, determined primarily by China's philosophy of war and its military strategy of self-restraint, and partly exogenous, including China's decisive position in the UN Security Council and its options for minimizing risk in an anarchic international community.\nChina's conservative stance will most likely continue in cyberspace, but it also faces a dilemma. On the one hand, international lawmaking in cyberspace is under way, and China is finally no longer the rule-taker but a rule-maker. It certainly wants to play a more substantive role and not miss the opportunity. As a potential victim of cyberattacks, it certainly wants to preserve and clarify the right to response against perpetrators, and sticking to rigid traditional positions may not be helpful in protecting national interests, including an increasing number of overseas interests. On the other hand, if the relevant restrictive interpretation is adjusted, the relevant rules may be abused and misinterpreted at will. In the overall unfriendly environment and the situation where, Chinese discourse is not dominant, Chinese legal and natural persons may be subjected to cyber attacks in the name of the right to self-defense, which may further deteriorate international relations in cyberspace. In this sense, China would basically maintain the ‘wait and see' approach regarding the jus ad bellum in cyberspace and continue its overall restrictive understanding of the relevant rules in cyberspace, however, facing the increasing frequency of cyber-attacks, the possibility that China would adopt a more flexible understanding of some specific rules cannot be completely ruled out.\nOur grateful thanks to the Editor and three anonymous reviewers for the journal for their astute comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.\n## Disclosure Statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s)."

The rationale for China's restrictive stance is partly endogenous, determined primarily by its philosophy and military strategy of self-restraint, and partly exogenous, influenced by its decisive position in the Security Council. The challenges posed by cyber operations to the use of force are mainly evident in the difficulties of attribution, the evolving means, aims, and effects of cyber-warfare, and the legal ambiguities arising from the asymmetry of offensive and defensive costs. China's stance in cyberspace will be significantly affected by its traditional approach, which stems from the resilience of established rules, strategic inheritance, and tactical cautiousness.\n# KEYWORDS\nuse of force; cyberspace; self-defence; China; jus ad bellum\n# Introduction\nWar and peace are the eternal themes of mankind. After the Second World War, the international community for the first time made the prohibition of the use of force as one of the fundamental principles of international law, thereby establishing a new international order. Simply put, the status quo of the normative framework for the law on the use of force can be summarized as 'one principle with two exceptions'. Under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and customary international law, states should refrain from the use or threat of force in international relations. But there are two exceptions to this principle. The first is the use of force authorized by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. This is the embodiment of the collective security mechanism established by the UN. The other exception is the victim state exercises its inherent right of self-defence.\nThis normative framework of 'one principle with two exceptions' forms the starting point for scholarly discussion of the law of the use of force. The connotation of international law related to jus ad bellum, as a typically high political field that touches on the survival and fundamental interests of states, is much more complicated in reality. As self-interest subjects, states would choose to clarify the principle and exceptions of the law of the non-use of force in extensive or restrictive way under different circumstances, and even put forward propositions beyond the existing normative framework. Therefore, the controversy over the law on the use of force has persisted since the day the regime was established, making this area one of the most contentious bodies of law. $^{1}$\nThe emergence of cyber technology and the proliferation of cyber warfare threats have further complicated the situation. With the rise and popularization of network technology, cyberspace has\nCONTACT Zehua Shi shizehua@whu.edu.cn Law School, Wuhan University, No. 299 Bayi Road, Wuhan, Hubei, China\n1Monica Hakimi, 'The Jus Ad Bellum's Regulatory Form'  112(2) American Journal of International Law 151-190.\n© 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group\ngradually become ‘the fifth domain' in addition to land, sea, air space and outer space. The growing strategic significance of cyberspace for nation-states has led to intense discussions over international rules pertaining to cyberwarfare, particularly jus ad bellum. As early as 2007, Estonia suffered a cyber-attack against its critical infrastructures, and in 2008, Russia was alleged to conduct cyber operations in the military conflict with Georgia. In 2010, Iran's nuclear facilities were severely damaged by a malicious worm known as Stuxnet. Later in 2019, Venezuela claimed its power grid was attacked by cyber means. A growing number of incidents have added urgency to the clarification of international law on the non-use of force in cyberspace. In addition to these sporadic incidents, there has been a general trend to formally establish cyber forces, strengthen cyber defense capabilities, and update military strategies. With the development of practice, the question of whether and how the principle of non-use of force should be applied to cyberspace has been frequently asked. Within the framework of the United Nations, general preliminary agreements have been reached so far, but much remains to be resolved.\nIt is well-known that China has hewed consistently a rather restrictive interpretation of the law on the use of force. However, the analysis of its international law stances, especially the logic and reasoning, needs to be strengthened, such as China's understanding of what constitutes the use of force and under what circumstances the right to self-defence can be exercised. In addition, how China, an extremely important state actor as well as stakeholder in the cyber domain, conceives of jus ad bellum in cyberspace is understandably a great concern for other States.\nThis paper explores the formation and evolution of China's traditionally restrictive normative stance on the non-use of force. Building on this foundation, it examines China's position on the use of force in cyberspace, incorporating an analysis of the unique characteristics of this domain. Furthermore, the paper assesses whether China's approach to the use of force in cyberspace is undergoing a historical shift—from a restrictive doctrine to a more pragmatically flexible stance. It is therefore divided into four parts. After quickly revisiting the current legal framework on the use of force, the second part demonstrates China's restrictive interpretation of jus ad bellum, and a general wariness towards the use of force outside the UN framework. Subsequently, the third part analyzes the challenges posed by ICTs to the application of the law on the use of force in cyberspace, and after navigating China's position on this issue and its reasoning, points out that although China still holds a restrictive position on the whole, the possibility of a shift towards a more flexible and pragmatic direction cannot be ruled out. Finally, a preliminary conclusion will be briefly presented.\n## The Chinese Restrictive Approach to the Law on the Use of Force\nRegarding the jus ad bellum, China has always taken a restrictive approach, that is, it believes that the prohibition of the use of force as a principle should be strictly observed, and exceptions should be minimized. This part examines the formation, consistency and evolution of China's normative position from an empirical perspective, and analyzes why China has basically adhered to this restrictive interpretation for more than half a century, and whether China's inclination has shifted in the context of the new era.\n##\nJOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA\n#\n# The Formation and Evolution of the Chinese Approach on the Use of Force\nFirst of all, China's interpretation of the principle prohibiting the use of force will be briefly presented based on its domestic regulations and corresponding statements. Secondly, China's position on exceptions to this prohibition will be examined through both its words and deeds, along with its stance with regard to the proposition of using force outside the framework of the UN Charter.\n# China's Restrictive Position on the Principle of Non-Use of Force\nWith regard to China's understanding of the principle of non-use of force, China's view is consistent with the framework of the UN and the main stream of international law. From 1949 to 1971, China was largely excluded from the international community based on ideological antagonism and the international situation. In the meantime, China's understanding of the use of force has largely been analyzed in the light of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence that it proposed in the 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement. The Five principles of Peaceful Coexistence, includes the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, has been committed to promoting and implementing by the Chinese government throughout the whole process. It was recently reaffirmed in the Foreign Relations Law. Since People's Republic of China obtained its lawful seat in the United Nations, the Chinese government's public statements repeatedly emphasize the importance of Article 2(4)'s prohibition on the threat or use of force. From the perspective of international law, China's position can be deconstructed from the following aspects.\nFirst, China emphasizes the central and even monopolistic role of the UN collective security mechanism, especially the Security Council, on the use of force. In other words, the use of force by states is prohibited absent Security Council authorization with the sole exception of self-defense. Secondly, China reckons that Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the use of force among sovereign States and also applies in the military conflicts between States and nations seeking self-determination. For instance, Article 4 of the Foreign Relations Law stipulates that China 'opposes the use of force or threat of force in international relations'. The legal argument here is that the prohibition applies only to the use of force by states against other states, thus does not affect the right of States to use force to maintain national security and order within their domestic jurisdiction. Therefore, given the position of the Chinese Government, which is that Taiwan is part of China's sacred territory, the nature of the Taiwan question 'is purely an internal matter for China'. Thirdly, the Chinese government confines 'force' in Art. 2(4) of the UN Charter to military force and thus economic or political coercion is excluded. Additionally, Unlike the United States, which tends not to strictly distinguish between the use of force and armed attack, China believes that only the most serious form of use of force constitutes an armed attack, which is in line with the conclusion given by the ICJ in the Nicaragua vs. the United States case. In summary, China's attitude towards jus ad bellum falls squally on the side of restrictive camp, and it is largely consistent over the half past century.\n8Shengzu Wang, History of International Relations[国际关系史], Vol. 8 (World Knowledge Press 1995).\n9Tieya Wang, International Law in China: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives (Martinus Nijhoff Publishers 1990).\n10Law on Foreign Relations of the People's Republic of China, 2023.\n11The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, 'Position Paper of the People's Republic of China on the UN Reforms' (7 June 2005) <https: 200506=\"\" 2005year_675849=\"\" 20050607_9288805.s=\"\" 22005=\"\" 22gylhg_675873=\"\" 674904=\"\" zit_674979=\"\" jiliao_674904=\"\" jywzt_675099=\"\" jwz1hg_675873=\"\" www.fmprc.gov.cn=\"\" ziliao_674904=\"\">\n12Kinmin Ma, 使用武力法:发展与挑战[‘The Law of Use of Force: Development and Challenges’] (2013) Chinese Yearbook of International Law.\n13 Constitution of the People's Republic of China, 2018.\n14 China, 'The Taiwan Question and China's Reunification in the New Era' (10 August 2022) <http: 10=\"\" 2022-08=\"\" content_78365819.html=\"\" english.scio.gov.cn=\"\" whitepapers=\"\">\n15 Harold Hongju Koh, 'International Law in Cyberspace'  54 Harvard International Law Journal Online 1-12.\n16 Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

SHI\n# Restrictive Interpretation of Exceptions to the Principle of Non-Use of Force\nConsistent with its formalist interpretation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, China maintains a restrictive position on exceptions to the principle of non-use of force, asserting that only two exceptions are recognized. The first is when the Security Council authorizes the use of force under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, and the second is when a state exercises its right to self-defense. The Security Council's authorization is a typical manifestation of the collective security system established by the United Nations and is generally uncontroversial in international law. However, as an inherent right of the states, self-defense has always been a subject of debate. Furthermore, the use of force outside the UN system has gained traction, particularly under the banners of humanitarian intervention and the Responsibility to Protect (R2P). This section will examine China's position on the right to self-defense and its perspective on the use of force beyond the UN framework.\nSelf-Defence. As sovereign States' inherent right, self-defence is indisputably constituted the legal exceptions to the non-use of force principle. Article 51 of UN Charter is a right-confirmation clause rather than a right-grant clause. It can be considered that treaty law and customary rule on the right of self-defence exist in parallel. Regarding China's stance on self-defence, both deeds and words need to be examined.\nThe three typical incidents of China's use of force occurred during a period when China was completely excluded from the United Nations, namely, the intervention in the Korean War in the 1950s; the border dispute and conflict between China and India in  $1962^{20}$ ; the Sino-Soviet Union Zhenbao (Damanskii) Island Incident in 1969. Some Chinese scholars render that China's intervention in Korean War could be characterized as the exercise of the right of self-defense, but there was no explicit invocation by the Chinese government, although it repeatedly stressed that its involvement in Korean War was a just war. China's participation in the Korean War can be analyzed in the light of the following considerations. China's intervention came at the request and express consent of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In addition, China chose to aid the DPRK in the name of the 'People's Volunteers Army' instead of the People's Liberation Army.\nWith the exception of Korean war, other situations involving use of force were clearly defined by China as 'self-defense counterattacks', otherwise as exercises of the right to self-defence. From 1971 to 1990, China's discussions regarding the use of force and its exceptions in the Security Council were limited, largely due to its domestic policies and the atmosphere of the Cold War. Additionally, the 1979 border conflict with Vietnam was officially characterized by the Chinese government as an act of self-defense. This characterization is evident in China's submission of a formal letter to the\n17The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China (n 11).\n18Christian Henderson, The Use of Force and International Law (Cambridge University Press 2018)\n19Chris O'Meara, 'Reconceptualising the Right of Self-Defence against \"Imminent\" Armed Attacks'  9(2) Journal on the Use of Force and International Law 278-323.\n20Ashley J.

Since then, China's discussions in the Security Council and other international forums regarding the legality of the use of force and its exceptions have gradually transitioned from limited participation to active engagement. The Position Paper of the People's Republic of China on United Nations Reforms, released in 2005 (hereinafter '2005 Position Paper'), serves as a landmark document, as it provides the most detailed illustration of China's position on jus ad bellum to date. It stipulated as follows: 'We are of the view that Article 51 of the Charter should neither be amended nor reinterpreted. The Charter lays down explicit provisions on the use of force, i.e. use of force shall not be resorted to without the authorization of the Security Council with the exception of self-defense under armed attack. Whether an urgent threat exists should be determined and handled with prudence by the Security Council in accordance with Chapter 7 of the Charter and in light of the specific situation'.\nThis 2005 position paper conveys precisely China's restrictive interpretation of the right to self-defense and provides a very cautious and conservative answer to two major disputes about the exercise of self-defense, namely, when and to whom the right of self-defense should be exercised. Compared to the relatively new position in 2021, China's stance on the right to self-defense remains largely consistent.\nIt is highly controversial whether the exercise of the right to self-defense should be interpreted strictly in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, which states that 'under armed attack' is a necessary prerequisite, or whether it can be exercised more flexibly in anticipation of imminent or even just potential threats. Regarding temporal requirements, China maintains an open yet extremely cautious approach. On the one hand, it consistently rejects the concept of 'preventive self-defense', recently associated with the 'Bush Doctrine', which China views as an abuse of the right to self-defense and thus emphasis 'no state should ... use force arbitrarily in the name of preventive self-defence'. On the other hand, China is also skeptical about the notion of 'anticipatory self-defense', which is called the Caroline doctrine under customary international law, according to which a state is required to prove that its use of force in response to a threat which was 'instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation'. The 2005 position paper using the phrase 'self-defense under armed attack', seems to lead to the conclusion that the Chinese government adopted a narrow understanding, which is in line with the plain meaning and the negotiating history of Article 51, especially with the provision 'if an armed attack occurs'. Nevertheless, it does not entirely dismiss the potential for exercising the right to self-defense against imminent threats under customary international law.\nIn addition, to whom the right of self-defense should be exercised, that is, the target requirement, also generates debates. Article 51 of the UN Charter does not specifically stipulate that the self-\n25UN SC, 'Letter Dated 17 February 1979 from the Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council', 1979, UN Doc.

In that vein, therefore, self-defence cannot be exercised against non-state actors unless the 'armed attack' conducted by this non-state actors are attributable to another sovereign state under the law of state responsibility. $^{36}$  The ICJ in the Wall Advisory Opinion held that Article 51 of the UN Charter 'recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self-defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State'. $^{37}$  China appears to be a little ambivalent on this point, as it voted in favour of the Security Council resolutions on the use of force against al-Qaeda after 9/11. $^{38}$  Yet it still deeply worries about the abuse of the right to self-defence as an exception to the prohibition of the use of force, and it emphasizes that \"The use of force against non-state actors in the territory of another state, which is for the purpose of self-defence, shall be subject to the consent of the state concerned ... no state should interfere in other's internal affairs under the cloak of 'counter-terrorism'. $^{39}$  This also echoes China's three principles of UN peacekeeping, namely, consent of the parties, impartiality and non-use of force except in self-defense and defense of the mandate. $^{40}$\nAssertions of the Use of Force Outside the Collective Security System. After the end of the Cold War, discussions emerged regarding the justification of using force outside the framework of the United Nations in extreme circumstances. This debate is particularly represented by the theory of humanitarian intervention and, later, the Responsibility to Protect (R2P). Humanitarian intervention is a doctrine that advocates for intervention to protect citizens from the oppression of their own government, allowing for unilateral force to be employed to protect human rights in another state. The concept of R2P was developed as an alternative to humanitarian intervention and was coined by a commission established by the Canadian government after the controversial NATO airstrikes against the former Yugoslavia in 1999. Generally, China's acceptance of the R2P concept is significantly higher than that of humanitarian intervention.\nAs for the humanitarian intervention, it can be said that China, together with many developing states, opposes this idea. It is true that China's approach to humanitarian intervention, and to the use of force in the broader sense, is profoundly influenced by its position on the principle of sovereignty under the UN Charter. A case in point is China's response to NATO's military intervention in Kosovo in 1999, during which it repeatedly stressed in the UN discussions that 'Kosovo is an inherent part of the territory of the former Yugoslavia', and rendered external intervention, particular through the use of force, would amount to the 'internationalization of a domestic issue'. From China's perspective, Serbia was defending its sovereignty against internal challenges, a position that China almost certainly viewed with sympathy given its own internal challenges to\n35Kimberley N Trapp, 'Can Non-State Actors Mount an Armed Attack?' in Marc Weller (ed), The Oxford Handbook of the Use of Force in International Law (Oxford University Press 2015).\n36UN GA, 'Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts', 2002, UN Doc.

China has also acquiesced in or actively supported a number of more limited humanitarian interventions, including in Haiti,⁴⁹ Somalia,⁵⁰ Bosnia,⁵¹ East Timor,⁵² etc. From these resolutions on humanitarian grounds for which China provided limited support, the Chinese government's essential requirements for humanitarian intervention have become increasingly clear, namely, authorization of Security Council and the consent of the host state.⁵³\nMeanwhile, China has demonstrated a significant shift in its position on sovereignty by accepting the basic tenets of the R2P. For example, the 2005 Position Paper includes the concept of R2P.⁵⁴ Yet it appears that China soon realized that it went too far.⁵⁵ Therefore, China changed its tune during the debates on the first UN General Assembly resolution on R2P in 2009, contending that the R2P remained 'a concept' and did not constitute 'a norm of international law'.⁵⁶ Furthermore, China warned that the implementation of R2P 'should not contravene the principle of state sovereignty and non-intervention in the internal affairs of States' and that the R2P should be prevented from 'becoming a kind of humanitarian intervention'.⁵⁷ Unlike some western states that focus on the third pillar of R2P, Responsibility to React, China attaches special weight to the other two pillars, i.e. Responsibility to Prevent and Responsibility to Rebuild,⁵⁸ which are the main reasons why R2P could be quickly accepted by those traditionally opposing humanitarian interventions at the 2005 World Summit.⁵⁹\nChina's position on R2P can be roughly analyzed by its shift of attitude from Libya to Syria in the voting and argumentation of Security Council resolutions.⁶⁰ China abstained from the voting on resolution 1973 (2011),⁶¹ and notably did not block the pass of this resolution although it has 'serious difficulty with parts of the resolution'.⁶² Three crucial aspects of this highly unusual, perhaps exceptional, confluence of factors is considered.⁶³ The first key factor that influenced international action in Libya was 'the clarity and immediacy of the threat to the civilian population'.⁶⁴ The second and most crucial factor that provided the impetus for military action in Libya was the presence of regional consensus on the need for external intervention.⁶⁵ The third important trigger was 'the defection of members of the Gaddafi government'.⁶⁶ However, China was concerned with the actual implementation of the Resolution 1973 by\n⁴⁸ Jonathan Davis, 'From Ideology to Pragmatism: China's Position on Humanitarian Intervention in the Post-Cold War Era'  44(2) Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law 217–283.\n⁴⁹ UN SC, 'Provisional Verbatim Record of the 3238th Meeting', 1993, UN Doc.S/PV.3238.\n⁵⁰ UN SC, 'Provisional Verbatim Record of the 3145th Meeting', 1992, UN Doc.S/PV.3145.\n⁵¹ UN SC, 'Security Council the 3461st Meeting', 1994, UN Doc.

For instance, it stated that ‘we are not in favor of any arbitrary interpretation of the Council's resolutions or of any actions going beyond those mandated'. China believed that its lenient approach to Libya worsened the situation and does not want a repeat in Syria. Thus, three separate Western-supported draft resolutions proposing non-forcible measures against the Assad regime had been vetoed by Russia and China.\nTo sum up, China's attitude towards concepts such as humanitarian intervention and R2P, which revise the traditional principles of non-use of force and sovereignty, is no longer as rigid as it used to be. China's approach to the issue is case-by-case, shifting from an initially ideological focus to a more pragmatic approach.\n### The Restrictive Approach Revisited: Consistency and Rationale\nChina's position on the use of force in international law has remained remarkably consistent over the past half-century, reflecting its broader transition from an outsider to an active participant in the international legal order. Despite profound shifts in global politics and China's evolving role on the world stage, its restrictive interpretation of jus ad bellum has endured, with steadfast adherence to the principle of non-use of force and a high threshold for exceptions. As China's global influence expands, its legal stance on the use of force will become increasingly significant. China's foreign policy has evolved from a strategy of biding its time to ‘advancing towards the center of the world stage'. While its foreign policy has evolved—shifting emphasis toward sovereignty and non-intervention rather than an absolute prohibition on force—its foundational approach remains unchanged. Understanding the rationale behind this persistent restrictivism requires an analysis from three key dimensions: internal formation, external influence, and objective morality.\nOn the one hand, China's restrictive approach is partly endogenous, shaped by its philosophy, its tradition of self-restraint, and its post-strike military strategy. These internal factors have fostered a long-standing commitment to limiting the use of force as a means of conflict resolution. China, as a quintessential agrarian civilization, operates within a governance framework that is inherently inward-looking, prioritizing land cultivation, territorial integrity, resource stability, and self-sufficiency. This model fosters a worldview that emphasizes continuity, tradition, and social order, rather than external expansion or aggressive engagement with foreign entities. Unlike maritime civilizations, which historically pursued expansion through conquest and overseas dominance, agrarian economies do not rely on external plunder for economic development. As a result, China lacks the inherent impetus for territorial expansion and have no enduring tradition of long-distance military expeditions. Furthermore, agrarian civilizations often perceive interaction with the outside world as a potential risk rather than an opportunity, leading to policies characterized by controlled trade and strict border defense. A notable historical example is the construction of the Great Wall, which was designed not for expansion, but for defense against external incursions.\n1. 67 Hanqin Xue, Chinese Contemporary Perspectives on International Law: History, Culture and International Law (Martinus Nijhoff 2012).\n1. 68 UN SC, ‘Security Council, 66th Year: 6528th Meeting', 4 May 2011, UN Doc.

Sima Law says that ‘though a country is now strong, bellicosity will lead to its ruin(国虽大, 好战必亡)’. For the surrounding ethnic groups, it has advocated ‘In practicing the rules of propriety, it is harmony that is prized(以和为贵, 以礼为固)’. Because of its self-perception as the superior state of China, it will hardly actively attack unless there is a threat to the tributary system and there is a need for restoration of peace. Even in its philosophy of war, China has always advocated ‘the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting(不战而屈人之兵)’. China possesses a defense-oriented strategy. It keeps to the stance that ‘we will not attack unless we are attacked, but we will surely counterattack if attacked’. Though met with debate, a typical example of this is China’s strategic posture regarding the nuclear weapons. In 1964, after its first nuclear test, China made the declaration that its nuclear development was solely for self-defence. China unconditionally committed itself to the non-use or threat of use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon States and to the non-first use of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances. Since its first National Defence White Paper in 1998, China has been adhering to the ‘principles of defense, self-defense and post-strike response’. This post-strike military position and its related philosophy of war have largely influenced China’s approach to the non-use of force.\nOn the other hand, the rationales for China's restrictive stance are partly exogenous, including China's decisive position in the Security Council and its options for minimizing risk in an anarchic international community. As one of the five permanent members, China bears a primary responsibility in ensuring international peace and security. China's advocacy on the dominant role of UN Security Council has closely related to its role as one of the permanent members, of which it has veto power. In this way, China can be sure that, at least under the framework of the United Nations, the Security Council will not make a resolution on the use of force to its disadvantage. Especially after witnessing the tragic consequences of unilateral military action and the abuse of the right to self-defense, China has affirmed that the restrictionist position is the best solution to safeguarding national interests, grounded in instrumental rationality and utilitarianism.\nAdditionally, morality and legitimacy play a crucial role. As a victim of war and the first country to sign the UN Charter, China sincerely and in good faith believes that the pursuit of peace is an objective that must never be compromised. The restrictive approach faithfully based on the UN Charter, objectively provides predictability in international behaviours and serves as a robust guarantee of international peace.\n# The Hesitating Power: Dilemmas Concerning the Application of Jus Ad Bellum in Cyberspace\nWith the process of de-sovereignty to re-sovereignty of cyberspace, the strategic significance of this domain is increasing annually, and the threats emanating from the cyberspace have profoundly impacted international relations. Quite a few states have begun to implement updated arrangements in national defense, including the deployment of cyber forces. Over the past two\n74Ibid.\n75Caitlin Talmadge, ‘Would China Go Nuclear?

In addition to advancements made under the UN, several countries have issued position papers outlining how international law applies to cyberspace through unilateral statements. All of these statements reference jus ad bellum in the context of cyberspace. Dozens of states have adopted the doctrine of scale and effects as criteria for determining what constitutes the use of force in cyberspace. Some have proposed progressive propositions such as anticipatory self-defense, cumulative self-defense, and self-defense against cyberattacks launched by non-state actors. At this critical juncture for clarifying and updating the rules, China appears to be in no rush to issue a unilateral declaration to clarify its position on the regulations governing the use of force in cyberspace.\nThe following discussion will unfold in three steps. First, the challenges posed by cyber operations to the existing framework of rules regarding the use of force will be elucidated. Second, China's stance on the law governing the use of force in cyberspace will be examined, along with an analysis of the considerations underlying China's general position in light of its domestic cyber strategy and the evolution of laws related to cyberspace. Finally, whether China's relevant stance in cyberspace would witness a historical shift from restrictionism to a more pragmatic flexibility will be explored.\n### The Challenges Posed by Cyber Operations to the Law on the Use of Force\nIt has to be acknowledged the international law regarding jus ad bellum per se is controversial within traditional physical domain. Cyberspace is often perceived as a homomorphic map of the physical domain, and this issue persists. In addition to the previously mentioned complexities, the unique characteristics of cyberspace further exacerbate the situation.\nFirstly, the application of cyber military technology has challenged modern theories of warfare. There exists a reciprocal relationship between military technology and theories of warfare. Cyberattacks no longer concentrate solely on the destruction of living forces and tangible assets, normally do not involve physical incursions into territory, and lack the apparent intensity and violence characteristic of kinetic warfare. This challenges fundamental assumptions regarding subject identification, real-world physical consequences, and civil-military distinctions. The damage caused by a cyberattack can be both tangible and intangible, including disruptions to financial markets, functional failures, and data loss. Furthermore, cyberattacks may be difficult for the victim states to detect. Additionally, the consequences of cyberattacks are often unpredictable and challenging to control. International law has yet to provide mature answers on how to evaluate intangible damages within the framework of jus ad bellum.\nSecondly, cyberattacks present dual challenges of technical and legal attribution. Due to the interconnectedness and anonymity of the cyberspace, attribution faces both technical and legal hurdles, raising questions about the object of the right to self-defense in cyberspace. States that conduct cyberattacks often intentionally evade accountability by employing proxy warfare or utilizing non-state actors as the actual perpetrators through outsourcing or contracting, thereby concealing their involvement. In notable cyberattacks that have garnered significant attention from the international community, such as the Estonian incident in 2007 and the Stuxnet in 2010, various clues have emerged, yet no country has ever acknowledged its participation. The existing legal framework for attribution, based on the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally\nWrongful Acts, struggles to effectively address the complexities of attribution in cyberspace, leading to ongoing debates about whether the right to self-defense extends to non-state actors.\nThirdly, the asymmetric cost dynamics between offensive and defensive cyber operations have given rise to a bidirectional deterrence effect. At the same time, the limited effectiveness of ex-post defensive measures in mitigating the impact of cyberattacks has further weakened mutual trust among sovereign states, exacerbating tensions in the international cybersecurity landscape. This situation poses significant challenges regarding the timing and limitations of states' exercise of the right to self-defense. In contrast to traditional kinetic weapons, particularly nuclear arms, the costs associated with the creation, research, and production of cyber weapons are relatively low. Additionally, the expenses related to reproduction and replacement are more affordable. Countries with robust cyber capabilities often rely heavily on digital networks for governance and management, making them more vulnerable to cyberattacks—a phenomenon known as the ‘glass house dilemma'. Plus, the consequences inflicted by cyberattacks may be temporary or permanent, direct or indirect, tangible or intangible, and can even exceed the perpetrator's control. However, it is certain that the erosion of the victim state's authority and the diminishing trust of its citizens are inevitable outcomes. All of this underscores the reality that the costs of defending against and responding to cyberattacks—whether they are ongoing or have already concluded—can be substantial and disproportionate. Thus, it is challenging for states to determine when to respond and how to navigate the constraints of necessity and proportionality in their responses. In short, this is likely to lead to a generalization of the right to self-defense. Claims such as anticipatory self-defense and cumulative self-defense with response to cyber-attacks have begun to emerge, challenging the established legal framework of jus ad bellum.\nThe three challenges outlined above demonstrate that the military application of cyber technology poses significant difficulties for the existing framework governing the non-use of force. This situation is not putting old wine in a new bottle but highlights the urgent need for a collaborative response among states. Without such cooperation, certain cyber operations may remain ambiguous under international law due to unclear definitions. This ambiguity undermines the predictability of norms in cyberspace and threatens the long-term stability of the cyber environment.\n### China's Cautious Stance on the Use of Force in Cyberspace and Its Strategic Considerations\nChina's stance on the use of force in cyberspace remains conservative thus is prima facie consistent with its restrictive approach in physical domain. Without providing any substantive clarification on the operational level, China declared a firm attitude towards the peaceful use of cyberspace. It has stressed on many occasions that all countries should adhere to the principle of non-use of force enshrined in the UN Charter in the cyber context. For instance, the joint Sino-Russian proposal for an International Code of Conduct for Information Security in 2011 stated that ‘to settle any dispute resulting from the application of the code through peaceful means and to refrain from the threat or use of force'. In addition, the 2017 International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace clearly stipulated that ‘China is dedicated to promoting each party in effectively complying with the basic international relationship rules such as ... refraining from use or threat of force'. However, China has been vague about what defines the use of cyber force and the specific circumstances under which it may invoke the right to self-defense in response to cyberattacks.\n12 YUNG AND Z. SHI\nThis partially because of the resilience of the existing *jus ad bellum* rules. The rules governing the non-use of force are not meant to be domain-specific, as ICJ has opined that Articles 2(4) and 51 of the UN Charter regarding the prohibition on use of force and self-defence, respectively, apply to ‘any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed’.⁸⁹ From the point of view of effective interpretation, it is submitted that the system of laws and regulations on the non-use of force itself has resilience. Although the cyberspace is artificial, it is still closely related to the traditional domain, and the existing rules can be extended to apply to the cyberspace. Thus, there is no legal vacuum. In terms of cost, China’s (or any other states’) position cannot be completely divorced from the existing framework.\nCompared to Western countries, China is currently less inclined to express a definitive stance on this issue. It perceives a troubling trend in the discourse that emphasizes exceptions rather than fundamental principles, with some states attempting to lower the threshold for triggering the right to self-defence in cyberspace. Although China places significant importance on the peaceful use of cyberspace, it believes that excessive discussion regarding the right to resort to force—particularly in the name of self-defence—could have potential negative impact on international peace and security, aggravating an arms race and leading to the militarization of cyberspace.⁹⁰ Thus, the Chinese government is skeptical of the intense debate surrounding exceptions that justify the use of cyber force, contending that Western countries are cherry-picking on this issue. For example, China emphasized the ‘overemphasis on making exceptions for cyber warfare or self-defense, while the non-use of force principle has been marginalized’ and ‘the risk of sliding towards the militarization of cyberspace’.⁹¹ In its submission to the UN Open-ended Working Group, China stated that ‘state should focus on… refraining from the use or threat of use of force. Willful use of force… should be prevented. The applicability of… *jus ad bellum* needs to be handled with prudence’.⁹²\nIt should be admitted that most States now recognize, albeit to different degrees, that it is unhelpful to rely on the military paradigm as the first port of call when analyzing inter-state malicious cyber operations.⁹³ Yet the complexity of the disagreement on the application of *jus ad bellum* lies in the fact that the debate has been very much politicized, from a legal point of view, there does not seem to be a compelling reason why the existing *jus ad bellum* cannot be applied to cyberspace.\nChina’s principled caution does not indicate a lack of concern regarding the issue. On the contrary, as a latecomer to international law, China now has the opportunity to play a significant role in shaping international law in a field that is still in its formative stages. China exhibits ambivalence toward the relevant factors, opting to use non-legal reasoning to minimize excessive discussion and avoid making premature decisions.\nChina’s current restrictive stance on the use of force in cyberspace can be understood from several key perspectives. First, the unique characteristics of cyberspace indeed present challenges to the application of existing frameworks, resulting in significant legal uncertainty. Second, there is insufficient state practice and *opinio juris* to effectively test and verify whether a cyber action constitutes the use of force or an armed attack. Countries have not yet established what rules are generally accepted by the international community, or even what rules would be advantageous for their own interests. Therefore, making a definitive statement at this time may be premature. Thirdly, because of the digital divide related to cyber technology and the soft power of international law-making between China and Western countries, coupled with the growing concerns regarding the\n⁸⁹ Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, International Court of Justice, Advisory Opinion’ 1996 226.\n⁹⁰ Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization(AALCO), ‘Verbatim Record of the Fifty Fourth Annual Session’, 2015, Doc.

Just as China explained at the 2019 annual meeting of the Asian-African Legal Cooperation Organization, ‘given the “digital gap” between developing and the developed countries, developing countries in general will be in a disadvantaged position in the discussion and development of such rules, it will be difficult to ensure the rules are fair and equitable'. Nevertheless, as an emerging power seeking to influence the development of international law in cyberspace, China's principled official rhetoric regarding of the jus ad bellum in cyberspace may also serve a bargaining leverage in the formulation of international law regulating the use of cyber force.\nEven in the absence of detailed and specific legal rules governing cyber hostile acts in peacetime, states remain bound by three fundamental principles of international law, each carrying increasing normative weight: state sovereignty, non-intervention, and non-use of force. Therefore, China's cautious approach to the use of force in cyberspace stems not only from the aforementioned lack of established practice, strategic continuity, and tactical prudence, but also from a profound commitment to cyber sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention. From China's perspective, most—if not all—contemporary cyberattacks fall short of constituting a use of force and can be more appropriately addressed within the existing framework of cyber sovereignty and non-intervention.\nIn conclusion, it is reasonable to assume that China's restrictive approach to jus ad bellum could materially affect its position on when a cyberattack constitutes the use of force and under what circumstances the right of self-defense can be exercised against a cyberattack. As a typical proponent of multilateralism, China would certainly continue to firmly uphold the integrity and the authority of the UN, which function as the core of the international collective security mechanism. However, this does not imply that China's stance is inflexible and rigid. In light of the characteristics of cyberspace, where its position may evolve be examined.\n### Towards a More Pragmatic Chinese Approach to the Law on Use of Force in Cyberspace?\nWhile cyber operations present a triple challenge to the application of jus ad bellum, the extent to which these challenges are likely to influence China's approach to the law on the use of force in cyberspace is worth re-examining. The following will be discussed from four aspects: attribution, the object of exercising the right of self-defense, the threshold of use of force or armed attack, and the time and limitation of exercising the right of self-defense.\nThe difficulty of attribution due to anonymity in cyberspace can indeed lead to the erosion of international mutual trust, which has a negative impact on the overall cybersecurity. However, fundamentally, this is only a temporary technical obstacle, which will eventually be overcome with technological progress, or a corresponding international response mechanism will be established, so it does not constitute a fundamental subversion of the legal logic of attribution in international law. In addition, as an important element of state responsibility, if the attribution is arbitrarily changed because of the characteristics of a certain field, it will obviously do more harm than good to the maintenance of international order and the predictability of international norms. Therefore, it is unlikely that China will adjust its position on the challenge posed by cyber attribution to the law of the use of force.\nBased on the cognition of the issue of cyber attribution, China will most likely not change its restrictive position on whether the object of exercising the right of self-defense in cyberspace can be extended to non-state actors. Once attribution is resolved, responding to malicious cyberattacks by\nnon-state actors becomes to a large extent a matter of combating cybercrime and international judicial cooperation, which does not necessarily involve the use of force issue, and it is also possible to seek the consent of the territorial State or invoke the principle of due diligence to involve the territorial State and transit State in the fight against cybercriminals or cyberterrorist organizations.\nGiven this, the real challenge lies in the means and methods of cyberattacks, which have fundamentally challenged the traditional theories of warfare. No longer solely focused on the destruction of living forces and physical assets, one significant consequence of cyberattacks is that they create certain confusion to defining the threshold for the use of force or armed attack. This confusion manifests both qualitatively and quantitatively. From a qualitative perspective, the damage caused by cyberattacks can have both physical and non-physical consequences. The current ‘consequence-based' standard proposed by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations is indeed reasonable in this context. When physical consequences can be explained by analogy, it becomes easier to determine whether a cyber operation meets the threshold for the use of force or armed attack. However, this framework struggles to adequately assess cyberattacks that lack physical consequences. Some scholars have argued that disruptive cyber operations may fall under the scope of Article 2(4) if the resulting disruption is ‘significant enough to affect state security', but this interpretation is inherently arbitrary. A more radical interpretation expands the definition of the use of force to include non-destructive cyber operations against critical national infrastructure. However, this ‘target-based' interpretation excessively broadens the threshold, which is not conducive to maintaining peace and security. It also undermines the applicability and integrity of the principles of cyber sovereignty and non-intervention. On the quantitative side, the challenge is more pronounced in defining damage. Non-physical damage is particularly difficult to quantify objectively, and measuring the direct and indirect impacts of cyberattacks presents a complex issue. If the definition of damage cannot be accurately established, how can we ensure that the requirements of necessity and proportionality in the right of self-defense are fulfilled in good faith? In this context, a shift from consequence-based to a convergence of consequence-based, goal-based and function-based criteria is not unacceptable to China.\nBeyond the question of what constitutes the threshold for the use of force, another potential turning point is that the post-attack response is unlikely to be satisfactory. The ineffectiveness of ex-post defense will challenge the temporal requirements for exercising the self-defense. Due to the asymmetric costs associated with cyber offence and defense, the victim country not only faces the burden of implementing general defense measures at a high cost but may also have to endure significant expenses with minimal success in its ex-post response. Therefore, it raises the question of whether it is feasible to flexibly adjust the timing of self-defense against armed cyber-attacks. While the wording of the UN Charter advocates for ex-post defense, there may be room for broader interpretation within customary international law.\nChina has yet to comment on the issue, but it will need to do so sooner or later. As China's cyber capabilities expand globally, so do its overseas interests that require protection, which may lead China to adopt a more open stance on the jus ad bellum. On April 2024, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has set up three new arms, the Aerospace Force, Cyberspace Force, and Information Support Force to serve alongside the existing Joint Logistics Support Force. In the short term, it is highly unlikely that China will issue unilateral statements to clarify its detailed position on the use of force in cyberspace. However, should such a statement be made, it will likely address the use of force\nand the right to self-defense. To date, no state that has issued such a statement has overlooked this issue. Even if China were to make a unilateral declaration regarding the applicability of international law in cyberspace, it is improbable that it would elaborate beyond affirming the prohibition on the use of force. More pragmatically, China's approach to the use of force in cyberspace is likely to be reflected in its responses to individual cyber incidents or operations, as well as in discussions within the UN framework. Just as mentioned in the 2005 Position Paper “given the varying causes and nature of crises, it is both unrealistic and hugely controversial to formulate a one-fits-all rule or criterion on the use of force. Whether to use force or not should be decided by the Security Council in light of the reality of cyber incidents on a case-by-case basis. It remains to be seen whether adaptation will be made by China to the application of specific rules in cyberspace, such as ease up on the right of anticipatory self-defence or endorse a convergence of consequence-based, goal-based and function-based approach on determine the use of force.\n## Conclusion\nThis article elaborates on China's position regarding the jus ad bellum by examining its state practices and official statements. It also explores the extent to which China's approach in the emerging domain of cyberspace may be influenced by, or differ from, its traditional stance. The rationales for China's restrictive stance are partly endogenous, determined primarily by China's philosophy of war and its military strategy of self-restraint, and partly exogenous, including China's decisive position in the UN Security Council and its options for minimizing risk in an anarchic international community.\nChina's conservative stance will most likely continue in cyberspace, but it also faces a dilemma. On the one hand, international lawmaking in cyberspace is under way, and China is finally no longer the rule-taker but a rule-maker. It certainly wants to play a more substantive role and not miss the opportunity. As a potential victim of cyberattacks, it certainly wants to preserve and clarify the right to response against perpetrators, and sticking to rigid traditional positions may not be helpful in protecting national interests, including an increasing number of overseas interests. On the other hand, if the relevant restrictive interpretation is adjusted, the relevant rules may be abused and misinterpreted at will. In the overall unfriendly environment and the situation where, Chinese discourse is not dominant, Chinese legal and natural persons may be subjected to cyber attacks in the name of the right to self-defense, which may further deteriorate international relations in cyberspace. In this sense, China would basically maintain the ‘wait and see' approach regarding the jus ad bellum in cyberspace and continue its overall restrictive understanding of the relevant rules in cyberspace, however, facing the increasing frequency of cyber-attacks, the possibility that China would adopt a more flexible understanding of some specific rules cannot be completely ruled out.\nOur grateful thanks to the Editor and three anonymous reviewers for the journal for their astute comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.\n## Disclosure Statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s)."

The rationale for China's restrictive stance is partly endogenous, determined primarily by its philosophy and military strategy of self-restraint, and partly exogenous, influenced by its decisive position in the Security Council. The challenges posed by cyber operations to the use of force are mainly evident in the difficulties of attribution, the evolving means, aims, and effects of cyber-warfare, and the legal ambiguities arising from the asymmetry of offensive and defensive costs. China's stance in cyberspace will be significantly affected by its traditional approach, which stems from the resilience of established rules, strategic inheritance, and tactical cautiousness.\n# KEYWORDS use of force; cyberspace; self-defence; China; jus ad bellum # Introduction War and peace are the eternal themes of mankind. After the Second World War, the international community for the first time made the prohibition of the use of force as one of the fundamental principles of international law, thereby establishing a new international order. Simply put, the status quo of the normative framework for the law on the use of force can be summarized as 'one principle with two exceptions'. Under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and customary international law, states should refrain from the use or threat of force in international relations. But there are two exceptions to this principle. The first is the use of force authorized by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. This is the embodiment of the collective security mechanism established by the UN. The other exception is the victim state exercises its inherent right of self-defence.\nThis normative framework of 'one principle with two exceptions' forms the starting point for scholarly discussion of the law of the use of force. The connotation of international law related to jus ad bellum, as a typically high political field that touches on the survival and fundamental interests of states, is much more complicated in reality. As self-interest subjects, states would choose to clarify the principle and exceptions of the law of the non-use of force in extensive or restrictive way under different circumstances, and even put forward propositions beyond the existing normative framework. Therefore, the controversy over the law on the use of force has persisted since the day the regime was established, making this area one of the most contentious bodies of law. \nThe emergence of cyber technology and the proliferation of cyber warfare threats have further complicated the situation. With the rise and popularization of network technology, cyberspace has CONTACT Zehua Shi shizehua@whu.edu.cn Law School, Wuhan University, No. 299 Bayi Road, Wuhan, Hubei, China 1Monica Hakimi, 'The Jus Ad Bellum's Regulatory Form' [2018] 112(2) American Journal of International Law 151-190.\n© 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group gradually become ‘the fifth domain' in addition to land, sea, air space and outer space. The growing strategic significance of cyberspace for nation-states has led to intense discussions over international rules pertaining to cyberwarfare, particularly jus ad bellum. As early as 2007, Estonia suffered a cyber-attack against its critical infrastructures, and in 2008, Russia was alleged to conduct cyber operations in the military conflict with Georgia. In 2010, Iran's nuclear facilities were severely damaged by a malicious worm known as Stuxnet. Later in 2019, Venezuela claimed its power grid was attacked by cyber means. A growing number of incidents have added urgency to the clarification of international law on the non-use of force in cyberspace. In addition to these sporadic incidents, there has been a general trend to formally establish cyber forces, strengthen cyber defense capabilities, and update military strategies. With the development of practice, the question of whether and how the principle of non-use of force should be applied to cyberspace has been frequently asked. Within the framework of the United Nations, general preliminary agreements have been reached so far, but much remains to be resolved.\nIt is well-known that China has hewed consistently a rather restrictive interpretation of the law on the use of force. However, the analysis of its international law stances, especially the logic and reasoning, needs to be strengthened, such as China's understanding of what constitutes the use of force and under what circumstances the right to self-defence can be exercised. In addition, how China, an extremely important state actor as well as stakeholder in the cyber domain, conceives of jus ad bellum in cyberspace is understandably a great concern for other States.\nThis paper explores the formation and evolution of China's traditionally restrictive normative stance on the non-use of force. Building on this foundation, it examines China's position on the use of force in cyberspace, incorporating an analysis of the unique characteristics of this domain. Furthermore, the paper assesses whether China's approach to the use of force in cyberspace is undergoing a historical shift—from a restrictive doctrine to a more pragmatically flexible stance. It is therefore divided into four parts. After quickly revisiting the current legal framework on the use of force, the second part demonstrates China's restrictive interpretation of jus ad bellum, and a general wariness towards the use of force outside the UN framework. Subsequently, the third part analyzes the challenges posed by ICTs to the application of the law on the use of force in cyberspace, and after navigating China's position on this issue and its reasoning, points out that although China still holds a restrictive position on the whole, the possibility of a shift towards a more flexible and pragmatic direction cannot be ruled out. Finally, a preliminary conclusion will be briefly presented.\n## The Chinese Restrictive Approach to the Law on the Use of Force Regarding the jus ad bellum, China has always taken a restrictive approach, that is, it believes that the prohibition of the use of force as a principle should be strictly observed, and exceptions should be minimized. This part examines the formation, consistency and evolution of China's normative position from an empirical perspective, and analyzes why China has basically adhered to this restrictive interpretation for more than half a century, and whether China's inclination has shifted in the context of the new era.\n## JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA # # The Formation and Evolution of the Chinese Approach on the Use of Force First of all, China's interpretation of the principle prohibiting the use of force will be briefly presented based on its domestic regulations and corresponding statements. Secondly, China's position on exceptions to this prohibition will be examined through both its words and deeds, along with its stance with regard to the proposition of using force outside the framework of the UN Charter.\n# China's Restrictive Position on the Principle of Non-Use of Force With regard to China's understanding of the principle of non-use of force, China's view is consistent with the framework of the UN and the main stream of international law. From 1949 to 1971, China was largely excluded from the international community based on ideological antagonism and the international situation. In the meantime, China's understanding of the use of force has largely been analyzed in the light of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence that it proposed in the 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement. The Five principles of Peaceful Coexistence, includes the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, has been committed to promoting and implementing by the Chinese government throughout the whole process. It was recently reaffirmed in the Foreign Relations Law. Since People's Republic of China obtained its lawful seat in the United Nations, the Chinese government's public statements repeatedly emphasize the importance of Article 2(4)'s prohibition on the threat or use of force. From the perspective of international law, China's position can be deconstructed from the following aspects.\nFirst, China emphasizes the central and even monopolistic role of the UN collective security mechanism, especially the Security Council, on the use of force. In other words, the use of force by states is prohibited absent Security Council authorization with the sole exception of self-defense.[11] Secondly, China reckons that Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the use of force among sovereign States and also applies in the military conflicts between States and nations seeking self-determination. For instance, Article 4 of the Foreign Relations Law stipulates that China 'opposes the use of force or threat of force in international relations'. The legal argument here is that the prohibition applies only to the use of force by states against other states, thus does not affect the right of States to use force to maintain national security and order within their domestic jurisdiction.[12] Therefore, given the position of the Chinese Government, which is that Taiwan is part of China's sacred territory,[13] the nature of the Taiwan question 'is purely an internal matter for China'.[14] Thirdly, the Chinese government confines 'force' in Art. 2(4) of the UN Charter to military force and thus economic or political coercion is excluded. Additionally, Unlike the United States, which tends not to strictly distinguish between the use of force and armed attack,[15] China believes that only the most serious form of use of force constitutes an armed attack, which is in line with the conclusion given by the ICJ in the Nicaragua vs. the United States case.[16] In summary, China's attitude towards jus ad bellum falls squally on the side of restrictive camp, and it is largely consistent over the half past century.\n8Shengzu Wang, History of International Relations[国际关系史], Vol. 8 (World Knowledge Press 1995).\n9Tieya Wang, International Law in China: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives (Martinus Nijhoff Publishers 1990).\n10Law on Foreign Relations of the People's Republic of China, 2023.\n11The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, 'Position Paper of the People's Republic of China on the UN Reforms' (7 June 2005) <https: 200506=\"\"2005year_675849=\"\"20050607_9288805.s=\"\"22005=\"\"22gylhg_675873=\"\"674904=\"\"zit_674979=\"\"jiliao_674904=\"\"jywzt_675099=\"\"jwz1hg_675873=\"\"www.fmprc.gov.cn=\"\"ziliao_674904=\"\"> 12Kinmin Ma, 使用武力法:发展与挑战[‘The Law of Use of Force: Development and Challenges’] (2013) Chinese Yearbook of International Law.\n\n# Y. YING AND Z. SHI # Restrictive Interpretation of Exceptions to the Principle of Non-Use of Force Consistent with its formalist interpretation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, China maintains a restrictive position on exceptions to the principle of non-use of force, asserting that only two exceptions are recognized. The first is when the Security Council authorizes the use of force under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, and the second is when a state exercises its right to self-defense.[17] The Security Council's authorization is a typical manifestation of the collective security system established by the United Nations and is generally uncontroversial in international law. However, as an inherent right of the states, self-defense has always been a subject of debate. Furthermore, the use of force outside the UN system has gained traction, particularly under the banners of humanitarian intervention and the Responsibility to Protect (R2P). This section will examine China's position on the right to self-defense and its perspective on the use of force beyond the UN framework.\nSelf-Defence. As sovereign States' inherent right, self-defence is indisputably constituted the legal exceptions to the non-use of force principle. Article 51 of UN Charter is a right-confirmation clause rather than a right-grant clause.[18] It can be considered that treaty law and customary rule on the right of self-defence exist in parallel.[19] Regarding China's stance on self-defence, both deeds and words need to be examined.\nThe three typical incidents of China's use of force occurred during a period when China was completely excluded from the United Nations, namely, the intervention in the Korean War in the 1950s; the border dispute and conflict between China and India in $1962$; the Sino-Soviet Union Zhenbao (Damanskii) Island Incident in 1969. Some Chinese scholars render that China's intervention in Korean War could be characterized as the exercise of the right of self-defense,[21] but there was no explicit invocation by the Chinese government, although it repeatedly stressed that its involvement in Korean War was a just war.[22] China's participation in the Korean War can be analyzed in the light of the following considerations. China's intervention came at the request and express consent of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In addition, China chose to aid the DPRK in the name of the 'People's Volunteers Army'[23] instead of the People's Liberation Army.\nWith the exception of Korean war, other situations involving use of force were clearly defined by China as 'self-defense counterattacks',[24] otherwise as exercises of the right to self-defence. From 1971 to 1990, China's discussions regarding the use of force and its exceptions in the Security Council were limited, largely due to its domestic policies and the atmosphere of the Cold War. Additionally, the 1979 border conflict with Vietnam was officially characterized by the Chinese government as an act of self-defense. This characterization is evident in China's submission of a formal letter to the 17The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China (n 11).\n18Christian Henderson, The Use of Force and International Law (Cambridge University Press 2018) 19Chris O'Meara, 'Reconceptualising the Right of Self-Defence against\"Imminent\"Armed Attacks' [2022] 9(2) Journal on the Use of Force and International Law 278-323.\n20Ashley J.

Since then, China's discussions in the Security Council and other international forums regarding the legality of the use of force and its exceptions have gradually transitioned from limited participation to active engagement. The Position Paper of the People's Republic of China on United Nations Reforms, released in 2005 (hereinafter '2005 Position Paper'), serves as a landmark document, as it provides the most detailed illustration of China's position on jus ad bellum to date. It stipulated as follows: 'We are of the view that Article 51 of the Charter should neither be amended nor reinterpreted. The Charter lays down explicit provisions on the use of force, i.e. use of force shall not be resorted to without the authorization of the Security Council with the exception of self-defense under armed attack. Whether an urgent threat exists should be determined and handled with prudence by the Security Council in accordance with Chapter 7 of the Charter and in light of the specific situation'.[26] This 2005 position paper conveys precisely China's restrictive interpretation of the right to self-defense and provides a very cautious and conservative answer to two major disputes about the exercise of self-defense, namely, when and to whom the right of self-defense should be exercised. Compared to the relatively new position in 2021,[27] China's stance on the right to self-defense remains largely consistent.\nIt is highly controversial whether the exercise of the right to self-defense should be interpreted strictly in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, which states that 'under armed attack' is a necessary prerequisite, or whether it can be exercised more flexibly in anticipation of imminent or even just potential threats. Regarding temporal requirements, China maintains an open yet extremely cautious approach. On the one hand, it consistently rejects the concept of 'preventive self-defense',[28] recently associated with the 'Bush Doctrine',[29] which China views as an abuse of the right to self-defense and thus emphasis 'no state should... use force arbitrarily in the name of preventive self-defence'.[30] On the other hand, China is also skeptical about the notion of 'anticipatory self-defense', which is called the Caroline doctrine[31] under customary international law, according to which a state is required to prove that its use of force in response to a threat which was 'instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation'. The 2005 position paper using the phrase 'self-defense under armed attack',[32] seems to lead to the conclusion that the Chinese government adopted a narrow understanding, which is in line with the plain meaning and the negotiating history of Article 51, especially with the provision 'if an armed attack occurs'.[33] Nevertheless, it does not entirely dismiss the potential for exercising the right to self-defense against imminent threats under customary international law.[34] In addition, to whom the right of self-defense should be exercised, that is, the target requirement, also generates debates. Article 51 of the UN Charter does not specifically stipulate that the self- 25UN SC, 'Letter Dated 17 February 1979 from the Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council', 1979, UN Doc.

YING AND Z. SHI defence undertaken by the victim State must be only against another State. However, in traditional view, non-state actors are not seen as the subjects of international law. In that vein, therefore, self-defence cannot be exercised against non-state actors unless the 'armed attack' conducted by this non-state actors are attributable to another sovereign state under the law of state responsibility. The ICJ in the Wall Advisory Opinion held that Article 51 of the UN Charter 'recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self-defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State'. China appears to be a little ambivalent on this point, as it voted in favour of the Security Council resolutions on the use of force against al-Qaeda after 9/11. Yet it still deeply worries about the abuse of the right to self-defence as an exception to the prohibition of the use of force, and it emphasizes that\"The use of force against non-state actors in the territory of another state, which is for the purpose of self-defence, shall be subject to the consent of the state concerned... no state should interfere in other's internal affairs under the cloak of 'counter-terrorism'. This also echoes China's three principles of UN peacekeeping, namely, consent of the parties, impartiality and non-use of force except in self-defense and defense of the mandate. \nAssertions of the Use of Force Outside the Collective Security System. After the end of the Cold War, discussions emerged regarding the justification of using force outside the framework of the United Nations in extreme circumstances. This debate is particularly represented by the theory of humanitarian intervention and, later, the Responsibility to Protect (R2P). Humanitarian intervention is a doctrine that advocates for intervention to protect citizens from the oppression of their own government,[41] allowing for unilateral force to be employed to protect human rights in another state.[42] The concept of R2P was developed as an alternative to humanitarian intervention and was coined by a commission established by the Canadian government after the controversial NATO airstrikes against the former Yugoslavia in 1999.[43] Generally, China's acceptance of the R2P concept is significantly higher than that of humanitarian intervention.\nAs for the humanitarian intervention, it can be said that China, together with many developing states, opposes this idea.[44] It is true that China's approach to humanitarian intervention, and to the use of force in the broader sense, is profoundly influenced by its position on the principle of sovereignty under the UN Charter.[45] A case in point is China's response to NATO's military intervention in Kosovo in 1999, during which it repeatedly stressed in the UN discussions that 'Kosovo is an inherent part of the territory of the former Yugoslavia',[46] and rendered external intervention, particular through the use of force, would amount to the 'internationalization of a domestic issue'.[47] From China's perspective, Serbia was defending its sovereignty against internal challenges, a position that China almost certainly viewed with sympathy given its own internal challenges to 35Kimberley N Trapp, 'Can Non-State Actors Mount an Armed Attack?' in Marc Weller (ed), The Oxford Handbook of the Use of Force in International Law (Oxford University Press 2015).\n36UN GA, 'Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts', 2002, UN Doc.

China has also acquiesced in or actively supported a number of more limited humanitarian interventions, including in Haiti,⁴⁹ Somalia,⁵⁰ Bosnia,⁵¹ East Timor,⁵² etc. From these resolutions on humanitarian grounds for which China provided limited support, the Chinese government's essential requirements for humanitarian intervention have become increasingly clear, namely, authorization of Security Council and the consent of the host state.⁵³ Meanwhile, China has demonstrated a significant shift in its position on sovereignty by accepting the basic tenets of the R2P. For example, the 2005 Position Paper includes the concept of R2P.⁵⁴ Yet it appears that China soon realized that it went too far.⁵⁵ Therefore, China changed its tune during the debates on the first UN General Assembly resolution on R2P in 2009, contending that the R2P remained 'a concept' and did not constitute 'a norm of international law'.⁵⁶ Furthermore, China warned that the implementation of R2P 'should not contravene the principle of state sovereignty and non-intervention in the internal affairs of States' and that the R2P should be prevented from 'becoming a kind of humanitarian intervention'.⁵⁷ Unlike some western states that focus on the third pillar of R2P, Responsibility to React, China attaches special weight to the other two pillars, i.e. Responsibility to Prevent and Responsibility to Rebuild,⁵⁸ which are the main reasons why R2P could be quickly accepted by those traditionally opposing humanitarian interventions at the 2005 World Summit.⁵⁹ China's position on R2P can be roughly analyzed by its shift of attitude from Libya to Syria in the voting and argumentation of Security Council resolutions.⁶⁰ China abstained from the voting on resolution 1973 (2011),⁶¹ and notably did not block the pass of this resolution although it has 'serious difficulty with parts of the resolution'.⁶² Three crucial aspects of this highly unusual, perhaps exceptional, confluence of factors is considered.⁶³ The first key factor that influenced international action in Libya was 'the clarity and immediacy of the threat to the civilian population'.⁶⁴ The second and most crucial factor that provided the impetus for military action in Libya was the presence of regional consensus on the need for external intervention.⁶⁵ The third important trigger was 'the defection of members of the Gaddafi government'.⁶⁶ However, China was concerned with the actual implementation of the Resolution 1973 by ⁴⁸ Jonathan Davis, 'From Ideology to Pragmatism: China's Position on Humanitarian Intervention in the Post-Cold War Era' [2011] 44(2) Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law 217–283.\n⁴⁹ UN SC, 'Provisional Verbatim Record of the 3238th Meeting', 1993, UN Doc.S/PV.3238.\n⁵⁰ UN SC, 'Provisional Verbatim Record of the 3145th Meeting', 1992, UN Doc.S/PV.3145.\n⁵¹ UN SC, 'Security Council the 3461st Meeting', 1994, UN Doc.

For instance, it stated that ‘we are not in favor of any arbitrary interpretation of the Council's resolutions or of any actions going beyond those mandated'. China believed that its lenient approach to Libya worsened the situation and does not want a repeat in Syria. Thus, three separate Western-supported draft resolutions proposing non-forcible measures against the Assad regime had been vetoed by Russia and China.\nTo sum up, China's attitude towards concepts such as humanitarian intervention and R2P, which revise the traditional principles of non-use of force and sovereignty, is no longer as rigid as it used to be. China's approach to the issue is case-by-case, shifting from an initially ideological focus to a more pragmatic approach.\n### The Restrictive Approach Revisited: Consistency and Rationale China's position on the use of force in international law has remained remarkably consistent over the past half-century, reflecting its broader transition from an outsider to an active participant in the international legal order. Despite profound shifts in global politics and China's evolving role on the world stage, its restrictive interpretation of jus ad bellum has endured, with steadfast adherence to the principle of non-use of force and a high threshold for exceptions. As China's global influence expands, its legal stance on the use of force will become increasingly significant. China's foreign policy has evolved from a strategy of biding its time to ‘advancing towards the center of the world stage'. While its foreign policy has evolved—shifting emphasis toward sovereignty and non-intervention rather than an absolute prohibition on force—its foundational approach remains unchanged. Understanding the rationale behind this persistent restrictivism requires an analysis from three key dimensions: internal formation, external influence, and objective morality.\nOn the one hand, China's restrictive approach is partly endogenous, shaped by its philosophy, its tradition of self-restraint, and its post-strike military strategy. These internal factors have fostered a long-standing commitment to limiting the use of force as a means of conflict resolution. China, as a quintessential agrarian civilization, operates within a governance framework that is inherently inward-looking, prioritizing land cultivation, territorial integrity, resource stability, and self-sufficiency. This model fosters a worldview that emphasizes continuity, tradition, and social order, rather than external expansion or aggressive engagement with foreign entities. Unlike maritime civilizations, which historically pursued expansion through conquest and overseas dominance, agrarian economies do not rely on external plunder for economic development. As a result, China lacks the inherent impetus for territorial expansion and have no enduring tradition of long-distance military expeditions. Furthermore, agrarian civilizations often perceive interaction with the outside world as a potential risk rather than an opportunity, leading to policies characterized by controlled trade and strict border defense. A notable historical example is the construction of the Great Wall, which was designed not for expansion, but for defense against external incursions.\n\nIn addition, Confucian philosophy and historical military doctrines emphasize defensive wars and deterrence rather than preemptive aggression. Sima Law says that ‘though a country is now strong, bellicosity will lead to its ruin(国虽大, 好战必亡)’. For the surrounding ethnic groups, it has advocated ‘In practicing the rules of propriety, it is harmony that is prized(以和为贵, 以礼为固)’. Because of its self-perception as the superior state of China, it will hardly actively attack unless there is a threat to the tributary system and there is a need for restoration of peace. Even in its philosophy of war, China has always advocated ‘the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting(不战而屈人之兵)’. China possesses a defense-oriented strategy. It keeps to the stance that ‘we will not attack unless we are attacked, but we will surely counterattack if attacked’. Though met with debate, a typical example of this is China’s strategic posture regarding the nuclear weapons. In 1964, after its first nuclear test, China made the declaration that its nuclear development was solely for self-defence. China unconditionally committed itself to the non-use or threat of use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon States and to the non-first use of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances. Since its first National Defence White Paper in 1998, China has been adhering to the ‘principles of defense, self-defense and post-strike response’. This post-strike military position and its related philosophy of war have largely influenced China’s approach to the non-use of force.\nOn the other hand, the rationales for China's restrictive stance are partly exogenous, including China's decisive position in the Security Council and its options for minimizing risk in an anarchic international community. As one of the five permanent members, China bears a primary responsibility in ensuring international peace and security. China's advocacy on the dominant role of UN Security Council has closely related to its role as one of the permanent members, of which it has veto power. In this way, China can be sure that, at least under the framework of the United Nations, the Security Council will not make a resolution on the use of force to its disadvantage. Especially after witnessing the tragic consequences of unilateral military action and the abuse of the right to self-defense, China has affirmed that the restrictionist position is the best solution to safeguarding national interests, grounded in instrumental rationality and utilitarianism.\nAdditionally, morality and legitimacy play a crucial role. As a victim of war and the first country to sign the UN Charter, China sincerely and in good faith believes that the pursuit of peace is an objective that must never be compromised. The restrictive approach faithfully based on the UN Charter, objectively provides predictability in international behaviours and serves as a robust guarantee of international peace.\n# The Hesitating Power: Dilemmas Concerning the Application of Jus Ad Bellum in Cyberspace With the process of de-sovereignty to re-sovereignty of cyberspace, the strategic significance of this domain is increasing annually, and the threats emanating from the cyberspace have profoundly impacted international relations. Quite a few states have begun to implement updated arrangements in national defense, including the deployment of cyber forces. Over the past two 74Ibid.\n75Caitlin Talmadge, ‘Would China Go Nuclear?

In addition to advancements made under the UN, several countries have issued position papers outlining how international law applies to cyberspace through unilateral statements. All of these statements reference jus ad bellum in the context of cyberspace. Dozens of states have adopted the doctrine of scale and effects as criteria for determining what constitutes the use of force in cyberspace. Some have proposed progressive propositions such as anticipatory self-defense, cumulative self-defense, and self-defense against cyberattacks launched by non-state actors. At this critical juncture for clarifying and updating the rules, China appears to be in no rush to issue a unilateral declaration to clarify its position on the regulations governing the use of force in cyberspace.\nThe following discussion will unfold in three steps. First, the challenges posed by cyber operations to the existing framework of rules regarding the use of force will be elucidated. Second, China's stance on the law governing the use of force in cyberspace will be examined, along with an analysis of the considerations underlying China's general position in light of its domestic cyber strategy and the evolution of laws related to cyberspace. Finally, whether China's relevant stance in cyberspace would witness a historical shift from restrictionism to a more pragmatic flexibility will be explored.\n### The Challenges Posed by Cyber Operations to the Law on the Use of Force It has to be acknowledged the international law regarding jus ad bellum per se is controversial within traditional physical domain. Cyberspace is often perceived as a homomorphic map of the physical domain, and this issue persists. In addition to the previously mentioned complexities, the unique characteristics of cyberspace further exacerbate the situation.\nFirstly, the application of cyber military technology has challenged modern theories of warfare. There exists a reciprocal relationship between military technology and theories of warfare. Cyberattacks no longer concentrate solely on the destruction of living forces and tangible assets, normally do not involve physical incursions into territory, and lack the apparent intensity and violence characteristic of kinetic warfare. This challenges fundamental assumptions regarding subject identification, real-world physical consequences, and civil-military distinctions. The damage caused by a cyberattack can be both tangible and intangible, including disruptions to financial markets, functional failures, and data loss. Furthermore, cyberattacks may be difficult for the victim states to detect. Additionally, the consequences of cyberattacks are often unpredictable and challenging to control. International law has yet to provide mature answers on how to evaluate intangible damages within the framework of jus ad bellum.\nSecondly, cyberattacks present dual challenges of technical and legal attribution. Due to the interconnectedness and anonymity of the cyberspace, attribution faces both technical and legal hurdles, raising questions about the object of the right to self-defense in cyberspace. States that conduct cyberattacks often intentionally evade accountability by employing proxy warfare or utilizing non-state actors as the actual perpetrators through outsourcing or contracting, thereby concealing their involvement. In notable cyberattacks that have garnered significant attention from the international community, such as the Estonian incident in 2007 and the Stuxnet in 2010, various clues have emerged, yet no country has ever acknowledged its participation. The existing legal framework for attribution, based on the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, struggles to effectively address the complexities of attribution in cyberspace, leading to ongoing debates about whether the right to self-defense extends to non-state actors.\nThirdly, the asymmetric cost dynamics between offensive and defensive cyber operations have given rise to a bidirectional deterrence effect. At the same time, the limited effectiveness of ex-post defensive measures in mitigating the impact of cyberattacks has further weakened mutual trust among sovereign states, exacerbating tensions in the international cybersecurity landscape. This situation poses significant challenges regarding the timing and limitations of states' exercise of the right to self-defense. In contrast to traditional kinetic weapons, particularly nuclear arms, the costs associated with the creation, research, and production of cyber weapons are relatively low. Additionally, the expenses related to reproduction and replacement are more affordable. Countries with robust cyber capabilities often rely heavily on digital networks for governance and management, making them more vulnerable to cyberattacks—a phenomenon known as the ‘glass house dilemma'. Plus, the consequences inflicted by cyberattacks may be temporary or permanent, direct or indirect, tangible or intangible, and can even exceed the perpetrator's control. However, it is certain that the erosion of the victim state's authority and the diminishing trust of its citizens are inevitable outcomes. All of this underscores the reality that the costs of defending against and responding to cyberattacks—whether they are ongoing or have already concluded—can be substantial and disproportionate. Thus, it is challenging for states to determine when to respond and how to navigate the constraints of necessity and proportionality in their responses. In short, this is likely to lead to a generalization of the right to self-defense. Claims such as anticipatory self-defense and cumulative self-defense with response to cyber-attacks have begun to emerge, challenging the established legal framework of jus ad bellum.\nThe three challenges outlined above demonstrate that the military application of cyber technology poses significant difficulties for the existing framework governing the non-use of force. This situation is not putting old wine in a new bottle but highlights the urgent need for a collaborative response among states. Without such cooperation, certain cyber operations may remain ambiguous under international law due to unclear definitions. This ambiguity undermines the predictability of norms in cyberspace and threatens the long-term stability of the cyber environment.\n### China's Cautious Stance on the Use of Force in Cyberspace and Its Strategic Considerations China's stance on the use of force in cyberspace remains conservative thus is prima facie consistent with its restrictive approach in physical domain. Without providing any substantive clarification on the operational level, China declared a firm attitude towards the peaceful use of cyberspace. It has stressed on many occasions that all countries should adhere to the principle of non-use of force enshrined in the UN Charter in the cyber context. For instance, the joint Sino-Russian proposal for an International Code of Conduct for Information Security in 2011 stated that ‘to settle any dispute resulting from the application of the code through peaceful means and to refrain from the threat or use of force'. In addition, the 2017 International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace clearly stipulated that ‘China is dedicated to promoting each party in effectively complying with the basic international relationship rules such as... refraining from use or threat of force'. However, China has been vague about what defines the use of cyber force and the specific circumstances under which it may invoke the right to self-defense in response to cyberattacks.\n\nThis partially because of the resilience of the existing *jus ad bellum* rules. The rules governing the non-use of force are not meant to be domain-specific, as ICJ has opined that Articles 2(4) and 51 of the UN Charter regarding the prohibition on use of force and self-defence, respectively, apply to ‘any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed’.⁸⁹ From the point of view of effective interpretation, it is submitted that the system of laws and regulations on the non-use of force itself has resilience. Although the cyberspace is artificial, it is still closely related to the traditional domain, and the existing rules can be extended to apply to the cyberspace. Thus, there is no legal vacuum. In terms of cost, China’s (or any other states’) position cannot be completely divorced from the existing framework.\nCompared to Western countries, China is currently less inclined to express a definitive stance on this issue. It perceives a troubling trend in the discourse that emphasizes exceptions rather than fundamental principles, with some states attempting to lower the threshold for triggering the right to self-defence in cyberspace. Although China places significant importance on the peaceful use of cyberspace, it believes that excessive discussion regarding the right to resort to force—particularly in the name of self-defence—could have potential negative impact on international peace and security, aggravating an arms race and leading to the militarization of cyberspace.⁹⁰ Thus, the Chinese government is skeptical of the intense debate surrounding exceptions that justify the use of cyber force, contending that Western countries are cherry-picking on this issue. For example, China emphasized the ‘overemphasis on making exceptions for cyber warfare or self-defense, while the non-use of force principle has been marginalized’ and ‘the risk of sliding towards the militarization of cyberspace’.⁹¹ In its submission to the UN Open-ended Working Group, China stated that ‘state should focus on… refraining from the use or threat of use of force. Willful use of force… should be prevented. The applicability of… *jus ad bellum* needs to be handled with prudence’.⁹² It should be admitted that most States now recognize, albeit to different degrees, that it is unhelpful to rely on the military paradigm as the first port of call when analyzing inter-state malicious cyber operations.⁹³ Yet the complexity of the disagreement on the application of *jus ad bellum* lies in the fact that the debate has been very much politicized, from a legal point of view, there does not seem to be a compelling reason why the existing *jus ad bellum* cannot be applied to cyberspace.\nChina’s principled caution does not indicate a lack of concern regarding the issue. On the contrary, as a latecomer to international law, China now has the opportunity to play a significant role in shaping international law in a field that is still in its formative stages. China exhibits ambivalence toward the relevant factors, opting to use non-legal reasoning to minimize excessive discussion and avoid making premature decisions.\nChina’s current restrictive stance on the use of force in cyberspace can be understood from several key perspectives. First, the unique characteristics of cyberspace indeed present challenges to the application of existing frameworks, resulting in significant legal uncertainty. Second, there is insufficient state practice and *opinio juris* to effectively test and verify whether a cyber action constitutes the use of force or an armed attack. Countries have not yet established what rules are generally accepted by the international community, or even what rules would be advantageous for their own interests. Therefore, making a definitive statement at this time may be premature. Thirdly, because of the digital divide related to cyber technology and the soft power of international law-making between China and Western countries, coupled with the growing concerns regarding the ⁸⁹ Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, International Court of Justice, Advisory Opinion’ 1996 226.\n⁹⁰ Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization(AALCO), ‘Verbatim Record of the Fifty Fourth Annual Session’, 2015, Doc.

Just as China explained at the 2019 annual meeting of the Asian-African Legal Cooperation Organization, ‘given the “digital gap” between developing and the developed countries, developing countries in general will be in a disadvantaged position in the discussion and development of such rules, it will be difficult to ensure the rules are fair and equitable'. Nevertheless, as an emerging power seeking to influence the development of international law in cyberspace, China's principled official rhetoric regarding of the jus ad bellum in cyberspace may also serve a bargaining leverage in the formulation of international law regulating the use of cyber force.\nEven in the absence of detailed and specific legal rules governing cyber hostile acts in peacetime, states remain bound by three fundamental principles of international law, each carrying increasing normative weight: state sovereignty, non-intervention, and non-use of force. Therefore, China's cautious approach to the use of force in cyberspace stems not only from the aforementioned lack of established practice, strategic continuity, and tactical prudence, but also from a profound commitment to cyber sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention. From China's perspective, most—if not all—contemporary cyberattacks fall short of constituting a use of force and can be more appropriately addressed within the existing framework of cyber sovereignty and non-intervention.\nIn conclusion, it is reasonable to assume that China's restrictive approach to jus ad bellum could materially affect its position on when a cyberattack constitutes the use of force and under what circumstances the right of self-defense can be exercised against a cyberattack. As a typical proponent of multilateralism, China would certainly continue to firmly uphold the integrity and the authority of the UN, which function as the core of the international collective security mechanism. However, this does not imply that China's stance is inflexible and rigid. In light of the characteristics of cyberspace, where its position may evolve be examined.\n### Towards a More Pragmatic Chinese Approach to the Law on Use of Force in Cyberspace?\nWhile cyber operations present a triple challenge to the application of jus ad bellum, the extent to which these challenges are likely to influence China's approach to the law on the use of force in cyberspace is worth re-examining. The following will be discussed from four aspects: attribution, the object of exercising the right of self-defense, the threshold of use of force or armed attack, and the time and limitation of exercising the right of self-defense.\nThe difficulty of attribution due to anonymity in cyberspace can indeed lead to the erosion of international mutual trust, which has a negative impact on the overall cybersecurity. However, fundamentally, this is only a temporary technical obstacle, which will eventually be overcome with technological progress, or a corresponding international response mechanism will be established, so it does not constitute a fundamental subversion of the legal logic of attribution in international law. In addition, as an important element of state responsibility, if the attribution is arbitrarily changed because of the characteristics of a certain field, it will obviously do more harm than good to the maintenance of international order and the predictability of international norms. Therefore, it is unlikely that China will adjust its position on the challenge posed by cyber attribution to the law of the use of force.\nBased on the cognition of the issue of cyber attribution, China will most likely not change its restrictive position on whether the object of exercising the right of self-defense in cyberspace can be extended to non-state actors. Once attribution is resolved, responding to malicious cyberattacks by non-state actors becomes to a large extent a matter of combating cybercrime and international judicial cooperation, which does not necessarily involve the use of force issue, and it is also possible to seek the consent of the territorial State or invoke the principle of due diligence to involve the territorial State and transit State in the fight against cybercriminals or cyberterrorist organizations.\nGiven this, the real challenge lies in the means and methods of cyberattacks, which have fundamentally challenged the traditional theories of warfare. No longer solely focused on the destruction of living forces and physical assets, one significant consequence of cyberattacks is that they create certain confusion to defining the threshold for the use of force or armed attack. This confusion manifests both qualitatively and quantitatively. From a qualitative perspective, the damage caused by cyberattacks can have both physical and non-physical consequences. The current ‘consequence-based' standard proposed by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations is indeed reasonable in this context. When physical consequences can be explained by analogy, it becomes easier to determine whether a cyber operation meets the threshold for the use of force or armed attack. However, this framework struggles to adequately assess cyberattacks that lack physical consequences. Some scholars have argued that disruptive cyber operations may fall under the scope of Article 2(4) if the resulting disruption is ‘significant enough to affect state security', but this interpretation is inherently arbitrary. A more radical interpretation expands the definition of the use of force to include non-destructive cyber operations against critical national infrastructure. However, this ‘target-based' interpretation excessively broadens the threshold, which is not conducive to maintaining peace and security. It also undermines the applicability and integrity of the principles of cyber sovereignty and non-intervention. On the quantitative side, the challenge is more pronounced in defining damage. Non-physical damage is particularly difficult to quantify objectively, and measuring the direct and indirect impacts of cyberattacks presents a complex issue. If the definition of damage cannot be accurately established, how can we ensure that the requirements of necessity and proportionality in the right of self-defense are fulfilled in good faith? In this context, a shift from consequence-based to a convergence of consequence-based, goal-based and function-based criteria is not unacceptable to China.\nBeyond the question of what constitutes the threshold for the use of force, another potential turning point is that the post-attack response is unlikely to be satisfactory. The ineffectiveness of ex-post defense will challenge the temporal requirements for exercising the self-defense. Due to the asymmetric costs associated with cyber offence and defense, the victim country not only faces the burden of implementing general defense measures at a high cost but may also have to endure significant expenses with minimal success in its ex-post response. Therefore, it raises the question of whether it is feasible to flexibly adjust the timing of self-defense against armed cyber-attacks. While the wording of the UN Charter advocates for ex-post defense, there may be room for broader interpretation within customary international law.\nChina has yet to comment on the issue, but it will need to do so sooner or later. As China's cyber capabilities expand globally, so do its overseas interests that require protection, which may lead China to adopt a more open stance on the jus ad bellum. On April 2024, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has set up three new arms, the Aerospace Force, Cyberspace Force, and Information Support Force to serve alongside the existing Joint Logistics Support Force. In the short term, it is highly unlikely that China will issue unilateral statements to clarify its detailed position on the use of force in cyberspace. However, should such a statement be made, it will likely address the use of force and the right to self-defense. To date, no state that has issued such a statement has overlooked this issue. Even if China were to make a unilateral declaration regarding the applicability of international law in cyberspace, it is improbable that it would elaborate beyond affirming the prohibition on the use of force. More pragmatically, China's approach to the use of force in cyberspace is likely to be reflected in its responses to individual cyber incidents or operations, as well as in discussions within the UN framework. Just as mentioned in the 2005 Position Paper “given the varying causes and nature of crises, it is both unrealistic and hugely controversial to formulate a one-fits-all rule or criterion on the use of force. Whether to use force or not should be decided by the Security Council in light of the reality of cyber incidents on a case-by-case basis. It remains to be seen whether adaptation will be made by China to the application of specific rules in cyberspace, such as ease up on the right of anticipatory self-defence or endorse a convergence of consequence-based, goal-based and function-based approach on determine the use of force.\n## Conclusion This article elaborates on China's position regarding the jus ad bellum by examining its state practices and official statements. It also explores the extent to which China's approach in the emerging domain of cyberspace may be influenced by, or differ from, its traditional stance. The rationales for China's restrictive stance are partly endogenous, determined primarily by China's philosophy of war and its military strategy of self-restraint, and partly exogenous, including China's decisive position in the UN Security Council and its options for minimizing risk in an anarchic international community.\nChina's conservative stance will most likely continue in cyberspace, but it also faces a dilemma. On the one hand, international lawmaking in cyberspace is under way, and China is finally no longer the rule-taker but a rule-maker. It certainly wants to play a more substantive role and not miss the opportunity. As a potential victim of cyberattacks, it certainly wants to preserve and clarify the right to response against perpetrators, and sticking to rigid traditional positions may not be helpful in protecting national interests, including an increasing number of overseas interests. On the other hand, if the relevant restrictive interpretation is adjusted, the relevant rules may be abused and misinterpreted at will. In the overall unfriendly environment and the situation where, Chinese discourse is not dominant, Chinese legal and natural persons may be subjected to cyber attacks in the name of the right to self-defense, which may further deteriorate international relations in cyberspace. In this sense, China would basically maintain the ‘wait and see' approach regarding the jus ad bellum in cyberspace and continue its overall restrictive understanding of the relevant rules in cyberspace, however, facing the increasing frequency of cyber-attacks, the possibility that China would adopt a more flexible understanding of some specific rules cannot be completely ruled out.\nOur grateful thanks to the Editor and three anonymous reviewers for the journal for their astute comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.\n## Disclosure Statement No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s)."

The rationale for China's restrictive stance is partly endogenous, determined primarily by its philosophy and military strategy of self-restraint, and partly exogenous, influenced by its decisive position in the Security Council. The challenges posed by cyber operations to the use of force are mainly evident in the difficulties of attribution, the evolving means, aims, and effects of cyber-warfare, and the legal ambiguities arising from the asymmetry of offensive and defensive costs. China's stance in cyberspace will be significantly affected by its traditional approach, which stems from the resilience of established rules, strategic inheritance, and tactical cautiousness.\n\n---\n\n## ## Conclusion This article elaborates on China's position regarding the jus ad bellum by examining its state practices and official statements.

SHI # Restrictive Interpretation of Exceptions to the Principle of Non-Use of Force Consistent with its formalist interpretation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, China maintains a restrictive position on exceptions to the principle of non-use of force, asserting that only two exceptions are recognized. The first is when the Security Council authorizes the use of force under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, and the second is when a state exercises its right to self-defense.[17] The Security Council's authorization is a typical manifestation of the collective security system established by the United Nations and is generally uncontroversial in international law.

The rationale for China's restrictive stance is partly endogenous, determined primarily by its philosophy and military strategy of self-restraint, and partly exogenous, influenced by its decisive position in the Security Council. The challenges posed by cyber operations to the use of force are mainly evident in the difficulties of attribution, the evolving means, aims, and effects of cyber-warfare, and the legal ambiguities arising from the asymmetry of offensive and defensive costs. China's stance in cyberspace will be significantly affected by its traditional approach, which stems from the resilience of established rules, strategic inheritance, and tactical cautiousness.\n\n# KEYWORDS\n\nuse of force; cyberspace; self-defence; China; jus ad bellum\n\n# Introduction\n\nWar and peace are the eternal themes of mankind. After the Second World War, the international community for the first time made the prohibition of the use of force as one of the fundamental principles of international law, thereby establishing a new international order. Simply put, the status quo of the normative framework for the law on the use of force can be summarized as 'one principle with two exceptions'. Under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and customary international law, states should refrain from the use or threat of force in international relations. But there are two exceptions to this principle. The first is the use of force authorized by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. This is the embodiment of the collective security mechanism established by the UN. The other exception is the victim state exercises its inherent right of self-defence.\n\nThis normative framework of 'one principle with two exceptions' forms the starting point for scholarly discussion of the law of the use of force. The connotation of international law related to jus ad bellum, as a typically high political field that touches on the survival and fundamental interests of states, is much more complicated in reality. As self-interest subjects, states would choose to clarify the principle and exceptions of the law of the non-use of force in extensive or restrictive way under different circumstances, and even put forward propositions beyond the existing normative framework. Therefore, the controversy over the law on the use of force has persisted since the day the regime was established, making this area one of the most contentious bodies of law. $^{1}$\n\nThe emergence of cyber technology and the proliferation of cyber warfare threats have further complicated the situation.

    "gradually become ‘the fifth domain' in addition to land, sea, air space and outer space. The growing strategic significance of cyberspace for nation-states has led to intense discussions over international rules pertaining to cyberwarfare, particularly jus ad bellum. As early as 2007, Estonia suffered a cyber-attack against its critical infrastructures, and in 2008, Russia was alleged to conduct cyber operations in the military conflict with Georgia. In 2010, Iran's nuclear facilities were severely damaged by a malicious worm known as Stuxnet. Later in 2019, Venezuela claimed its power grid was attacked by cyber means. A growing number of incidents have added urgency to the clarification of international law on the non-use of force in cyberspace. In addition to these sporadic incidents, there has been a general trend to formally establish cyber forces, strengthen cyber defense capabilities, and update military strategies. With the development of practice, the question of whether and how the principle of non-use of force should be applied to cyberspace has been frequently asked. Within the framework of the United Nations, general preliminary agreements have been reached so far, but much remains to be resolved.\n\nIt is well-known that China has hewed consistently a rather restrictive interpretation of the law on the use of force. However, the analysis of its international law stances, especially the logic and reasoning, needs to be strengthened, such as China's understanding of what constitutes the use of force and under what circumstances the right to self-defence can be exercised. In addition, how China, an extremely important state actor as well as stakeholder in the cyber domain, conceives of jus ad bellum in cyberspace is understandably a great concern for other States.\n\nThis paper explores the formation and evolution of China's traditionally restrictive normative stance on the non-use of force. Building on this foundation, it examines China's position on the use of force in cyberspace, incorporating an analysis of the unique characteristics of this domain. Furthermore, the paper assesses whether China's approach to the use of force in cyberspace is undergoing a historical shift—from a restrictive doctrine to a more pragmatically flexible stance. It is therefore divided into four parts. After quickly revisiting the current legal framework on the use of force, the second part demonstrates China's restrictive interpretation of jus ad bellum, and a general wariness towards the use of force outside the UN framework. Subsequently, the third part analyzes the challenges posed by ICTs to the application of the law on the use of force in cyberspace, and after navigating China's position on this issue and its reasoning, points out that although China still holds a restrictive position on the whole, the possibility of a shift towards a more flexible and pragmatic direction cannot be ruled out. Finally, a preliminary conclusion will be briefly presented.\n\n## The Chinese Restrictive Approach to the Law on the Use of Force\n\nRegarding the jus ad bellum, China has always taken a restrictive approach, that is, it believes that the prohibition of the use of force as a principle should be strictly observed, and exceptions should be minimized. This part examines the formation, consistency and evolution of China's normative position from an empirical perspective, and analyzes why China has basically adhered to this restrictive interpretation for more than half a century, and whether China's inclination has shifted in the context of the new era.\n\n##",
    "JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA\n\n#\n\n# The Formation and Evolution of the Chinese Approach on the Use of Force\n\nFirst of all, China's interpretation of the principle prohibiting the use of force will be briefly presented based on its domestic regulations and corresponding statements. Secondly, China's position on exceptions to this prohibition will be examined through both its words and deeds, along with its stance with regard to the proposition of using force outside the framework of the UN Charter.\n\n# China's Restrictive Position on the Principle of Non-Use of Force\n\nWith regard to China's understanding of the principle of non-use of force, China's view is consistent with the framework of the UN and the main stream of international law. From 1949 to 1971, China was largely excluded from the international community based on ideological antagonism and the international situation. In the meantime, China's understanding of the use of force has largely been analyzed in the light of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence that it proposed in the 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement. The Five principles of Peaceful Coexistence, includes the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, has been committed to promoting and implementing by the Chinese government throughout the whole process. It was recently reaffirmed in the Foreign Relations Law. Since People's Republic of China obtained its lawful seat in the United Nations, the Chinese government's public statements repeatedly emphasize the importance of Article 2(4)'s prohibition on the threat or use of force. From the perspective of international law, China's position can be deconstructed from the following aspects.\n\nFirst, China emphasizes the central and even monopolistic role of the UN collective security mechanism, especially the Security Council, on the use of force. In other words, the use of force by states is prohibited absent Security Council authorization with the sole exception of self-defense.[11] Secondly, China reckons that Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the use of force among sovereign States and also applies in the military conflicts between States and nations seeking self-determination. For instance, Article 4 of the Foreign Relations Law stipulates that China 'opposes the use of force or threat of force in international relations'. The legal argument here is that the prohibition applies only to the use of force by states against other states, thus does not affect the right of States to use force to maintain national security and order within their domestic jurisdiction.[12] Therefore, given the position of the Chinese Government, which is that Taiwan is part of China's sacred territory,[13] the nature of the Taiwan question 'is purely an internal matter for China'.[14] Thirdly, the Chinese government confines 'force' in Art. 2(4) of the UN Charter to military force and thus economic or political coercion is excluded. Additionally, Unlike the United States, which tends not to strictly distinguish between the use of force and armed attack,[15] China believes that only the most serious form of use of force constitutes an armed attack, which is in line with the conclusion given by the ICJ in the Nicaragua vs. the United States case.[16] In summary, China's attitude towards jus ad bellum falls squally on the side of restrictive camp, and it is largely consistent over the half past century.\n\n8Shengzu Wang, History of International Relations[国际关系史], Vol. 8 (World Knowledge Press 1995).\n9Tieya Wang, International Law in China: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives (Martinus Nijhoff Publishers 1990).\n10Law on Foreign Relations of the People's Republic of China, 2023.\n11The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, 'Position Paper of the People's Republic of China on the UN Reforms' (7 June 2005) <https: 200506=\"\" 2005year_675849=\"\" 20050607_9288805.s=\"\" 22005=\"\" 22gylhg_675873=\"\" 674904=\"\" zit_674979=\"\" jiliao_674904=\"\" jywzt_675099=\"\" jwz1hg_675873=\"\" www.fmprc.gov.cn=\"\" ziliao_674904=\"\">\n12Kinmin Ma, 使用武力法:发展与挑战[‘The Law of Use of Force: Development and Challenges’] (2013) Chinese Yearbook of International Law.\n13 Constitution of the People's Republic of China, 2018.\n14 China, 'The Taiwan Question and China's Reunification in the New Era' (10 August 2022) <http: 10=\"\" 2022-08=\"\" content_78365819.html=\"\" english.scio.gov.cn=\"\" whitepapers=\"\">\n15 Harold Hongju Koh, 'International Law in Cyberspace' [2012] 54 Harvard International Law Journal Online 1-12.\n16 Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

    "#\n\nY. YING AND Z. SHI\n\n# Restrictive Interpretation of Exceptions to the Principle of Non-Use of Force\n\nConsistent with its formalist interpretation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, China maintains a restrictive position on exceptions to the principle of non-use of force, asserting that only two exceptions are recognized. The first is when the Security Council authorizes the use of force under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, and the second is when a state exercises its right to self-defense.[17] The Security Council's authorization is a typical manifestation of the collective security system established by the United Nations and is generally uncontroversial in international law. However, as an inherent right of the states, self-defense has always been a subject of debate. Furthermore, the use of force outside the UN system has gained traction, particularly under the banners of humanitarian intervention and the Responsibility to Protect (R2P). This section will examine China's position on the right to self-defense and its perspective on the use of force beyond the UN framework.\n\nSelf-Defence. As sovereign States' inherent right, self-defence is indisputably constituted the legal exceptions to the non-use of force principle. Article 51 of UN Charter is a right-confirmation clause rather than a right-grant clause.[18] It can be considered that treaty law and customary rule on the right of self-defence exist in parallel.[19] Regarding China's stance on self-defence, both deeds and words need to be examined.\n\nThe three typical incidents of China's use of force occurred during a period when China was completely excluded from the United Nations, namely, the intervention in the Korean War in the 1950s; the border dispute and conflict between China and India in  $1962^{20}$ ; the Sino-Soviet Union Zhenbao (Damanskii) Island Incident in 1969. Some Chinese scholars render that China's intervention in Korean War could be characterized as the exercise of the right of self-defense,[21] but there was no explicit invocation by the Chinese government, although it repeatedly stressed that its involvement in Korean War was a just war.[22] China's participation in the Korean War can be analyzed in the light of the following considerations. China's intervention came at the request and express consent of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In addition, China chose to aid the DPRK in the name of the 'People's Volunteers Army'[23] instead of the People's Liberation Army.\n\nWith the exception of Korean war, other situations involving use of force were clearly defined by China as 'self-defense counterattacks',[24] otherwise as exercises of the right to self-defence. From 1971 to 1990, China's discussions regarding the use of force and its exceptions in the Security Council were limited, largely due to its domestic policies and the atmosphere of the Cold War. Additionally, the 1979 border conflict with Vietnam was officially characterized by the Chinese government as an act of self-defense. This characterization is evident in China's submission of a formal letter to the\n\n17The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China (n 11).\n18Christian Henderson, The Use of Force and International Law (Cambridge University Press 2018)\n19Chris O'Meara, 'Reconceptualising the Right of Self-Defence against \"Imminent\" Armed Attacks' [2022] 9(2) Journal on the Use of Force and International Law 278-323.\n20Ashley J.

    "JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA\n\n#\n\nPresident of the UN Security Council, fulfilling the procedural requirement for the exercise of self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter.[25]\n\nThe Security Council discussion of the Gulf War was China's first substantive participation in the decision to collectively use force. Since then, China's discussions in the Security Council and other international forums regarding the legality of the use of force and its exceptions have gradually transitioned from limited participation to active engagement. The Position Paper of the People's Republic of China on United Nations Reforms, released in 2005 (hereinafter '2005 Position Paper'), serves as a landmark document, as it provides the most detailed illustration of China's position on jus ad bellum to date. It stipulated as follows: 'We are of the view that Article 51 of the Charter should neither be amended nor reinterpreted. The Charter lays down explicit provisions on the use of force, i.e. use of force shall not be resorted to without the authorization of the Security Council with the exception of self-defense under armed attack. Whether an urgent threat exists should be determined and handled with prudence by the Security Council in accordance with Chapter 7 of the Charter and in light of the specific situation'.[26]\n\nThis 2005 position paper conveys precisely China's restrictive interpretation of the right to self-defense and provides a very cautious and conservative answer to two major disputes about the exercise of self-defense, namely, when and to whom the right of self-defense should be exercised. Compared to the relatively new position in 2021,[27] China's stance on the right to self-defense remains largely consistent.\n\nIt is highly controversial whether the exercise of the right to self-defense should be interpreted strictly in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, which states that 'under armed attack' is a necessary prerequisite, or whether it can be exercised more flexibly in anticipation of imminent or even just potential threats. Regarding temporal requirements, China maintains an open yet extremely cautious approach. On the one hand, it consistently rejects the concept of 'preventive self-defense',[28] recently associated with the 'Bush Doctrine',[29] which China views as an abuse of the right to self-defense and thus emphasis 'no state should ... use force arbitrarily in the name of preventive self-defence'.[30] On the other hand, China is also skeptical about the notion of 'anticipatory self-defense', which is called the Caroline doctrine[31] under customary international law, according to which a state is required to prove that its use of force in response to a threat which was 'instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation'. The 2005 position paper using the phrase 'self-defense under armed attack',[32] seems to lead to the conclusion that the Chinese government adopted a narrow understanding, which is in line with the plain meaning and the negotiating history of Article 51, especially with the provision 'if an armed attack occurs'.[33] Nevertheless, it does not entirely dismiss the potential for exercising the right to self-defense against imminent threats under customary international law.[34]\n\nIn addition, to whom the right of self-defense should be exercised, that is, the target requirement, also generates debates. Article 51 of the UN Charter does not specifically stipulate that the self-\n\n25UN SC, 'Letter Dated 17 February 1979 from the Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council', 1979, UN Doc.

In that vein, therefore, self-defence cannot be exercised against non-state actors unless the 'armed attack' conducted by this non-state actors are attributable to another sovereign state under the law of state responsibility. $^{36}$  The ICJ in the Wall Advisory Opinion held that Article 51 of the UN Charter 'recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self-defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State'. $^{37}$  China appears to be a little ambivalent on this point, as it voted in favour of the Security Council resolutions on the use of force against al-Qaeda after 9/11. $^{38}$  Yet it still deeply worries about the abuse of the right to self-defence as an exception to the prohibition of the use of force, and it emphasizes that \"The use of force against non-state actors in the territory of another state, which is for the purpose of self-defence, shall be subject to the consent of the state concerned ... no state should interfere in other's internal affairs under the cloak of 'counter-terrorism'. $^{39}$  This also echoes China's three principles of UN peacekeeping, namely, consent of the parties, impartiality and non-use of force except in self-defense and defense of the mandate. $^{40}$\n\nAssertions of the Use of Force Outside the Collective Security System. After the end of the Cold War, discussions emerged regarding the justification of using force outside the framework of the United Nations in extreme circumstances. This debate is particularly represented by the theory of humanitarian intervention and, later, the Responsibility to Protect (R2P). Humanitarian intervention is a doctrine that advocates for intervention to protect citizens from the oppression of their own government,[41] allowing for unilateral force to be employed to protect human rights in another state.[42] The concept of R2P was developed as an alternative to humanitarian intervention and was coined by a commission established by the Canadian government after the controversial NATO airstrikes against the former Yugoslavia in 1999.[43] Generally, China's acceptance of the R2P concept is significantly higher than that of humanitarian intervention.\n\nAs for the humanitarian intervention, it can be said that China, together with many developing states, opposes this idea.[44] It is true that China's approach to humanitarian intervention, and to the use of force in the broader sense, is profoundly influenced by its position on the principle of sovereignty under the UN Charter.[45] A case in point is China's response to NATO's military intervention in Kosovo in 1999, during which it repeatedly stressed in the UN discussions that 'Kosovo is an inherent part of the territory of the former Yugoslavia',[46] and rendered external intervention, particular through the use of force, would amount to the 'internationalization of a domestic issue'.[47] From China's perspective, Serbia was defending its sovereignty against internal challenges, a position that China almost certainly viewed with sympathy given its own internal challenges to\n\n35Kimberley N Trapp, 'Can Non-State Actors Mount an Armed Attack?' in Marc Weller (ed), The Oxford Handbook of the Use of Force in International Law (Oxford University Press 2015).\n36UN GA, 'Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts', 2002, UN Doc.

China has also acquiesced in or actively supported a number of more limited humanitarian interventions, including in Haiti,⁴⁹ Somalia,⁵⁰ Bosnia,⁵¹ East Timor,⁵² etc. From these resolutions on humanitarian grounds for which China provided limited support, the Chinese government's essential requirements for humanitarian intervention have become increasingly clear, namely, authorization of Security Council and the consent of the host state.⁵³\n\nMeanwhile, China has demonstrated a significant shift in its position on sovereignty by accepting the basic tenets of the R2P. For example, the 2005 Position Paper includes the concept of R2P.⁵⁴ Yet it appears that China soon realized that it went too far.⁵⁵ Therefore, China changed its tune during the debates on the first UN General Assembly resolution on R2P in 2009, contending that the R2P remained 'a concept' and did not constitute 'a norm of international law'.⁵⁶ Furthermore, China warned that the implementation of R2P 'should not contravene the principle of state sovereignty and non-intervention in the internal affairs of States' and that the R2P should be prevented from 'becoming a kind of humanitarian intervention'.⁵⁷ Unlike some western states that focus on the third pillar of R2P, Responsibility to React, China attaches special weight to the other two pillars, i.e. Responsibility to Prevent and Responsibility to Rebuild,⁵⁸ which are the main reasons why R2P could be quickly accepted by those traditionally opposing humanitarian interventions at the 2005 World Summit.⁵⁹\n\nChina's position on R2P can be roughly analyzed by its shift of attitude from Libya to Syria in the voting and argumentation of Security Council resolutions.⁶⁰ China abstained from the voting on resolution 1973 (2011),⁶¹ and notably did not block the pass of this resolution although it has 'serious difficulty with parts of the resolution'.⁶² Three crucial aspects of this highly unusual, perhaps exceptional, confluence of factors is considered.⁶³ The first key factor that influenced international action in Libya was 'the clarity and immediacy of the threat to the civilian population'.⁶⁴ The second and most crucial factor that provided the impetus for military action in Libya was the presence of regional consensus on the need for external intervention.⁶⁵ The third important trigger was 'the defection of members of the Gaddafi government'.⁶⁶ However, China was concerned with the actual implementation of the Resolution 1973 by\n\n⁴⁸ Jonathan Davis, 'From Ideology to Pragmatism: China's Position on Humanitarian Intervention in the Post-Cold War Era' [2011] 44(2) Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law 217–283.\n⁴⁹ UN SC, 'Provisional Verbatim Record of the 3238th Meeting', 1993, UN Doc.S/PV.3238.\n⁵⁰ UN SC, 'Provisional Verbatim Record of the 3145th Meeting', 1992, UN Doc.S/PV.3145.\n⁵¹ UN SC, 'Security Council the 3461st Meeting', 1994, UN Doc.

    "NATO in its military operations in Libya. For instance, it stated that ‘we are not in favor of any arbitrary interpretation of the Council's resolutions or of any actions going beyond those mandated'. China believed that its lenient approach to Libya worsened the situation and does not want a repeat in Syria. Thus, three separate Western-supported draft resolutions proposing non-forcible measures against the Assad regime had been vetoed by Russia and China.\n\nTo sum up, China's attitude towards concepts such as humanitarian intervention and R2P, which revise the traditional principles of non-use of force and sovereignty, is no longer as rigid as it used to be. China's approach to the issue is case-by-case, shifting from an initially ideological focus to a more pragmatic approach.\n\n### The Restrictive Approach Revisited: Consistency and Rationale\n\nChina's position on the use of force in international law has remained remarkably consistent over the past half-century, reflecting its broader transition from an outsider to an active participant in the international legal order. Despite profound shifts in global politics and China's evolving role on the world stage, its restrictive interpretation of jus ad bellum has endured, with steadfast adherence to the principle of non-use of force and a high threshold for exceptions. As China's global influence expands, its legal stance on the use of force will become increasingly significant. China's foreign policy has evolved from a strategy of biding its time to ‘advancing towards the center of the world stage'. While its foreign policy has evolved—shifting emphasis toward sovereignty and non-intervention rather than an absolute prohibition on force—its foundational approach remains unchanged. Understanding the rationale behind this persistent restrictivism requires an analysis from three key dimensions: internal formation, external influence, and objective morality.\n\nOn the one hand, China's restrictive approach is partly endogenous, shaped by its philosophy, its tradition of self-restraint, and its post-strike military strategy. These internal factors have fostered a long-standing commitment to limiting the use of force as a means of conflict resolution. China, as a quintessential agrarian civilization, operates within a governance framework that is inherently inward-looking, prioritizing land cultivation, territorial integrity, resource stability, and self-sufficiency. This model fosters a worldview that emphasizes continuity, tradition, and social order, rather than external expansion or aggressive engagement with foreign entities. Unlike maritime civilizations, which historically pursued expansion through conquest and overseas dominance, agrarian economies do not rely on external plunder for economic development. As a result, China lacks the inherent impetus for territorial expansion and have no enduring tradition of long-distance military expeditions. Furthermore, agrarian civilizations often perceive interaction with the outside world as a potential risk rather than an opportunity, leading to policies characterized by controlled trade and strict border defense. A notable historical example is the construction of the Great Wall, which was designed not for expansion, but for defense against external incursions.\n\n1. 67 Hanqin Xue, Chinese Contemporary Perspectives on International Law: History, Culture and International Law (Martinus Nijhoff 2012).\n1. 68 UN SC, ‘Security Council, 66th Year: 6528th Meeting', 4 May 2011, UN Doc.

    "JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA\n\nIn addition, Confucian philosophy and historical military doctrines emphasize defensive wars and deterrence rather than preemptive aggression. Sima Law says that ‘though a country is now strong, bellicosity will lead to its ruin(国虽大, 好战必亡)’. For the surrounding ethnic groups, it has advocated ‘In practicing the rules of propriety, it is harmony that is prized(以和为贵, 以礼为固)’. Because of its self-perception as the superior state of China, it will hardly actively attack unless there is a threat to the tributary system and there is a need for restoration of peace. Even in its philosophy of war, China has always advocated ‘the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting(不战而屈人之兵)’. China possesses a defense-oriented strategy. It keeps to the stance that ‘we will not attack unless we are attacked, but we will surely counterattack if attacked’. Though met with debate, a typical example of this is China’s strategic posture regarding the nuclear weapons. In 1964, after its first nuclear test, China made the declaration that its nuclear development was solely for self-defence. China unconditionally committed itself to the non-use or threat of use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon States and to the non-first use of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances. Since its first National Defence White Paper in 1998, China has been adhering to the ‘principles of defense, self-defense and post-strike response’. This post-strike military position and its related philosophy of war have largely influenced China’s approach to the non-use of force.\n\nOn the other hand, the rationales for China's restrictive stance are partly exogenous, including China's decisive position in the Security Council and its options for minimizing risk in an anarchic international community. As one of the five permanent members, China bears a primary responsibility in ensuring international peace and security. China's advocacy on the dominant role of UN Security Council has closely related to its role as one of the permanent members, of which it has veto power. In this way, China can be sure that, at least under the framework of the United Nations, the Security Council will not make a resolution on the use of force to its disadvantage. Especially after witnessing the tragic consequences of unilateral military action and the abuse of the right to self-defense, China has affirmed that the restrictionist position is the best solution to safeguarding national interests, grounded in instrumental rationality and utilitarianism.\n\nAdditionally, morality and legitimacy play a crucial role. As a victim of war and the first country to sign the UN Charter, China sincerely and in good faith believes that the pursuit of peace is an objective that must never be compromised. The restrictive approach faithfully based on the UN Charter, objectively provides predictability in international behaviours and serves as a robust guarantee of international peace.\n\n# The Hesitating Power: Dilemmas Concerning the Application of Jus Ad Bellum in Cyberspace\n\nWith the process of de-sovereignty to re-sovereignty of cyberspace, the strategic significance of this domain is increasing annually, and the threats emanating from the cyberspace have profoundly impacted international relations.

    "decades, the discourse surrounding ‘cyber warfare' and the applicability of jus ad bellum in cyberspace has garnered considerable interest, particularly in the western world. In addition to advancements made under the UN, several countries have issued position papers outlining how international law applies to cyberspace through unilateral statements. All of these statements reference jus ad bellum in the context of cyberspace. Dozens of states have adopted the doctrine of scale and effects as criteria for determining what constitutes the use of force in cyberspace. Some have proposed progressive propositions such as anticipatory self-defense, cumulative self-defense, and self-defense against cyberattacks launched by non-state actors. At this critical juncture for clarifying and updating the rules, China appears to be in no rush to issue a unilateral declaration to clarify its position on the regulations governing the use of force in cyberspace.\n\nThe following discussion will unfold in three steps. First, the challenges posed by cyber operations to the existing framework of rules regarding the use of force will be elucidated. Second, China's stance on the law governing the use of force in cyberspace will be examined, along with an analysis of the considerations underlying China's general position in light of its domestic cyber strategy and the evolution of laws related to cyberspace. Finally, whether China's relevant stance in cyberspace would witness a historical shift from restrictionism to a more pragmatic flexibility will be explored.\n\n### The Challenges Posed by Cyber Operations to the Law on the Use of Force\n\nIt has to be acknowledged the international law regarding jus ad bellum per se is controversial within traditional physical domain. Cyberspace is often perceived as a homomorphic map of the physical domain, and this issue persists. In addition to the previously mentioned complexities, the unique characteristics of cyberspace further exacerbate the situation.\n\nFirstly, the application of cyber military technology has challenged modern theories of warfare. There exists a reciprocal relationship between military technology and theories of warfare. Cyberattacks no longer concentrate solely on the destruction of living forces and tangible assets, normally do not involve physical incursions into territory, and lack the apparent intensity and violence characteristic of kinetic warfare. This challenges fundamental assumptions regarding subject identification, real-world physical consequences, and civil-military distinctions. The damage caused by a cyberattack can be both tangible and intangible, including disruptions to financial markets, functional failures, and data loss. Furthermore, cyberattacks may be difficult for the victim states to detect. Additionally, the consequences of cyberattacks are often unpredictable and challenging to control. International law has yet to provide mature answers on how to evaluate intangible damages within the framework of jus ad bellum.\n\nSecondly, cyberattacks present dual challenges of technical and legal attribution. Due to the interconnectedness and anonymity of the cyberspace, attribution faces both technical and legal hurdles, raising questions about the object of the right to self-defense in cyberspace. States that conduct cyberattacks often intentionally evade accountability by employing proxy warfare or utilizing non-state actors as the actual perpetrators through outsourcing or contracting, thereby concealing their involvement. In notable cyberattacks that have garnered significant attention from the international community, such as the Estonian incident in 2007 and the Stuxnet in 2010, various clues have emerged, yet no country has ever acknowledged its participation. The existing legal framework for attribution, based on the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally",
    "Wrongful Acts, struggles to effectively address the complexities of attribution in cyberspace, leading to ongoing debates about whether the right to self-defense extends to non-state actors.\n\nThirdly, the asymmetric cost dynamics between offensive and defensive cyber operations have given rise to a bidirectional deterrence effect. At the same time, the limited effectiveness of ex-post defensive measures in mitigating the impact of cyberattacks has further weakened mutual trust among sovereign states, exacerbating tensions in the international cybersecurity landscape. This situation poses significant challenges regarding the timing and limitations of states' exercise of the right to self-defense. In contrast to traditional kinetic weapons, particularly nuclear arms, the costs associated with the creation, research, and production of cyber weapons are relatively low. Additionally, the expenses related to reproduction and replacement are more affordable. Countries with robust cyber capabilities often rely heavily on digital networks for governance and management, making them more vulnerable to cyberattacks—a phenomenon known as the ‘glass house dilemma'. Plus, the consequences inflicted by cyberattacks may be temporary or permanent, direct or indirect, tangible or intangible, and can even exceed the perpetrator's control. However, it is certain that the erosion of the victim state's authority and the diminishing trust of its citizens are inevitable outcomes. All of this underscores the reality that the costs of defending against and responding to cyberattacks—whether they are ongoing or have already concluded—can be substantial and disproportionate. Thus, it is challenging for states to determine when to respond and how to navigate the constraints of necessity and proportionality in their responses. In short, this is likely to lead to a generalization of the right to self-defense. Claims such as anticipatory self-defense and cumulative self-defense with response to cyber-attacks have begun to emerge, challenging the established legal framework of jus ad bellum.\n\nThe three challenges outlined above demonstrate that the military application of cyber technology poses significant difficulties for the existing framework governing the non-use of force. This situation is not putting old wine in a new bottle but highlights the urgent need for a collaborative response among states. Without such cooperation, certain cyber operations may remain ambiguous under international law due to unclear definitions. This ambiguity undermines the predictability of norms in cyberspace and threatens the long-term stability of the cyber environment.\n\n### China's Cautious Stance on the Use of Force in Cyberspace and Its Strategic Considerations\n\nChina's stance on the use of force in cyberspace remains conservative thus is prima facie consistent with its restrictive approach in physical domain. Without providing any substantive clarification on the operational level, China declared a firm attitude towards the peaceful use of cyberspace. It has stressed on many occasions that all countries should adhere to the principle of non-use of force enshrined in the UN Charter in the cyber context. For instance, the joint Sino-Russian proposal for an International Code of Conduct for Information Security in 2011 stated that ‘to settle any dispute resulting from the application of the code through peaceful means and to refrain from the threat or use of force'. In addition, the 2017 International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace clearly stipulated that ‘China is dedicated to promoting each party in effectively complying with the basic international relationship rules such as ... refraining from use or threat of force'. However, China has been vague about what defines the use of cyber force and the specific circumstances under which it may invoke the right to self-defense in response to cyberattacks.",
    "12 YUNG AND Z. SHI\n\nThis partially because of the resilience of the existing *jus ad bellum* rules. The rules governing the non-use of force are not meant to be domain-specific, as ICJ has opined that Articles 2(4) and 51 of the UN Charter regarding the prohibition on use of force and self-defence, respectively, apply to ‘any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed’.⁸⁹ From the point of view of effective interpretation, it is submitted that the system of laws and regulations on the non-use of force itself has resilience. Although the cyberspace is artificial, it is still closely related to the traditional domain, and the existing rules can be extended to apply to the cyberspace. Thus, there is no legal vacuum. In terms of cost, China’s (or any other states’) position cannot be completely divorced from the existing framework.\n\nCompared to Western countries, China is currently less inclined to express a definitive stance on this issue. It perceives a troubling trend in the discourse that emphasizes exceptions rather than fundamental principles, with some states attempting to lower the threshold for triggering the right to self-defence in cyberspace. Although China places significant importance on the peaceful use of cyberspace, it believes that excessive discussion regarding the right to resort to force—particularly in the name of self-defence—could have potential negative impact on international peace and security, aggravating an arms race and leading to the militarization of cyberspace.⁹⁰ Thus, the Chinese government is skeptical of the intense debate surrounding exceptions that justify the use of cyber force, contending that Western countries are cherry-picking on this issue. For example, China emphasized the ‘overemphasis on making exceptions for cyber warfare or self-defense, while the non-use of force principle has been marginalized’ and ‘the risk of sliding towards the militarization of cyberspace’.⁹¹ In its submission to the UN Open-ended Working Group, China stated that ‘state should focus on… refraining from the use or threat of use of force. Willful use of force… should be prevented. The applicability of… *jus ad bellum* needs to be handled with prudence’.⁹²\n\nIt should be admitted that most States now recognize, albeit to different degrees, that it is unhelpful to rely on the military paradigm as the first port of call when analyzing inter-state malicious cyber operations.⁹³ Yet the complexity of the disagreement on the application of *jus ad bellum* lies in the fact that the debate has been very much politicized, from a legal point of view, there does not seem to be a compelling reason why the existing *jus ad bellum* cannot be applied to cyberspace.\n\nChina’s principled caution does not indicate a lack of concern regarding the issue. On the contrary, as a latecomer to international law, China now has the opportunity to play a significant role in shaping international law in a field that is still in its formative stages. China exhibits ambivalence toward the relevant factors, opting to use non-legal reasoning to minimize excessive discussion and avoid making premature decisions.\n\nChina’s current restrictive stance on the use of force in cyberspace can be understood from several key perspectives. First, the unique characteristics of cyberspace indeed present challenges to the application of existing frameworks, resulting in significant legal uncertainty. Second, there is insufficient state practice and *opinio juris* to effectively test and verify whether a cyber action constitutes the use of force or an armed attack. Countries have not yet established what rules are generally accepted by the international community, or even what rules would be advantageous for their own interests. Therefore, making a definitive statement at this time may be premature. Thirdly, because of the digital divide related to cyber technology and the soft power of international law-making between China and Western countries, coupled with the growing concerns regarding the\n\n⁸⁹ Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, International Court of Justice, Advisory Opinion’ 1996 226.\n\n⁹⁰ Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization(AALCO), ‘Verbatim Record of the Fifty Fourth Annual Session’, 2015, Doc.

    "security of the global cyber environment, China is apprehensive about becoming a potential victim of cyberattacks and the generalization of self-defense, and concerns that it might lack sufficient influence to ensure that relevant rules are clarified fairly and appropriately. Just as China explained at the 2019 annual meeting of the Asian-African Legal Cooperation Organization, ‘given the “digital gap” between developing and the developed countries, developing countries in general will be in a disadvantaged position in the discussion and development of such rules, it will be difficult to ensure the rules are fair and equitable'. Nevertheless, as an emerging power seeking to influence the development of international law in cyberspace, China's principled official rhetoric regarding of the jus ad bellum in cyberspace may also serve a bargaining leverage in the formulation of international law regulating the use of cyber force.\n\nEven in the absence of detailed and specific legal rules governing cyber hostile acts in peacetime, states remain bound by three fundamental principles of international law, each carrying increasing normative weight: state sovereignty, non-intervention, and non-use of force. Therefore, China's cautious approach to the use of force in cyberspace stems not only from the aforementioned lack of established practice, strategic continuity, and tactical prudence, but also from a profound commitment to cyber sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention. From China's perspective, most—if not all—contemporary cyberattacks fall short of constituting a use of force and can be more appropriately addressed within the existing framework of cyber sovereignty and non-intervention.\n\nIn conclusion, it is reasonable to assume that China's restrictive approach to jus ad bellum could materially affect its position on when a cyberattack constitutes the use of force and under what circumstances the right of self-defense can be exercised against a cyberattack. As a typical proponent of multilateralism, China would certainly continue to firmly uphold the integrity and the authority of the UN, which function as the core of the international collective security mechanism. However, this does not imply that China's stance is inflexible and rigid. In light of the characteristics of cyberspace, where its position may evolve be examined.\n\n### Towards a More Pragmatic Chinese Approach to the Law on Use of Force in Cyberspace?\n\nWhile cyber operations present a triple challenge to the application of jus ad bellum, the extent to which these challenges are likely to influence China's approach to the law on the use of force in cyberspace is worth re-examining. The following will be discussed from four aspects: attribution, the object of exercising the right of self-defense, the threshold of use of force or armed attack, and the time and limitation of exercising the right of self-defense.\n\nThe difficulty of attribution due to anonymity in cyberspace can indeed lead to the erosion of international mutual trust, which has a negative impact on the overall cybersecurity. However, fundamentally, this is only a temporary technical obstacle, which will eventually be overcome with technological progress, or a corresponding international response mechanism will be established, so it does not constitute a fundamental subversion of the legal logic of attribution in international law. In addition, as an important element of state responsibility, if the attribution is arbitrarily changed because of the characteristics of a certain field, it will obviously do more harm than good to the maintenance of international order and the predictability of international norms. Therefore, it is unlikely that China will adjust its position on the challenge posed by cyber attribution to the law of the use of force.\n\nBased on the cognition of the issue of cyber attribution, China will most likely not change its restrictive position on whether the object of exercising the right of self-defense in cyberspace can be extended to non-state actors. Once attribution is resolved, responding to malicious cyberattacks by",
    "non-state actors becomes to a large extent a matter of combating cybercrime and international judicial cooperation, which does not necessarily involve the use of force issue, and it is also possible to seek the consent of the territorial State or invoke the principle of due diligence to involve the territorial State and transit State in the fight against cybercriminals or cyberterrorist organizations.\n\nGiven this, the real challenge lies in the means and methods of cyberattacks, which have fundamentally challenged the traditional theories of warfare. No longer solely focused on the destruction of living forces and physical assets, one significant consequence of cyberattacks is that they create certain confusion to defining the threshold for the use of force or armed attack. This confusion manifests both qualitatively and quantitatively. From a qualitative perspective, the damage caused by cyberattacks can have both physical and non-physical consequences. The current ‘consequence-based' standard proposed by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations is indeed reasonable in this context. When physical consequences can be explained by analogy, it becomes easier to determine whether a cyber operation meets the threshold for the use of force or armed attack. However, this framework struggles to adequately assess cyberattacks that lack physical consequences. Some scholars have argued that disruptive cyber operations may fall under the scope of Article 2(4) if the resulting disruption is ‘significant enough to affect state security', but this interpretation is inherently arbitrary. A more radical interpretation expands the definition of the use of force to include non-destructive cyber operations against critical national infrastructure. However, this ‘target-based' interpretation excessively broadens the threshold, which is not conducive to maintaining peace and security. It also undermines the applicability and integrity of the principles of cyber sovereignty and non-intervention. On the quantitative side, the challenge is more pronounced in defining damage. Non-physical damage is particularly difficult to quantify objectively, and measuring the direct and indirect impacts of cyberattacks presents a complex issue. If the definition of damage cannot be accurately established, how can we ensure that the requirements of necessity and proportionality in the right of self-defense are fulfilled in good faith? In this context, a shift from consequence-based to a convergence of consequence-based, goal-based and function-based criteria is not unacceptable to China.\n\nBeyond the question of what constitutes the threshold for the use of force, another potential turning point is that the post-attack response is unlikely to be satisfactory. The ineffectiveness of ex-post defense will challenge the temporal requirements for exercising the self-defense. Due to the asymmetric costs associated with cyber offence and defense, the victim country not only faces the burden of implementing general defense measures at a high cost but may also have to endure significant expenses with minimal success in its ex-post response. Therefore, it raises the question of whether it is feasible to flexibly adjust the timing of self-defense against armed cyber-attacks. While the wording of the UN Charter advocates for ex-post defense, there may be room for broader interpretation within customary international law.\n\nChina has yet to comment on the issue, but it will need to do so sooner or later. As China's cyber capabilities expand globally, so do its overseas interests that require protection, which may lead China to adopt a more open stance on the jus ad bellum. On April 2024, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has set up three new arms, the Aerospace Force, Cyberspace Force, and Information Support Force to serve alongside the existing Joint Logistics Support Force. In the short term, it is highly unlikely that China will issue unilateral statements to clarify its detailed position on the use of force in cyberspace. However, should such a statement be made, it will likely address the use of force",
    "and the right to self-defense. To date, no state that has issued such a statement has overlooked this issue. Even if China were to make a unilateral declaration regarding the applicability of international law in cyberspace, it is improbable that it would elaborate beyond affirming the prohibition on the use of force. More pragmatically, China's approach to the use of force in cyberspace is likely to be reflected in its responses to individual cyber incidents or operations, as well as in discussions within the UN framework. Just as mentioned in the 2005 Position Paper “given the varying causes and nature of crises, it is both unrealistic and hugely controversial to formulate a one-fits-all rule or criterion on the use of force. Whether to use force or not should be decided by the Security Council in light of the reality of cyber incidents on a case-by-case basis. It remains to be seen whether adaptation will be made by China to the application of specific rules in cyberspace, such as ease up on the right of anticipatory self-defence or endorse a convergence of consequence-based, goal-based and function-based approach on determine the use of force.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis article elaborates on China's position regarding the jus ad bellum by examining its state practices and official statements. It also explores the extent to which China's approach in the emerging domain of cyberspace may be influenced by, or differ from, its traditional stance. The rationales for China's restrictive stance are partly endogenous, determined primarily by China's philosophy of war and its military strategy of self-restraint, and partly exogenous, including China's decisive position in the UN Security Council and its options for minimizing risk in an anarchic international community.\n\nChina's conservative stance will most likely continue in cyberspace, but it also faces a dilemma. On the one hand, international lawmaking in cyberspace is under way, and China is finally no longer the rule-taker but a rule-maker. It certainly wants to play a more substantive role and not miss the opportunity. As a potential victim of cyberattacks, it certainly wants to preserve and clarify the right to response against perpetrators, and sticking to rigid traditional positions may not be helpful in protecting national interests, including an increasing number of overseas interests. On the other hand, if the relevant restrictive interpretation is adjusted, the relevant rules may be abused and misinterpreted at will. In the overall unfriendly environment and the situation where, Chinese discourse is not dominant, Chinese legal and natural persons may be subjected to cyber attacks in the name of the right to self-defense, which may further deteriorate international relations in cyberspace. In this sense, China would basically maintain the ‘wait and see' approach regarding the jus ad bellum in cyberspace and continue its overall restrictive understanding of the relevant rules in cyberspace, however, facing the increasing frequency of cyber-attacks, the possibility that China would adopt a more flexible understanding of some specific rules cannot be completely ruled out.\n\nOur grateful thanks to the Editor and three anonymous reviewers for the journal for their astute comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.\n\n## Disclosure Statement\n\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s)."

    "abstract": "China's restrictive approach to the use of force is primarily reflected in its emphasis on the central role of the Security Council, the strict interpretation of the temporal and target requirements of self-defence, and skepticism regarding the use of force outside the UN framework. The rationale for China's restrictive stance is partly endogenous, determined primarily by its philosophy and military strategy of self-restraint, and partly exogenous, influenced by its decisive position in the Security Council. The challenges posed by cyber operations to the use of force are mainly evident in the difficulties of attribution, the evolving means, aims, and effects of cyber-warfare, and the legal ambiguities arising from the asymmetry of offensive and defensive costs. China's stance in cyberspace will be significantly affected by its traditional approach, which stems from the resilience of established rules, strategic inheritance, and tactical cautiousness.",
