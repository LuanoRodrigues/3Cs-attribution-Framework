The application of warfare is certainly no exception to this development. Both state and non-state actors are busy devising new ways of applying technology to carry out attacks on their adversaries, or prevent their adversaries from successfully attacking them. In the past, technology has been used merely to augment or improve the performance or capabilities of traditional military weapons and tools. However, with the increasing level of interconnected devices, attacks that operate purely through digital mediums are becoming increasingly effective.\n\nTraditionally, International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and the Laws of Armed Conflict (LOAC) have focused on the regulation and governance of kinetic, physical operations. The prospect of significant attacks being carried out through purely electronic means would have been pure fantasy a generation ago, and would not have been envisioned when IHL and LOAC were being developed. The traditional categorization of conflict and of participant action is stretched when applied beyond the physical world. It is the difficulty in categorizing participant action that must be addressed in order to ensure the protections that have been applied in historic conflicts are capable of being applied in the conflicts of the future.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039",

This paper will not be addressing the use of cyberwarfare techniques as a part of a larger traditional kinetic war; rather the main focus will remain on how a cyber attack can be classified in the absence of traditional warfare operations. As a part of the examination of the classification of cyber attacks, this paper will address whether existing IHL and LOAC are sufficient to meet the challenges of the future digital battlefield, or whether a new approach is required.\n\n## Background\n\n### Defining cyber attacks\n\nTo understand cyber attacks one must notionally understand the medium that it describes. \"Cyberspace\" is a term that originated from science fiction, and today commonly refers to the Internet, or the World Wide Web.¹ While Cyberspace typically is used in reference to the publicly accessible Internet with which the public is familiar, it could also apply to many of the private networks which organizations and governments operate.

Taking into account the various definitions and views, for the purpose of this article a cyber attack will refer to “the use of electronic techniques by a state actor to conduct operations through cyberspace with the objective of causing harm to the interests of another state”.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039",

One particular story that has received a fair amount of press in recent years relates to a Soviet pipeline explosion which occurred in June of 1982. It is alleged that Soviet spies had stolen a computer-control system from a Canadian firm, but unbeknownst to the Soviets, the CIA knew about their plans, and had inserted a \"logic bomb\" into the code of the control system. The system malfunctioned, allowing unsafe operating conditions to develop unchecked, resulting in a massive explosion that apparently was registered by western satellites.⁵ It should be noted however, that Vasily Pchelintsev, the former KGB head of the region, has denied this account.⁶ As with many accounts from that period of time exact details remain contentious.\n\n⁵ \"War in the fifth domain; cyberwar\" The Economist (3 July 2010). online: Proquest <http: 578452939?accountid=\"10406\" ezproxy.library.dal.ca=\"\" login?url=\"http://search.proquest.com/docview\">\n⁶ Thomas Rid, \"Think Again: Cyberwar\" Foreign Policy (March/April 2012), online: Think Again: <http: 02=\"\" 2012=\"\" 27=\"\" articles=\"\" cyberwar=\"\" www.foreignpolicy.com=\"\">\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039</http:></http:>",

On April 27, 2007 a series of significant cyber attacks hit Estonian web servers, focusing on banks, government organizations, and media. While it was a significant attack in terms of the effect (knocking out most significant Estonian based websites) it was actually a fairly simple attack, known as distributed denial of service, whereby the sites were basically flooded with requests, making it impossible for them to respond to legitimate users.⁷\n\nMembers of the Estonian government blamed Russia for the attacks, something Russia denied. To this day it is still unclear who actually perpetrated the attacks. Tracing of some of the network traffic led to Russian IP addresses; however, that unfortunately is not always conclusive, and does not necessarily point to the ultimate origin of the attack.⁸ Whether it was Russian government actors, or simply private citizens is still a question of great debate. Actually conclusively attributing the attack to a particular state actor has proven exceedingly difficult for Estonia, a theme that will be explored further in this article.\n\n⁷ “Estonia looks to cyber defence, after attacks”, Communications Engineer 5:4 (2007) 3, online <http: ieeexplore.ieee.org=\"\" stamp=\"\" stamp.jsp?tp=\"&amp;arnumber=4444805\">⁸ Ibid.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039</http:>",

Unlike most computer malware Stuxnet was designed neither to provide illicit access, nor to steal information. Instead of targeting credit card information or banking information as is usual amongst malware, Stuxnet searched for a very specific operating environment when it infected a machine, and would actually shut itself down if it did not find the correct conditions.⁹\n\nOnce the worm found the proper set of conditions were present on the network that it infected, it would push out changes to a device which controlled pieces of industrial machinery, altering the operating conditions of the machinery, periodically speeding up or slowing the ordinary operating speed of attached motors. The worm even went so far as to record what the ordinary operating conditions were, and spoof that data back to operators, so they would not realize anything was amiss.¹⁰\n\nBased on the conditions and the hardware that the worm searched for it has been widely speculated that Iranian nuclear facilities were the target of the attack, more specifically the Bushehr nuclear power plant as well as the Natanz uranium enrichment facility.

The matter before the court involved an incident between elements of the British Royal Navy and Albania. After a series of incidents in the channel, which was within Albanian territorial waters, but which was claimed as an area of free passage by the British, Britain sent four warships through the channel, two of which struck mines laid by the Albanians. The ICJ ultimately found that by sending warships into Albanian territorial waters Britain did violate international law, but the mere fact that the warships were readied to attack did not constitute use of force. In this case the court took a fairly narrow view of the interpretation of use of force, and allowed demonstration of force, and preparation to defend, as not falling under the ambit of use of force.¹⁷\n\nThe manner in which Article 2(4) was written and developed also provides guidance on what should be considered force and what should not. During the drafting of what would become Article 2(4) a number of nations proposed alternate phrasing that would have likely resulted in a more expansive definition.\n\n¹⁶ Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania), [1949] ICJ Rep 244.\n¹⁷ Stanimir A.

The fact that more expansive definitions that explicitly included alternate forms of force were rejected is illustrative, and supports a more narrow reading of Article 2(4).\n\nIt seems then, when considering different types of force, political, economic, and armed, only the last can be considered to be sufficient to trigger Article 2(4). Based on the above, there appears to be two approaches to having a cyber attack be sufficient to trigger Article 2(4). One could advocate an expansion of the interpretation of the section to include cyber force, taking into account that expansions have been rejected before. Alternatively, Article 2(4) could be addressed by having a cyber attack be included under the armed force already prohibited.¹⁹\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039",

What this means is that simply getting “in the door” under Article 2(4) does not necessarily allow a state access to the remedies provided by Article 51. Violation of Article 2(4) might declare an attack illegal, but it does not automatically engage Article 51. This paper is primarily concerned with the ability of a state to defend itself, so focus will be placed largely upon when a cyber attack should be elevated to the level of an armed attack under Article 51.\n\nWhen considering the language differences between Article 2(4) and Article 51 in the cyber context, one possible difficulty immediately comes to the forefront. The wording \"use of force\" in Article 2(4) leaves itself open to interpretation regarding what kind of force could qualify, whereas the use of \"armed force\" in Article 51 does suggest a substantially narrower approach.²² Article 51 was clearly designed with traditional kinetic operations in mind; this is understandable, as the technological developments which have led to the issue of military cyber attacks are a recent phenomenon.\n\n²¹ Michael N Schmitt, “Cyber Operations in International Law: The Use of Force, Collective Security, Self-Defense, and Armed Conflicts” in Committee on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options, eds, Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for U.S. Policy (Washington: The National Academies Press, 2010) 151 at 163.\n²² Ibid.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039",

Instead of focusing on the medium, attention must turn to the effect. International law scholar Michael Schmitt³³ has proposed the following loose test with the aim of distinguishing political or economic pressure from armed force:\n\n1) Severity: Armed attacks threaten physical injury or destruction of property to a much greater degree than other forms of coercion. Physical well-being usually occupies the apex of the human hierarchy of need.\n\n2) Immediacy: The negative consequences of armed coercion, or threat thereof, usually occur with great immediacy, while those of other forms of coercion develop more slowly. Thus, the opportunity for the target state or the international community to seek peaceful accommodation is hampered in the former case.\n\n3) Directness: The consequences of armed coercion are more directly tied to the actus reus than in other forms of\n\n³³ See http://www.usnwc.edu/Academics/Faculty/Michael-Schmitt.aspx\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039",

As a result, even though armed and economic acts may have roughly similar consequences, the former represents a greater intrusion on the rights of the target state and, therefore, is more likely to disrupt international stability.\n\n5) Measurability: While the consequences of armed coercion are usually easy to ascertain (e.g., a certain level of destruction), the actual negative consequences of other forms of coercion are harder to measure. This fact renders the appropriateness of community condemnation, and the degree of vehemence contained therein, less suspect in the case of armed force.\n\n6) Presumptive Legitimacy: In most cases, whether under domestic or international law, the application of violence is\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039",

By measuring the consequence of a cyber attack against these characteristics one would theoretically be able to distinguish between what should be considered a use of armed force and what should be left to other domestic or international law provisions.

One issue raised by Matthew Hoisington applies to the final factor to be considered, presumptive legitimacy. He points out that determining whether the attack is legitimate under international law by asking whether the attack was legitimate, is essentially putting the cart before the horse.³⁵ Additionally, Hoisington turns to the attribution issue addressed above, pointing out that unlike a traditional kinetic attack, the ultimate consequence of an cyber attack may be difficult to ascertain immediately afterwards. This will present a problem in determining the permitted response under international law, a deficiency that will likely plague most approaches that designed to be used after an attack.³⁶\n\nA quick consequence-based analysis of a cyber attack will likely catch the so called \"low hanging fruit\", attacks that closely resemble traditional military attacks. Cyber attacks that directly target devices which immediately cause death, injury, damage or destruction which is clearly identifiable by the victim do not present significant categorization challenges, but unfortunately an attack will not necessarily be confined to these black and white situations.\n\n³⁵ Supra note 24.\n³⁶ Ibid\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039",

We are left asking, how far down the chain of causation must we go when assessing an attack?\n\nTo address the unique issues that cyber attacks present with regards to assessment, Hoisington advocates for a presumptive exception to be created for states that have been the victim of a cyber attack. His proposal would create protection under international law for a state that acts in good faith to respond to a cyber attack, bypassing the need to properly attribute and characterise the attack. This would result in a loosening of the requirements to the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter. To constrain the expansion of the Article 51 right Hoisington would have nations decide on a separate categorization of critical national infrastructure that, if attacked, would trigger the aforementioned protection.³⁷\n\nHoisington's approach seems to run contrary to the spirit of Article 51, and international humanitarian law in general.

In the case of determining whether death, injury, damage, or destruction can be tied to a cyber attack it seems reasonable to consider whether the attack represented a \"substantial and integral cause of the injury suffered\".\n\nUse of a modified version of Schmitt's test42 presents an attractive first step:\n\n1) Severity: Consequences must rise to the level of death, injury, damage, or destruction.\n2) Causation: The damages suffered which meet the first step must be considered substantially and integrally connected to the attack.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039",

The application of warfare is certainly no exception to this development. Both state and non-state actors are busy devising new ways of applying technology to carry out attacks on their adversaries, or prevent their adversaries from successfully attacking them. In the past, technology has been used merely to augment or improve the performance or capabilities of traditional military weapons and tools. However, with the increasing level of interconnected devices, attacks that operate purely through digital mediums are becoming increasingly effective.\nTraditionally, International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and the Laws of Armed Conflict (LOAC) have focused on the regulation and governance of kinetic, physical operations. The prospect of significant attacks being carried out through purely electronic means would have been pure fantasy a generation ago, and would not have been envisioned when IHL and LOAC were being developed. The traditional categorization of conflict and of participant action is stretched when applied beyond the physical world. It is the difficulty in categorizing participant action that must be addressed in order to ensure the protections that have been applied in historic conflicts are capable of being applied in the conflicts of the future.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nThis paper will address the question of how a purely electronic event or operation should be evaluated under existing legal paradigms, more specifically, how a state may go about assessing and properly responding to a cyber attack. This paper will not be addressing the use of cyberwarfare techniques as a part of a larger traditional kinetic war; rather the main focus will remain on how a cyber attack can be classified in the absence of traditional warfare operations. As a part of the examination of the classification of cyber attacks, this paper will address whether existing IHL and LOAC are sufficient to meet the challenges of the future digital battlefield, or whether a new approach is required.\n## Background\n### Defining cyber attacks\nTo understand cyber attacks one must notionally understand the medium that it describes. \"Cyberspace\" is a term that originated from science fiction, and today commonly refers to the Internet, or the World Wide Web.¹ While Cyberspace typically is used in reference to the publicly accessible Internet with which the public is familiar, it could also apply to many of the private networks which organizations and governments operate. The US Department of Defence have defined cyberspace as a \"global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer\n¹ Bradley Raboin, \"Corresponding Evolution: International Law and the Emergence of Cyber Warfare\", 31 J Nat'l Ass'n L Jud 602 at 607.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nsystems, and embedded processors and controllers.\"² There are a variety of other definitions that choose different means and wording to ultimately define cyberspace as being a vast network of interconnected computer and telecommunications devices.\nMoving on to cyber attacks specifically, the US Department of Defence defines “cyber operations” in this context as being \"the employment of cyber capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve military objectives or effects in or through cyberspace\".³ Additionally, they define a “computer network attack” as being \"actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves\".⁴ Given that this paper will be addressing cyber attacks that have the possibility of causing harm to more than electronic targets the latter definition will not be sufficient. Taking into account the various definitions and views, for the purpose of this article a cyber attack will refer to “the use of electronic techniques by a state actor to conduct operations through cyberspace with the objective of causing harm to the interests of another state”.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n# A brief history of cyber attacks\n## Pipeline sabotage\nWhile cyber conflict is a relatively new concept in its current form of network intrusions and remote attacks, states have been looking to use digital mediums to stage and carry out attacks going back to at least the cold war era. One particular story that has received a fair amount of press in recent years relates to a Soviet pipeline explosion which occurred in June of 1982. It is alleged that Soviet spies had stolen a computer-control system from a Canadian firm, but unbeknownst to the Soviets, the CIA knew about their plans, and had inserted a \"logic bomb\" into the code of the control system. The system malfunctioned, allowing unsafe operating conditions to develop unchecked, resulting in a massive explosion that apparently was registered by western satellites.⁵ It should be noted however, that Vasily Pchelintsev, the former KGB head of the region, has denied this account.⁶ As with many accounts from that period of time exact details remain contentious.\n⁵ \"War in the fifth domain; cyberwar\" The Economist (3 July 2010). online: Proquest <http: 578452939?accountid=\"10406\" ezproxy.library.dal.ca=\"\" login?url=\"http://search.proquest.com/docview\">\n⁶ Thomas Rid, \"Think Again: Cyberwar\" Foreign Policy (March/April 2012), online: Think Again: <http: 02=\"\" 2012=\"\" 27=\"\" articles=\"\" cyberwar=\"\" www.foreignpolicy.com=\"\">\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039</http:></http:>\n# 2007 Attacks on Estonia\nIn 2007, Estonia was planning on moving a WWII-era Russian grave, much to the chagrin of Russia and the Russian people. On April 27, 2007 a series of significant cyber attacks hit Estonian web servers, focusing on banks, government organizations, and media. While it was a significant attack in terms of the effect (knocking out most significant Estonian based websites) it was actually a fairly simple attack, known as distributed denial of service, whereby the sites were basically flooded with requests, making it impossible for them to respond to legitimate users.⁷\nMembers of the Estonian government blamed Russia for the attacks, something Russia denied. To this day it is still unclear who actually perpetrated the attacks. Tracing of some of the network traffic led to Russian IP addresses; however, that unfortunately is not always conclusive, and does not necessarily point to the ultimate origin of the attack.⁸ Whether it was Russian government actors, or simply private citizens is still a question of great debate. Actually conclusively attributing the attack to a particular state actor has proven exceedingly difficult for Estonia, a theme that will be explored further in this article.\n⁷ “Estonia looks to cyber defence, after attacks”, Communications Engineer 5:4 (2007) 3, online <http: ieeexplore.ieee.org=\"\" stamp=\"\" stamp.jsp?tp=\"&amp;arnumber=4444805\">⁸ Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039</http:>\n# Stuxnet\nStuxnet may very well represent an evolution in cyberwarfare. The name Stuxnet refers to a computer worm that was discovered in June of 2010. Unlike most computer malware Stuxnet was designed neither to provide illicit access, nor to steal information. Instead of targeting credit card information or banking information as is usual amongst malware, Stuxnet searched for a very specific operating environment when it infected a machine, and would actually shut itself down if it did not find the correct conditions.⁹\nOnce the worm found the proper set of conditions were present on the network that it infected, it would push out changes to a device which controlled pieces of industrial machinery, altering the operating conditions of the machinery, periodically speeding up or slowing the ordinary operating speed of attached motors. The worm even went so far as to record what the ordinary operating conditions were, and spoof that data back to operators, so they would not realize anything was amiss.¹⁰\nBased on the conditions and the hardware that the worm searched for it has been widely speculated that Iranian nuclear facilities were the target of the attack, more specifically the Bushehr nuclear power plant as well as the Natanz uranium enrichment facility. The level of complexity that was present in the\n⁹ Parliamentary Information and Research Service, The Stuxnet Worm: Just Another Computer Attack or a Game Changer? by Holly Porteous (Ottawa: Library of Parliament, October 2010) at 1.\n¹⁰ Ibid at 2.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nStuxnet worm has led researchers to conclude that the most likely originators of the attack would have been a State actor. The fact that Stuxnet was designed to minimize the collateral damage, whereas malware traditionally targets the widest group possible, adds credence to this assertion. Given the politics, as well as attributes found in the worm, blame has largely been levelled on Israel and the United States.¹¹\n## The current paradigm\n## Article 2(4)\nGenerally speaking, under international law a military attack is prima facie illegal¹², subject to acts of self-defence¹³ or by authorization of the UN¹⁴. The UN Charter defines this prohibition as being:\n4. All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.¹⁵ (emphasis added)\n¹¹ Ibid.\n¹² Charter of the United Nations, 26 June 1945, Can TS 1945 No 7 2(4), Article 2(4).\n¹³ Ibid Article 51.\n¹⁴ Ibid Chapter VII.\n¹⁵ Supra note 12.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nClearly, the salient question becomes “what constitutes a use of force?” To better examine this question one must first consider what has previously been considered to be a use of force, and how those determinations have been made.\nIn 1947 the International Court of Justice (ICJ) had the opportunity to lend guidance on the interpretation of Article 2(4) in the Corfu Channel¹⁶ case. The matter before the court involved an incident between elements of the British Royal Navy and Albania. After a series of incidents in the channel, which was within Albanian territorial waters, but which was claimed as an area of free passage by the British, Britain sent four warships through the channel, two of which struck mines laid by the Albanians. The ICJ ultimately found that by sending warships into Albanian territorial waters Britain did violate international law, but the mere fact that the warships were readied to attack did not constitute use of force. In this case the court took a fairly narrow view of the interpretation of use of force, and allowed demonstration of force, and preparation to defend, as not falling under the ambit of use of force.¹⁷\nThe manner in which Article 2(4) was written and developed also provides guidance on what should be considered force and what should not. During the drafting of what would become Article 2(4) a number of nations proposed alternate phrasing that would have likely resulted in a more expansive definition.\n¹⁶ Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania), [1949] ICJ Rep 244.\n¹⁷ Stanimir A. Alexandrov, Self-defense against the use of force in international law (Boston: Kluwer Law International 1996) at 124.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nIran proposed that direct and indirect political pressure be banned, and Brazil suggested that threats of force, and economic pressure be explicitly included as well.¹⁸ All of these suggestions were ultimately voted down, with the current form eventually being settled on. The fact that more expansive definitions that explicitly included alternate forms of force were rejected is illustrative, and supports a more narrow reading of Article 2(4).\nIt seems then, when considering different types of force, political, economic, and armed, only the last can be considered to be sufficient to trigger Article 2(4). Based on the above, there appears to be two approaches to having a cyber attack be sufficient to trigger Article 2(4). One could advocate an expansion of the interpretation of the section to include cyber force, taking into account that expansions have been rejected before. Alternatively, Article 2(4) could be addressed by having a cyber attack be included under the armed force already prohibited.¹⁹\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n# Article 51\nArticle 51 provides for a state's right to self-defence under international law:\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.²⁰\nIt is important to recognize the relationship between Article 51 and Article 2(4). Article 51 gives the right to self-defence when an armed attack is perpetrated against a nation, and Article 2(4) declares that a use of force will be considered illegal, with the jurisprudence focusing on an armed attack. It follows that any armed attack will be considered a use of force under Article 2(4) and therefore\n²⁰ Supra note 13.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nprima facie illegal. However, it does not follow that any attack rising to the level of a use of force under Article 2(4) will necessarily be considered to be an armed attack under Article 51.²¹ The way the provisions have been interpreted, an armed attack between the two are not necessarily the same, there is a gap between what is covered by Article 51, and what is covered by Article 2(4). What this means is that simply getting “in the door” under Article 2(4) does not necessarily allow a state access to the remedies provided by Article 51. Violation of Article 2(4) might declare an attack illegal, but it does not automatically engage Article 51. This paper is primarily concerned with the ability of a state to defend itself, so focus will be placed largely upon when a cyber attack should be elevated to the level of an armed attack under Article 51.\nWhen considering the language differences between Article 2(4) and Article 51 in the cyber context, one possible difficulty immediately comes to the forefront. The wording \"use of force\" in Article 2(4) leaves itself open to interpretation regarding what kind of force could qualify, whereas the use of \"armed force\" in Article 51 does suggest a substantially narrower approach.²² Article 51 was clearly designed with traditional kinetic operations in mind; this is understandable, as the technological developments which have led to the issue of military cyber attacks are a recent phenomenon.\n²¹ Michael N Schmitt, “Cyber Operations in International Law: The Use of Force, Collective Security, Self-Defense, and Armed Conflicts” in Committee on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options, eds, Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for U.S. Policy (Washington: The National Academies Press, 2010) 151 at 163.\n²² Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nIn order to have a cyber attack qualify under this approach then, it appears as though one must assess the consequences of the attack, and compare them to what consequences have traditionally triggered self-defence rights. Analysis of past events has shown that generally death, injury, damage, or destruction has been required to meet the armed attack threshold.²³\nOnce an armed attack is encountered and Article 51 is engaged any response needs to meet certain conditions in order to be considered legitimate; necessity, proportionality, and immediacy.²⁴ Matthew Hoisington sets out the details as being:\nTo fulfil the principle of necessity the state must attribute the attack to a specific source, characterize the intent behind the attack, and conclude that the state must use force in response. The principle of proportionality requires that the force used in the response be proportional to the original attack. The requirement of immediacy prohibits a response from occurring after too much time has passed. With regard to immediacy as a general criterion, however, no\n²³ Ibid at 164.\n²⁴ Matthew Hoisington, “Cyberwarfare and the Use of Force Giving Rise to the Right of Self-Defense” (2009) 32:2 Boston College International &amp; Comparative Law Review 439 at 452.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nrequirement exists for defensive action to be exercised (or risk forfeiture), immediately following an armed attack.²⁵\nThe ability of a state to assess what response is proportional, and respond within an appropriate timeframe flows from its ability to properly attribute and characterise an attack. Attribution in particular is a different kind of animal in the cyber context.\n## Attribution Issues\nAttribution, meaning how the responsibility for an attack is attached to a particular state²⁶ presents a number of novel considerations when operating within the cyber context. Attribution is necessary in order to trigger the entitlement of a responding state to answer with countermeasures against the offending state.²⁷ In the cyber context attribution immediately rises to the forefront of issues presented. In a global interconnected network such as the internet, attacks can be launched from anywhere. The internet itself consists of distributed nodes, and traffic does not follow a straight-line pattern, network traffic can be\n²⁵ Ibid.\n²⁶ Levi Grosswald, “Cyberattack Attribution Matters under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter” (2011) 36 Brook J Int'l L 1153 at 1153.\n²⁷ Jorn Griebel &amp; Milan Plucken, “New Developments Regarding the Rules of Attribution? The International Court of Justice's Decision in Bosnia v Serbia” (2008) 21 Leiden Journal of International Law 601 at 604.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nsent on more circuitous routes²⁸, which do not conform to geographic lines or patterns.\nThe distributed nature of the makeup and structure of the internet which leads to the circuitous nature of online traffic, can be exploited to mask the activities, and the origin, by those who possess the requisite skill and knowledge. It is not as simple as tracing an attack step by step back to the beginning, as attackers are able to use compromised servers and personal computers as launching points²⁹, often without the victim being aware that their system has been hijacked. Using strategies such as this it is clearly possible for blame to be levied where it is undeserved. An attack could be traced back to servers located in China, but that does not necessarily mean that the attack originated in China. The cyber traffic could still have crisscrossed the globe multiple times before finally arriving at the ultimate origin point. In fact, this obfuscation of network traffic could be used as a kind of \"false flag\", designed to trick the victim into believing their attacker was a third party.³⁰ Deliberately spreading the seeds of false information is certainly within the ambit of global politics and espionage.\nSifting through the misinformation and obfuscation requires a time intensive investigation. Compromised servers need to be accessed and\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n28 L Subramanian, V N Padmanabhan, &amp; R H Katz, “Geographic Properties of Internet Routing” (Paper delivered at the USENIX Technical Conference, Monterey, CA, USA, 2002), online: <http: en-us=\"\" pages=\"\" padmanab=\"\" papers=\"\" research.microsoft.com=\"\" usenix2002.pdf=\"\">\n29 Supra note 26 at 1167.\n30 Ibid at 1169.\n14</http:>\nexamined to determine the next traffic path that needs to be followed. Simply accessing the compromised systems could be a challenge in and of itself. Depending on where the hijacked servers are located a state may be unable to obtain physical access, and may have to rely on compromising the systems themselves in order to conduct a proper forensic analysis. Without a full and thorough investigation of this type actual attribution is impossible, as a preliminary analysis could only reasonably provide a conclusion based on inferences and best guesses.³¹\n## Characterization issues\nThe ability to assess an appropriate and proportional response is a vital part of the Article 51 evaluation. In order to craft a proportional response a state first needs to know what the attack actually consisted of. Many of the factors that are considered by states in the event of a kinetic attack may be difficult or completely impossible to fully understand in the immediate aftermath of a cyber attack.³² Simply characterizing the event as an attack in the state versus state sense, as opposed to a criminal or terrorist attack is extremely difficult in the absence of physical indicators that can be used in traditional cases.\n³¹ Ibid.\n³² Ibid at 1170.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n# Inclusion under armed force\nTo consider inclusion of cyber attacks under armed force a different categorization model needs to be used. Instead of focusing on the medium, attention must turn to the effect. International law scholar Michael Schmitt³³ has proposed the following loose test with the aim of distinguishing political or economic pressure from armed force:\n1) Severity: Armed attacks threaten physical injury or destruction of property to a much greater degree than other forms of coercion. Physical well-being usually occupies the apex of the human hierarchy of need.\n2) Immediacy: The negative consequences of armed coercion, or threat thereof, usually occur with great immediacy, while those of other forms of coercion develop more slowly. Thus, the opportunity for the target state or the international community to seek peaceful accommodation is hampered in the former case.\n3) Directness: The consequences of armed coercion are more directly tied to the actus reus than in other forms of\n³³ See http://www.usnwc.edu/Academics/Faculty/Michael-Schmitt.aspx\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\ncoercion, which often depend on numerous contributory factors to operate. Thus, the prohibition on force precludes negative consequences with greater certainty.\n4) Invasiveness: In armed coercion, the act causing the harm usually crosses into the target state, whereas in economic warfare the acts generally occur beyond the target's borders. As a result, even though armed and economic acts may have roughly similar consequences, the former represents a greater intrusion on the rights of the target state and, therefore, is more likely to disrupt international stability.\n5) Measurability: While the consequences of armed coercion are usually easy to ascertain (e.g., a certain level of destruction), the actual negative consequences of other forms of coercion are harder to measure. This fact renders the appropriateness of community condemnation, and the degree of vehemence contained therein, less suspect in the case of armed force.\n6) Presumptive Legitimacy: In most cases, whether under domestic or international law, the application of violence is\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\ndeemed illegitimate absent some specific exception such as self-defence. The cognitive approach is prohibitory. By contrast, most other forms of coercion—again in the domestic and international sphere—are presumptively lawful, absent a prohibition to the contrary. The cognitive approach is permissive. Thus, the consequences of armed coercion are presumptively impermissible, whereas those of other coercive acts are not (as a very generalized rule).³⁴\nThe goal of Schmitt's test is to develop a set of characteristics that will be found in a typical use of armed force. By measuring the consequence of a cyber attack against these characteristics one would theoretically be able to distinguish between what should be considered a use of armed force and what should be left to other domestic or international law provisions. Ultimately, the idea is that there will be no difference between a kinetic attack that brings down an airplane, or a cyber attack that does the same, the consequences of the attack are the same, regardless of the medium chosen.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n³⁴ Michael Schmitt, \"Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law. Thoughts on a Normative Framework\" (1999) 37 Colum J Transnat'l L 885 at 914.\n# Assessment difficulties\nThere are problems that arise with the use of Schmitt's consequence-based categorization framework. One issue raised by Matthew Hoisington applies to the final factor to be considered, presumptive legitimacy. He points out that determining whether the attack is legitimate under international law by asking whether the attack was legitimate, is essentially putting the cart before the horse.³⁵ Additionally, Hoisington turns to the attribution issue addressed above, pointing out that unlike a traditional kinetic attack, the ultimate consequence of an cyber attack may be difficult to ascertain immediately afterwards. This will present a problem in determining the permitted response under international law, a deficiency that will likely plague most approaches that designed to be used after an attack.³⁶\nA quick consequence-based analysis of a cyber attack will likely catch the so called \"low hanging fruit\", attacks that closely resemble traditional military attacks. Cyber attacks that directly target devices which immediately cause death, injury, damage or destruction which is clearly identifiable by the victim do not present significant categorization challenges, but unfortunately an attack will not necessarily be confined to these black and white situations.\n³⁵ Supra note 24.\n³⁶ Ibid\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nThe ultimate effect of a cyber attack may not be immediately apparent, and may in fact be deliberately disguised in order to cause the damage to propagate and spread in the way that the attacker desires. This has consequences regarding qualification under Article 51, as well as the proportionality consideration that a state must undertake. We are left asking, how far down the chain of causation must we go when assessing an attack?\nTo address the unique issues that cyber attacks present with regards to assessment, Hoisington advocates for a presumptive exception to be created for states that have been the victim of a cyber attack. His proposal would create protection under international law for a state that acts in good faith to respond to a cyber attack, bypassing the need to properly attribute and characterise the attack. This would result in a loosening of the requirements to the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter. To constrain the expansion of the Article 51 right Hoisington would have nations decide on a separate categorization of critical national infrastructure that, if attacked, would trigger the aforementioned protection.³⁷\nHoisington's approach seems to run contrary to the spirit of Article 51, and international humanitarian law in general. Certainly the unique aspects of cyber attacks must be considered, and the need for a state to be permitted to defend itself is vital, relaxing the attribution requirements present in Article 51 could very\n³⁷ Ibid at 453.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nwell result in an expansion of conflict. The very aims of Article 51 appear to be the limiting of the frequency and severity of aggressive acts of self-defence, and a loosening of the requirements would run contrary to that objective.³⁸\nIt seems clear that an attacking nation would use means to disguise the origins of their attack. The anonymous nature of the internet likely would be one of the main benefits that an attacker would be seeking. Given what we have established regarding the ability of attackers to disguise and engage in \"false flag\" conduct it would not be unreasonable to believe that a relaxation of the attribution requirement could very well lead to attacks on innocent third party states, pulling another nation into the conflict.³⁹\nInstead of removing the attribution requirement for certain protected national assets a new approach to evaluating and regulating cyber attacks under international law may be necessary.\n## Suggested improvements\n## Towards qualifying as armed force\nIn order to determine if an attack should be considered an armed attack focus should be centred on the severity of the consequences. One of the main problems that have faced result-oriented tests in the past has been the difficulty\n³⁸ Supra note 26 at 1175\n³⁹ Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nin determining what consequences can be actually tied to the cyber attack itself. Basically, how far down the chain do we go looking for the characteristics of an armed attack?\nI would suggest that one might look to domestic criminal law regarding causation to find a starting point. The Supreme Court of Canada have settled on the test of a \"significant contributing cause\"40 with regards to most offences, and a \"substantial and integral cause\"41 when applied to first degree murder. In the case of determining whether death, injury, damage, or destruction can be tied to a cyber attack it seems reasonable to consider whether the attack represented a \"substantial and integral cause of the injury suffered\".\nUse of a modified version of Schmitt's test42 presents an attractive first step:\n1) Severity: Consequences must rise to the level of death, injury, damage, or destruction.\n2) Causation: The damages suffered which meet the first step must be considered substantially and integrally connected to the attack.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n3) Invasiveness: This step would remain largely unchanged. It is important to clarify that the physical actor does not need to cross into the victim state for this step to be met. Rather the attack should be found within the borders, the physical location of the attacker is non-material.\nThe immediacy and directness requirements from Schmitt's test have been superseded by the causation test, while avoiding the problem of unduly constraining the attacked nation. As set out above there are significant problems with attempting to determine the immediate effects of a cyber attack, and the directness step is not required, as the causation test would handle cases where the actus reus is not sufficiently tied to the consequence. The immediacy requirement seems to be onerous without providing much benefit. For example, if an attacking nation were to compromise a control system and implant a logic bomb, which would only trigger months later, causing significant damage and injury, it seems nonsensical to believe that the attack is somehow not an armed attack, simply because one of the consequences were hidden.\nThe measurability requirement and the challenges that it presents have been addressed above. The near impossibility of accurately ascertaining the full consequences of an attack means forcing the measurability requirement would unduly hamstring a state that has been the victim of a cyber attack. By confining\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nthe analysis to the severity of the consequence, the connection between the consequences and the attack, and maintaining the requirement for the attack to occur within the boundaries of the state; a cyber attack can be effectively classified against the armed conflict standard, while making allowances for the challenges the cyber environment presents.\n## Towards determining attribution\nEnsuring that nations that have been subjected to a cyber attack are able to accurately attribute the attack to a particular state actor within a reasonable timeframe benefits the international community as a whole. Allowing a state to accurately attribute an attack reduces the risk of widening the conflict by responding against an innocent third party, and would hold attacking nations more accountable for their actions. A change to the technical infrastructure which allows nations to hide behind the internet is not feasible or even necessarily desirable. Rather an approach that recognizes the overall benefit to international cooperation may be the most workable. The international community has recognized the benefit of independent regulators and inspectors with regards to issues such a nuclear development$^{43}$, as the benefit to all outweighs the intrusion that these agencies present.\nAs set out above, tracking a cyber attack back, through compromised servers, presents a significant problem for attribution. One way of addressing this\n$^{43}$ A prime example being the International Atomic Energy Agency\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nissue would be an international framework, whereby nations found to be hosting a computer or server implicated in an armed attack, would be responsible for conducting an investigation into the offending device. The implicated state would then be responsible for providing an independent regulator with all pertinent data taken from the system, the regulator would be responsible for evaluating the data, and would then turn over the results of the investigation to the state which was attacked.\nAn alternative setup would have the independent regulator actually be provided access to the compromised system, whereby they would conduct an independent investigation themselves, without relying on the host nation to provide them with the data. This approach would present the host nation with a more substantial trespass on their independence, and would likely face more opposition than the first approach.\nCertainly even this approach is not without its pitfalls. Data can be faked, and a host nation could conceivably attempt to point the finger at another by manufacturing data that purports to show that the attack originated elsewhere, and merely passed through their nation. However, a thorough forensic investigation would be likely to uncover discrepancies, and at least trigger the suspicion of both the independent auditor, and the victim state. A criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is not at play here, an implicated state would ultimately be responsible for showing that they were not behind the\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nattack, to the satisfaction of the independent auditors. In the absence of a legitimate defence, Article 51 would be triggered, as it would currently, and the aggrieved state would be able to defend itself pursuant to international law.\nSuch an approach would have the added benefit of providing extra incentive for states to not allow rogue non-state elements to operate within their borders, as it would increase their risk of being implicated in any illegal attack perpetrated by private groups. Certainly an approach as outlined above may present problems regarding timeframe. In the event of a significant attack time may be of essence. While a full investigation may take time, addressing an attack currently being carried out should not. An implicated state must take reasonable efforts to shut down compromised servers as quickly as possible, and any undue delay would be interpreted as showing involvement in the attack, allowing the attribution requirement to be met, and permitting an Article 51 response.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n# Conclusion\nAttacks through cyberspace are a logical development given the increasing significance the internet and wired devices play in our everyday lives. Legal frameworks in general are being challenged by the changes that the global information network is presenting, and international humanitarian law is no exception. Cyber attacks of a significant scale are only in their infancy, but it is better to be ahead of the curve, with a well thought out approach to the issue, than attempting to catch up after the fact.\nThe challenges that international law faces when presented with cyber attacks require a new kind of framework, one that respects the principles that underpin international humanitarian law, while recognizing the need for states to be able address an electronic aggressor. Existing approaches to evaluating a cyber attack either unduly hamstring a nation suffering from the effects of an attack, or would permit an undesirable expansion of armed conflict. In addition to a new legal approach to evaluating cyber attacks a new framework for regulating international responses and investigations to cyber attacks is required. Attributing attacks to particular actors over cyberspace is certainly difficult, but the international community must be careful not to relax the standards too much, or risk losing the protection that it has historically provided.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039",

The application of warfare is certainly no exception to this development. Both state and non-state actors are busy devising new ways of applying technology to carry out attacks on their adversaries, or prevent their adversaries from successfully attacking them. In the past, technology has been used merely to augment or improve the performance or capabilities of traditional military weapons and tools. However, with the increasing level of interconnected devices, attacks that operate purely through digital mediums are becoming increasingly effective.\nTraditionally, International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and the Laws of Armed Conflict (LOAC) have focused on the regulation and governance of kinetic, physical operations. The prospect of significant attacks being carried out through purely electronic means would have been pure fantasy a generation ago, and would not have been envisioned when IHL and LOAC were being developed. The traditional categorization of conflict and of participant action is stretched when applied beyond the physical world. It is the difficulty in categorizing participant action that must be addressed in order to ensure the protections that have been applied in historic conflicts are capable of being applied in the conflicts of the future.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nThis paper will address the question of how a purely electronic event or operation should be evaluated under existing legal paradigms, more specifically, how a state may go about assessing and properly responding to a cyber attack. This paper will not be addressing the use of cyberwarfare techniques as a part of a larger traditional kinetic war; rather the main focus will remain on how a cyber attack can be classified in the absence of traditional warfare operations. As a part of the examination of the classification of cyber attacks, this paper will address whether existing IHL and LOAC are sufficient to meet the challenges of the future digital battlefield, or whether a new approach is required.\n## Background\n### Defining cyber attacks\nTo understand cyber attacks one must notionally understand the medium that it describes. \"Cyberspace\" is a term that originated from science fiction, and today commonly refers to the Internet, or the World Wide Web. While Cyberspace typically is used in reference to the publicly accessible Internet with which the public is familiar, it could also apply to many of the private networks which organizations and governments operate. The US Department of Defence have defined cyberspace as a \"global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer\n Bradley Raboin, \"Corresponding Evolution: International Law and the Emergence of Cyber Warfare\", 31 J Nat'l Ass'n L Jud 602 at 607.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nsystems, and embedded processors and controllers.\" There are a variety of other definitions that choose different means and wording to ultimately define cyberspace as being a vast network of interconnected computer and telecommunications devices.\nMoving on to cyber attacks specifically, the US Department of Defence defines “cyber operations” in this context as being \"the employment of cyber capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve military objectives or effects in or through cyberspace\". Additionally, they define a “computer network attack” as being \"actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves\". Given that this paper will be addressing cyber attacks that have the possibility of causing harm to more than electronic targets the latter definition will not be sufficient. Taking into account the various definitions and views, for the purpose of this article a cyber attack will refer to “the use of electronic techniques by a state actor to conduct operations through cyberspace with the objective of causing harm to the interests of another state”.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n# A brief history of cyber attacks\n## Pipeline sabotage\nWhile cyber conflict is a relatively new concept in its current form of network intrusions and remote attacks, states have been looking to use digital mediums to stage and carry out attacks going back to at least the cold war era. One particular story that has received a fair amount of press in recent years relates to a Soviet pipeline explosion which occurred in June of 1982. It is alleged that Soviet spies had stolen a computer-control system from a Canadian firm, but unbeknownst to the Soviets, the CIA knew about their plans, and had inserted a \"logic bomb\" into the code of the control system. The system malfunctioned, allowing unsafe operating conditions to develop unchecked, resulting in a massive explosion that apparently was registered by western satellites. It should be noted however, that Vasily Pchelintsev, the former KGB head of the region, has denied this account. As with many accounts from that period of time exact details remain contentious.\n \"War in the fifth domain; cyberwar\" The Economist (3 July 2010). online: Proquest <http: 578452939?accountid=\"10406\" ezproxy.library.dal.ca=\"\" login?url=\"http://search.proquest.com/docview\">\n Thomas Rid, \"Think Again: Cyberwar\" Foreign Policy (March/April 2012), online: Think Again: <http: 02=\"\" 2012=\"\" 27=\"\" articles=\"\" cyberwar=\"\" www.foreignpolicy.com=\"\">\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039</http:></http:>\n# 2007 Attacks on Estonia\nIn 2007, Estonia was planning on moving a WWII-era Russian grave, much to the chagrin of Russia and the Russian people. On April 27, 2007 a series of significant cyber attacks hit Estonian web servers, focusing on banks, government organizations, and media. While it was a significant attack in terms of the effect (knocking out most significant Estonian based websites) it was actually a fairly simple attack, known as distributed denial of service, whereby the sites were basically flooded with requests, making it impossible for them to respond to legitimate users.\nMembers of the Estonian government blamed Russia for the attacks, something Russia denied. To this day it is still unclear who actually perpetrated the attacks. Tracing of some of the network traffic led to Russian IP addresses; however, that unfortunately is not always conclusive, and does not necessarily point to the ultimate origin of the attack. Whether it was Russian government actors, or simply private citizens is still a question of great debate. Actually conclusively attributing the attack to a particular state actor has proven exceedingly difficult for Estonia, a theme that will be explored further in this article.\n “Estonia looks to cyber defence, after attacks”, Communications Engineer 5:4 (2007) 3, online <http: ieeexplore.ieee.org=\"\" stamp=\"\" stamp.jsp?tp=\"&amp;arnumber=4444805\"> Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039</http:>\n# Stuxnet\nStuxnet may very well represent an evolution in cyberwarfare. The name Stuxnet refers to a computer worm that was discovered in June of 2010. Unlike most computer malware Stuxnet was designed neither to provide illicit access, nor to steal information. Instead of targeting credit card information or banking information as is usual amongst malware, Stuxnet searched for a very specific operating environment when it infected a machine, and would actually shut itself down if it did not find the correct conditions.\nOnce the worm found the proper set of conditions were present on the network that it infected, it would push out changes to a device which controlled pieces of industrial machinery, altering the operating conditions of the machinery, periodically speeding up or slowing the ordinary operating speed of attached motors. The worm even went so far as to record what the ordinary operating conditions were, and spoof that data back to operators, so they would not realize anything was amiss.\nBased on the conditions and the hardware that the worm searched for it has been widely speculated that Iranian nuclear facilities were the target of the attack, more specifically the Bushehr nuclear power plant as well as the Natanz uranium enrichment facility. The level of complexity that was present in the\n Parliamentary Information and Research Service, The Stuxnet Worm: Just Another Computer Attack or a Game Changer? by Holly Porteous (Ottawa: Library of Parliament, October 2010) at 1.\n Ibid at 2.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nStuxnet worm has led researchers to conclude that the most likely originators of the attack would have been a State actor. The fact that Stuxnet was designed to minimize the collateral damage, whereas malware traditionally targets the widest group possible, adds credence to this assertion. Given the politics, as well as attributes found in the worm, blame has largely been levelled on Israel and the United States.\n## The current paradigm\n## Article 2(4)\nGenerally speaking, under international law a military attack is prima facie illegal, subject to acts of self-defence or by authorization of the UN. The UN Charter defines this prohibition as being:\n4. All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations. (emphasis added)\n Ibid.\n Charter of the United Nations, 26 June 1945, Can TS 1945 No 7 2(4), Article 2(4).\n Ibid Article 51.\n Ibid Chapter VII.\n Supra note 12.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nClearly, the salient question becomes “what constitutes a use of force?” To better examine this question one must first consider what has previously been considered to be a use of force, and how those determinations have been made.\nIn 1947 the International Court of Justice (ICJ) had the opportunity to lend guidance on the interpretation of Article 2(4) in the Corfu Channel case. The matter before the court involved an incident between elements of the British Royal Navy and Albania. After a series of incidents in the channel, which was within Albanian territorial waters, but which was claimed as an area of free passage by the British, Britain sent four warships through the channel, two of which struck mines laid by the Albanians. The ICJ ultimately found that by sending warships into Albanian territorial waters Britain did violate international law, but the mere fact that the warships were readied to attack did not constitute use of force. In this case the court took a fairly narrow view of the interpretation of use of force, and allowed demonstration of force, and preparation to defend, as not falling under the ambit of use of force.\nThe manner in which Article 2(4) was written and developed also provides guidance on what should be considered force and what should not. During the drafting of what would become Article 2(4) a number of nations proposed alternate phrasing that would have likely resulted in a more expansive definition.\n Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania), [1949] ICJ Rep 244.\n Stanimir A. Alexandrov, Self-defense against the use of force in international law (Boston: Kluwer Law International 1996) at 124.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nIran proposed that direct and indirect political pressure be banned, and Brazil suggested that threats of force, and economic pressure be explicitly included as well. All of these suggestions were ultimately voted down, with the current form eventually being settled on. The fact that more expansive definitions that explicitly included alternate forms of force were rejected is illustrative, and supports a more narrow reading of Article 2(4).\nIt seems then, when considering different types of force, political, economic, and armed, only the last can be considered to be sufficient to trigger Article 2(4). Based on the above, there appears to be two approaches to having a cyber attack be sufficient to trigger Article 2(4). One could advocate an expansion of the interpretation of the section to include cyber force, taking into account that expansions have been rejected before. Alternatively, Article 2(4) could be addressed by having a cyber attack be included under the armed force already prohibited.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n# Article 51\nArticle 51 provides for a state's right to self-defence under international law:\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.\nIt is important to recognize the relationship between Article 51 and Article 2(4). Article 51 gives the right to self-defence when an armed attack is perpetrated against a nation, and Article 2(4) declares that a use of force will be considered illegal, with the jurisprudence focusing on an armed attack. It follows that any armed attack will be considered a use of force under Article 2(4) and therefore\n Supra note 13.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nprima facie illegal. However, it does not follow that any attack rising to the level of a use of force under Article 2(4) will necessarily be considered to be an armed attack under Article 51. The way the provisions have been interpreted, an armed attack between the two are not necessarily the same, there is a gap between what is covered by Article 51, and what is covered by Article 2(4). What this means is that simply getting “in the door” under Article 2(4) does not necessarily allow a state access to the remedies provided by Article 51. Violation of Article 2(4) might declare an attack illegal, but it does not automatically engage Article 51. This paper is primarily concerned with the ability of a state to defend itself, so focus will be placed largely upon when a cyber attack should be elevated to the level of an armed attack under Article 51.\nWhen considering the language differences between Article 2(4) and Article 51 in the cyber context, one possible difficulty immediately comes to the forefront. The wording \"use of force\" in Article 2(4) leaves itself open to interpretation regarding what kind of force could qualify, whereas the use of \"armed force\" in Article 51 does suggest a substantially narrower approach. Article 51 was clearly designed with traditional kinetic operations in mind; this is understandable, as the technological developments which have led to the issue of military cyber attacks are a recent phenomenon.\n Michael N Schmitt, “Cyber Operations in International Law: The Use of Force, Collective Security, Self-Defense, and Armed Conflicts” in Committee on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options, eds, Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for U.S. Policy (Washington: The National Academies Press, 2010) 151 at 163.\n Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nIn order to have a cyber attack qualify under this approach then, it appears as though one must assess the consequences of the attack, and compare them to what consequences have traditionally triggered self-defence rights. Analysis of past events has shown that generally death, injury, damage, or destruction has been required to meet the armed attack threshold.\nOnce an armed attack is encountered and Article 51 is engaged any response needs to meet certain conditions in order to be considered legitimate; necessity, proportionality, and immediacy. Matthew Hoisington sets out the details as being:\nTo fulfil the principle of necessity the state must attribute the attack to a specific source, characterize the intent behind the attack, and conclude that the state must use force in response. The principle of proportionality requires that the force used in the response be proportional to the original attack. The requirement of immediacy prohibits a response from occurring after too much time has passed. With regard to immediacy as a general criterion, however, no\n Ibid at 164.\n Matthew Hoisington, “Cyberwarfare and the Use of Force Giving Rise to the Right of Self-Defense” (2009) 32:2 Boston College International &amp; Comparative Law Review 439 at 452.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nrequirement exists for defensive action to be exercised (or risk forfeiture), immediately following an armed attack.\nThe ability of a state to assess what response is proportional, and respond within an appropriate timeframe flows from its ability to properly attribute and characterise an attack. Attribution in particular is a different kind of animal in the cyber context.\n## Attribution Issues\nAttribution, meaning how the responsibility for an attack is attached to a particular state presents a number of novel considerations when operating within the cyber context. Attribution is necessary in order to trigger the entitlement of a responding state to answer with countermeasures against the offending state. In the cyber context attribution immediately rises to the forefront of issues presented. In a global interconnected network such as the internet, attacks can be launched from anywhere. The internet itself consists of distributed nodes, and traffic does not follow a straight-line pattern, network traffic can be\n Ibid.\n Levi Grosswald, “Cyberattack Attribution Matters under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter” (2011) 36 Brook J Int'l L 1153 at 1153.\n Jorn Griebel &amp; Milan Plucken, “New Developments Regarding the Rules of Attribution? The International Court of Justice's Decision in Bosnia v Serbia” (2008) 21 Leiden Journal of International Law 601 at 604.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nsent on more circuitous routes, which do not conform to geographic lines or patterns.\nThe distributed nature of the makeup and structure of the internet which leads to the circuitous nature of online traffic, can be exploited to mask the activities, and the origin, by those who possess the requisite skill and knowledge. It is not as simple as tracing an attack step by step back to the beginning, as attackers are able to use compromised servers and personal computers as launching points, often without the victim being aware that their system has been hijacked. Using strategies such as this it is clearly possible for blame to be levied where it is undeserved. An attack could be traced back to servers located in China, but that does not necessarily mean that the attack originated in China. The cyber traffic could still have crisscrossed the globe multiple times before finally arriving at the ultimate origin point. In fact, this obfuscation of network traffic could be used as a kind of \"false flag\", designed to trick the victim into believing their attacker was a third party. Deliberately spreading the seeds of false information is certainly within the ambit of global politics and espionage.\nSifting through the misinformation and obfuscation requires a time intensive investigation. Compromised servers need to be accessed and\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n\n14</http:>\nexamined to determine the next traffic path that needs to be followed. Simply accessing the compromised systems could be a challenge in and of itself. Depending on where the hijacked servers are located a state may be unable to obtain physical access, and may have to rely on compromising the systems themselves in order to conduct a proper forensic analysis. Without a full and thorough investigation of this type actual attribution is impossible, as a preliminary analysis could only reasonably provide a conclusion based on inferences and best guesses.\n## Characterization issues\nThe ability to assess an appropriate and proportional response is a vital part of the Article 51 evaluation. In order to craft a proportional response a state first needs to know what the attack actually consisted of. Many of the factors that are considered by states in the event of a kinetic attack may be difficult or completely impossible to fully understand in the immediate aftermath of a cyber attack. Simply characterizing the event as an attack in the state versus state sense, as opposed to a criminal or terrorist attack is extremely difficult in the absence of physical indicators that can be used in traditional cases.\n Ibid.\n Ibid at 1170.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n# Inclusion under armed force\nTo consider inclusion of cyber attacks under armed force a different categorization model needs to be used. Instead of focusing on the medium, attention must turn to the effect. International law scholar Michael Schmitt has proposed the following loose test with the aim of distinguishing political or economic pressure from armed force:\n1) Severity: Armed attacks threaten physical injury or destruction of property to a much greater degree than other forms of coercion. Physical well-being usually occupies the apex of the human hierarchy of need.\n2) Immediacy: The negative consequences of armed coercion, or threat thereof, usually occur with great immediacy, while those of other forms of coercion develop more slowly. Thus, the opportunity for the target state or the international community to seek peaceful accommodation is hampered in the former case.\n3) Directness: The consequences of armed coercion are more directly tied to the actus reus than in other forms of\n See http://www.usnwc.edu/Academics/Faculty/Michael-Schmitt.aspx\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\ncoercion, which often depend on numerous contributory factors to operate. Thus, the prohibition on force precludes negative consequences with greater certainty.\n4) Invasiveness: In armed coercion, the act causing the harm usually crosses into the target state, whereas in economic warfare the acts generally occur beyond the target's borders. As a result, even though armed and economic acts may have roughly similar consequences, the former represents a greater intrusion on the rights of the target state and, therefore, is more likely to disrupt international stability.\n5) Measurability: While the consequences of armed coercion are usually easy to ascertain (e.g., a certain level of destruction), the actual negative consequences of other forms of coercion are harder to measure. This fact renders the appropriateness of community condemnation, and the degree of vehemence contained therein, less suspect in the case of armed force.\n6) Presumptive Legitimacy: In most cases, whether under domestic or international law, the application of violence is\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\ndeemed illegitimate absent some specific exception such as self-defence. The cognitive approach is prohibitory. By contrast, most other forms of coercion—again in the domestic and international sphere—are presumptively lawful, absent a prohibition to the contrary. The cognitive approach is permissive. Thus, the consequences of armed coercion are presumptively impermissible, whereas those of other coercive acts are not (as a very generalized rule).\nThe goal of Schmitt's test is to develop a set of characteristics that will be found in a typical use of armed force. By measuring the consequence of a cyber attack against these characteristics one would theoretically be able to distinguish between what should be considered a use of armed force and what should be left to other domestic or international law provisions. Ultimately, the idea is that there will be no difference between a kinetic attack that brings down an airplane, or a cyber attack that does the same, the consequences of the attack are the same, regardless of the medium chosen.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n Michael Schmitt, \"Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law. Thoughts on a Normative Framework\" (1999) 37 Colum J Transnat'l L 885 at 914.\n# Assessment difficulties\nThere are problems that arise with the use of Schmitt's consequence-based categorization framework. One issue raised by Matthew Hoisington applies to the final factor to be considered, presumptive legitimacy. He points out that determining whether the attack is legitimate under international law by asking whether the attack was legitimate, is essentially putting the cart before the horse. Additionally, Hoisington turns to the attribution issue addressed above, pointing out that unlike a traditional kinetic attack, the ultimate consequence of an cyber attack may be difficult to ascertain immediately afterwards. This will present a problem in determining the permitted response under international law, a deficiency that will likely plague most approaches that designed to be used after an attack.\nA quick consequence-based analysis of a cyber attack will likely catch the so called \"low hanging fruit\", attacks that closely resemble traditional military attacks. Cyber attacks that directly target devices which immediately cause death, injury, damage or destruction which is clearly identifiable by the victim do not present significant categorization challenges, but unfortunately an attack will not necessarily be confined to these black and white situations.\n Supra note 24.\n Ibid\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nThe ultimate effect of a cyber attack may not be immediately apparent, and may in fact be deliberately disguised in order to cause the damage to propagate and spread in the way that the attacker desires. This has consequences regarding qualification under Article 51, as well as the proportionality consideration that a state must undertake. We are left asking, how far down the chain of causation must we go when assessing an attack?\nTo address the unique issues that cyber attacks present with regards to assessment, Hoisington advocates for a presumptive exception to be created for states that have been the victim of a cyber attack. His proposal would create protection under international law for a state that acts in good faith to respond to a cyber attack, bypassing the need to properly attribute and characterise the attack. This would result in a loosening of the requirements to the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter. To constrain the expansion of the Article 51 right Hoisington would have nations decide on a separate categorization of critical national infrastructure that, if attacked, would trigger the aforementioned protection.\nHoisington's approach seems to run contrary to the spirit of Article 51, and international humanitarian law in general. Certainly the unique aspects of cyber attacks must be considered, and the need for a state to be permitted to defend itself is vital, relaxing the attribution requirements present in Article 51 could very\n Ibid at 453.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nwell result in an expansion of conflict. The very aims of Article 51 appear to be the limiting of the frequency and severity of aggressive acts of self-defence, and a loosening of the requirements would run contrary to that objective.\nIt seems clear that an attacking nation would use means to disguise the origins of their attack. The anonymous nature of the internet likely would be one of the main benefits that an attacker would be seeking. Given what we have established regarding the ability of attackers to disguise and engage in \"false flag\" conduct it would not be unreasonable to believe that a relaxation of the attribution requirement could very well lead to attacks on innocent third party states, pulling another nation into the conflict.\nInstead of removing the attribution requirement for certain protected national assets a new approach to evaluating and regulating cyber attacks under international law may be necessary.\n## Suggested improvements\n## Towards qualifying as armed force\nIn order to determine if an attack should be considered an armed attack focus should be centred on the severity of the consequences. One of the main problems that have faced result-oriented tests in the past has been the difficulty\n Supra note 26 at 1175\n Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nin determining what consequences can be actually tied to the cyber attack itself. Basically, how far down the chain do we go looking for the characteristics of an armed attack?\nI would suggest that one might look to domestic criminal law regarding causation to find a starting point. The Supreme Court of Canada have settled on the test of a \"significant contributing cause\"40 with regards to most offences, and a \"substantial and integral cause\"41 when applied to first degree murder. In the case of determining whether death, injury, damage, or destruction can be tied to a cyber attack it seems reasonable to consider whether the attack represented a \"substantial and integral cause of the injury suffered\".\nUse of a modified version of Schmitt's test42 presents an attractive first step:\n1) Severity: Consequences must rise to the level of death, injury, damage, or destruction.\n2) Causation: The damages suffered which meet the first step must be considered substantially and integrally connected to the attack.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n3) Invasiveness: This step would remain largely unchanged. It is important to clarify that the physical actor does not need to cross into the victim state for this step to be met. Rather the attack should be found within the borders, the physical location of the attacker is non-material.\nThe immediacy and directness requirements from Schmitt's test have been superseded by the causation test, while avoiding the problem of unduly constraining the attacked nation. As set out above there are significant problems with attempting to determine the immediate effects of a cyber attack, and the directness step is not required, as the causation test would handle cases where the actus reus is not sufficiently tied to the consequence. The immediacy requirement seems to be onerous without providing much benefit. For example, if an attacking nation were to compromise a control system and implant a logic bomb, which would only trigger months later, causing significant damage and injury, it seems nonsensical to believe that the attack is somehow not an armed attack, simply because one of the consequences were hidden.\nThe measurability requirement and the challenges that it presents have been addressed above. The near impossibility of accurately ascertaining the full consequences of an attack means forcing the measurability requirement would unduly hamstring a state that has been the victim of a cyber attack. By confining\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nthe analysis to the severity of the consequence, the connection between the consequences and the attack, and maintaining the requirement for the attack to occur within the boundaries of the state; a cyber attack can be effectively classified against the armed conflict standard, while making allowances for the challenges the cyber environment presents.\n## Towards determining attribution\nEnsuring that nations that have been subjected to a cyber attack are able to accurately attribute the attack to a particular state actor within a reasonable timeframe benefits the international community as a whole. Allowing a state to accurately attribute an attack reduces the risk of widening the conflict by responding against an innocent third party, and would hold attacking nations more accountable for their actions. A change to the technical infrastructure which allows nations to hide behind the internet is not feasible or even necessarily desirable. Rather an approach that recognizes the overall benefit to international cooperation may be the most workable. The international community has recognized the benefit of independent regulators and inspectors with regards to issues such a nuclear development$^{43}$, as the benefit to all outweighs the intrusion that these agencies present.\nAs set out above, tracking a cyber attack back, through compromised servers, presents a significant problem for attribution. One way of addressing this\n$^{43}$ A prime example being the International Atomic Energy Agency\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nissue would be an international framework, whereby nations found to be hosting a computer or server implicated in an armed attack, would be responsible for conducting an investigation into the offending device. The implicated state would then be responsible for providing an independent regulator with all pertinent data taken from the system, the regulator would be responsible for evaluating the data, and would then turn over the results of the investigation to the state which was attacked.\nAn alternative setup would have the independent regulator actually be provided access to the compromised system, whereby they would conduct an independent investigation themselves, without relying on the host nation to provide them with the data. This approach would present the host nation with a more substantial trespass on their independence, and would likely face more opposition than the first approach.\nCertainly even this approach is not without its pitfalls. Data can be faked, and a host nation could conceivably attempt to point the finger at another by manufacturing data that purports to show that the attack originated elsewhere, and merely passed through their nation. However, a thorough forensic investigation would be likely to uncover discrepancies, and at least trigger the suspicion of both the independent auditor, and the victim state. A criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is not at play here, an implicated state would ultimately be responsible for showing that they were not behind the\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nattack, to the satisfaction of the independent auditors. In the absence of a legitimate defence, Article 51 would be triggered, as it would currently, and the aggrieved state would be able to defend itself pursuant to international law.\nSuch an approach would have the added benefit of providing extra incentive for states to not allow rogue non-state elements to operate within their borders, as it would increase their risk of being implicated in any illegal attack perpetrated by private groups. Certainly an approach as outlined above may present problems regarding timeframe. In the event of a significant attack time may be of essence. While a full investigation may take time, addressing an attack currently being carried out should not. An implicated state must take reasonable efforts to shut down compromised servers as quickly as possible, and any undue delay would be interpreted as showing involvement in the attack, allowing the attribution requirement to be met, and permitting an Article 51 response.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n# Conclusion\nAttacks through cyberspace are a logical development given the increasing significance the internet and wired devices play in our everyday lives. Legal frameworks in general are being challenged by the changes that the global information network is presenting, and international humanitarian law is no exception. Cyber attacks of a significant scale are only in their infancy, but it is better to be ahead of the curve, with a well thought out approach to the issue, than attempting to catch up after the fact.\nThe challenges that international law faces when presented with cyber attacks require a new kind of framework, one that respects the principles that underpin international humanitarian law, while recognizing the need for states to be able address an electronic aggressor. Existing approaches to evaluating a cyber attack either unduly hamstring a nation suffering from the effects of an attack, or would permit an undesirable expansion of armed conflict. In addition to a new legal approach to evaluating cyber attacks a new framework for regulating international responses and investigations to cyber attacks is required. Attributing attacks to particular actors over cyberspace is certainly difficult, but the international community must be careful not to relax the standards too much, or risk losing the protection that it has historically provided.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039",

The application of warfare is certainly no exception to this development. Both state and non-state actors are busy devising new ways of applying technology to carry out attacks on their adversaries, or prevent their adversaries from successfully attacking them. In the past, technology has been used merely to augment or improve the performance or capabilities of traditional military weapons and tools. However, with the increasing level of interconnected devices, attacks that operate purely through digital mediums are becoming increasingly effective.\nTraditionally, International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and the Laws of Armed Conflict (LOAC) have focused on the regulation and governance of kinetic, physical operations. The prospect of significant attacks being carried out through purely electronic means would have been pure fantasy a generation ago, and would not have been envisioned when IHL and LOAC were being developed. The traditional categorization of conflict and of participant action is stretched when applied beyond the physical world. It is the difficulty in categorizing participant action that must be addressed in order to ensure the protections that have been applied in historic conflicts are capable of being applied in the conflicts of the future.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nThis paper will address the question of how a purely electronic event or operation should be evaluated under existing legal paradigms, more specifically, how a state may go about assessing and properly responding to a cyber attack. This paper will not be addressing the use of cyberwarfare techniques as a part of a larger traditional kinetic war; rather the main focus will remain on how a cyber attack can be classified in the absence of traditional warfare operations. As a part of the examination of the classification of cyber attacks, this paper will address whether existing IHL and LOAC are sufficient to meet the challenges of the future digital battlefield, or whether a new approach is required.\n## Background\n### Defining cyber attacks\nTo understand cyber attacks one must notionally understand the medium that it describes. \"Cyberspace\" is a term that originated from science fiction, and today commonly refers to the Internet, or the World Wide Web. While Cyberspace typically is used in reference to the publicly accessible Internet with which the public is familiar, it could also apply to many of the private networks which organizations and governments operate. The US Department of Defence have defined cyberspace as a \"global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer\n Bradley Raboin, \"Corresponding Evolution: International Law and the Emergence of Cyber Warfare\", 31 J Nat'l Ass'n L Jud 602 at 607.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nsystems, and embedded processors and controllers.\" There are a variety of other definitions that choose different means and wording to ultimately define cyberspace as being a vast network of interconnected computer and telecommunications devices.\nMoving on to cyber attacks specifically, the US Department of Defence defines “cyber operations” in this context as being \"the employment of cyber capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve military objectives or effects in or through cyberspace\". Additionally, they define a “computer network attack” as being \"actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves\". Given that this paper will be addressing cyber attacks that have the possibility of causing harm to more than electronic targets the latter definition will not be sufficient. Taking into account the various definitions and views, for the purpose of this article a cyber attack will refer to “the use of electronic techniques by a state actor to conduct operations through cyberspace with the objective of causing harm to the interests of another state”.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n# A brief history of cyber attacks\n## Pipeline sabotage\nWhile cyber conflict is a relatively new concept in its current form of network intrusions and remote attacks, states have been looking to use digital mediums to stage and carry out attacks going back to at least the cold war era. One particular story that has received a fair amount of press in recent years relates to a Soviet pipeline explosion which occurred in June of 1982. It is alleged that Soviet spies had stolen a computer-control system from a Canadian firm, but unbeknownst to the Soviets, the CIA knew about their plans, and had inserted a \"logic bomb\" into the code of the control system. The system malfunctioned, allowing unsafe operating conditions to develop unchecked, resulting in a massive explosion that apparently was registered by western satellites. It should be noted however, that Vasily Pchelintsev, the former KGB head of the region, has denied this account. As with many accounts from that period of time exact details remain contentious.\n \"War in the fifth domain; cyberwar\" The Economist (3 July 2010). online: Proquest <http: 578452939?accountid=\"10406\" ezproxy.library.dal.ca=\"\" login?url=\"http://search.proquest.com/docview\">\n Thomas Rid, \"Think Again: Cyberwar\" Foreign Policy (March/April 2012), online: Think Again: <http: 02=\"\" 2012=\"\" 27=\"\" articles=\"\" cyberwar=\"\" www.foreignpolicy.com=\"\">\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039</http:></http:>\n# 2007 Attacks on Estonia\nIn 2007, Estonia was planning on moving a WWII-era Russian grave, much to the chagrin of Russia and the Russian people. On April 27, 2007 a series of significant cyber attacks hit Estonian web servers, focusing on banks, government organizations, and media. While it was a significant attack in terms of the effect (knocking out most significant Estonian based websites) it was actually a fairly simple attack, known as distributed denial of service, whereby the sites were basically flooded with requests, making it impossible for them to respond to legitimate users.\nMembers of the Estonian government blamed Russia for the attacks, something Russia denied. To this day it is still unclear who actually perpetrated the attacks. Tracing of some of the network traffic led to Russian IP addresses; however, that unfortunately is not always conclusive, and does not necessarily point to the ultimate origin of the attack. Whether it was Russian government actors, or simply private citizens is still a question of great debate. Actually conclusively attributing the attack to a particular state actor has proven exceedingly difficult for Estonia, a theme that will be explored further in this article.\n “Estonia looks to cyber defence, after attacks”, Communications Engineer 5:4 (2007) 3, online <http: ieeexplore.ieee.org=\"\" stamp=\"\" stamp.jsp?tp=\"&amp;arnumber=4444805\"> Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039</http:>\n# Stuxnet\nStuxnet may very well represent an evolution in cyberwarfare. The name Stuxnet refers to a computer worm that was discovered in June of 2010. Unlike most computer malware Stuxnet was designed neither to provide illicit access, nor to steal information. Instead of targeting credit card information or banking information as is usual amongst malware, Stuxnet searched for a very specific operating environment when it infected a machine, and would actually shut itself down if it did not find the correct conditions.\nOnce the worm found the proper set of conditions were present on the network that it infected, it would push out changes to a device which controlled pieces of industrial machinery, altering the operating conditions of the machinery, periodically speeding up or slowing the ordinary operating speed of attached motors. The worm even went so far as to record what the ordinary operating conditions were, and spoof that data back to operators, so they would not realize anything was amiss.\nBased on the conditions and the hardware that the worm searched for it has been widely speculated that Iranian nuclear facilities were the target of the attack, more specifically the Bushehr nuclear power plant as well as the Natanz uranium enrichment facility. The level of complexity that was present in the\n Parliamentary Information and Research Service, The Stuxnet Worm: Just Another Computer Attack or a Game Changer? by Holly Porteous (Ottawa: Library of Parliament, October 2010) at 1.\n Ibid at 2.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nStuxnet worm has led researchers to conclude that the most likely originators of the attack would have been a State actor. The fact that Stuxnet was designed to minimize the collateral damage, whereas malware traditionally targets the widest group possible, adds credence to this assertion. Given the politics, as well as attributes found in the worm, blame has largely been levelled on Israel and the United States.\n## The current paradigm\n## Article 2(4)\nGenerally speaking, under international law a military attack is prima facie illegal, subject to acts of self-defence or by authorization of the UN. The UN Charter defines this prohibition as being:\n4. All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations. (emphasis added)\n Ibid.\n Charter of the United Nations, 26 June 1945, Can TS 1945 No 7 2(4), Article 2(4).\n Ibid Article 51.\n Ibid Chapter VII.\n Supra note 12.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nClearly, the salient question becomes “what constitutes a use of force?” To better examine this question one must first consider what has previously been considered to be a use of force, and how those determinations have been made.\nIn 1947 the International Court of Justice (ICJ) had the opportunity to lend guidance on the interpretation of Article 2(4) in the Corfu Channel case. The matter before the court involved an incident between elements of the British Royal Navy and Albania. After a series of incidents in the channel, which was within Albanian territorial waters, but which was claimed as an area of free passage by the British, Britain sent four warships through the channel, two of which struck mines laid by the Albanians. The ICJ ultimately found that by sending warships into Albanian territorial waters Britain did violate international law, but the mere fact that the warships were readied to attack did not constitute use of force. In this case the court took a fairly narrow view of the interpretation of use of force, and allowed demonstration of force, and preparation to defend, as not falling under the ambit of use of force.\nThe manner in which Article 2(4) was written and developed also provides guidance on what should be considered force and what should not. During the drafting of what would become Article 2(4) a number of nations proposed alternate phrasing that would have likely resulted in a more expansive definition.\n Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania), [1949] ICJ Rep 244.\n Stanimir A. Alexandrov, Self-defense against the use of force in international law (Boston: Kluwer Law International 1996) at 124.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nIran proposed that direct and indirect political pressure be banned, and Brazil suggested that threats of force, and economic pressure be explicitly included as well. All of these suggestions were ultimately voted down, with the current form eventually being settled on. The fact that more expansive definitions that explicitly included alternate forms of force were rejected is illustrative, and supports a more narrow reading of Article 2(4).\nIt seems then, when considering different types of force, political, economic, and armed, only the last can be considered to be sufficient to trigger Article 2(4). Based on the above, there appears to be two approaches to having a cyber attack be sufficient to trigger Article 2(4). One could advocate an expansion of the interpretation of the section to include cyber force, taking into account that expansions have been rejected before. Alternatively, Article 2(4) could be addressed by having a cyber attack be included under the armed force already prohibited.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n# Article 51\nArticle 51 provides for a state's right to self-defence under international law:\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.\nIt is important to recognize the relationship between Article 51 and Article 2(4). Article 51 gives the right to self-defence when an armed attack is perpetrated against a nation, and Article 2(4) declares that a use of force will be considered illegal, with the jurisprudence focusing on an armed attack. It follows that any armed attack will be considered a use of force under Article 2(4) and therefore\n Supra note 13.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nprima facie illegal. However, it does not follow that any attack rising to the level of a use of force under Article 2(4) will necessarily be considered to be an armed attack under Article 51. The way the provisions have been interpreted, an armed attack between the two are not necessarily the same, there is a gap between what is covered by Article 51, and what is covered by Article 2(4). What this means is that simply getting “in the door” under Article 2(4) does not necessarily allow a state access to the remedies provided by Article 51. Violation of Article 2(4) might declare an attack illegal, but it does not automatically engage Article 51. This paper is primarily concerned with the ability of a state to defend itself, so focus will be placed largely upon when a cyber attack should be elevated to the level of an armed attack under Article 51.\nWhen considering the language differences between Article 2(4) and Article 51 in the cyber context, one possible difficulty immediately comes to the forefront. The wording \"use of force\" in Article 2(4) leaves itself open to interpretation regarding what kind of force could qualify, whereas the use of \"armed force\" in Article 51 does suggest a substantially narrower approach. Article 51 was clearly designed with traditional kinetic operations in mind; this is understandable, as the technological developments which have led to the issue of military cyber attacks are a recent phenomenon.\n Michael N Schmitt, “Cyber Operations in International Law: The Use of Force, Collective Security, Self-Defense, and Armed Conflicts” in Committee on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options, eds, Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for U.S. Policy (Washington: The National Academies Press, 2010) 151 at 163.\n Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nIn order to have a cyber attack qualify under this approach then, it appears as though one must assess the consequences of the attack, and compare them to what consequences have traditionally triggered self-defence rights. Analysis of past events has shown that generally death, injury, damage, or destruction has been required to meet the armed attack threshold.\nOnce an armed attack is encountered and Article 51 is engaged any response needs to meet certain conditions in order to be considered legitimate; necessity, proportionality, and immediacy. Matthew Hoisington sets out the details as being:\nTo fulfil the principle of necessity the state must attribute the attack to a specific source, characterize the intent behind the attack, and conclude that the state must use force in response. The principle of proportionality requires that the force used in the response be proportional to the original attack. The requirement of immediacy prohibits a response from occurring after too much time has passed. With regard to immediacy as a general criterion, however, no\n Ibid at 164.\n Matthew Hoisington, “Cyberwarfare and the Use of Force Giving Rise to the Right of Self-Defense” (2009) 32:2 Boston College International &amp; Comparative Law Review 439 at 452.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nrequirement exists for defensive action to be exercised (or risk forfeiture), immediately following an armed attack.\nThe ability of a state to assess what response is proportional, and respond within an appropriate timeframe flows from its ability to properly attribute and characterise an attack. Attribution in particular is a different kind of animal in the cyber context.\n## Attribution Issues\nAttribution, meaning how the responsibility for an attack is attached to a particular state presents a number of novel considerations when operating within the cyber context. Attribution is necessary in order to trigger the entitlement of a responding state to answer with countermeasures against the offending state. In the cyber context attribution immediately rises to the forefront of issues presented. In a global interconnected network such as the internet, attacks can be launched from anywhere. The internet itself consists of distributed nodes, and traffic does not follow a straight-line pattern, network traffic can be\n Ibid.\n Levi Grosswald, “Cyberattack Attribution Matters under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter” (2011) 36 Brook J Int'l L 1153 at 1153.\n Jorn Griebel &amp; Milan Plucken, “New Developments Regarding the Rules of Attribution? The International Court of Justice's Decision in Bosnia v Serbia” (2008) 21 Leiden Journal of International Law 601 at 604.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nsent on more circuitous routes, which do not conform to geographic lines or patterns.\nThe distributed nature of the makeup and structure of the internet which leads to the circuitous nature of online traffic, can be exploited to mask the activities, and the origin, by those who possess the requisite skill and knowledge. It is not as simple as tracing an attack step by step back to the beginning, as attackers are able to use compromised servers and personal computers as launching points, often without the victim being aware that their system has been hijacked. Using strategies such as this it is clearly possible for blame to be levied where it is undeserved. An attack could be traced back to servers located in China, but that does not necessarily mean that the attack originated in China. The cyber traffic could still have crisscrossed the globe multiple times before finally arriving at the ultimate origin point. In fact, this obfuscation of network traffic could be used as a kind of \"false flag\", designed to trick the victim into believing their attacker was a third party. Deliberately spreading the seeds of false information is certainly within the ambit of global politics and espionage.\nSifting through the misinformation and obfuscation requires a time intensive investigation. Compromised servers need to be accessed and\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n\n14</http:>\nexamined to determine the next traffic path that needs to be followed. Simply accessing the compromised systems could be a challenge in and of itself. Depending on where the hijacked servers are located a state may be unable to obtain physical access, and may have to rely on compromising the systems themselves in order to conduct a proper forensic analysis. Without a full and thorough investigation of this type actual attribution is impossible, as a preliminary analysis could only reasonably provide a conclusion based on inferences and best guesses.\n## Characterization issues\nThe ability to assess an appropriate and proportional response is a vital part of the Article 51 evaluation. In order to craft a proportional response a state first needs to know what the attack actually consisted of. Many of the factors that are considered by states in the event of a kinetic attack may be difficult or completely impossible to fully understand in the immediate aftermath of a cyber attack. Simply characterizing the event as an attack in the state versus state sense, as opposed to a criminal or terrorist attack is extremely difficult in the absence of physical indicators that can be used in traditional cases.\n Ibid.\n Ibid at 1170.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n# Inclusion under armed force\nTo consider inclusion of cyber attacks under armed force a different categorization model needs to be used. Instead of focusing on the medium, attention must turn to the effect. International law scholar Michael Schmitt has proposed the following loose test with the aim of distinguishing political or economic pressure from armed force:\n1) Severity: Armed attacks threaten physical injury or destruction of property to a much greater degree than other forms of coercion. Physical well-being usually occupies the apex of the human hierarchy of need.\n2) Immediacy: The negative consequences of armed coercion, or threat thereof, usually occur with great immediacy, while those of other forms of coercion develop more slowly. Thus, the opportunity for the target state or the international community to seek peaceful accommodation is hampered in the former case.\n3) Directness: The consequences of armed coercion are more directly tied to the actus reus than in other forms of\n See http://www.usnwc.edu/Academics/Faculty/Michael-Schmitt.aspx\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\ncoercion, which often depend on numerous contributory factors to operate. Thus, the prohibition on force precludes negative consequences with greater certainty.\n4) Invasiveness: In armed coercion, the act causing the harm usually crosses into the target state, whereas in economic warfare the acts generally occur beyond the target's borders. As a result, even though armed and economic acts may have roughly similar consequences, the former represents a greater intrusion on the rights of the target state and, therefore, is more likely to disrupt international stability.\n5) Measurability: While the consequences of armed coercion are usually easy to ascertain (e.g., a certain level of destruction), the actual negative consequences of other forms of coercion are harder to measure. This fact renders the appropriateness of community condemnation, and the degree of vehemence contained therein, less suspect in the case of armed force.\n6) Presumptive Legitimacy: In most cases, whether under domestic or international law, the application of violence is\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\ndeemed illegitimate absent some specific exception such as self-defence. The cognitive approach is prohibitory. By contrast, most other forms of coercion—again in the domestic and international sphere—are presumptively lawful, absent a prohibition to the contrary. The cognitive approach is permissive. Thus, the consequences of armed coercion are presumptively impermissible, whereas those of other coercive acts are not (as a very generalized rule).\nThe goal of Schmitt's test is to develop a set of characteristics that will be found in a typical use of armed force. By measuring the consequence of a cyber attack against these characteristics one would theoretically be able to distinguish between what should be considered a use of armed force and what should be left to other domestic or international law provisions. Ultimately, the idea is that there will be no difference between a kinetic attack that brings down an airplane, or a cyber attack that does the same, the consequences of the attack are the same, regardless of the medium chosen.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n Michael Schmitt, \"Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law. Thoughts on a Normative Framework\" (1999) 37 Colum J Transnat'l L 885 at 914.\n# Assessment difficulties\nThere are problems that arise with the use of Schmitt's consequence-based categorization framework. One issue raised by Matthew Hoisington applies to the final factor to be considered, presumptive legitimacy. He points out that determining whether the attack is legitimate under international law by asking whether the attack was legitimate, is essentially putting the cart before the horse. Additionally, Hoisington turns to the attribution issue addressed above, pointing out that unlike a traditional kinetic attack, the ultimate consequence of an cyber attack may be difficult to ascertain immediately afterwards. This will present a problem in determining the permitted response under international law, a deficiency that will likely plague most approaches that designed to be used after an attack.\nA quick consequence-based analysis of a cyber attack will likely catch the so called \"low hanging fruit\", attacks that closely resemble traditional military attacks. Cyber attacks that directly target devices which immediately cause death, injury, damage or destruction which is clearly identifiable by the victim do not present significant categorization challenges, but unfortunately an attack will not necessarily be confined to these black and white situations.\n Supra note 24.\n Ibid\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nThe ultimate effect of a cyber attack may not be immediately apparent, and may in fact be deliberately disguised in order to cause the damage to propagate and spread in the way that the attacker desires. This has consequences regarding qualification under Article 51, as well as the proportionality consideration that a state must undertake. We are left asking, how far down the chain of causation must we go when assessing an attack?\nTo address the unique issues that cyber attacks present with regards to assessment, Hoisington advocates for a presumptive exception to be created for states that have been the victim of a cyber attack. His proposal would create protection under international law for a state that acts in good faith to respond to a cyber attack, bypassing the need to properly attribute and characterise the attack. This would result in a loosening of the requirements to the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter. To constrain the expansion of the Article 51 right Hoisington would have nations decide on a separate categorization of critical national infrastructure that, if attacked, would trigger the aforementioned protection.\nHoisington's approach seems to run contrary to the spirit of Article 51, and international humanitarian law in general. Certainly the unique aspects of cyber attacks must be considered, and the need for a state to be permitted to defend itself is vital, relaxing the attribution requirements present in Article 51 could very\n Ibid at 453.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nwell result in an expansion of conflict. The very aims of Article 51 appear to be the limiting of the frequency and severity of aggressive acts of self-defence, and a loosening of the requirements would run contrary to that objective.\nIt seems clear that an attacking nation would use means to disguise the origins of their attack. The anonymous nature of the internet likely would be one of the main benefits that an attacker would be seeking. Given what we have established regarding the ability of attackers to disguise and engage in \"false flag\" conduct it would not be unreasonable to believe that a relaxation of the attribution requirement could very well lead to attacks on innocent third party states, pulling another nation into the conflict.\nInstead of removing the attribution requirement for certain protected national assets a new approach to evaluating and regulating cyber attacks under international law may be necessary.\n## Suggested improvements\n## Towards qualifying as armed force\nIn order to determine if an attack should be considered an armed attack focus should be centred on the severity of the consequences. One of the main problems that have faced result-oriented tests in the past has been the difficulty\n Supra note 26 at 1175\n Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nin determining what consequences can be actually tied to the cyber attack itself. Basically, how far down the chain do we go looking for the characteristics of an armed attack?\nI would suggest that one might look to domestic criminal law regarding causation to find a starting point. The Supreme Court of Canada have settled on the test of a \"significant contributing cause\"40 with regards to most offences, and a \"substantial and integral cause\"41 when applied to first degree murder. In the case of determining whether death, injury, damage, or destruction can be tied to a cyber attack it seems reasonable to consider whether the attack represented a \"substantial and integral cause of the injury suffered\".\nUse of a modified version of Schmitt's test42 presents an attractive first step:\n1) Severity: Consequences must rise to the level of death, injury, damage, or destruction.\n2) Causation: The damages suffered which meet the first step must be considered substantially and integrally connected to the attack.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n3) Invasiveness: This step would remain largely unchanged. It is important to clarify that the physical actor does not need to cross into the victim state for this step to be met. Rather the attack should be found within the borders, the physical location of the attacker is non-material.\nThe immediacy and directness requirements from Schmitt's test have been superseded by the causation test, while avoiding the problem of unduly constraining the attacked nation. As set out above there are significant problems with attempting to determine the immediate effects of a cyber attack, and the directness step is not required, as the causation test would handle cases where the actus reus is not sufficiently tied to the consequence. The immediacy requirement seems to be onerous without providing much benefit. For example, if an attacking nation were to compromise a control system and implant a logic bomb, which would only trigger months later, causing significant damage and injury, it seems nonsensical to believe that the attack is somehow not an armed attack, simply because one of the consequences were hidden.\nThe measurability requirement and the challenges that it presents have been addressed above. The near impossibility of accurately ascertaining the full consequences of an attack means forcing the measurability requirement would unduly hamstring a state that has been the victim of a cyber attack. By confining\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nthe analysis to the severity of the consequence, the connection between the consequences and the attack, and maintaining the requirement for the attack to occur within the boundaries of the state; a cyber attack can be effectively classified against the armed conflict standard, while making allowances for the challenges the cyber environment presents.\n## Towards determining attribution\nEnsuring that nations that have been subjected to a cyber attack are able to accurately attribute the attack to a particular state actor within a reasonable timeframe benefits the international community as a whole. Allowing a state to accurately attribute an attack reduces the risk of widening the conflict by responding against an innocent third party, and would hold attacking nations more accountable for their actions. A change to the technical infrastructure which allows nations to hide behind the internet is not feasible or even necessarily desirable. Rather an approach that recognizes the overall benefit to international cooperation may be the most workable. The international community has recognized the benefit of independent regulators and inspectors with regards to issues such a nuclear development$^{43}$, as the benefit to all outweighs the intrusion that these agencies present.\nAs set out above, tracking a cyber attack back, through compromised servers, presents a significant problem for attribution. One way of addressing this\n$^{43}$ A prime example being the International Atomic Energy Agency\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nissue would be an international framework, whereby nations found to be hosting a computer or server implicated in an armed attack, would be responsible for conducting an investigation into the offending device. The implicated state would then be responsible for providing an independent regulator with all pertinent data taken from the system, the regulator would be responsible for evaluating the data, and would then turn over the results of the investigation to the state which was attacked.\nAn alternative setup would have the independent regulator actually be provided access to the compromised system, whereby they would conduct an independent investigation themselves, without relying on the host nation to provide them with the data. This approach would present the host nation with a more substantial trespass on their independence, and would likely face more opposition than the first approach.\nCertainly even this approach is not without its pitfalls. Data can be faked, and a host nation could conceivably attempt to point the finger at another by manufacturing data that purports to show that the attack originated elsewhere, and merely passed through their nation. However, a thorough forensic investigation would be likely to uncover discrepancies, and at least trigger the suspicion of both the independent auditor, and the victim state. A criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is not at play here, an implicated state would ultimately be responsible for showing that they were not behind the\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nattack, to the satisfaction of the independent auditors. In the absence of a legitimate defence, Article 51 would be triggered, as it would currently, and the aggrieved state would be able to defend itself pursuant to international law.\nSuch an approach would have the added benefit of providing extra incentive for states to not allow rogue non-state elements to operate within their borders, as it would increase their risk of being implicated in any illegal attack perpetrated by private groups. Certainly an approach as outlined above may present problems regarding timeframe. In the event of a significant attack time may be of essence. While a full investigation may take time, addressing an attack currently being carried out should not. An implicated state must take reasonable efforts to shut down compromised servers as quickly as possible, and any undue delay would be interpreted as showing involvement in the attack, allowing the attribution requirement to be met, and permitting an Article 51 response.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n# Conclusion\nAttacks through cyberspace are a logical development given the increasing significance the internet and wired devices play in our everyday lives. Legal frameworks in general are being challenged by the changes that the global information network is presenting, and international humanitarian law is no exception. Cyber attacks of a significant scale are only in their infancy, but it is better to be ahead of the curve, with a well thought out approach to the issue, than attempting to catch up after the fact.\nThe challenges that international law faces when presented with cyber attacks require a new kind of framework, one that respects the principles that underpin international humanitarian law, while recognizing the need for states to be able address an electronic aggressor. Existing approaches to evaluating a cyber attack either unduly hamstring a nation suffering from the effects of an attack, or would permit an undesirable expansion of armed conflict. In addition to a new legal approach to evaluating cyber attacks a new framework for regulating international responses and investigations to cyber attacks is required. Attributing attacks to particular actors over cyberspace is certainly difficult, but the international community must be careful not to relax the standards too much, or risk losing the protection that it has historically provided.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039",

The application of warfare is certainly no exception to this development. Both state and non-state actors are busy devising new ways of applying technology to carry out attacks on their adversaries, or prevent their adversaries from successfully attacking them. In the past, technology has been used merely to augment or improve the performance or capabilities of traditional military weapons and tools. However, with the increasing level of interconnected devices, attacks that operate purely through digital mediums are becoming increasingly effective.\nTraditionally, International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and the Laws of Armed Conflict (LOAC) have focused on the regulation and governance of kinetic, physical operations. The prospect of significant attacks being carried out through purely electronic means would have been pure fantasy a generation ago, and would not have been envisioned when IHL and LOAC were being developed. The traditional categorization of conflict and of participant action is stretched when applied beyond the physical world. It is the difficulty in categorizing participant action that must be addressed in order to ensure the protections that have been applied in historic conflicts are capable of being applied in the conflicts of the future.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nThis paper will address the question of how a purely electronic event or operation should be evaluated under existing legal paradigms, more specifically, how a state may go about assessing and properly responding to a cyber attack. This paper will not be addressing the use of cyberwarfare techniques as a part of a larger traditional kinetic war; rather the main focus will remain on how a cyber attack can be classified in the absence of traditional warfare operations. As a part of the examination of the classification of cyber attacks, this paper will address whether existing IHL and LOAC are sufficient to meet the challenges of the future digital battlefield, or whether a new approach is required.\n## Background\n### Defining cyber attacks\nTo understand cyber attacks one must notionally understand the medium that it describes. \"Cyberspace\" is a term that originated from science fiction, and today commonly refers to the Internet, or the World Wide Web. While Cyberspace typically is used in reference to the publicly accessible Internet with which the public is familiar, it could also apply to many of the private networks which organizations and governments operate. The US Department of Defence have defined cyberspace as a \"global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer\n Bradley Raboin, \"Corresponding Evolution: International Law and the Emergence of Cyber Warfare\", 31 J Nat'l Ass'n L Jud 602 at 607.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nsystems, and embedded processors and controllers.\" There are a variety of other definitions that choose different means and wording to ultimately define cyberspace as being a vast network of interconnected computer and telecommunications devices.\nMoving on to cyber attacks specifically, the US Department of Defence defines “cyber operations” in this context as being \"the employment of cyber capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve military objectives or effects in or through cyberspace\". Additionally, they define a “computer network attack” as being \"actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves\". Given that this paper will be addressing cyber attacks that have the possibility of causing harm to more than electronic targets the latter definition will not be sufficient. Taking into account the various definitions and views, for the purpose of this article a cyber attack will refer to “the use of electronic techniques by a state actor to conduct operations through cyberspace with the objective of causing harm to the interests of another state”.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n# A brief history of cyber attacks\n## Pipeline sabotage\nWhile cyber conflict is a relatively new concept in its current form of network intrusions and remote attacks, states have been looking to use digital mediums to stage and carry out attacks going back to at least the cold war era. One particular story that has received a fair amount of press in recent years relates to a Soviet pipeline explosion which occurred in June of 1982. It is alleged that Soviet spies had stolen a computer-control system from a Canadian firm, but unbeknownst to the Soviets, the CIA knew about their plans, and had inserted a \"logic bomb\" into the code of the control system. The system malfunctioned, allowing unsafe operating conditions to develop unchecked, resulting in a massive explosion that apparently was registered by western satellites. It should be noted however, that Vasily Pchelintsev, the former KGB head of the region, has denied this account. As with many accounts from that period of time exact details remain contentious.\n \"War in the fifth domain; cyberwar\" The Economist (3 July 2010). online: Proquest <http: 578452939?accountid=\"10406\" ezproxy.library.dal.ca=\"\" login?url=\"http://search.proquest.com/docview\">\n Thomas Rid, \"Think Again: Cyberwar\" Foreign Policy (March/April 2012), online: Think Again: <http: 02=\"\" 2012=\"\" 27=\"\" articles=\"\" cyberwar=\"\" www.foreignpolicy.com=\"\">\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039</http:></http:>\n# 2007 Attacks on Estonia\nIn 2007, Estonia was planning on moving a WWII-era Russian grave, much to the chagrin of Russia and the Russian people. On April 27, 2007 a series of significant cyber attacks hit Estonian web servers, focusing on banks, government organizations, and media. While it was a significant attack in terms of the effect (knocking out most significant Estonian based websites) it was actually a fairly simple attack, known as distributed denial of service, whereby the sites were basically flooded with requests, making it impossible for them to respond to legitimate users.\nMembers of the Estonian government blamed Russia for the attacks, something Russia denied. To this day it is still unclear who actually perpetrated the attacks. Tracing of some of the network traffic led to Russian IP addresses; however, that unfortunately is not always conclusive, and does not necessarily point to the ultimate origin of the attack. Whether it was Russian government actors, or simply private citizens is still a question of great debate. Actually conclusively attributing the attack to a particular state actor has proven exceedingly difficult for Estonia, a theme that will be explored further in this article.\n “Estonia looks to cyber defence, after attacks”, Communications Engineer 5:4 (2007) 3, online <http: ieeexplore.ieee.org=\"\" stamp=\"\" stamp.jsp?tp=\"&amp;arnumber=4444805\"> Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039</http:>\n# Stuxnet\nStuxnet may very well represent an evolution in cyberwarfare. The name Stuxnet refers to a computer worm that was discovered in June of 2010. Unlike most computer malware Stuxnet was designed neither to provide illicit access, nor to steal information. Instead of targeting credit card information or banking information as is usual amongst malware, Stuxnet searched for a very specific operating environment when it infected a machine, and would actually shut itself down if it did not find the correct conditions.\nOnce the worm found the proper set of conditions were present on the network that it infected, it would push out changes to a device which controlled pieces of industrial machinery, altering the operating conditions of the machinery, periodically speeding up or slowing the ordinary operating speed of attached motors. The worm even went so far as to record what the ordinary operating conditions were, and spoof that data back to operators, so they would not realize anything was amiss.\nBased on the conditions and the hardware that the worm searched for it has been widely speculated that Iranian nuclear facilities were the target of the attack, more specifically the Bushehr nuclear power plant as well as the Natanz uranium enrichment facility. The level of complexity that was present in the\n Parliamentary Information and Research Service, The Stuxnet Worm: Just Another Computer Attack or a Game Changer? by Holly Porteous (Ottawa: Library of Parliament, October 2010) at 1.\n Ibid at 2.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nStuxnet worm has led researchers to conclude that the most likely originators of the attack would have been a State actor. The fact that Stuxnet was designed to minimize the collateral damage, whereas malware traditionally targets the widest group possible, adds credence to this assertion. Given the politics, as well as attributes found in the worm, blame has largely been levelled on Israel and the United States.\n## The current paradigm\n## Article 2(4)\nGenerally speaking, under international law a military attack is prima facie illegal, subject to acts of self-defence or by authorization of the UN. The UN Charter defines this prohibition as being:\n4. All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations. (emphasis added)\n Ibid.\n Charter of the United Nations, 26 June 1945, Can TS 1945 No 7 2(4), Article 2(4).\n Ibid Article 51.\n Ibid Chapter VII.\n Supra note 12.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nClearly, the salient question becomes “what constitutes a use of force?” To better examine this question one must first consider what has previously been considered to be a use of force, and how those determinations have been made.\nIn 1947 the International Court of Justice (ICJ) had the opportunity to lend guidance on the interpretation of Article 2(4) in the Corfu Channel case. The matter before the court involved an incident between elements of the British Royal Navy and Albania. After a series of incidents in the channel, which was within Albanian territorial waters, but which was claimed as an area of free passage by the British, Britain sent four warships through the channel, two of which struck mines laid by the Albanians. The ICJ ultimately found that by sending warships into Albanian territorial waters Britain did violate international law, but the mere fact that the warships were readied to attack did not constitute use of force. In this case the court took a fairly narrow view of the interpretation of use of force, and allowed demonstration of force, and preparation to defend, as not falling under the ambit of use of force.\nThe manner in which Article 2(4) was written and developed also provides guidance on what should be considered force and what should not. During the drafting of what would become Article 2(4) a number of nations proposed alternate phrasing that would have likely resulted in a more expansive definition.\n Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania), [1949] ICJ Rep 244.\n Stanimir A. Alexandrov, Self-defense against the use of force in international law (Boston: Kluwer Law International 1996) at 124.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nIran proposed that direct and indirect political pressure be banned, and Brazil suggested that threats of force, and economic pressure be explicitly included as well. All of these suggestions were ultimately voted down, with the current form eventually being settled on. The fact that more expansive definitions that explicitly included alternate forms of force were rejected is illustrative, and supports a more narrow reading of Article 2(4).\nIt seems then, when considering different types of force, political, economic, and armed, only the last can be considered to be sufficient to trigger Article 2(4). Based on the above, there appears to be two approaches to having a cyber attack be sufficient to trigger Article 2(4). One could advocate an expansion of the interpretation of the section to include cyber force, taking into account that expansions have been rejected before. Alternatively, Article 2(4) could be addressed by having a cyber attack be included under the armed force already prohibited.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n# Article 51\nArticle 51 provides for a state's right to self-defence under international law:\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.\nIt is important to recognize the relationship between Article 51 and Article 2(4). Article 51 gives the right to self-defence when an armed attack is perpetrated against a nation, and Article 2(4) declares that a use of force will be considered illegal, with the jurisprudence focusing on an armed attack. It follows that any armed attack will be considered a use of force under Article 2(4) and therefore\n Supra note 13.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nprima facie illegal. However, it does not follow that any attack rising to the level of a use of force under Article 2(4) will necessarily be considered to be an armed attack under Article 51. The way the provisions have been interpreted, an armed attack between the two are not necessarily the same, there is a gap between what is covered by Article 51, and what is covered by Article 2(4). What this means is that simply getting “in the door” under Article 2(4) does not necessarily allow a state access to the remedies provided by Article 51. Violation of Article 2(4) might declare an attack illegal, but it does not automatically engage Article 51. This paper is primarily concerned with the ability of a state to defend itself, so focus will be placed largely upon when a cyber attack should be elevated to the level of an armed attack under Article 51.\nWhen considering the language differences between Article 2(4) and Article 51 in the cyber context, one possible difficulty immediately comes to the forefront. The wording \"use of force\" in Article 2(4) leaves itself open to interpretation regarding what kind of force could qualify, whereas the use of \"armed force\" in Article 51 does suggest a substantially narrower approach. Article 51 was clearly designed with traditional kinetic operations in mind; this is understandable, as the technological developments which have led to the issue of military cyber attacks are a recent phenomenon.\n Michael N Schmitt, “Cyber Operations in International Law: The Use of Force, Collective Security, Self-Defense, and Armed Conflicts” in Committee on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options, eds, Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for U.S. Policy (Washington: The National Academies Press, 2010) 151 at 163.\n Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nIn order to have a cyber attack qualify under this approach then, it appears as though one must assess the consequences of the attack, and compare them to what consequences have traditionally triggered self-defence rights. Analysis of past events has shown that generally death, injury, damage, or destruction has been required to meet the armed attack threshold.\nOnce an armed attack is encountered and Article 51 is engaged any response needs to meet certain conditions in order to be considered legitimate; necessity, proportionality, and immediacy. Matthew Hoisington sets out the details as being:\nTo fulfil the principle of necessity the state must attribute the attack to a specific source, characterize the intent behind the attack, and conclude that the state must use force in response. The principle of proportionality requires that the force used in the response be proportional to the original attack. The requirement of immediacy prohibits a response from occurring after too much time has passed. With regard to immediacy as a general criterion, however, no\n Ibid at 164.\n Matthew Hoisington, “Cyberwarfare and the Use of Force Giving Rise to the Right of Self-Defense” (2009) 32:2 Boston College International &amp; Comparative Law Review 439 at 452.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nrequirement exists for defensive action to be exercised (or risk forfeiture), immediately following an armed attack.\nThe ability of a state to assess what response is proportional, and respond within an appropriate timeframe flows from its ability to properly attribute and characterise an attack. Attribution in particular is a different kind of animal in the cyber context.\n## Attribution Issues\nAttribution, meaning how the responsibility for an attack is attached to a particular state presents a number of novel considerations when operating within the cyber context. Attribution is necessary in order to trigger the entitlement of a responding state to answer with countermeasures against the offending state. In the cyber context attribution immediately rises to the forefront of issues presented. In a global interconnected network such as the internet, attacks can be launched from anywhere. The internet itself consists of distributed nodes, and traffic does not follow a straight-line pattern, network traffic can be\n Ibid.\n Levi Grosswald, “Cyberattack Attribution Matters under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter” (2011) 36 Brook J Int'l L 1153 at 1153.\n Jorn Griebel &amp; Milan Plucken, “New Developments Regarding the Rules of Attribution? The International Court of Justice's Decision in Bosnia v Serbia” (2008) 21 Leiden Journal of International Law 601 at 604.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nsent on more circuitous routes, which do not conform to geographic lines or patterns.\nThe distributed nature of the makeup and structure of the internet which leads to the circuitous nature of online traffic, can be exploited to mask the activities, and the origin, by those who possess the requisite skill and knowledge. It is not as simple as tracing an attack step by step back to the beginning, as attackers are able to use compromised servers and personal computers as launching points, often without the victim being aware that their system has been hijacked. Using strategies such as this it is clearly possible for blame to be levied where it is undeserved. An attack could be traced back to servers located in China, but that does not necessarily mean that the attack originated in China. The cyber traffic could still have crisscrossed the globe multiple times before finally arriving at the ultimate origin point. In fact, this obfuscation of network traffic could be used as a kind of \"false flag\", designed to trick the victim into believing their attacker was a third party. Deliberately spreading the seeds of false information is certainly within the ambit of global politics and espionage.\nSifting through the misinformation and obfuscation requires a time intensive investigation. Compromised servers need to be accessed and\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n\n14</http:>\nexamined to determine the next traffic path that needs to be followed. Simply accessing the compromised systems could be a challenge in and of itself. Depending on where the hijacked servers are located a state may be unable to obtain physical access, and may have to rely on compromising the systems themselves in order to conduct a proper forensic analysis. Without a full and thorough investigation of this type actual attribution is impossible, as a preliminary analysis could only reasonably provide a conclusion based on inferences and best guesses.\n## Characterization issues\nThe ability to assess an appropriate and proportional response is a vital part of the Article 51 evaluation. In order to craft a proportional response a state first needs to know what the attack actually consisted of. Many of the factors that are considered by states in the event of a kinetic attack may be difficult or completely impossible to fully understand in the immediate aftermath of a cyber attack. Simply characterizing the event as an attack in the state versus state sense, as opposed to a criminal or terrorist attack is extremely difficult in the absence of physical indicators that can be used in traditional cases.\n Ibid.\n Ibid at 1170.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n# Inclusion under armed force\nTo consider inclusion of cyber attacks under armed force a different categorization model needs to be used. Instead of focusing on the medium, attention must turn to the effect. International law scholar Michael Schmitt has proposed the following loose test with the aim of distinguishing political or economic pressure from armed force:\n1) Severity: Armed attacks threaten physical injury or destruction of property to a much greater degree than other forms of coercion. Physical well-being usually occupies the apex of the human hierarchy of need.\n2) Immediacy: The negative consequences of armed coercion, or threat thereof, usually occur with great immediacy, while those of other forms of coercion develop more slowly. Thus, the opportunity for the target state or the international community to seek peaceful accommodation is hampered in the former case.\n3) Directness: The consequences of armed coercion are more directly tied to the actus reus than in other forms of\n See http://www.usnwc.edu/Academics/Faculty/Michael-Schmitt.aspx\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\ncoercion, which often depend on numerous contributory factors to operate. Thus, the prohibition on force precludes negative consequences with greater certainty.\n4) Invasiveness: In armed coercion, the act causing the harm usually crosses into the target state, whereas in economic warfare the acts generally occur beyond the target's borders. As a result, even though armed and economic acts may have roughly similar consequences, the former represents a greater intrusion on the rights of the target state and, therefore, is more likely to disrupt international stability.\n5) Measurability: While the consequences of armed coercion are usually easy to ascertain (e.g., a certain level of destruction), the actual negative consequences of other forms of coercion are harder to measure. This fact renders the appropriateness of community condemnation, and the degree of vehemence contained therein, less suspect in the case of armed force.\n6) Presumptive Legitimacy: In most cases, whether under domestic or international law, the application of violence is\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\ndeemed illegitimate absent some specific exception such as self-defence. The cognitive approach is prohibitory. By contrast, most other forms of coercion—again in the domestic and international sphere—are presumptively lawful, absent a prohibition to the contrary. The cognitive approach is permissive. Thus, the consequences of armed coercion are presumptively impermissible, whereas those of other coercive acts are not (as a very generalized rule).\nThe goal of Schmitt's test is to develop a set of characteristics that will be found in a typical use of armed force. By measuring the consequence of a cyber attack against these characteristics one would theoretically be able to distinguish between what should be considered a use of armed force and what should be left to other domestic or international law provisions. Ultimately, the idea is that there will be no difference between a kinetic attack that brings down an airplane, or a cyber attack that does the same, the consequences of the attack are the same, regardless of the medium chosen.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n Michael Schmitt, \"Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law. Thoughts on a Normative Framework\" (1999) 37 Colum J Transnat'l L 885 at 914.\n# Assessment difficulties\nThere are problems that arise with the use of Schmitt's consequence-based categorization framework. One issue raised by Matthew Hoisington applies to the final factor to be considered, presumptive legitimacy. He points out that determining whether the attack is legitimate under international law by asking whether the attack was legitimate, is essentially putting the cart before the horse. Additionally, Hoisington turns to the attribution issue addressed above, pointing out that unlike a traditional kinetic attack, the ultimate consequence of an cyber attack may be difficult to ascertain immediately afterwards. This will present a problem in determining the permitted response under international law, a deficiency that will likely plague most approaches that designed to be used after an attack.\nA quick consequence-based analysis of a cyber attack will likely catch the so called \"low hanging fruit\", attacks that closely resemble traditional military attacks. Cyber attacks that directly target devices which immediately cause death, injury, damage or destruction which is clearly identifiable by the victim do not present significant categorization challenges, but unfortunately an attack will not necessarily be confined to these black and white situations.\n Supra note 24.\n Ibid\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nThe ultimate effect of a cyber attack may not be immediately apparent, and may in fact be deliberately disguised in order to cause the damage to propagate and spread in the way that the attacker desires. This has consequences regarding qualification under Article 51, as well as the proportionality consideration that a state must undertake. We are left asking, how far down the chain of causation must we go when assessing an attack?\nTo address the unique issues that cyber attacks present with regards to assessment, Hoisington advocates for a presumptive exception to be created for states that have been the victim of a cyber attack. His proposal would create protection under international law for a state that acts in good faith to respond to a cyber attack, bypassing the need to properly attribute and characterise the attack. This would result in a loosening of the requirements to the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter. To constrain the expansion of the Article 51 right Hoisington would have nations decide on a separate categorization of critical national infrastructure that, if attacked, would trigger the aforementioned protection.\nHoisington's approach seems to run contrary to the spirit of Article 51, and international humanitarian law in general. Certainly the unique aspects of cyber attacks must be considered, and the need for a state to be permitted to defend itself is vital, relaxing the attribution requirements present in Article 51 could very\n Ibid at 453.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nwell result in an expansion of conflict. The very aims of Article 51 appear to be the limiting of the frequency and severity of aggressive acts of self-defence, and a loosening of the requirements would run contrary to that objective.\nIt seems clear that an attacking nation would use means to disguise the origins of their attack. The anonymous nature of the internet likely would be one of the main benefits that an attacker would be seeking. Given what we have established regarding the ability of attackers to disguise and engage in \"false flag\" conduct it would not be unreasonable to believe that a relaxation of the attribution requirement could very well lead to attacks on innocent third party states, pulling another nation into the conflict.\nInstead of removing the attribution requirement for certain protected national assets a new approach to evaluating and regulating cyber attacks under international law may be necessary.\n## Suggested improvements\n## Towards qualifying as armed force\nIn order to determine if an attack should be considered an armed attack focus should be centred on the severity of the consequences. One of the main problems that have faced result-oriented tests in the past has been the difficulty\n Supra note 26 at 1175\n Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nin determining what consequences can be actually tied to the cyber attack itself. Basically, how far down the chain do we go looking for the characteristics of an armed attack?\nI would suggest that one might look to domestic criminal law regarding causation to find a starting point. The Supreme Court of Canada have settled on the test of a \"significant contributing cause\"40 with regards to most offences, and a \"substantial and integral cause\"41 when applied to first degree murder. In the case of determining whether death, injury, damage, or destruction can be tied to a cyber attack it seems reasonable to consider whether the attack represented a \"substantial and integral cause of the injury suffered\".\nUse of a modified version of Schmitt's test42 presents an attractive first step:\n1) Severity: Consequences must rise to the level of death, injury, damage, or destruction.\n2) Causation: The damages suffered which meet the first step must be considered substantially and integrally connected to the attack.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n3) Invasiveness: This step would remain largely unchanged. It is important to clarify that the physical actor does not need to cross into the victim state for this step to be met. Rather the attack should be found within the borders, the physical location of the attacker is non-material.\nThe immediacy and directness requirements from Schmitt's test have been superseded by the causation test, while avoiding the problem of unduly constraining the attacked nation. As set out above there are significant problems with attempting to determine the immediate effects of a cyber attack, and the directness step is not required, as the causation test would handle cases where the actus reus is not sufficiently tied to the consequence. The immediacy requirement seems to be onerous without providing much benefit. For example, if an attacking nation were to compromise a control system and implant a logic bomb, which would only trigger months later, causing significant damage and injury, it seems nonsensical to believe that the attack is somehow not an armed attack, simply because one of the consequences were hidden.\nThe measurability requirement and the challenges that it presents have been addressed above. The near impossibility of accurately ascertaining the full consequences of an attack means forcing the measurability requirement would unduly hamstring a state that has been the victim of a cyber attack. By confining\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nthe analysis to the severity of the consequence, the connection between the consequences and the attack, and maintaining the requirement for the attack to occur within the boundaries of the state; a cyber attack can be effectively classified against the armed conflict standard, while making allowances for the challenges the cyber environment presents.\n## Towards determining attribution\nEnsuring that nations that have been subjected to a cyber attack are able to accurately attribute the attack to a particular state actor within a reasonable timeframe benefits the international community as a whole. Allowing a state to accurately attribute an attack reduces the risk of widening the conflict by responding against an innocent third party, and would hold attacking nations more accountable for their actions. A change to the technical infrastructure which allows nations to hide behind the internet is not feasible or even necessarily desirable. Rather an approach that recognizes the overall benefit to international cooperation may be the most workable. The international community has recognized the benefit of independent regulators and inspectors with regards to issues such a nuclear development$^{43}$, as the benefit to all outweighs the intrusion that these agencies present.\nAs set out above, tracking a cyber attack back, through compromised servers, presents a significant problem for attribution. One way of addressing this\n$^{43}$ A prime example being the International Atomic Energy Agency\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nissue would be an international framework, whereby nations found to be hosting a computer or server implicated in an armed attack, would be responsible for conducting an investigation into the offending device. The implicated state would then be responsible for providing an independent regulator with all pertinent data taken from the system, the regulator would be responsible for evaluating the data, and would then turn over the results of the investigation to the state which was attacked.\nAn alternative setup would have the independent regulator actually be provided access to the compromised system, whereby they would conduct an independent investigation themselves, without relying on the host nation to provide them with the data. This approach would present the host nation with a more substantial trespass on their independence, and would likely face more opposition than the first approach.\nCertainly even this approach is not without its pitfalls. Data can be faked, and a host nation could conceivably attempt to point the finger at another by manufacturing data that purports to show that the attack originated elsewhere, and merely passed through their nation. However, a thorough forensic investigation would be likely to uncover discrepancies, and at least trigger the suspicion of both the independent auditor, and the victim state. A criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is not at play here, an implicated state would ultimately be responsible for showing that they were not behind the\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nattack, to the satisfaction of the independent auditors. In the absence of a legitimate defence, Article 51 would be triggered, as it would currently, and the aggrieved state would be able to defend itself pursuant to international law.\nSuch an approach would have the added benefit of providing extra incentive for states to not allow rogue non-state elements to operate within their borders, as it would increase their risk of being implicated in any illegal attack perpetrated by private groups. Certainly an approach as outlined above may present problems regarding timeframe. In the event of a significant attack time may be of essence. While a full investigation may take time, addressing an attack currently being carried out should not. An implicated state must take reasonable efforts to shut down compromised servers as quickly as possible, and any undue delay would be interpreted as showing involvement in the attack, allowing the attribution requirement to be met, and permitting an Article 51 response.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n# Conclusion\nAttacks through cyberspace are a logical development given the increasing significance the internet and wired devices play in our everyday lives. Legal frameworks in general are being challenged by the changes that the global information network is presenting, and international humanitarian law is no exception. Cyber attacks of a significant scale are only in their infancy, but it is better to be ahead of the curve, with a well thought out approach to the issue, than attempting to catch up after the fact.\nThe challenges that international law faces when presented with cyber attacks require a new kind of framework, one that respects the principles that underpin international humanitarian law, while recognizing the need for states to be able address an electronic aggressor. Existing approaches to evaluating a cyber attack either unduly hamstring a nation suffering from the effects of an attack, or would permit an undesirable expansion of armed conflict. In addition to a new legal approach to evaluating cyber attacks a new framework for regulating international responses and investigations to cyber attacks is required. Attributing attacks to particular actors over cyberspace is certainly difficult, but the international community must be careful not to relax the standards too much, or risk losing the protection that it has historically provided.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039"

The application of warfare is certainly no exception to this development. Both state and non-state actors are busy devising new ways of applying technology to carry out attacks on their adversaries, or prevent their adversaries from successfully attacking them. In the past, technology has been used merely to augment or improve the performance or capabilities of traditional military weapons and tools. However, with the increasing level of interconnected devices, attacks that operate purely through digital mediums are becoming increasingly effective.\nTraditionally, International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and the Laws of Armed Conflict (LOAC) have focused on the regulation and governance of kinetic, physical operations. The prospect of significant attacks being carried out through purely electronic means would have been pure fantasy a generation ago, and would not have been envisioned when IHL and LOAC were being developed. The traditional categorization of conflict and of participant action is stretched when applied beyond the physical world. It is the difficulty in categorizing participant action that must be addressed in order to ensure the protections that have been applied in historic conflicts are capable of being applied in the conflicts of the future.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nThis paper will address the question of how a purely electronic event or operation should be evaluated under existing legal paradigms, more specifically, how a state may go about assessing and properly responding to a cyber attack. This paper will not be addressing the use of cyberwarfare techniques as a part of a larger traditional kinetic war; rather the main focus will remain on how a cyber attack can be classified in the absence of traditional warfare operations. As a part of the examination of the classification of cyber attacks, this paper will address whether existing IHL and LOAC are sufficient to meet the challenges of the future digital battlefield, or whether a new approach is required.\n## Background\n### Defining cyber attacks\nTo understand cyber attacks one must notionally understand the medium that it describes. \"Cyberspace\" is a term that originated from science fiction, and today commonly refers to the Internet, or the World Wide Web.¹ While Cyberspace typically is used in reference to the publicly accessible Internet with which the public is familiar, it could also apply to many of the private networks which organizations and governments operate. The US Department of Defence have defined cyberspace as a \"global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer\n¹ Bradley Raboin, \"Corresponding Evolution: International Law and the Emergence of Cyber Warfare\", 31 J Nat'l Ass'n L Jud 602 at 607.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nsystems, and embedded processors and controllers.\"² There are a variety of other definitions that choose different means and wording to ultimately define cyberspace as being a vast network of interconnected computer and telecommunications devices.\nMoving on to cyber attacks specifically, the US Department of Defence defines “cyber operations” in this context as being \"the employment of cyber capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve military objectives or effects in or through cyberspace\".³ Additionally, they define a “computer network attack” as being \"actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves\".⁴ Given that this paper will be addressing cyber attacks that have the possibility of causing harm to more than electronic targets the latter definition will not be sufficient. Taking into account the various definitions and views, for the purpose of this article a cyber attack will refer to “the use of electronic techniques by a state actor to conduct operations through cyberspace with the objective of causing harm to the interests of another state”.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n# A brief history of cyber attacks\n## Pipeline sabotage\nWhile cyber conflict is a relatively new concept in its current form of network intrusions and remote attacks, states have been looking to use digital mediums to stage and carry out attacks going back to at least the cold war era. One particular story that has received a fair amount of press in recent years relates to a Soviet pipeline explosion which occurred in June of 1982. It is alleged that Soviet spies had stolen a computer-control system from a Canadian firm, but unbeknownst to the Soviets, the CIA knew about their plans, and had inserted a \"logic bomb\" into the code of the control system. The system malfunctioned, allowing unsafe operating conditions to develop unchecked, resulting in a massive explosion that apparently was registered by western satellites.⁵ It should be noted however, that Vasily Pchelintsev, the former KGB head of the region, has denied this account.⁶ As with many accounts from that period of time exact details remain contentious.\n⁵ \"War in the fifth domain; cyberwar\" The Economist (3 July 2010). online: Proquest <http: 578452939?accountid=\"10406\" ezproxy.library.dal.ca=\"\" login?url=\"http://search.proquest.com/docview\">\n⁶ Thomas Rid, \"Think Again: Cyberwar\" Foreign Policy (March/April 2012), online: Think Again: <http: 02=\"\" 2012=\"\" 27=\"\" articles=\"\" cyberwar=\"\" www.foreignpolicy.com=\"\">\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039</http:></http:>\n# 2007 Attacks on Estonia\nIn 2007, Estonia was planning on moving a WWII-era Russian grave, much to the chagrin of Russia and the Russian people. On April 27, 2007 a series of significant cyber attacks hit Estonian web servers, focusing on banks, government organizations, and media. While it was a significant attack in terms of the effect (knocking out most significant Estonian based websites) it was actually a fairly simple attack, known as distributed denial of service, whereby the sites were basically flooded with requests, making it impossible for them to respond to legitimate users.⁷\nMembers of the Estonian government blamed Russia for the attacks, something Russia denied. To this day it is still unclear who actually perpetrated the attacks. Tracing of some of the network traffic led to Russian IP addresses; however, that unfortunately is not always conclusive, and does not necessarily point to the ultimate origin of the attack.⁸ Whether it was Russian government actors, or simply private citizens is still a question of great debate. Actually conclusively attributing the attack to a particular state actor has proven exceedingly difficult for Estonia, a theme that will be explored further in this article.\n⁷ “Estonia looks to cyber defence, after attacks”, Communications Engineer 5:4 (2007) 3, online <http: ieeexplore.ieee.org=\"\" stamp=\"\" stamp.jsp?tp=\"&amp;arnumber=4444805\">⁸ Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039</http:>\n# Stuxnet\nStuxnet may very well represent an evolution in cyberwarfare. The name Stuxnet refers to a computer worm that was discovered in June of 2010. Unlike most computer malware Stuxnet was designed neither to provide illicit access, nor to steal information. Instead of targeting credit card information or banking information as is usual amongst malware, Stuxnet searched for a very specific operating environment when it infected a machine, and would actually shut itself down if it did not find the correct conditions.⁹\nOnce the worm found the proper set of conditions were present on the network that it infected, it would push out changes to a device which controlled pieces of industrial machinery, altering the operating conditions of the machinery, periodically speeding up or slowing the ordinary operating speed of attached motors. The worm even went so far as to record what the ordinary operating conditions were, and spoof that data back to operators, so they would not realize anything was amiss.¹⁰\nBased on the conditions and the hardware that the worm searched for it has been widely speculated that Iranian nuclear facilities were the target of the attack, more specifically the Bushehr nuclear power plant as well as the Natanz uranium enrichment facility. The level of complexity that was present in the\n⁹ Parliamentary Information and Research Service, The Stuxnet Worm: Just Another Computer Attack or a Game Changer? by Holly Porteous (Ottawa: Library of Parliament, October 2010) at 1.\n¹⁰ Ibid at 2.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nStuxnet worm has led researchers to conclude that the most likely originators of the attack would have been a State actor. The fact that Stuxnet was designed to minimize the collateral damage, whereas malware traditionally targets the widest group possible, adds credence to this assertion. Given the politics, as well as attributes found in the worm, blame has largely been levelled on Israel and the United States.¹¹\n## The current paradigm\n## Article 2(4)\nGenerally speaking, under international law a military attack is prima facie illegal¹², subject to acts of self-defence¹³ or by authorization of the UN¹⁴. The UN Charter defines this prohibition as being:\n4. All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.¹⁵ (emphasis added)\n¹¹ Ibid.\n¹² Charter of the United Nations, 26 June 1945, Can TS 1945 No 7 2(4), Article 2(4).\n¹³ Ibid Article 51.\n¹⁴ Ibid Chapter VII.\n¹⁵ Supra note 12.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nClearly, the salient question becomes “what constitutes a use of force?” To better examine this question one must first consider what has previously been considered to be a use of force, and how those determinations have been made.\nIn 1947 the International Court of Justice (ICJ) had the opportunity to lend guidance on the interpretation of Article 2(4) in the Corfu Channel¹⁶ case. The matter before the court involved an incident between elements of the British Royal Navy and Albania. After a series of incidents in the channel, which was within Albanian territorial waters, but which was claimed as an area of free passage by the British, Britain sent four warships through the channel, two of which struck mines laid by the Albanians. The ICJ ultimately found that by sending warships into Albanian territorial waters Britain did violate international law, but the mere fact that the warships were readied to attack did not constitute use of force. In this case the court took a fairly narrow view of the interpretation of use of force, and allowed demonstration of force, and preparation to defend, as not falling under the ambit of use of force.¹⁷\nThe manner in which Article 2(4) was written and developed also provides guidance on what should be considered force and what should not. During the drafting of what would become Article 2(4) a number of nations proposed alternate phrasing that would have likely resulted in a more expansive definition.\n¹⁶ Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania),  ICJ Rep 244.\n¹⁷ Stanimir A. Alexandrov, Self-defense against the use of force in international law (Boston: Kluwer Law International 1996) at 124.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nIran proposed that direct and indirect political pressure be banned, and Brazil suggested that threats of force, and economic pressure be explicitly included as well.¹⁸ All of these suggestions were ultimately voted down, with the current form eventually being settled on. The fact that more expansive definitions that explicitly included alternate forms of force were rejected is illustrative, and supports a more narrow reading of Article 2(4).\nIt seems then, when considering different types of force, political, economic, and armed, only the last can be considered to be sufficient to trigger Article 2(4). Based on the above, there appears to be two approaches to having a cyber attack be sufficient to trigger Article 2(4). One could advocate an expansion of the interpretation of the section to include cyber force, taking into account that expansions have been rejected before. Alternatively, Article 2(4) could be addressed by having a cyber attack be included under the armed force already prohibited.¹⁹\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n# Article 51\nArticle 51 provides for a state's right to self-defence under international law:\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.²⁰\nIt is important to recognize the relationship between Article 51 and Article 2(4). Article 51 gives the right to self-defence when an armed attack is perpetrated against a nation, and Article 2(4) declares that a use of force will be considered illegal, with the jurisprudence focusing on an armed attack. It follows that any armed attack will be considered a use of force under Article 2(4) and therefore\n²⁰ Supra note 13.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nprima facie illegal. However, it does not follow that any attack rising to the level of a use of force under Article 2(4) will necessarily be considered to be an armed attack under Article 51.²¹ The way the provisions have been interpreted, an armed attack between the two are not necessarily the same, there is a gap between what is covered by Article 51, and what is covered by Article 2(4). What this means is that simply getting “in the door” under Article 2(4) does not necessarily allow a state access to the remedies provided by Article 51. Violation of Article 2(4) might declare an attack illegal, but it does not automatically engage Article 51. This paper is primarily concerned with the ability of a state to defend itself, so focus will be placed largely upon when a cyber attack should be elevated to the level of an armed attack under Article 51.\nWhen considering the language differences between Article 2(4) and Article 51 in the cyber context, one possible difficulty immediately comes to the forefront. The wording \"use of force\" in Article 2(4) leaves itself open to interpretation regarding what kind of force could qualify, whereas the use of \"armed force\" in Article 51 does suggest a substantially narrower approach.²² Article 51 was clearly designed with traditional kinetic operations in mind; this is understandable, as the technological developments which have led to the issue of military cyber attacks are a recent phenomenon.\n²¹ Michael N Schmitt, “Cyber Operations in International Law: The Use of Force, Collective Security, Self-Defense, and Armed Conflicts” in Committee on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options, eds, Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for U.S. Policy (Washington: The National Academies Press, 2010) 151 at 163.\n²² Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nIn order to have a cyber attack qualify under this approach then, it appears as though one must assess the consequences of the attack, and compare them to what consequences have traditionally triggered self-defence rights. Analysis of past events has shown that generally death, injury, damage, or destruction has been required to meet the armed attack threshold.²³\nOnce an armed attack is encountered and Article 51 is engaged any response needs to meet certain conditions in order to be considered legitimate; necessity, proportionality, and immediacy.²⁴ Matthew Hoisington sets out the details as being:\nTo fulfil the principle of necessity the state must attribute the attack to a specific source, characterize the intent behind the attack, and conclude that the state must use force in response. The principle of proportionality requires that the force used in the response be proportional to the original attack. The requirement of immediacy prohibits a response from occurring after too much time has passed. With regard to immediacy as a general criterion, however, no\n²³ Ibid at 164.\n²⁴ Matthew Hoisington, “Cyberwarfare and the Use of Force Giving Rise to the Right of Self-Defense” (2009) 32:2 Boston College International &amp; Comparative Law Review 439 at 452.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nrequirement exists for defensive action to be exercised (or risk forfeiture), immediately following an armed attack.²⁵\nThe ability of a state to assess what response is proportional, and respond within an appropriate timeframe flows from its ability to properly attribute and characterise an attack. Attribution in particular is a different kind of animal in the cyber context.\n## Attribution Issues\nAttribution, meaning how the responsibility for an attack is attached to a particular state²⁶ presents a number of novel considerations when operating within the cyber context. Attribution is necessary in order to trigger the entitlement of a responding state to answer with countermeasures against the offending state.²⁷ In the cyber context attribution immediately rises to the forefront of issues presented. In a global interconnected network such as the internet, attacks can be launched from anywhere. The internet itself consists of distributed nodes, and traffic does not follow a straight-line pattern, network traffic can be\n²⁵ Ibid.\n²⁶ Levi Grosswald, “Cyberattack Attribution Matters under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter” (2011) 36 Brook J Int'l L 1153 at 1153.\n²⁷ Jorn Griebel &amp; Milan Plucken, “New Developments Regarding the Rules of Attribution? The International Court of Justice's Decision in Bosnia v Serbia” (2008) 21 Leiden Journal of International Law 601 at 604.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nsent on more circuitous routes²⁸, which do not conform to geographic lines or patterns.\nThe distributed nature of the makeup and structure of the internet which leads to the circuitous nature of online traffic, can be exploited to mask the activities, and the origin, by those who possess the requisite skill and knowledge. It is not as simple as tracing an attack step by step back to the beginning, as attackers are able to use compromised servers and personal computers as launching points²⁹, often without the victim being aware that their system has been hijacked. Using strategies such as this it is clearly possible for blame to be levied where it is undeserved. An attack could be traced back to servers located in China, but that does not necessarily mean that the attack originated in China. The cyber traffic could still have crisscrossed the globe multiple times before finally arriving at the ultimate origin point. In fact, this obfuscation of network traffic could be used as a kind of \"false flag\", designed to trick the victim into believing their attacker was a third party.³⁰ Deliberately spreading the seeds of false information is certainly within the ambit of global politics and espionage.\nSifting through the misinformation and obfuscation requires a time intensive investigation. Compromised servers need to be accessed and\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n28 L Subramanian, V N Padmanabhan, &amp; R H Katz, “Geographic Properties of Internet Routing” (Paper delivered at the USENIX Technical Conference, Monterey, CA, USA, 2002), online: <http: en-us=\"\" pages=\"\" padmanab=\"\" papers=\"\" research.microsoft.com=\"\" usenix2002.pdf=\"\">\n29 Supra note 26 at 1167.\n30 Ibid at 1169.\n14</http:>\nexamined to determine the next traffic path that needs to be followed. Simply accessing the compromised systems could be a challenge in and of itself. Depending on where the hijacked servers are located a state may be unable to obtain physical access, and may have to rely on compromising the systems themselves in order to conduct a proper forensic analysis. Without a full and thorough investigation of this type actual attribution is impossible, as a preliminary analysis could only reasonably provide a conclusion based on inferences and best guesses.³¹\n## Characterization issues\nThe ability to assess an appropriate and proportional response is a vital part of the Article 51 evaluation. In order to craft a proportional response a state first needs to know what the attack actually consisted of. Many of the factors that are considered by states in the event of a kinetic attack may be difficult or completely impossible to fully understand in the immediate aftermath of a cyber attack.³² Simply characterizing the event as an attack in the state versus state sense, as opposed to a criminal or terrorist attack is extremely difficult in the absence of physical indicators that can be used in traditional cases.\n³¹ Ibid.\n³² Ibid at 1170.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n# Inclusion under armed force\nTo consider inclusion of cyber attacks under armed force a different categorization model needs to be used. Instead of focusing on the medium, attention must turn to the effect. International law scholar Michael Schmitt³³ has proposed the following loose test with the aim of distinguishing political or economic pressure from armed force:\n1) Severity: Armed attacks threaten physical injury or destruction of property to a much greater degree than other forms of coercion. Physical well-being usually occupies the apex of the human hierarchy of need.\n2) Immediacy: The negative consequences of armed coercion, or threat thereof, usually occur with great immediacy, while those of other forms of coercion develop more slowly. Thus, the opportunity for the target state or the international community to seek peaceful accommodation is hampered in the former case.\n3) Directness: The consequences of armed coercion are more directly tied to the actus reus than in other forms of\n³³ See http://www.usnwc.edu/Academics/Faculty/Michael-Schmitt.aspx\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\ncoercion, which often depend on numerous contributory factors to operate. Thus, the prohibition on force precludes negative consequences with greater certainty.\n4) Invasiveness: In armed coercion, the act causing the harm usually crosses into the target state, whereas in economic warfare the acts generally occur beyond the target's borders. As a result, even though armed and economic acts may have roughly similar consequences, the former represents a greater intrusion on the rights of the target state and, therefore, is more likely to disrupt international stability.\n5) Measurability: While the consequences of armed coercion are usually easy to ascertain (e.g., a certain level of destruction), the actual negative consequences of other forms of coercion are harder to measure. This fact renders the appropriateness of community condemnation, and the degree of vehemence contained therein, less suspect in the case of armed force.\n6) Presumptive Legitimacy: In most cases, whether under domestic or international law, the application of violence is\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\ndeemed illegitimate absent some specific exception such as self-defence. The cognitive approach is prohibitory. By contrast, most other forms of coercion—again in the domestic and international sphere—are presumptively lawful, absent a prohibition to the contrary. The cognitive approach is permissive. Thus, the consequences of armed coercion are presumptively impermissible, whereas those of other coercive acts are not (as a very generalized rule).³⁴\nThe goal of Schmitt's test is to develop a set of characteristics that will be found in a typical use of armed force. By measuring the consequence of a cyber attack against these characteristics one would theoretically be able to distinguish between what should be considered a use of armed force and what should be left to other domestic or international law provisions. Ultimately, the idea is that there will be no difference between a kinetic attack that brings down an airplane, or a cyber attack that does the same, the consequences of the attack are the same, regardless of the medium chosen.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n³⁴ Michael Schmitt, \"Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law. Thoughts on a Normative Framework\" (1999) 37 Colum J Transnat'l L 885 at 914.\n# Assessment difficulties\nThere are problems that arise with the use of Schmitt's consequence-based categorization framework. One issue raised by Matthew Hoisington applies to the final factor to be considered, presumptive legitimacy. He points out that determining whether the attack is legitimate under international law by asking whether the attack was legitimate, is essentially putting the cart before the horse.³⁵ Additionally, Hoisington turns to the attribution issue addressed above, pointing out that unlike a traditional kinetic attack, the ultimate consequence of an cyber attack may be difficult to ascertain immediately afterwards. This will present a problem in determining the permitted response under international law, a deficiency that will likely plague most approaches that designed to be used after an attack.³⁶\nA quick consequence-based analysis of a cyber attack will likely catch the so called \"low hanging fruit\", attacks that closely resemble traditional military attacks. Cyber attacks that directly target devices which immediately cause death, injury, damage or destruction which is clearly identifiable by the victim do not present significant categorization challenges, but unfortunately an attack will not necessarily be confined to these black and white situations.\n³⁵ Supra note 24.\n³⁶ Ibid\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nThe ultimate effect of a cyber attack may not be immediately apparent, and may in fact be deliberately disguised in order to cause the damage to propagate and spread in the way that the attacker desires. This has consequences regarding qualification under Article 51, as well as the proportionality consideration that a state must undertake. We are left asking, how far down the chain of causation must we go when assessing an attack?\nTo address the unique issues that cyber attacks present with regards to assessment, Hoisington advocates for a presumptive exception to be created for states that have been the victim of a cyber attack. His proposal would create protection under international law for a state that acts in good faith to respond to a cyber attack, bypassing the need to properly attribute and characterise the attack. This would result in a loosening of the requirements to the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter. To constrain the expansion of the Article 51 right Hoisington would have nations decide on a separate categorization of critical national infrastructure that, if attacked, would trigger the aforementioned protection.³⁷\nHoisington's approach seems to run contrary to the spirit of Article 51, and international humanitarian law in general. Certainly the unique aspects of cyber attacks must be considered, and the need for a state to be permitted to defend itself is vital, relaxing the attribution requirements present in Article 51 could very\n³⁷ Ibid at 453.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nwell result in an expansion of conflict. The very aims of Article 51 appear to be the limiting of the frequency and severity of aggressive acts of self-defence, and a loosening of the requirements would run contrary to that objective.³⁸\nIt seems clear that an attacking nation would use means to disguise the origins of their attack. The anonymous nature of the internet likely would be one of the main benefits that an attacker would be seeking. Given what we have established regarding the ability of attackers to disguise and engage in \"false flag\" conduct it would not be unreasonable to believe that a relaxation of the attribution requirement could very well lead to attacks on innocent third party states, pulling another nation into the conflict.³⁹\nInstead of removing the attribution requirement for certain protected national assets a new approach to evaluating and regulating cyber attacks under international law may be necessary.\n## Suggested improvements\n## Towards qualifying as armed force\nIn order to determine if an attack should be considered an armed attack focus should be centred on the severity of the consequences. One of the main problems that have faced result-oriented tests in the past has been the difficulty\n³⁸ Supra note 26 at 1175\n³⁹ Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nin determining what consequences can be actually tied to the cyber attack itself. Basically, how far down the chain do we go looking for the characteristics of an armed attack?\nI would suggest that one might look to domestic criminal law regarding causation to find a starting point. The Supreme Court of Canada have settled on the test of a \"significant contributing cause\"40 with regards to most offences, and a \"substantial and integral cause\"41 when applied to first degree murder. In the case of determining whether death, injury, damage, or destruction can be tied to a cyber attack it seems reasonable to consider whether the attack represented a \"substantial and integral cause of the injury suffered\".\nUse of a modified version of Schmitt's test42 presents an attractive first step:\n1) Severity: Consequences must rise to the level of death, injury, damage, or destruction.\n2) Causation: The damages suffered which meet the first step must be considered substantially and integrally connected to the attack.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n3) Invasiveness: This step would remain largely unchanged. It is important to clarify that the physical actor does not need to cross into the victim state for this step to be met. Rather the attack should be found within the borders, the physical location of the attacker is non-material.\nThe immediacy and directness requirements from Schmitt's test have been superseded by the causation test, while avoiding the problem of unduly constraining the attacked nation. As set out above there are significant problems with attempting to determine the immediate effects of a cyber attack, and the directness step is not required, as the causation test would handle cases where the actus reus is not sufficiently tied to the consequence. The immediacy requirement seems to be onerous without providing much benefit. For example, if an attacking nation were to compromise a control system and implant a logic bomb, which would only trigger months later, causing significant damage and injury, it seems nonsensical to believe that the attack is somehow not an armed attack, simply because one of the consequences were hidden.\nThe measurability requirement and the challenges that it presents have been addressed above. The near impossibility of accurately ascertaining the full consequences of an attack means forcing the measurability requirement would unduly hamstring a state that has been the victim of a cyber attack. By confining\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nthe analysis to the severity of the consequence, the connection between the consequences and the attack, and maintaining the requirement for the attack to occur within the boundaries of the state; a cyber attack can be effectively classified against the armed conflict standard, while making allowances for the challenges the cyber environment presents.\n## Towards determining attribution\nEnsuring that nations that have been subjected to a cyber attack are able to accurately attribute the attack to a particular state actor within a reasonable timeframe benefits the international community as a whole. Allowing a state to accurately attribute an attack reduces the risk of widening the conflict by responding against an innocent third party, and would hold attacking nations more accountable for their actions. A change to the technical infrastructure which allows nations to hide behind the internet is not feasible or even necessarily desirable. Rather an approach that recognizes the overall benefit to international cooperation may be the most workable. The international community has recognized the benefit of independent regulators and inspectors with regards to issues such a nuclear development$^{43}$, as the benefit to all outweighs the intrusion that these agencies present.\nAs set out above, tracking a cyber attack back, through compromised servers, presents a significant problem for attribution. One way of addressing this\n$^{43}$ A prime example being the International Atomic Energy Agency\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nissue would be an international framework, whereby nations found to be hosting a computer or server implicated in an armed attack, would be responsible for conducting an investigation into the offending device. The implicated state would then be responsible for providing an independent regulator with all pertinent data taken from the system, the regulator would be responsible for evaluating the data, and would then turn over the results of the investigation to the state which was attacked.\nAn alternative setup would have the independent regulator actually be provided access to the compromised system, whereby they would conduct an independent investigation themselves, without relying on the host nation to provide them with the data. This approach would present the host nation with a more substantial trespass on their independence, and would likely face more opposition than the first approach.\nCertainly even this approach is not without its pitfalls. Data can be faked, and a host nation could conceivably attempt to point the finger at another by manufacturing data that purports to show that the attack originated elsewhere, and merely passed through their nation. However, a thorough forensic investigation would be likely to uncover discrepancies, and at least trigger the suspicion of both the independent auditor, and the victim state. A criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is not at play here, an implicated state would ultimately be responsible for showing that they were not behind the\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\nattack, to the satisfaction of the independent auditors. In the absence of a legitimate defence, Article 51 would be triggered, as it would currently, and the aggrieved state would be able to defend itself pursuant to international law.\nSuch an approach would have the added benefit of providing extra incentive for states to not allow rogue non-state elements to operate within their borders, as it would increase their risk of being implicated in any illegal attack perpetrated by private groups. Certainly an approach as outlined above may present problems regarding timeframe. In the event of a significant attack time may be of essence. While a full investigation may take time, addressing an attack currently being carried out should not. An implicated state must take reasonable efforts to shut down compromised servers as quickly as possible, and any undue delay would be interpreted as showing involvement in the attack, allowing the attribution requirement to be met, and permitting an Article 51 response.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039\n# Conclusion\nAttacks through cyberspace are a logical development given the increasing significance the internet and wired devices play in our everyday lives. Legal frameworks in general are being challenged by the changes that the global information network is presenting, and international humanitarian law is no exception. Cyber attacks of a significant scale are only in their infancy, but it is better to be ahead of the curve, with a well thought out approach to the issue, than attempting to catch up after the fact.\nThe challenges that international law faces when presented with cyber attacks require a new kind of framework, one that respects the principles that underpin international humanitarian law, while recognizing the need for states to be able address an electronic aggressor. Existing approaches to evaluating a cyber attack either unduly hamstring a nation suffering from the effects of an attack, or would permit an undesirable expansion of armed conflict. In addition to a new legal approach to evaluating cyber attacks a new framework for regulating international responses and investigations to cyber attacks is required. Attributing attacks to particular actors over cyberspace is certainly difficult, but the international community must be careful not to relax the standards too much, or risk losing the protection that it has historically provided.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039"

The application of warfare is certainly no exception to this development. Both state and non-state actors are busy devising new ways of applying technology to carry out attacks on their adversaries, or prevent their adversaries from successfully attacking them. In the past, technology has been used merely to augment or improve the performance or capabilities of traditional military weapons and tools. However, with the increasing level of interconnected devices, attacks that operate purely through digital mediums are becoming increasingly effective.\nTraditionally, International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and the Laws of Armed Conflict (LOAC) have focused on the regulation and governance of kinetic, physical operations. The prospect of significant attacks being carried out through purely electronic means would have been pure fantasy a generation ago, and would not have been envisioned when IHL and LOAC were being developed. The traditional categorization of conflict and of participant action is stretched when applied beyond the physical world. It is the difficulty in categorizing participant action that must be addressed in order to ensure the protections that have been applied in historic conflicts are capable of being applied in the conflicts of the future.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039 This paper will address the question of how a purely electronic event or operation should be evaluated under existing legal paradigms, more specifically, how a state may go about assessing and properly responding to a cyber attack. This paper will not be addressing the use of cyberwarfare techniques as a part of a larger traditional kinetic war; rather the main focus will remain on how a cyber attack can be classified in the absence of traditional warfare operations. As a part of the examination of the classification of cyber attacks, this paper will address whether existing IHL and LOAC are sufficient to meet the challenges of the future digital battlefield, or whether a new approach is required.\n## Background ### Defining cyber attacks To understand cyber attacks one must notionally understand the medium that it describes.\"Cyberspace\"is a term that originated from science fiction, and today commonly refers to the Internet, or the World Wide Web.¹ While Cyberspace typically is used in reference to the publicly accessible Internet with which the public is familiar, it could also apply to many of the private networks which organizations and governments operate. The US Department of Defence have defined cyberspace as a\"global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer ¹ Bradley Raboin,\"Corresponding Evolution: International Law and the Emergence of Cyber Warfare\", 31 J Nat'l Ass'n L Jud 602 at 607.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039 systems, and embedded processors and controllers.\"² There are a variety of other definitions that choose different means and wording to ultimately define cyberspace as being a vast network of interconnected computer and telecommunications devices.\nMoving on to cyber attacks specifically, the US Department of Defence defines “cyber operations” in this context as being\"the employment of cyber capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve military objectives or effects in or through cyberspace\".³ Additionally, they define a “computer network attack” as being\"actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves\".⁴ Given that this paper will be addressing cyber attacks that have the possibility of causing harm to more than electronic targets the latter definition will not be sufficient. Taking into account the various definitions and views, for the purpose of this article a cyber attack will refer to “the use of electronic techniques by a state actor to conduct operations through cyberspace with the objective of causing harm to the interests of another state”.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039 # A brief history of cyber attacks ## Pipeline sabotage While cyber conflict is a relatively new concept in its current form of network intrusions and remote attacks, states have been looking to use digital mediums to stage and carry out attacks going back to at least the cold war era. One particular story that has received a fair amount of press in recent years relates to a Soviet pipeline explosion which occurred in June of 1982. It is alleged that Soviet spies had stolen a computer-control system from a Canadian firm, but unbeknownst to the Soviets, the CIA knew about their plans, and had inserted a\"logic bomb\"into the code of the control system. The system malfunctioned, allowing unsafe operating conditions to develop unchecked, resulting in a massive explosion that apparently was registered by western satellites.⁵ It should be noted however, that Vasily Pchelintsev, the former KGB head of the region, has denied this account.⁶ As with many accounts from that period of time exact details remain contentious.\n⁵\"War in the fifth domain; cyberwar\"The Economist (3 July 2010). online: Proquest <http: 578452939?accountid=\"10406\"ezproxy.library.dal.ca=\"\"login?url=\"http://search.proquest.com/docview\"> ⁶ Thomas Rid,\"Think Again: Cyberwar\"Foreign Policy (March/April 2012), online: Think Again: <http: 02=\"\"2012=\"\"27=\"\"articles=\"\"cyberwar=\"\"www.foreignpolicy.com=\"\"> Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039</http:></http:> # 2007 Attacks on Estonia In 2007, Estonia was planning on moving a WWII-era Russian grave, much to the chagrin of Russia and the Russian people. On April 27, 2007 a series of significant cyber attacks hit Estonian web servers, focusing on banks, government organizations, and media. While it was a significant attack in terms of the effect (knocking out most significant Estonian based websites) it was actually a fairly simple attack, known as distributed denial of service, whereby the sites were basically flooded with requests, making it impossible for them to respond to legitimate users.⁷ Members of the Estonian government blamed Russia for the attacks, something Russia denied. To this day it is still unclear who actually perpetrated the attacks. Tracing of some of the network traffic led to Russian IP addresses; however, that unfortunately is not always conclusive, and does not necessarily point to the ultimate origin of the attack.⁸ Whether it was Russian government actors, or simply private citizens is still a question of great debate. Actually conclusively attributing the attack to a particular state actor has proven exceedingly difficult for Estonia, a theme that will be explored further in this article.\n⁷ “Estonia looks to cyber defence, after attacks”, Communications Engineer 5:4 (2007) 3, online <http: ieeexplore.ieee.org=\"\"stamp=\"\"stamp.jsp?tp=\"&amp;arnumber=4444805\">⁸ Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039</http:> # Stuxnet Stuxnet may very well represent an evolution in cyberwarfare. The name Stuxnet refers to a computer worm that was discovered in June of 2010. Unlike most computer malware Stuxnet was designed neither to provide illicit access, nor to steal information. Instead of targeting credit card information or banking information as is usual amongst malware, Stuxnet searched for a very specific operating environment when it infected a machine, and would actually shut itself down if it did not find the correct conditions.⁹ Once the worm found the proper set of conditions were present on the network that it infected, it would push out changes to a device which controlled pieces of industrial machinery, altering the operating conditions of the machinery, periodically speeding up or slowing the ordinary operating speed of attached motors. The worm even went so far as to record what the ordinary operating conditions were, and spoof that data back to operators, so they would not realize anything was amiss.¹⁰ Based on the conditions and the hardware that the worm searched for it has been widely speculated that Iranian nuclear facilities were the target of the attack, more specifically the Bushehr nuclear power plant as well as the Natanz uranium enrichment facility. The level of complexity that was present in the ⁹ Parliamentary Information and Research Service, The Stuxnet Worm: Just Another Computer Attack or a Game Changer? by Holly Porteous (Ottawa: Library of Parliament, October 2010) at 1.\n¹⁰ Ibid at 2.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039 Stuxnet worm has led researchers to conclude that the most likely originators of the attack would have been a State actor. The fact that Stuxnet was designed to minimize the collateral damage, whereas malware traditionally targets the widest group possible, adds credence to this assertion. Given the politics, as well as attributes found in the worm, blame has largely been levelled on Israel and the United States.¹¹ ## The current paradigm ## Article 2(4) Generally speaking, under international law a military attack is prima facie illegal¹², subject to acts of self-defence¹³ or by authorization of the UN¹⁴. The UN Charter defines this prohibition as being: ¹¹ Ibid.\n¹² Charter of the United Nations, 26 June 1945, Can TS 1945 No 7 2(4), Article 2(4).\n¹³ Ibid Article 51.\n¹⁴ Ibid Chapter VII.\n¹⁵ Supra note 12.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039 Clearly, the salient question becomes “what constitutes a use of force?” To better examine this question one must first consider what has previously been considered to be a use of force, and how those determinations have been made.\nIn 1947 the International Court of Justice (ICJ) had the opportunity to lend guidance on the interpretation of Article 2(4) in the Corfu Channel¹⁶ case. The matter before the court involved an incident between elements of the British Royal Navy and Albania. After a series of incidents in the channel, which was within Albanian territorial waters, but which was claimed as an area of free passage by the British, Britain sent four warships through the channel, two of which struck mines laid by the Albanians. The ICJ ultimately found that by sending warships into Albanian territorial waters Britain did violate international law, but the mere fact that the warships were readied to attack did not constitute use of force. In this case the court took a fairly narrow view of the interpretation of use of force, and allowed demonstration of force, and preparation to defend, as not falling under the ambit of use of force.¹⁷ The manner in which Article 2(4) was written and developed also provides guidance on what should be considered force and what should not. During the drafting of what would become Article 2(4) a number of nations proposed alternate phrasing that would have likely resulted in a more expansive definition.\n¹⁶ Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania), [1949] ICJ Rep 244.\n¹⁷ Stanimir A. Alexandrov, Self-defense against the use of force in international law (Boston: Kluwer Law International 1996) at 124.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039 Iran proposed that direct and indirect political pressure be banned, and Brazil suggested that threats of force, and economic pressure be explicitly included as well.¹⁸ All of these suggestions were ultimately voted down, with the current form eventually being settled on. The fact that more expansive definitions that explicitly included alternate forms of force were rejected is illustrative, and supports a more narrow reading of Article 2(4).\nIt seems then, when considering different types of force, political, economic, and armed, only the last can be considered to be sufficient to trigger Article 2(4). Based on the above, there appears to be two approaches to having a cyber attack be sufficient to trigger Article 2(4). One could advocate an expansion of the interpretation of the section to include cyber force, taking into account that expansions have been rejected before. Alternatively, Article 2(4) could be addressed by having a cyber attack be included under the armed force already prohibited.¹⁹ Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039 # Article 51 Article 51 provides for a state's right to self-defence under international law: Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.²⁰ It is important to recognize the relationship between Article 51 and Article 2(4). Article 51 gives the right to self-defence when an armed attack is perpetrated against a nation, and Article 2(4) declares that a use of force will be considered illegal, with the jurisprudence focusing on an armed attack. It follows that any armed attack will be considered a use of force under Article 2(4) and therefore ²⁰ Supra note 13.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039 prima facie illegal. However, it does not follow that any attack rising to the level of a use of force under Article 2(4) will necessarily be considered to be an armed attack under Article 51.²¹ The way the provisions have been interpreted, an armed attack between the two are not necessarily the same, there is a gap between what is covered by Article 51, and what is covered by Article 2(4). What this means is that simply getting “in the door” under Article 2(4) does not necessarily allow a state access to the remedies provided by Article 51. Violation of Article 2(4) might declare an attack illegal, but it does not automatically engage Article 51. This paper is primarily concerned with the ability of a state to defend itself, so focus will be placed largely upon when a cyber attack should be elevated to the level of an armed attack under Article 51.\nWhen considering the language differences between Article 2(4) and Article 51 in the cyber context, one possible difficulty immediately comes to the forefront. The wording\"use of force\"in Article 2(4) leaves itself open to interpretation regarding what kind of force could qualify, whereas the use of\"armed force\"in Article 51 does suggest a substantially narrower approach.²² Article 51 was clearly designed with traditional kinetic operations in mind; this is understandable, as the technological developments which have led to the issue of military cyber attacks are a recent phenomenon.\n²¹ Michael N Schmitt, “Cyber Operations in International Law: The Use of Force, Collective Security, Self-Defense, and Armed Conflicts” in Committee on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options, eds, Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for U.S. Policy (Washington: The National Academies Press, 2010) 151 at 163.\n²² Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039 In order to have a cyber attack qualify under this approach then, it appears as though one must assess the consequences of the attack, and compare them to what consequences have traditionally triggered self-defence rights. Analysis of past events has shown that generally death, injury, damage, or destruction has been required to meet the armed attack threshold.²³ Once an armed attack is encountered and Article 51 is engaged any response needs to meet certain conditions in order to be considered legitimate; necessity, proportionality, and immediacy.²⁴ Matthew Hoisington sets out the details as being: To fulfil the principle of necessity the state must attribute the attack to a specific source, characterize the intent behind the attack, and conclude that the state must use force in response. The principle of proportionality requires that the force used in the response be proportional to the original attack. The requirement of immediacy prohibits a response from occurring after too much time has passed. With regard to immediacy as a general criterion, however, no ²³ Ibid at 164.\n²⁴ Matthew Hoisington, “Cyberwarfare and the Use of Force Giving Rise to the Right of Self-Defense” (2009) 32:2 Boston College International &amp; Comparative Law Review 439 at 452.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039 requirement exists for defensive action to be exercised (or risk forfeiture), immediately following an armed attack.²⁵ The ability of a state to assess what response is proportional, and respond within an appropriate timeframe flows from its ability to properly attribute and characterise an attack. Attribution in particular is a different kind of animal in the cyber context.\n## Attribution Issues Attribution, meaning how the responsibility for an attack is attached to a particular state²⁶ presents a number of novel considerations when operating within the cyber context. Attribution is necessary in order to trigger the entitlement of a responding state to answer with countermeasures against the offending state.²⁷ In the cyber context attribution immediately rises to the forefront of issues presented. In a global interconnected network such as the internet, attacks can be launched from anywhere. The internet itself consists of distributed nodes, and traffic does not follow a straight-line pattern, network traffic can be ²⁵ Ibid.\n²⁶ Levi Grosswald, “Cyberattack Attribution Matters under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter” (2011) 36 Brook J Int'l L 1153 at 1153.\n²⁷ Jorn Griebel &amp; Milan Plucken, “New Developments Regarding the Rules of Attribution? The International Court of Justice's Decision in Bosnia v Serbia” (2008) 21 Leiden Journal of International Law 601 at 604.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039 sent on more circuitous routes²⁸, which do not conform to geographic lines or patterns.\nThe distributed nature of the makeup and structure of the internet which leads to the circuitous nature of online traffic, can be exploited to mask the activities, and the origin, by those who possess the requisite skill and knowledge. It is not as simple as tracing an attack step by step back to the beginning, as attackers are able to use compromised servers and personal computers as launching points²⁹, often without the victim being aware that their system has been hijacked. Using strategies such as this it is clearly possible for blame to be levied where it is undeserved. An attack could be traced back to servers located in China, but that does not necessarily mean that the attack originated in China. The cyber traffic could still have crisscrossed the globe multiple times before finally arriving at the ultimate origin point. In fact, this obfuscation of network traffic could be used as a kind of\"false flag\", designed to trick the victim into believing their attacker was a third party.³⁰ Deliberately spreading the seeds of false information is certainly within the ambit of global politics and espionage.\nSifting through the misinformation and obfuscation requires a time intensive investigation. Compromised servers need to be accessed and Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039 14</http:> examined to determine the next traffic path that needs to be followed. Simply accessing the compromised systems could be a challenge in and of itself. Depending on where the hijacked servers are located a state may be unable to obtain physical access, and may have to rely on compromising the systems themselves in order to conduct a proper forensic analysis. Without a full and thorough investigation of this type actual attribution is impossible, as a preliminary analysis could only reasonably provide a conclusion based on inferences and best guesses.³¹ ## Characterization issues The ability to assess an appropriate and proportional response is a vital part of the Article 51 evaluation. In order to craft a proportional response a state first needs to know what the attack actually consisted of. Many of the factors that are considered by states in the event of a kinetic attack may be difficult or completely impossible to fully understand in the immediate aftermath of a cyber attack.³² Simply characterizing the event as an attack in the state versus state sense, as opposed to a criminal or terrorist attack is extremely difficult in the absence of physical indicators that can be used in traditional cases.\n³¹ Ibid.\n³² Ibid at 1170.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039 # Inclusion under armed force To consider inclusion of cyber attacks under armed force a different categorization model needs to be used. Instead of focusing on the medium, attention must turn to the effect. International law scholar Michael Schmitt³³ has proposed the following loose test with the aim of distinguishing political or economic pressure from armed force: ³³ See http://www.usnwc.edu/Academics/Faculty/Michael-Schmitt.aspx Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039 coercion, which often depend on numerous contributory factors to operate. Thus, the prohibition on force precludes negative consequences with greater certainty.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039 deemed illegitimate absent some specific exception such as self-defence. The cognitive approach is prohibitory. By contrast, most other forms of coercion—again in the domestic and international sphere—are presumptively lawful, absent a prohibition to the contrary. The cognitive approach is permissive. Thus, the consequences of armed coercion are presumptively impermissible, whereas those of other coercive acts are not (as a very generalized rule).³⁴ The goal of Schmitt's test is to develop a set of characteristics that will be found in a typical use of armed force. By measuring the consequence of a cyber attack against these characteristics one would theoretically be able to distinguish between what should be considered a use of armed force and what should be left to other domestic or international law provisions. Ultimately, the idea is that there will be no difference between a kinetic attack that brings down an airplane, or a cyber attack that does the same, the consequences of the attack are the same, regardless of the medium chosen.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039 ³⁴ Michael Schmitt,\"Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law. Thoughts on a Normative Framework\"(1999) 37 Colum J Transnat'l L 885 at 914.\n# Assessment difficulties There are problems that arise with the use of Schmitt's consequence-based categorization framework. One issue raised by Matthew Hoisington applies to the final factor to be considered, presumptive legitimacy. He points out that determining whether the attack is legitimate under international law by asking whether the attack was legitimate, is essentially putting the cart before the horse.³⁵ Additionally, Hoisington turns to the attribution issue addressed above, pointing out that unlike a traditional kinetic attack, the ultimate consequence of an cyber attack may be difficult to ascertain immediately afterwards. This will present a problem in determining the permitted response under international law, a deficiency that will likely plague most approaches that designed to be used after an attack.³⁶ A quick consequence-based analysis of a cyber attack will likely catch the so called\"low hanging fruit\", attacks that closely resemble traditional military attacks. Cyber attacks that directly target devices which immediately cause death, injury, damage or destruction which is clearly identifiable by the victim do not present significant categorization challenges, but unfortunately an attack will not necessarily be confined to these black and white situations.\n³⁵ Supra note 24.\n³⁶ Ibid Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039 The ultimate effect of a cyber attack may not be immediately apparent, and may in fact be deliberately disguised in order to cause the damage to propagate and spread in the way that the attacker desires. This has consequences regarding qualification under Article 51, as well as the proportionality consideration that a state must undertake. We are left asking, how far down the chain of causation must we go when assessing an attack?\nTo address the unique issues that cyber attacks present with regards to assessment, Hoisington advocates for a presumptive exception to be created for states that have been the victim of a cyber attack. His proposal would create protection under international law for a state that acts in good faith to respond to a cyber attack, bypassing the need to properly attribute and characterise the attack. This would result in a loosening of the requirements to the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter. To constrain the expansion of the Article 51 right Hoisington would have nations decide on a separate categorization of critical national infrastructure that, if attacked, would trigger the aforementioned protection.³⁷ Hoisington's approach seems to run contrary to the spirit of Article 51, and international humanitarian law in general. Certainly the unique aspects of cyber attacks must be considered, and the need for a state to be permitted to defend itself is vital, relaxing the attribution requirements present in Article 51 could very ³⁷ Ibid at 453.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039 well result in an expansion of conflict. The very aims of Article 51 appear to be the limiting of the frequency and severity of aggressive acts of self-defence, and a loosening of the requirements would run contrary to that objective.³⁸ It seems clear that an attacking nation would use means to disguise the origins of their attack. The anonymous nature of the internet likely would be one of the main benefits that an attacker would be seeking. Given what we have established regarding the ability of attackers to disguise and engage in\"false flag\"conduct it would not be unreasonable to believe that a relaxation of the attribution requirement could very well lead to attacks on innocent third party states, pulling another nation into the conflict.³⁹ Instead of removing the attribution requirement for certain protected national assets a new approach to evaluating and regulating cyber attacks under international law may be necessary.\n## Suggested improvements ## Towards qualifying as armed force In order to determine if an attack should be considered an armed attack focus should be centred on the severity of the consequences. One of the main problems that have faced result-oriented tests in the past has been the difficulty ³⁸ Supra note 26 at 1175 ³⁹ Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039 in determining what consequences can be actually tied to the cyber attack itself. Basically, how far down the chain do we go looking for the characteristics of an armed attack?\nI would suggest that one might look to domestic criminal law regarding causation to find a starting point. The Supreme Court of Canada have settled on the test of a\"significant contributing cause\"40 with regards to most offences, and a\"substantial and integral cause\"41 when applied to first degree murder. In the case of determining whether death, injury, damage, or destruction can be tied to a cyber attack it seems reasonable to consider whether the attack represented a\"substantial and integral cause of the injury suffered\".\nUse of a modified version of Schmitt's test42 presents an attractive first step: Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039 The immediacy and directness requirements from Schmitt's test have been superseded by the causation test, while avoiding the problem of unduly constraining the attacked nation. As set out above there are significant problems with attempting to determine the immediate effects of a cyber attack, and the directness step is not required, as the causation test would handle cases where the actus reus is not sufficiently tied to the consequence. The immediacy requirement seems to be onerous without providing much benefit. For example, if an attacking nation were to compromise a control system and implant a logic bomb, which would only trigger months later, causing significant damage and injury, it seems nonsensical to believe that the attack is somehow not an armed attack, simply because one of the consequences were hidden.\nThe measurability requirement and the challenges that it presents have been addressed above. The near impossibility of accurately ascertaining the full consequences of an attack means forcing the measurability requirement would unduly hamstring a state that has been the victim of a cyber attack. By confining Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039 the analysis to the severity of the consequence, the connection between the consequences and the attack, and maintaining the requirement for the attack to occur within the boundaries of the state; a cyber attack can be effectively classified against the armed conflict standard, while making allowances for the challenges the cyber environment presents.\n## Towards determining attribution Ensuring that nations that have been subjected to a cyber attack are able to accurately attribute the attack to a particular state actor within a reasonable timeframe benefits the international community as a whole. Allowing a state to accurately attribute an attack reduces the risk of widening the conflict by responding against an innocent third party, and would hold attacking nations more accountable for their actions. A change to the technical infrastructure which allows nations to hide behind the internet is not feasible or even necessarily desirable. Rather an approach that recognizes the overall benefit to international cooperation may be the most workable. The international community has recognized the benefit of independent regulators and inspectors with regards to issues such a nuclear development, as the benefit to all outweighs the intrusion that these agencies present.\nAs set out above, tracking a cyber attack back, through compromised servers, presents a significant problem for attribution. One way of addressing this A prime example being the International Atomic Energy Agency Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039 issue would be an international framework, whereby nations found to be hosting a computer or server implicated in an armed attack, would be responsible for conducting an investigation into the offending device. The implicated state would then be responsible for providing an independent regulator with all pertinent data taken from the system, the regulator would be responsible for evaluating the data, and would then turn over the results of the investigation to the state which was attacked.\nAn alternative setup would have the independent regulator actually be provided access to the compromised system, whereby they would conduct an independent investigation themselves, without relying on the host nation to provide them with the data. This approach would present the host nation with a more substantial trespass on their independence, and would likely face more opposition than the first approach.\nCertainly even this approach is not without its pitfalls. Data can be faked, and a host nation could conceivably attempt to point the finger at another by manufacturing data that purports to show that the attack originated elsewhere, and merely passed through their nation. However, a thorough forensic investigation would be likely to uncover discrepancies, and at least trigger the suspicion of both the independent auditor, and the victim state. A criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is not at play here, an implicated state would ultimately be responsible for showing that they were not behind the Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039 attack, to the satisfaction of the independent auditors. In the absence of a legitimate defence, Article 51 would be triggered, as it would currently, and the aggrieved state would be able to defend itself pursuant to international law.\nSuch an approach would have the added benefit of providing extra incentive for states to not allow rogue non-state elements to operate within their borders, as it would increase their risk of being implicated in any illegal attack perpetrated by private groups. Certainly an approach as outlined above may present problems regarding timeframe. In the event of a significant attack time may be of essence. While a full investigation may take time, addressing an attack currently being carried out should not. An implicated state must take reasonable efforts to shut down compromised servers as quickly as possible, and any undue delay would be interpreted as showing involvement in the attack, allowing the attribution requirement to be met, and permitting an Article 51 response.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039 # Conclusion Attacks through cyberspace are a logical development given the increasing significance the internet and wired devices play in our everyday lives. Legal frameworks in general are being challenged by the changes that the global information network is presenting, and international humanitarian law is no exception. Cyber attacks of a significant scale are only in their infancy, but it is better to be ahead of the curve, with a well thought out approach to the issue, than attempting to catch up after the fact.\nThe challenges that international law faces when presented with cyber attacks require a new kind of framework, one that respects the principles that underpin international humanitarian law, while recognizing the need for states to be able address an electronic aggressor. Existing approaches to evaluating a cyber attack either unduly hamstring a nation suffering from the effects of an attack, or would permit an undesirable expansion of armed conflict. In addition to a new legal approach to evaluating cyber attacks a new framework for regulating international responses and investigations to cyber attacks is required. Attributing attacks to particular actors over cyberspace is certainly difficult, but the international community must be careful not to relax the standards too much, or risk losing the protection that it has historically provided.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2312039"
