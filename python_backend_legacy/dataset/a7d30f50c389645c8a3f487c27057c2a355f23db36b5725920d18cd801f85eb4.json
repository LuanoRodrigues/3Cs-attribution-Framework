In the digital era, the rise of cyber conflict blurs traditional distinctions between war and peace, presenting complex challenges. This article investigates the intricate dynamics of cyber conflict, driven by state and state-sponsored actions in cyber sabotage, espionage, and disinformation spread. It reviews how nations like the US, Russia, and China use cyber capabilities to assert dominance, counter threats, and shape global politics, impacting national security, economic stability, and democratic integrity. The analysis highlights the difficulties in attributing cyber-attacks, limitations of current legal frameworks, and risks of escalation to physical conflict. We suggest five strategic approaches to mitigate cyber conflict, including enhancing international cybersecurity collaboration, setting clear cyber norms, managing cyber arsenals responsibly, safeguarding tech company independence, and promoting public discourse on cyber issues. These strategies aim for a transparent, cooperative resolution to cyber conflicts, aligning with the nuances of digital warfare.\n\nKeywords: Cyber Conflict · Cyber Attacks · De-escalation\n\n# 1 A Looming Geopolitical Situation\n\nCyber capabilities have emerged as a disruptive technological force, revolutionizing traditional warfare and conflict dynamics [20]. This technological evolution has empowered state and state-sponsored actors with unprecedented tools for sabotage, espionage, and manipulation, reshaping the geopolitical landscape into a domain marked by unpredictability and menace. The United States (US), suffering from an increasing number of threats to its critical infrastructure due to cyber-attacks [16] and recognizing the potential of cyber warfare, has adopted a proactive stance as outlined in its strategy to “Achieve and Maintain Cyberspace Superiority” [17]. This approach mandates a “defend forward”, necessitating preemptive infiltration into adversaries’ systems to enable swift retaliation, thus aiming for a deterrence-based dominance in cyberspace. Before 2018, the US maintained an approach of restraint to cyber operations outside the US Government, but this changed due to mainly Russia’s cyber-enables information operations in the 2026 US Presidential election. Obama administration contemplated but ultimately decided against initiating offensive cyber operations, largely due to apprehensions about the possibility of provoking further aggressive actions from Russia.

Nonetheless, the chosen course of action by the administration veered away from cyber retaliation, opting instead for a response that encompassed diplomatic, economic, and law enforcement strategies. This led to a call from certain factions within the private sector and the Department of Defense to reevaluate existing beliefs regarding escalation dynamics, advocating for a more forward-leaning strategy [6].\n\nThe concept of cyber superiority was already vividly illustrated by Operation Olympic Games, where the U.S. in collaboration with Israel, reportedly deployed the Stuxnet virus against Iran's nuclear program [10]. Despite this show of offensive capability, the incident underscored the vulnerability of even technologically advanced nations to retaliatory cyber-attacks, highlighting the complex, double-edged nature of cyber power. Further exemplifying the strategic shift towards cyber warfare, Russia's actions in Ukraine since 2014 have demonstrated the seamless integration of cyber operations with traditional military tactics. Russian forces not only commandeered communication infrastructures but also launched cyber-attacks against critical services, employing disinformation campaigns to undermine the state and influence global perceptions. For example, nowadays in the Ukraine war, Russia repeatedly has claimed that Ukraine is filled with “Nazis”, and persists in promoting this demonstrably false claim, both internally and externally [2]. Similarly, China's cyber activities, including economic and state espionage, have prompted international tensions, leading to agreements aimed at curbing cyber espionage -- a testament to the global recognition of the seriousness of cyber threats.\n\nThe digital realm has thus become a critical fifth dimension of military strategy, with nations deploying viruses, ransomware, and exploiting vulnerabilities to assert their interests [12]. All major world powers have established military cyber commands and reformed their intelligence services, and in some states, like Russia and China, there are close ties between government agencies and patriotic or even criminal hackers. States often operate from the shadows, and typically neither confirm nor deny their involvement in a cyber-attack. Instead, they provide ambiguous responses such as ‘non-denial denials' or refuse to address the allegations' [3]. This approach allows states to pursue dual objectives: they can maintain crisis stability while leaving open the possibility of their participation in the cyber-attack. By intentionally remaining under suspicion, a state can influence how rivals perceive its cyber capabilities and determination. Additionally, by not denying responsibility, a state can also affect how rivals view the capabilities of its allies, thereby bolstering the credibility of deterrence. This approach achieves these ends without the escalatory dangers associated with explicitly admitting responsibility.\n\nThe establishment of military cyber commands and the collaboration between governments and hacker groups underscore the strategic importance of cyberspace. In this shadowy warfare, the lines between peace and conflict blur, as states engage in continuous digital skirmishing, preparing the battlefield with espionage tools, traps, and offensive weapons, even during peacetime. This transformation into a world where cyber conflict is an “always on” phenomenon demands a reevaluation of traditional notions of warfare and security [1].

These operations not only pose significant challenges to societal security but also offer strategic tools to achieve political and military objectives. As the digital landscape evolves, so too will the nature of conflict and the strategies nations employ to protect their interests and assert their power on the global stage.\n\n## The Cyber Conflict\n\nThe cyber conflict lies between peace and war, which has implications for how we should think about peacetime and wartime (see Table 1). Traditionally, war and peace form a binary distinction: it is either war or peace between countries. This distinction can still be maintained, provided we distinguish peacetime from cyber peace, and understand war as cyber-physical war. In a time of cyber peace, it is not only peacetime, but there is also no cyber conflict. Countries do not engage in cyber espionage and do not use cyber means to cause damage in another country. Disinformation campaigns are also not undertaken. The focus in this situation is on strengthening cybersecurity. States can also train cyber soldiers and acquire weapons. However, the ability to build offensive cyber capabilities is limited: gaining intelligence about the cyber capabilities and systems of the opponent is of great importance for both setting up one's defense and creating offensive capacity. The goals in the cyber conflict vary: sometimes a state seeks economic advantages by spying, sometimes a state wants to prepare the military battlefield in its favor, and sometimes a state wants to pressure or manipulate the political decision-making in another state. But cyber-attacks have never escalated to the point where countries have declared war on each other. Moreover, in this cyber conflict, there is an important difference between cyber sabotage that directly causes severe damage, and cyber espionage and disinformation spreading that serve the interests of a particular state much more indirectly. The victim is not supposed to notice cyber espionage and disinformation spreading, while cyber sabotage immediately affects the physical world of people -- for example, because financial services break down or a power plant fails.\n\nWe therefore distinguish between cold and hot aspects of the cyber conflict. In situations of cold cyber conflict, it seems as if no conflict is taking place at all since countries use cyber espionage and the spread of disinformation. In situations of hot cyber conflict, the information struggle flares up because facilities are openly damaged and people directly experience the consequences of cyber sabotage in their own living environment. An example of such a hot cyber conflict was the Stuxnet operation, which caused serious physical damage in peacetime. The damage was so severe that there has been broad discussion about whether the attack should even be classified as an armed attack under humanitarian law [14]. The cold and hot aspects of the cyber conflict are not mutually exclusive. For example, cyber sabotage generally presupposes cyber espionage. A particular cyber conflict has more or fewer cold and hot aspects. And it's not that a hot cyber-attack is necessarily more dangerous than a cold cyber-attack -- perhaps nothing is more dangerous than corrupting a democratic rule of law state's information provision from within. But it is true that serious cyber sabotage borders on an act of war, as acts of war are characterized by very serious physical damage.",

In wartime, offensive cyber capabilities will likely play a significant role: more and more military equipment is becoming digitalized, and it can be very advantageous to mislead the opponent's air defense through disinformation, as happened during Operation Orchard of the Israeli Air Force on a Syrian nuclear reactor. Therefore, it makes sense to speak of cyber-physical warfare, integrating digital applications into the conventional arsenal of warfare. Russia's cyber activity in Ukraine transcends warm cyber conflict because the cyber-attacks coincided with conventional military deployment. However, it is questionable whether the cyber sabotage carried out by Russia would be sufficient to fall under the prohibition of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. The severity of the consequences is usually considered the measure to determine whether a particular cyber-attack falls under the",

This standard states that there is only force if it leads to an actual or potentially harmful physical effect on the targeted state. These physical effects include death, bodily injury, or significant damage to vital infrastructures or military installations. Technically, a sabotaging cyber-attack could lead to civilian casualties or significant infrastructural damage, for example, as a result of long-term disabling of power plants. Yet, it is challenging to find cyber-attacks that meet that standard. Sabotaging cyber-attacks generally do not result in civilian casualties -- at least not in a direct sense, but can endanger human health and well-being [16]. Most sabotaging cyber-attacks do cause serious societal damage but do not cripple vital infrastructures. For example, sabotaging cyber-attacks occasionally disrupt banking services, but the financial sector has never been completely shut down. Similarly, in 2015 in Ukraine, the power supply was shut down, but the lights came back on a few hours later. Therefore, it is questionable where the turning point lies between an attack that damages vital infrastructure and an attack that causes significant damage to vital infrastructure. Experts indicate that international law does not clearly answer this question [15]. For example, there is no consensus on whether the Stuxnet attack should be considered an armed attack. This is significant, as that attack is marked as one of the most far-reaching cyber-attacks. In addition, some authors argue that certain cyber-attacks that do not cause physical damage should still be considered armed attacks (see, e.g. [7]). In this case, we should think of cyber-attacks that can have a socially disruptive effect, such as crashing a stock market through digital manipulations. However, yet in practice, cyber conflicts have tended to be of low intensity, staying beneath the threshold that would categorize them as armed attacks [8]. Furthermore, to this day, cyber operations have no direct impact on the battlefield, but rather target broader national and civilian resilience (see, [11, 20]). Also nowadays in the Ukrainian war, Russia mounts sophisticated cyber-attacks, but it still does not happen in any fashion that is decisive to the war [2].\n\nIn our opinion, relaxing the ‘physical effects' standard is counterproductive and completely negates the intentions of de-escalation, as it would give countries more opportunities to respond with traditional violence to a cyber-attack under Article 51 of the UN Charter, which allows self-defense in the case of armed violence. Cyber sabotage is an infringement on the sovereignty of the state. This could also apply to cyber espionage and the spread of disinformation. The norm of sovereignty restriction (Article 2(7) of the UN Charter) could provide a framework to critically examine cyber-attacks and even declare them contrary to international law. In the Tallinn Manual 2.0, where a special group of experts proposes applying international law to cyber-attacks, it is also stated that the norm of sovereignty restriction applies to cyber-attacks [15]. However, the norm is very generally formulated, and the Tallinn Manual 2.0 offers, at best, an ambiguous stance regarding the interpretation of the norm and when and which countermeasures are permitted. The norm itself constitutes a less severe offense than an attack or armed attack. A violation of the prohibition of force justifies a stronger response than a violation of sovereignty -- and it could well be that states want to take a strong countermeasure in some situations. However, the legal problems that arise in cyberspace can only be very limitedly interpreted in terms of positive international law,",

We will not further discuss the legal complications that cyber-attacks entail in this article, but we can at least state that a clear, elaborated, and widely supported normative framework for the majority of cyber-attacks that states face during a cyber conflict is lacking. The cyber conflict does not fit the traditional patterns of thought about peace and war and may even be considered an “other-than-war” phenomenon [13].\n\nTherefore, cyber-attacks are poised to occupy a distinct place within the moral hierarchy of foreign policy tools, nestled between diplomacy and kinetic warfare, similar to severe economic sanctions. Larry May [9] proposes reclassifying these cyber operations not as acts of war but as akin to embargoes, serving as political and economic levers. This reimagining suggests cyber-attacks could be a strategic alternative to conflict, potentially guiding how NATO responds to attacks on its members. The effectiveness of traditional economic sanctions is debated, especially given globalization's role in diluting their impact. Instances like the UN's sanctions against Libya and the EU's against Russia illustrate sanctions' complex consequences, including retaliation that can harm the sanctioning states themselves. Cyber-attacks offer, according to May, an additional strategy in coercive diplomacy, potentially pressuring states towards compliance without the drawbacks of conventional sanctions. They could prompt states to cease unlawful activities by threatening their digital infrastructure, such as the Stuxnet virus against Iran's nuclear program. This approach, leveraging cyber capabilities for targeted pressure while minimizing civilian distress, could serve as a peaceful yet potent means to enforce international norms and laws. However, the potential for retaliatory cyber-attacks by the targeted state may increase escalation.\n\nIn addition, many states invest significant amounts of money in building offensive cyber capabilities. They all want to have a high-quality arsenal capable of conducting complex espionage, sabotage, and disinformation spreading. These factors contribute to a risky cyber conflict, where attackers have the means and opportunity to attack vulnerable systems, and where these attackers rarely face repercussions. In this threatening geopolitical situation, countries will likely continue to suffer from cyber-attacks carried out by other states. Moreover, there is a chance that cyber-attacks will escalate, in the sense that both the harmfulness and frequency of cyber-attacks increase. Given the danger to the security of the digital environment, international efforts must be made to effectively de-escalate cyber-attacks: the frequency of cyber-attacks must decrease, and the cyber-attacks that society experiences must become less severe. The question is how this turnaround can be achieved, and who should take responsibility for it. In the next section, we will discuss five solution directions that support this de-escalation.\n\n## Solution for the De-escalation of the International Information Conflict\n\n### Continue Cooperation to Improve International Cyber Security\n\nIn addition to the national steps taken to increase resilience and cyber security, states need to continue investing in international cooperation in the field of cyber security. The emphasis of NATO's cyber policy is on strengthening the defense of NATO member",

            "markdown": "states: “The keynote is defense, whether an attack comes from state, criminal, or other sources,” according to a NATO spokesperson. NATO's defensive doctrine is mainly based on deterrence or passive deterrence: ‘deterrence by denial.' This means that security measures must be strengthened to the point that it becomes practically impossible, or at least very expensive, for attackers to infiltrate systems. The cooperation to further improve digital security at the EU and NATO level must be continued and intensified. Some good examples of this cooperation include the rollout of a broad network of Cyber Emergency Incident Response Teams (the CERT network) and the release of an initial standard (ETSI TS 103 645) by the European Telecommunications Standardisation Institute (ETSI) for securing Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices to support all parties involved in the development and production of IoT for consumers with guidance on securing their products.\n\nImplementing a policy where NATO refrains from initiating cyber-attacks first, supported by credible military deterrents, can effectively communicate its commitment to restraint and establish boundaries for acceptable cyber-attacks. This strategy would define a baseline for cyber operations that won't provoke a violent response, highlighting that only countermeasures against cyber adversaries are permissible, while attacks on civilian infrastructure are explicitly excluded [6]. However, the dynamic between attackers and defenders in cyberspace remains unresolved, with attackers often gaining the upper hand. Strengthening global cooperation through the sharing of intelligence, best practices, and joint response strategies is essential. Additionally, creating global forums for cybersecurity intelligence and coordination will facilitate timely responses to threats. Despite this, international support for multilateral cyber arms control is waning due to challenges in verification, perceived minimal consequences for violators, and the exclusivity of agreements. Any effective framework must address these issues and consider the complexity of verifying and attributing violations in cyberspace. Furthermore, developing and promoting international cybersecurity standards will help define responsible state behavior, protect civilian networks, and promote a rules-based approach to managing cyber conflict, thus preventing escalation towards armed conflict [18].\n\n### Make Clear International Agreements Regarding Cyber Sabotage, Disinformation, and Cyber Espionage\n\nThe geopolitical landscape of cyber-attacks suffers from a notable absence of specific, binding international rules tailored to the unique dynamics of cyber conflict. Consequently, states often rely on generic international legal frameworks, which are ambiguous and open to varied interpretations concerning cyber-attacks. This ambiguity tends to benefit the attackers by fostering an environment of uncertainty that they can exploit. Establishing clear and concrete rules would enable the international community to respond promptly and decisively to cyber incidents, setting clear expectations and consequences for state actions.\n\nProposals for international agreements on cyber conflict include a “Geneva Convention for cyber-attacks” to establish norms akin to those that govern traditional warfare. However, the feasibility of such a treaty remains in question due to significant geopolitical divisions. For instance, the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context",

The debate over how international humanitarian law applies to cyber operations continues to be contentious, reflecting broader disagreements on the militarization of cyberspace. The diplomatic efforts to forge a consensus have led to a bifurcation in approaches [5]. The U.S. and its allies have pursued one track, while a coalition led by Russia and China has followed another, both proposing different norms for state behavior in cyberspace. This division underscores the challenges in achieving a unified global stance on cyber conflicts.\n\nBeyond formal treaties, there is potential for building confidence through voluntary agreements that enhance state cooperation and transparency. Such measures could reduce misunderstandings and prevent conflicts, involving multilateral commitments to share intelligence on cyber threats and refrain from targeting civilian infrastructure during peacetime. At the national level, countries could independently declare their responses to cyber incidents, creating predictable standards and responses. This approach includes categorizing types of cyber-attacks and the corresponding responses, which the European Union began implementing in 2019 with a framework for targeted measures against cyber threats.\n\nThe debate over cyber espionage and its implications for state sovereignty is particularly complex. Cyber espionage often involves tactics that could be seen as violating sovereignty if they cause harm, such as data corruption or system disruption. Meanwhile, the spread of disinformation represents another serious challenge, potentially destabilizing democratic processes and public discourse. It is inappropriate for a democratic rule of law state to further disrupt the information provision in another country. This does not mean that foreign information campaigns are inadmissible. It may be useful to give critical Russian journalism a helping hand. But spreading disinformation that weakens the legal order is, in our opinion, comparable to the use of chemical weapons: an inadmissible means for a civilized democratic state.\n\nIn terms of countermeasures, the need for proportionate and responsible responses is paramount. Retaliatory cyber-attacks are risky and may not effectively enhance cybersecurity or deter aggressors. Instead, a combination of diplomatic, economic, and legal measures, alongside public exposure of malicious activities, may offer a more sustainable path to maintaining international peace and security in the digital age. Thus, the international community stands at a critical juncture, needing to balance the imperatives of security and cooperation against the backdrop of rapidly evolving cyber capabilities. The establishment of robust, clear, and widely accepted norms for cyberspace is essential to manage and mitigate the risks of cyber conflict effectively.\n\nA fundamental choice has to be made regarding the type of countermeasures that should be taken in response to a cyber-attack. One can fight fire with fire and launch a similar cyber counterattack. We have indicated that this is irresponsible in the case of undermining a democratic rule of law. Many other cyber-attacks directly affect civilian institutions and facilities -- targets that should be spared as much as possible even in wartime. It is therefore highly questionable whether a democratic rule of law state should retaliate in kind. European States can also respond with other means, for example, by using the European sanctions package, and taking diplomatic and economic",

Every attack contributes to the proliferation of weapons, and cyber conflicts have so far never ended with a decisive counterattack. Moreover, serious reservations are expressed in the literature about the deterrence strategy [19]. If a cyber counterattack is carried out, it must happen immediately and in cooperation with allies. If threats are made without follow-up, the deterrent effect disappears.\n\n### Ensure Responsible Management of the Cyber Arsenal\n\nMalware can spread across the world in seconds: that is the price we pay for a global internet. Whoever deploys a cyber weapon can expect the used code to end up in unforeseen hands and perhaps boomerang back in one's face. This means that cyber weapons must be deployed carefully and once-used vulnerabilities must be reported promptly. Because that is the unique opportunity for de-escalation that cyber conflict offers: programmers can neutralize much malicious code. Since these updates increase the security of the entire digital domain, this aspect must be optimally utilized. It is therefore of great importance that intelligence services and defense units work cooperatively with software producers and chip manufacturers to implement security updates as effectively as possible and distribute them among users. International intelligence services and defense units must cooperate with software producers and computer chip manufacturers in implementing security updates and distributing them among users. Moreover, intelligence services and defense units must continuously ask themselves what increases cyber security more: possessing a certain cyber weapon or releasing it?\n\nInternational allies should also be more open with each other and jointly monitor the management of vulnerabilities. It would be a pity if allies independently collect cyber weapons and keep them strictly secret: then, vulnerabilities could remain on the shelf that the services could have reported from a strategic point of view. Ultimately, in the long term, the importance of reliable and safe digital applications weighs more heavily than the interest in occasionally breaking through that security, however much this would enable specific operations. Responsible management of the cyber arsenal also has consequences for cooperation with private parties. Many large states possess a high-quality arsenal capable of conducting complex espionage, sabotage, and disinformation spreading, and master the simpler methods of committing cyber-attacks. This development has also led to a flourishing private or malicious industry that supplies these weapons, contributes to the proliferation of weapons, and gives opponents access to offensive cyber capabilities. Not for nothing did the German government in 2017 decide to have cyber weapons developed by its own state agency [4]. Government must seriously consider which private partners should be involved in the development of offensive cyber capabilities -- and whether there is enough reason to take this development more into its own hands. Strict conditions must also apply to ensure that dangerous technology is not sold to countries that cannot trust with these weapons. An international lobby for an updated system of export licenses could help in this regard.",

They can patch the holes in their software and ensure the most robust possible digital applications. This means that it is of crucial importance that these companies do not become extensions of national governments. Kaspersky Labs and Huawei Technologies are under great pressure due to their connections with China and Russia. The governments of Russia and China do not respect the fundamental rights of their citizens and regularly use their power to intervene in the business world -- so why wouldn't they use these global players as pawns of their intelligence services? How exactly the Western governments should deal with companies like Huawei and Kaspersky depends on the extent to which the Chinese and Russian governments actually control these companies. American companies sometimes work intensively with intelligence services, whether or not under duress, as in the renewed PRISM program of the National Security Agency (NSA). The international community must prevent such situations, both within the prescribed frameworks and proactively, if it wants to maintain a reliable and safe international technology market. It is therefore encouraging to see that more than 60 global companies, including Microsoft, Facebook, and Dell, are part of the Cybersecurity Tech Accord and have joined the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace. The cooperation agreement contains a set of common promises that have consequences for how these companies relate to governments. Such as the promise never to help governments launch cyber-attacks against innocent civilians and businesses, and the promise to protect their products against covert influence and sabotage. Although the impact and precise meaning of the agreement in practice remain to be seen, this cooperation could greatly reduce the ability of governments to set up espionage and sabotage operations with the help of companies.\n\n### Invest in a Societal Debate on Geopolitical Cyber Security\n\nWar, peace, and international conflict are matters that the population should be particularly involved in a democracy: major societal interests are at stake. The nature of the current information conflict complicates this discussion because so many things are opaque or secret. However, the decision to acquire certain weapons and authorize certain operations cannot only be a matter for experts and officials with special authority: the ongoing cyber conflict must be thoroughly and deeply discussed in the public debate. Each of the four solution directions mentioned above should be addressed in the Dutch and international public debate. Therefore, secrecy by intelligence services and defense cannot be taken for granted -- this secrecy must be weighed against the interest of citizens in gaining insight into the government's cyber operations and forming an opinion about them. The greater the impact of international cyber conflicts on society, the greater the importance of making a relevant public debate possible. Moreover, the involvement of citizens is urgently needed: they are frequently the victims of disinformation, cyber espionage, and cyber sabotage. In the cyber conflict, all citizens have a role to play and should be equipped to recognize disinformation and take basic security measures. Only citizens who understand how technology affects their lives and who have meaningful input in the political choices made regarding new technology are resilient against",

The government has a special responsibility to enable this citizenship: by facilitating education, prioritizing the rights of citizens, and providing as much transparency as possible about the issues it faces in a threatening geopolitical situation.\n\n# 4 Conclusions\n\nMost actions currently undertaken by influential states fall within what we have described as the cyber conflict. In peacetime, countries build up their cyber security and try to infiltrate the digital systems of other countries as secretly as possible. Russia also actively spreads disinformation. This is a strategy that other autocratic countries do not seem to apply on a large scale, at least not in relation to other countries, but is part of the desire to control, censor, and manipulate the information that reaches their population. There are also several examples of serious cyber sabotage, such as Operation Olympic Games, attributed to Israel and the United States, and the WannaCry attack, attributed to North Korea. So far, cyber-attacks have never led to a cyber-physical war; in that sense, there is no 'cyberwar'. However, the current international situation is risky and worrying, and the disruptive effects of cyber capabilities underscore the risks in the international landscape, which could lead to the escalation of cyber-attacks. We have formulated five possible solutions for the de-escalation of the international cyber conflict. Perhaps the most important is that clear international agreements are made in the field of offensive cyber capabilities. However, in the current geopolitical environment, international support for multilateral cyber arms control agreements is declining, due to issues such as doubts about verification, perceived limited consequences for violators of agreements, and a lack of inclusivity of many agreements. Any multilateral framework for cyber weapons control will have to take this trend into account, especially since the verification of any agreement and the attribution of any violation will be even more complicated in the cyber domain than regular arms control. However, cyber weapons control frameworks limit expensive and destabilizing arms races and help prevent dangerous escalation toward armed conflict.\n\nAcknowledgment.

In the digital era, the rise of cyber conflict blurs traditional distinctions between war and peace, presenting complex challenges. This article investigates the intricate dynamics of cyber conflict, driven by state and state-sponsored actions in cyber sabotage, espionage, and disinformation spread. It reviews how nations like the US, Russia, and China use cyber capabilities to assert dominance, counter threats, and shape global politics, impacting national security, economic stability, and democratic integrity. The analysis highlights the difficulties in attributing cyber-attacks, limitations of current legal frameworks, and risks of escalation to physical conflict. We suggest five strategic approaches to mitigate cyber conflict, including enhancing international cybersecurity collaboration, setting clear cyber norms, managing cyber arsenals responsibly, safeguarding tech company independence, and promoting public discourse on cyber issues. These strategies aim for a transparent, cooperative resolution to cyber conflicts, aligning with the nuances of digital warfare.\nKeywords: Cyber Conflict · Cyber Attacks · De-escalation\n# 1 A Looming Geopolitical Situation\nCyber capabilities have emerged as a disruptive technological force, revolutionizing traditional warfare and conflict dynamics [20]. This technological evolution has empowered state and state-sponsored actors with unprecedented tools for sabotage, espionage, and manipulation, reshaping the geopolitical landscape into a domain marked by unpredictability and menace. The United States (US), suffering from an increasing number of threats to its critical infrastructure due to cyber-attacks [16] and recognizing the potential of cyber warfare, has adopted a proactive stance as outlined in its strategy to “Achieve and Maintain Cyberspace Superiority” [17]. This approach mandates a “defend forward”, necessitating preemptive infiltration into adversaries’ systems to enable swift retaliation, thus aiming for a deterrence-based dominance in cyberspace. Before 2018, the US maintained an approach of restraint to cyber operations outside the US Government, but this changed due to mainly Russia’s cyber-enables information operations in the 2026 US Presidential election. Obama administration contemplated but ultimately decided against initiating offensive cyber operations, largely due to apprehensions about the possibility of provoking further aggressive actions from Russia. Among the more robust\n© The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024\nD. H. de la Iglesia et al. (Eds.): DiTTEt 2024, AISC 1459, pp. 295-306, 2024.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-66635-3_25\ncyber strategies under consideration were proposals to neutralize websites disseminating leaked information, to execute cyber-attacks aimed at disrupting Russian media outlets, and to impair the command and control infrastructure utilized by Russian intelligence entities. Nonetheless, the chosen course of action by the administration veered away from cyber retaliation, opting instead for a response that encompassed diplomatic, economic, and law enforcement strategies. This led to a call from certain factions within the private sector and the Department of Defense to reevaluate existing beliefs regarding escalation dynamics, advocating for a more forward-leaning strategy [6].\nThe concept of cyber superiority was already vividly illustrated by Operation Olympic Games, where the U.S. in collaboration with Israel, reportedly deployed the Stuxnet virus against Iran's nuclear program [10]. Despite this show of offensive capability, the incident underscored the vulnerability of even technologically advanced nations to retaliatory cyber-attacks, highlighting the complex, double-edged nature of cyber power. Further exemplifying the strategic shift towards cyber warfare, Russia's actions in Ukraine since 2014 have demonstrated the seamless integration of cyber operations with traditional military tactics. Russian forces not only commandeered communication infrastructures but also launched cyber-attacks against critical services, employing disinformation campaigns to undermine the state and influence global perceptions. For example, nowadays in the Ukraine war, Russia repeatedly has claimed that Ukraine is filled with “Nazis”, and persists in promoting this demonstrably false claim, both internally and externally [2]. Similarly, China's cyber activities, including economic and state espionage, have prompted international tensions, leading to agreements aimed at curbing cyber espionage -- a testament to the global recognition of the seriousness of cyber threats.\nThe digital realm has thus become a critical fifth dimension of military strategy, with nations deploying viruses, ransomware, and exploiting vulnerabilities to assert their interests [12]. All major world powers have established military cyber commands and reformed their intelligence services, and in some states, like Russia and China, there are close ties between government agencies and patriotic or even criminal hackers. States often operate from the shadows, and typically neither confirm nor deny their involvement in a cyber-attack. Instead, they provide ambiguous responses such as ‘non-denial denials' or refuse to address the allegations' [3]. This approach allows states to pursue dual objectives: they can maintain crisis stability while leaving open the possibility of their participation in the cyber-attack. By intentionally remaining under suspicion, a state can influence how rivals perceive its cyber capabilities and determination. Additionally, by not denying responsibility, a state can also affect how rivals view the capabilities of its allies, thereby bolstering the credibility of deterrence. This approach achieves these ends without the escalatory dangers associated with explicitly admitting responsibility.\nThe establishment of military cyber commands and the collaboration between governments and hacker groups underscore the strategic importance of cyberspace. In this shadowy warfare, the lines between peace and conflict blur, as states engage in continuous digital skirmishing, preparing the battlefield with espionage tools, traps, and offensive weapons, even during peacetime. This transformation into a world where cyber conflict is an “always on” phenomenon demands a reevaluation of traditional notions of warfare and security [1]. Cyber operations, from sabotage and espionage to disinformation\ncampaigns, have become integral components of national defense and offensive strategies. These operations not only pose significant challenges to societal security but also offer strategic tools to achieve political and military objectives. As the digital landscape evolves, so too will the nature of conflict and the strategies nations employ to protect their interests and assert their power on the global stage.\n## The Cyber Conflict\nThe cyber conflict lies between peace and war, which has implications for how we should think about peacetime and wartime (see Table 1). Traditionally, war and peace form a binary distinction: it is either war or peace between countries. This distinction can still be maintained, provided we distinguish peacetime from cyber peace, and understand war as cyber-physical war. In a time of cyber peace, it is not only peacetime, but there is also no cyber conflict. Countries do not engage in cyber espionage and do not use cyber means to cause damage in another country. Disinformation campaigns are also not undertaken. The focus in this situation is on strengthening cybersecurity. States can also train cyber soldiers and acquire weapons. However, the ability to build offensive cyber capabilities is limited: gaining intelligence about the cyber capabilities and systems of the opponent is of great importance for both setting up one's defense and creating offensive capacity. The goals in the cyber conflict vary: sometimes a state seeks economic advantages by spying, sometimes a state wants to prepare the military battlefield in its favor, and sometimes a state wants to pressure or manipulate the political decision-making in another state. But cyber-attacks have never escalated to the point where countries have declared war on each other. Moreover, in this cyber conflict, there is an important difference between cyber sabotage that directly causes severe damage, and cyber espionage and disinformation spreading that serve the interests of a particular state much more indirectly. The victim is not supposed to notice cyber espionage and disinformation spreading, while cyber sabotage immediately affects the physical world of people -- for example, because financial services break down or a power plant fails.\nWe therefore distinguish between cold and hot aspects of the cyber conflict. In situations of cold cyber conflict, it seems as if no conflict is taking place at all since countries use cyber espionage and the spread of disinformation. In situations of hot cyber conflict, the information struggle flares up because facilities are openly damaged and people directly experience the consequences of cyber sabotage in their own living environment. An example of such a hot cyber conflict was the Stuxnet operation, which caused serious physical damage in peacetime. The damage was so severe that there has been broad discussion about whether the attack should even be classified as an armed attack under humanitarian law [14]. The cold and hot aspects of the cyber conflict are not mutually exclusive. For example, cyber sabotage generally presupposes cyber espionage. A particular cyber conflict has more or fewer cold and hot aspects. And it's not that a hot cyber-attack is necessarily more dangerous than a cold cyber-attack -- perhaps nothing is more dangerous than corrupting a democratic rule of law state's information provision from within. But it is true that serious cyber sabotage borders on an act of war, as acts of war are characterized by very serious physical damage.\nL. Royakkers\nTable 1. The action strategies within the four phases in cyberspace.\n|  Situation | Intent  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Cyber peace (peacetime) | Peace/neutrality; Strengthening of (inter)national cybersecurity: • Establishment of (inter)national Computer Emergency Response Teams, detecting, preventing, and addressing cyber incidents and risks  |\n|  Cold Cyber Conflict (peacetime) | Strengthening national offensive cyber capacity: • The significant increase in defense spending on cyber weapons in most states Acquiring (strategic) information: • The espionage operations of the American security agency NSA (revealed by Edward Snowden) e.g., to eavesdrop on European allies Influencing public opinion or democratic processes: • Russian disinformation about MH17 • Alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections  |\n|  Warm Cyber Conflict (peacetime) | Preparing the digital battlefield: • The American strategy of ‘forward defense,’ where foreign vital structures are hacked in advance to quickly retaliate upon infiltration Exerting political pressure: • Russian cyber-attacks in 2007 on internet sites of the Estonian government, banks, media, and companies, due to a conflict over the relocation of a Russian war monument in the Estonian capital Tallinn Damaging, disrupting, or destroying (vital) systems: • The American Stuxnet attack on the Iranian nuclear program  |\n|  Cyber-Physical War (wartime) | Military victory: • In the wars in Eastern Ukraine, Russia made/makes extensive use of cyber-attacks alongside conventional weapons  |\nWe must nuance our understanding of war. In wartime, offensive cyber capabilities will likely play a significant role: more and more military equipment is becoming digitalized, and it can be very advantageous to mislead the opponent's air defense through disinformation, as happened during Operation Orchard of the Israeli Air Force on a Syrian nuclear reactor. Therefore, it makes sense to speak of cyber-physical warfare, integrating digital applications into the conventional arsenal of warfare. Russia's cyber activity in Ukraine transcends warm cyber conflict because the cyber-attacks coincided with conventional military deployment. However, it is questionable whether the cyber sabotage carried out by Russia would be sufficient to fall under the prohibition of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. The severity of the consequences is usually considered the measure to determine whether a particular cyber-attack falls under the\nprohibition of force (see [18]). In international humanitarian law, the ‘physical effects' standard is used to define what is considered ‘use of force'. This standard states that there is only force if it leads to an actual or potentially harmful physical effect on the targeted state. These physical effects include death, bodily injury, or significant damage to vital infrastructures or military installations. Technically, a sabotaging cyber-attack could lead to civilian casualties or significant infrastructural damage, for example, as a result of long-term disabling of power plants. Yet, it is challenging to find cyber-attacks that meet that standard. Sabotaging cyber-attacks generally do not result in civilian casualties -- at least not in a direct sense, but can endanger human health and well-being [16]. Most sabotaging cyber-attacks do cause serious societal damage but do not cripple vital infrastructures. For example, sabotaging cyber-attacks occasionally disrupt banking services, but the financial sector has never been completely shut down. Similarly, in 2015 in Ukraine, the power supply was shut down, but the lights came back on a few hours later. Therefore, it is questionable where the turning point lies between an attack that damages vital infrastructure and an attack that causes significant damage to vital infrastructure. Experts indicate that international law does not clearly answer this question [15]. For example, there is no consensus on whether the Stuxnet attack should be considered an armed attack. This is significant, as that attack is marked as one of the most far-reaching cyber-attacks. In addition, some authors argue that certain cyber-attacks that do not cause physical damage should still be considered armed attacks (see, e.g. [7]). In this case, we should think of cyber-attacks that can have a socially disruptive effect, such as crashing a stock market through digital manipulations. However, yet in practice, cyber conflicts have tended to be of low intensity, staying beneath the threshold that would categorize them as armed attacks [8]. Furthermore, to this day, cyber operations have no direct impact on the battlefield, but rather target broader national and civilian resilience (see, [11, 20]). Also nowadays in the Ukrainian war, Russia mounts sophisticated cyber-attacks, but it still does not happen in any fashion that is decisive to the war [2].\nIn our opinion, relaxing the ‘physical effects' standard is counterproductive and completely negates the intentions of de-escalation, as it would give countries more opportunities to respond with traditional violence to a cyber-attack under Article 51 of the UN Charter, which allows self-defense in the case of armed violence. Cyber sabotage is an infringement on the sovereignty of the state. This could also apply to cyber espionage and the spread of disinformation. The norm of sovereignty restriction (Article 2(7) of the UN Charter) could provide a framework to critically examine cyber-attacks and even declare them contrary to international law. In the Tallinn Manual 2.0, where a special group of experts proposes applying international law to cyber-attacks, it is also stated that the norm of sovereignty restriction applies to cyber-attacks [15]. However, the norm is very generally formulated, and the Tallinn Manual 2.0 offers, at best, an ambiguous stance regarding the interpretation of the norm and when and which countermeasures are permitted. The norm itself constitutes a less severe offense than an attack or armed attack. A violation of the prohibition of force justifies a stronger response than a violation of sovereignty -- and it could well be that states want to take a strong countermeasure in some situations. However, the legal problems that arise in cyberspace can only be very limitedly interpreted in terms of positive international law,\nand cyberspace continuously ‘escapes' existing forms of regulation. We will not further discuss the legal complications that cyber-attacks entail in this article, but we can at least state that a clear, elaborated, and widely supported normative framework for the majority of cyber-attacks that states face during a cyber conflict is lacking. The cyber conflict does not fit the traditional patterns of thought about peace and war and may even be considered an “other-than-war” phenomenon [13].\nTherefore, cyber-attacks are poised to occupy a distinct place within the moral hierarchy of foreign policy tools, nestled between diplomacy and kinetic warfare, similar to severe economic sanctions. Larry May [9] proposes reclassifying these cyber operations not as acts of war but as akin to embargoes, serving as political and economic levers. This reimagining suggests cyber-attacks could be a strategic alternative to conflict, potentially guiding how NATO responds to attacks on its members. The effectiveness of traditional economic sanctions is debated, especially given globalization's role in diluting their impact. Instances like the UN's sanctions against Libya and the EU's against Russia illustrate sanctions' complex consequences, including retaliation that can harm the sanctioning states themselves. Cyber-attacks offer, according to May, an additional strategy in coercive diplomacy, potentially pressuring states towards compliance without the drawbacks of conventional sanctions. They could prompt states to cease unlawful activities by threatening their digital infrastructure, such as the Stuxnet virus against Iran's nuclear program. This approach, leveraging cyber capabilities for targeted pressure while minimizing civilian distress, could serve as a peaceful yet potent means to enforce international norms and laws. However, the potential for retaliatory cyber-attacks by the targeted state may increase escalation.\nIn addition, many states invest significant amounts of money in building offensive cyber capabilities. They all want to have a high-quality arsenal capable of conducting complex espionage, sabotage, and disinformation spreading. These factors contribute to a risky cyber conflict, where attackers have the means and opportunity to attack vulnerable systems, and where these attackers rarely face repercussions. In this threatening geopolitical situation, countries will likely continue to suffer from cyber-attacks carried out by other states. Moreover, there is a chance that cyber-attacks will escalate, in the sense that both the harmfulness and frequency of cyber-attacks increase. Given the danger to the security of the digital environment, international efforts must be made to effectively de-escalate cyber-attacks: the frequency of cyber-attacks must decrease, and the cyber-attacks that society experiences must become less severe. The question is how this turnaround can be achieved, and who should take responsibility for it. In the next section, we will discuss five solution directions that support this de-escalation.\n## Solution for the De-escalation of the International Information Conflict\n### Continue Cooperation to Improve International Cyber Security\nIn addition to the national steps taken to increase resilience and cyber security, states need to continue investing in international cooperation in the field of cyber security. The emphasis of NATO's cyber policy is on strengthening the defense of NATO member\nstates: “The keynote is defense, whether an attack comes from state, criminal, or other sources,” according to a NATO spokesperson. NATO's defensive doctrine is mainly based on deterrence or passive deterrence: ‘deterrence by denial.' This means that security measures must be strengthened to the point that it becomes practically impossible, or at least very expensive, for attackers to infiltrate systems. The cooperation to further improve digital security at the EU and NATO level must be continued and intensified. Some good examples of this cooperation include the rollout of a broad network of Cyber Emergency Incident Response Teams (the CERT network) and the release of an initial standard (ETSI TS 103 645) by the European Telecommunications Standardisation Institute (ETSI) for securing Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices to support all parties involved in the development and production of IoT for consumers with guidance on securing their products.\nImplementing a policy where NATO refrains from initiating cyber-attacks first, supported by credible military deterrents, can effectively communicate its commitment to restraint and establish boundaries for acceptable cyber-attacks. This strategy would define a baseline for cyber operations that won't provoke a violent response, highlighting that only countermeasures against cyber adversaries are permissible, while attacks on civilian infrastructure are explicitly excluded [6]. However, the dynamic between attackers and defenders in cyberspace remains unresolved, with attackers often gaining the upper hand. Strengthening global cooperation through the sharing of intelligence, best practices, and joint response strategies is essential. Additionally, creating global forums for cybersecurity intelligence and coordination will facilitate timely responses to threats. Despite this, international support for multilateral cyber arms control is waning due to challenges in verification, perceived minimal consequences for violators, and the exclusivity of agreements. Any effective framework must address these issues and consider the complexity of verifying and attributing violations in cyberspace. Furthermore, developing and promoting international cybersecurity standards will help define responsible state behavior, protect civilian networks, and promote a rules-based approach to managing cyber conflict, thus preventing escalation towards armed conflict [18].\n### Make Clear International Agreements Regarding Cyber Sabotage, Disinformation, and Cyber Espionage\nThe geopolitical landscape of cyber-attacks suffers from a notable absence of specific, binding international rules tailored to the unique dynamics of cyber conflict. Consequently, states often rely on generic international legal frameworks, which are ambiguous and open to varied interpretations concerning cyber-attacks. This ambiguity tends to benefit the attackers by fostering an environment of uncertainty that they can exploit. Establishing clear and concrete rules would enable the international community to respond promptly and decisively to cyber incidents, setting clear expectations and consequences for state actions.\nProposals for international agreements on cyber conflict include a “Geneva Convention for cyber-attacks” to establish norms akin to those that govern traditional warfare. However, the feasibility of such a treaty remains in question due to significant geopolitical divisions. For instance, the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context\nof International Security (GGE) has struggled to reach consensus, with major powers diverging sharply on key issues like the right to retaliate following a cyber-attack. The debate over how international humanitarian law applies to cyber operations continues to be contentious, reflecting broader disagreements on the militarization of cyberspace. The diplomatic efforts to forge a consensus have led to a bifurcation in approaches [5]. The U.S. and its allies have pursued one track, while a coalition led by Russia and China has followed another, both proposing different norms for state behavior in cyberspace. This division underscores the challenges in achieving a unified global stance on cyber conflicts.\nBeyond formal treaties, there is potential for building confidence through voluntary agreements that enhance state cooperation and transparency. Such measures could reduce misunderstandings and prevent conflicts, involving multilateral commitments to share intelligence on cyber threats and refrain from targeting civilian infrastructure during peacetime. At the national level, countries could independently declare their responses to cyber incidents, creating predictable standards and responses. This approach includes categorizing types of cyber-attacks and the corresponding responses, which the European Union began implementing in 2019 with a framework for targeted measures against cyber threats.\nThe debate over cyber espionage and its implications for state sovereignty is particularly complex. Cyber espionage often involves tactics that could be seen as violating sovereignty if they cause harm, such as data corruption or system disruption. Meanwhile, the spread of disinformation represents another serious challenge, potentially destabilizing democratic processes and public discourse. It is inappropriate for a democratic rule of law state to further disrupt the information provision in another country. This does not mean that foreign information campaigns are inadmissible. It may be useful to give critical Russian journalism a helping hand. But spreading disinformation that weakens the legal order is, in our opinion, comparable to the use of chemical weapons: an inadmissible means for a civilized democratic state.\nIn terms of countermeasures, the need for proportionate and responsible responses is paramount. Retaliatory cyber-attacks are risky and may not effectively enhance cybersecurity or deter aggressors. Instead, a combination of diplomatic, economic, and legal measures, alongside public exposure of malicious activities, may offer a more sustainable path to maintaining international peace and security in the digital age. Thus, the international community stands at a critical juncture, needing to balance the imperatives of security and cooperation against the backdrop of rapidly evolving cyber capabilities. The establishment of robust, clear, and widely accepted norms for cyberspace is essential to manage and mitigate the risks of cyber conflict effectively.\nA fundamental choice has to be made regarding the type of countermeasures that should be taken in response to a cyber-attack. One can fight fire with fire and launch a similar cyber counterattack. We have indicated that this is irresponsible in the case of undermining a democratic rule of law. Many other cyber-attacks directly affect civilian institutions and facilities -- targets that should be spared as much as possible even in wartime. It is therefore highly questionable whether a democratic rule of law state should retaliate in kind. European States can also respond with other means, for example, by using the European sanctions package, and taking diplomatic and economic\nmeasures. Considering these alternative means is not only of moral importance -- it is questionable whether cyber counterattacks structurally increase cyber security. Every attack contributes to the proliferation of weapons, and cyber conflicts have so far never ended with a decisive counterattack. Moreover, serious reservations are expressed in the literature about the deterrence strategy [19]. If a cyber counterattack is carried out, it must happen immediately and in cooperation with allies. If threats are made without follow-up, the deterrent effect disappears.\n### Ensure Responsible Management of the Cyber Arsenal\nMalware can spread across the world in seconds: that is the price we pay for a global internet. Whoever deploys a cyber weapon can expect the used code to end up in unforeseen hands and perhaps boomerang back in one's face. This means that cyber weapons must be deployed carefully and once-used vulnerabilities must be reported promptly. Because that is the unique opportunity for de-escalation that cyber conflict offers: programmers can neutralize much malicious code. Since these updates increase the security of the entire digital domain, this aspect must be optimally utilized. It is therefore of great importance that intelligence services and defense units work cooperatively with software producers and chip manufacturers to implement security updates as effectively as possible and distribute them among users. International intelligence services and defense units must cooperate with software producers and computer chip manufacturers in implementing security updates and distributing them among users. Moreover, intelligence services and defense units must continuously ask themselves what increases cyber security more: possessing a certain cyber weapon or releasing it?\nInternational allies should also be more open with each other and jointly monitor the management of vulnerabilities. It would be a pity if allies independently collect cyber weapons and keep them strictly secret: then, vulnerabilities could remain on the shelf that the services could have reported from a strategic point of view. Ultimately, in the long term, the importance of reliable and safe digital applications weighs more heavily than the interest in occasionally breaking through that security, however much this would enable specific operations. Responsible management of the cyber arsenal also has consequences for cooperation with private parties. Many large states possess a high-quality arsenal capable of conducting complex espionage, sabotage, and disinformation spreading, and master the simpler methods of committing cyber-attacks. This development has also led to a flourishing private or malicious industry that supplies these weapons, contributes to the proliferation of weapons, and gives opponents access to offensive cyber capabilities. Not for nothing did the German government in 2017 decide to have cyber weapons developed by its own state agency [4]. Government must seriously consider which private partners should be involved in the development of offensive cyber capabilities -- and whether there is enough reason to take this development more into its own hands. Strict conditions must also apply to ensure that dangerous technology is not sold to countries that cannot trust with these weapons. An international lobby for an updated system of export licenses could help in this regard.\n### Protect the Independence of Technology Companies\nTechnology companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Apple play a crucial role in ensuring international cyber security. They can patch the holes in their software and ensure the most robust possible digital applications. This means that it is of crucial importance that these companies do not become extensions of national governments. Kaspersky Labs and Huawei Technologies are under great pressure due to their connections with China and Russia. The governments of Russia and China do not respect the fundamental rights of their citizens and regularly use their power to intervene in the business world -- so why wouldn't they use these global players as pawns of their intelligence services? How exactly the Western governments should deal with companies like Huawei and Kaspersky depends on the extent to which the Chinese and Russian governments actually control these companies. American companies sometimes work intensively with intelligence services, whether or not under duress, as in the renewed PRISM program of the National Security Agency (NSA). The international community must prevent such situations, both within the prescribed frameworks and proactively, if it wants to maintain a reliable and safe international technology market. It is therefore encouraging to see that more than 60 global companies, including Microsoft, Facebook, and Dell, are part of the Cybersecurity Tech Accord and have joined the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace. The cooperation agreement contains a set of common promises that have consequences for how these companies relate to governments. Such as the promise never to help governments launch cyber-attacks against innocent civilians and businesses, and the promise to protect their products against covert influence and sabotage. Although the impact and precise meaning of the agreement in practice remain to be seen, this cooperation could greatly reduce the ability of governments to set up espionage and sabotage operations with the help of companies.\n### Invest in a Societal Debate on Geopolitical Cyber Security\nWar, peace, and international conflict are matters that the population should be particularly involved in a democracy: major societal interests are at stake. The nature of the current information conflict complicates this discussion because so many things are opaque or secret. However, the decision to acquire certain weapons and authorize certain operations cannot only be a matter for experts and officials with special authority: the ongoing cyber conflict must be thoroughly and deeply discussed in the public debate. Each of the four solution directions mentioned above should be addressed in the Dutch and international public debate. Therefore, secrecy by intelligence services and defense cannot be taken for granted -- this secrecy must be weighed against the interest of citizens in gaining insight into the government's cyber operations and forming an opinion about them. The greater the impact of international cyber conflicts on society, the greater the importance of making a relevant public debate possible. Moreover, the involvement of citizens is urgently needed: they are frequently the victims of disinformation, cyber espionage, and cyber sabotage. In the cyber conflict, all citizens have a role to play and should be equipped to recognize disinformation and take basic security measures. Only citizens who understand how technology affects their lives and who have meaningful input in the political choices made regarding new technology are resilient against\nBytes and Battles: Pathways to De-escalation in the Cyber Conflict Arena\nundermining cyber-attacks. The government has a special responsibility to enable this citizenship: by facilitating education, prioritizing the rights of citizens, and providing as much transparency as possible about the issues it faces in a threatening geopolitical situation.\n# 4 Conclusions\nMost actions currently undertaken by influential states fall within what we have described as the cyber conflict. In peacetime, countries build up their cyber security and try to infiltrate the digital systems of other countries as secretly as possible. Russia also actively spreads disinformation. This is a strategy that other autocratic countries do not seem to apply on a large scale, at least not in relation to other countries, but is part of the desire to control, censor, and manipulate the information that reaches their population. There are also several examples of serious cyber sabotage, such as Operation Olympic Games, attributed to Israel and the United States, and the WannaCry attack, attributed to North Korea. So far, cyber-attacks have never led to a cyber-physical war; in that sense, there is no 'cyberwar'. However, the current international situation is risky and worrying, and the disruptive effects of cyber capabilities underscore the risks in the international landscape, which could lead to the escalation of cyber-attacks. We have formulated five possible solutions for the de-escalation of the international cyber conflict. Perhaps the most important is that clear international agreements are made in the field of offensive cyber capabilities. However, in the current geopolitical environment, international support for multilateral cyber arms control agreements is declining, due to issues such as doubts about verification, perceived limited consequences for violators of agreements, and a lack of inclusivity of many agreements. Any multilateral framework for cyber weapons control will have to take this trend into account, especially since the verification of any agreement and the attribution of any violation will be even more complicated in the cyber domain than regular arms control. However, cyber weapons control frameworks limit expensive and destabilizing arms races and help prevent dangerous escalation toward armed conflict.\nAcknowledgment.

In the digital era, the rise of cyber conflict blurs traditional distinctions between war and peace, presenting complex challenges. This article investigates the intricate dynamics of cyber conflict, driven by state and state-sponsored actions in cyber sabotage, espionage, and disinformation spread. It reviews how nations like the US, Russia, and China use cyber capabilities to assert dominance, counter threats, and shape global politics, impacting national security, economic stability, and democratic integrity. The analysis highlights the difficulties in attributing cyber-attacks, limitations of current legal frameworks, and risks of escalation to physical conflict. We suggest five strategic approaches to mitigate cyber conflict, including enhancing international cybersecurity collaboration, setting clear cyber norms, managing cyber arsenals responsibly, safeguarding tech company independence, and promoting public discourse on cyber issues. These strategies aim for a transparent, cooperative resolution to cyber conflicts, aligning with the nuances of digital warfare.\nKeywords: Cyber Conflict · Cyber Attacks · De-escalation\n# 1 A Looming Geopolitical Situation\nCyber capabilities have emerged as a disruptive technological force, revolutionizing traditional warfare and conflict dynamics [20]. This technological evolution has empowered state and state-sponsored actors with unprecedented tools for sabotage, espionage, and manipulation, reshaping the geopolitical landscape into a domain marked by unpredictability and menace. The United States (US), suffering from an increasing number of threats to its critical infrastructure due to cyber-attacks [16] and recognizing the potential of cyber warfare, has adopted a proactive stance as outlined in its strategy to “Achieve and Maintain Cyberspace Superiority” [17]. This approach mandates a “defend forward”, necessitating preemptive infiltration into adversaries’ systems to enable swift retaliation, thus aiming for a deterrence-based dominance in cyberspace. Before 2018, the US maintained an approach of restraint to cyber operations outside the US Government, but this changed due to mainly Russia’s cyber-enables information operations in the 2026 US Presidential election. Obama administration contemplated but ultimately decided against initiating offensive cyber operations, largely due to apprehensions about the possibility of provoking further aggressive actions from Russia. Among the more robust\n© The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024\nD. H. de la Iglesia et al. (Eds.): DiTTEt 2024, AISC 1459, pp. 295-306, 2024.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-66635-3_25\ncyber strategies under consideration were proposals to neutralize websites disseminating leaked information, to execute cyber-attacks aimed at disrupting Russian media outlets, and to impair the command and control infrastructure utilized by Russian intelligence entities. Nonetheless, the chosen course of action by the administration veered away from cyber retaliation, opting instead for a response that encompassed diplomatic, economic, and law enforcement strategies. This led to a call from certain factions within the private sector and the Department of Defense to reevaluate existing beliefs regarding escalation dynamics, advocating for a more forward-leaning strategy [6].\nThe concept of cyber superiority was already vividly illustrated by Operation Olympic Games, where the U.S. in collaboration with Israel, reportedly deployed the Stuxnet virus against Iran's nuclear program [10]. Despite this show of offensive capability, the incident underscored the vulnerability of even technologically advanced nations to retaliatory cyber-attacks, highlighting the complex, double-edged nature of cyber power. Further exemplifying the strategic shift towards cyber warfare, Russia's actions in Ukraine since 2014 have demonstrated the seamless integration of cyber operations with traditional military tactics. Russian forces not only commandeered communication infrastructures but also launched cyber-attacks against critical services, employing disinformation campaigns to undermine the state and influence global perceptions. For example, nowadays in the Ukraine war, Russia repeatedly has claimed that Ukraine is filled with “Nazis”, and persists in promoting this demonstrably false claim, both internally and externally [2]. Similarly, China's cyber activities, including economic and state espionage, have prompted international tensions, leading to agreements aimed at curbing cyber espionage -- a testament to the global recognition of the seriousness of cyber threats.\nThe digital realm has thus become a critical fifth dimension of military strategy, with nations deploying viruses, ransomware, and exploiting vulnerabilities to assert their interests [12]. All major world powers have established military cyber commands and reformed their intelligence services, and in some states, like Russia and China, there are close ties between government agencies and patriotic or even criminal hackers. States often operate from the shadows, and typically neither confirm nor deny their involvement in a cyber-attack. Instead, they provide ambiguous responses such as ‘non-denial denials' or refuse to address the allegations' [3]. This approach allows states to pursue dual objectives: they can maintain crisis stability while leaving open the possibility of their participation in the cyber-attack. By intentionally remaining under suspicion, a state can influence how rivals perceive its cyber capabilities and determination. Additionally, by not denying responsibility, a state can also affect how rivals view the capabilities of its allies, thereby bolstering the credibility of deterrence. This approach achieves these ends without the escalatory dangers associated with explicitly admitting responsibility.\nThe establishment of military cyber commands and the collaboration between governments and hacker groups underscore the strategic importance of cyberspace. In this shadowy warfare, the lines between peace and conflict blur, as states engage in continuous digital skirmishing, preparing the battlefield with espionage tools, traps, and offensive weapons, even during peacetime. This transformation into a world where cyber conflict is an “always on” phenomenon demands a reevaluation of traditional notions of warfare and security [1]. Cyber operations, from sabotage and espionage to disinformation\ncampaigns, have become integral components of national defense and offensive strategies. These operations not only pose significant challenges to societal security but also offer strategic tools to achieve political and military objectives. As the digital landscape evolves, so too will the nature of conflict and the strategies nations employ to protect their interests and assert their power on the global stage.\n## The Cyber Conflict\nThe cyber conflict lies between peace and war, which has implications for how we should think about peacetime and wartime (see Table 1). Traditionally, war and peace form a binary distinction: it is either war or peace between countries. This distinction can still be maintained, provided we distinguish peacetime from cyber peace, and understand war as cyber-physical war. In a time of cyber peace, it is not only peacetime, but there is also no cyber conflict. Countries do not engage in cyber espionage and do not use cyber means to cause damage in another country. Disinformation campaigns are also not undertaken. The focus in this situation is on strengthening cybersecurity. States can also train cyber soldiers and acquire weapons. However, the ability to build offensive cyber capabilities is limited: gaining intelligence about the cyber capabilities and systems of the opponent is of great importance for both setting up one's defense and creating offensive capacity. The goals in the cyber conflict vary: sometimes a state seeks economic advantages by spying, sometimes a state wants to prepare the military battlefield in its favor, and sometimes a state wants to pressure or manipulate the political decision-making in another state. But cyber-attacks have never escalated to the point where countries have declared war on each other. Moreover, in this cyber conflict, there is an important difference between cyber sabotage that directly causes severe damage, and cyber espionage and disinformation spreading that serve the interests of a particular state much more indirectly. The victim is not supposed to notice cyber espionage and disinformation spreading, while cyber sabotage immediately affects the physical world of people -- for example, because financial services break down or a power plant fails.\nWe therefore distinguish between cold and hot aspects of the cyber conflict. In situations of cold cyber conflict, it seems as if no conflict is taking place at all since countries use cyber espionage and the spread of disinformation. In situations of hot cyber conflict, the information struggle flares up because facilities are openly damaged and people directly experience the consequences of cyber sabotage in their own living environment. An example of such a hot cyber conflict was the Stuxnet operation, which caused serious physical damage in peacetime. The damage was so severe that there has been broad discussion about whether the attack should even be classified as an armed attack under humanitarian law [14]. The cold and hot aspects of the cyber conflict are not mutually exclusive. For example, cyber sabotage generally presupposes cyber espionage. A particular cyber conflict has more or fewer cold and hot aspects. And it's not that a hot cyber-attack is necessarily more dangerous than a cold cyber-attack -- perhaps nothing is more dangerous than corrupting a democratic rule of law state's information provision from within. But it is true that serious cyber sabotage borders on an act of war, as acts of war are characterized by very serious physical damage.\nL. Royakkers\nTable 1. The action strategies within the four phases in cyberspace.\n|  Situation | Intent  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Cyber peace (peacetime) | Peace/neutrality; Strengthening of (inter)national cybersecurity: • Establishment of (inter)national Computer Emergency Response Teams, detecting, preventing, and addressing cyber incidents and risks  |\n|  Cold Cyber Conflict (peacetime) | Strengthening national offensive cyber capacity: • The significant increase in defense spending on cyber weapons in most states Acquiring (strategic) information: • The espionage operations of the American security agency NSA (revealed by Edward Snowden) e.g., to eavesdrop on European allies Influencing public opinion or democratic processes: • Russian disinformation about MH17 • Alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections  |\n|  Warm Cyber Conflict (peacetime) | Preparing the digital battlefield: • The American strategy of ‘forward defense,’ where foreign vital structures are hacked in advance to quickly retaliate upon infiltration Exerting political pressure: • Russian cyber-attacks in 2007 on internet sites of the Estonian government, banks, media, and companies, due to a conflict over the relocation of a Russian war monument in the Estonian capital Tallinn Damaging, disrupting, or destroying (vital) systems: • The American Stuxnet attack on the Iranian nuclear program  |\n|  Cyber-Physical War (wartime) | Military victory: • In the wars in Eastern Ukraine, Russia made/makes extensive use of cyber-attacks alongside conventional weapons  |\nWe must nuance our understanding of war. In wartime, offensive cyber capabilities will likely play a significant role: more and more military equipment is becoming digitalized, and it can be very advantageous to mislead the opponent's air defense through disinformation, as happened during Operation Orchard of the Israeli Air Force on a Syrian nuclear reactor. Therefore, it makes sense to speak of cyber-physical warfare, integrating digital applications into the conventional arsenal of warfare. Russia's cyber activity in Ukraine transcends warm cyber conflict because the cyber-attacks coincided with conventional military deployment. However, it is questionable whether the cyber sabotage carried out by Russia would be sufficient to fall under the prohibition of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. The severity of the consequences is usually considered the measure to determine whether a particular cyber-attack falls under the\nprohibition of force (see [18]). In international humanitarian law, the ‘physical effects' standard is used to define what is considered ‘use of force'. This standard states that there is only force if it leads to an actual or potentially harmful physical effect on the targeted state. These physical effects include death, bodily injury, or significant damage to vital infrastructures or military installations. Technically, a sabotaging cyber-attack could lead to civilian casualties or significant infrastructural damage, for example, as a result of long-term disabling of power plants. Yet, it is challenging to find cyber-attacks that meet that standard. Sabotaging cyber-attacks generally do not result in civilian casualties -- at least not in a direct sense, but can endanger human health and well-being [16]. Most sabotaging cyber-attacks do cause serious societal damage but do not cripple vital infrastructures. For example, sabotaging cyber-attacks occasionally disrupt banking services, but the financial sector has never been completely shut down. Similarly, in 2015 in Ukraine, the power supply was shut down, but the lights came back on a few hours later. Therefore, it is questionable where the turning point lies between an attack that damages vital infrastructure and an attack that causes significant damage to vital infrastructure. Experts indicate that international law does not clearly answer this question [15]. For example, there is no consensus on whether the Stuxnet attack should be considered an armed attack. This is significant, as that attack is marked as one of the most far-reaching cyber-attacks. In addition, some authors argue that certain cyber-attacks that do not cause physical damage should still be considered armed attacks (see, e.g. [7]). In this case, we should think of cyber-attacks that can have a socially disruptive effect, such as crashing a stock market through digital manipulations. However, yet in practice, cyber conflicts have tended to be of low intensity, staying beneath the threshold that would categorize them as armed attacks [8]. Furthermore, to this day, cyber operations have no direct impact on the battlefield, but rather target broader national and civilian resilience (see, [11, 20]). Also nowadays in the Ukrainian war, Russia mounts sophisticated cyber-attacks, but it still does not happen in any fashion that is decisive to the war [2].\nIn our opinion, relaxing the ‘physical effects' standard is counterproductive and completely negates the intentions of de-escalation, as it would give countries more opportunities to respond with traditional violence to a cyber-attack under Article 51 of the UN Charter, which allows self-defense in the case of armed violence. Cyber sabotage is an infringement on the sovereignty of the state. This could also apply to cyber espionage and the spread of disinformation. The norm of sovereignty restriction (Article 2(7) of the UN Charter) could provide a framework to critically examine cyber-attacks and even declare them contrary to international law. In the Tallinn Manual 2.0, where a special group of experts proposes applying international law to cyber-attacks, it is also stated that the norm of sovereignty restriction applies to cyber-attacks [15]. However, the norm is very generally formulated, and the Tallinn Manual 2.0 offers, at best, an ambiguous stance regarding the interpretation of the norm and when and which countermeasures are permitted. The norm itself constitutes a less severe offense than an attack or armed attack. A violation of the prohibition of force justifies a stronger response than a violation of sovereignty -- and it could well be that states want to take a strong countermeasure in some situations. However, the legal problems that arise in cyberspace can only be very limitedly interpreted in terms of positive international law,\nand cyberspace continuously ‘escapes' existing forms of regulation. We will not further discuss the legal complications that cyber-attacks entail in this article, but we can at least state that a clear, elaborated, and widely supported normative framework for the majority of cyber-attacks that states face during a cyber conflict is lacking. The cyber conflict does not fit the traditional patterns of thought about peace and war and may even be considered an “other-than-war” phenomenon [13].\nTherefore, cyber-attacks are poised to occupy a distinct place within the moral hierarchy of foreign policy tools, nestled between diplomacy and kinetic warfare, similar to severe economic sanctions. Larry May [9] proposes reclassifying these cyber operations not as acts of war but as akin to embargoes, serving as political and economic levers. This reimagining suggests cyber-attacks could be a strategic alternative to conflict, potentially guiding how NATO responds to attacks on its members. The effectiveness of traditional economic sanctions is debated, especially given globalization's role in diluting their impact. Instances like the UN's sanctions against Libya and the EU's against Russia illustrate sanctions' complex consequences, including retaliation that can harm the sanctioning states themselves. Cyber-attacks offer, according to May, an additional strategy in coercive diplomacy, potentially pressuring states towards compliance without the drawbacks of conventional sanctions. They could prompt states to cease unlawful activities by threatening their digital infrastructure, such as the Stuxnet virus against Iran's nuclear program. This approach, leveraging cyber capabilities for targeted pressure while minimizing civilian distress, could serve as a peaceful yet potent means to enforce international norms and laws. However, the potential for retaliatory cyber-attacks by the targeted state may increase escalation.\nIn addition, many states invest significant amounts of money in building offensive cyber capabilities. They all want to have a high-quality arsenal capable of conducting complex espionage, sabotage, and disinformation spreading. These factors contribute to a risky cyber conflict, where attackers have the means and opportunity to attack vulnerable systems, and where these attackers rarely face repercussions. In this threatening geopolitical situation, countries will likely continue to suffer from cyber-attacks carried out by other states. Moreover, there is a chance that cyber-attacks will escalate, in the sense that both the harmfulness and frequency of cyber-attacks increase. Given the danger to the security of the digital environment, international efforts must be made to effectively de-escalate cyber-attacks: the frequency of cyber-attacks must decrease, and the cyber-attacks that society experiences must become less severe. The question is how this turnaround can be achieved, and who should take responsibility for it. In the next section, we will discuss five solution directions that support this de-escalation.\n## Solution for the De-escalation of the International Information Conflict\n### Continue Cooperation to Improve International Cyber Security\nIn addition to the national steps taken to increase resilience and cyber security, states need to continue investing in international cooperation in the field of cyber security. The emphasis of NATO's cyber policy is on strengthening the defense of NATO member\nstates: “The keynote is defense, whether an attack comes from state, criminal, or other sources,” according to a NATO spokesperson. NATO's defensive doctrine is mainly based on deterrence or passive deterrence: ‘deterrence by denial.' This means that security measures must be strengthened to the point that it becomes practically impossible, or at least very expensive, for attackers to infiltrate systems. The cooperation to further improve digital security at the EU and NATO level must be continued and intensified. Some good examples of this cooperation include the rollout of a broad network of Cyber Emergency Incident Response Teams (the CERT network) and the release of an initial standard (ETSI TS 103 645) by the European Telecommunications Standardisation Institute (ETSI) for securing Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices to support all parties involved in the development and production of IoT for consumers with guidance on securing their products.\nImplementing a policy where NATO refrains from initiating cyber-attacks first, supported by credible military deterrents, can effectively communicate its commitment to restraint and establish boundaries for acceptable cyber-attacks. This strategy would define a baseline for cyber operations that won't provoke a violent response, highlighting that only countermeasures against cyber adversaries are permissible, while attacks on civilian infrastructure are explicitly excluded [6]. However, the dynamic between attackers and defenders in cyberspace remains unresolved, with attackers often gaining the upper hand. Strengthening global cooperation through the sharing of intelligence, best practices, and joint response strategies is essential. Additionally, creating global forums for cybersecurity intelligence and coordination will facilitate timely responses to threats. Despite this, international support for multilateral cyber arms control is waning due to challenges in verification, perceived minimal consequences for violators, and the exclusivity of agreements. Any effective framework must address these issues and consider the complexity of verifying and attributing violations in cyberspace. Furthermore, developing and promoting international cybersecurity standards will help define responsible state behavior, protect civilian networks, and promote a rules-based approach to managing cyber conflict, thus preventing escalation towards armed conflict [18].\n### Make Clear International Agreements Regarding Cyber Sabotage, Disinformation, and Cyber Espionage\nThe geopolitical landscape of cyber-attacks suffers from a notable absence of specific, binding international rules tailored to the unique dynamics of cyber conflict. Consequently, states often rely on generic international legal frameworks, which are ambiguous and open to varied interpretations concerning cyber-attacks. This ambiguity tends to benefit the attackers by fostering an environment of uncertainty that they can exploit. Establishing clear and concrete rules would enable the international community to respond promptly and decisively to cyber incidents, setting clear expectations and consequences for state actions.\nProposals for international agreements on cyber conflict include a “Geneva Convention for cyber-attacks” to establish norms akin to those that govern traditional warfare. However, the feasibility of such a treaty remains in question due to significant geopolitical divisions. For instance, the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context\nof International Security (GGE) has struggled to reach consensus, with major powers diverging sharply on key issues like the right to retaliate following a cyber-attack. The debate over how international humanitarian law applies to cyber operations continues to be contentious, reflecting broader disagreements on the militarization of cyberspace. The diplomatic efforts to forge a consensus have led to a bifurcation in approaches [5]. The U.S. and its allies have pursued one track, while a coalition led by Russia and China has followed another, both proposing different norms for state behavior in cyberspace. This division underscores the challenges in achieving a unified global stance on cyber conflicts.\nBeyond formal treaties, there is potential for building confidence through voluntary agreements that enhance state cooperation and transparency. Such measures could reduce misunderstandings and prevent conflicts, involving multilateral commitments to share intelligence on cyber threats and refrain from targeting civilian infrastructure during peacetime. At the national level, countries could independently declare their responses to cyber incidents, creating predictable standards and responses. This approach includes categorizing types of cyber-attacks and the corresponding responses, which the European Union began implementing in 2019 with a framework for targeted measures against cyber threats.\nThe debate over cyber espionage and its implications for state sovereignty is particularly complex. Cyber espionage often involves tactics that could be seen as violating sovereignty if they cause harm, such as data corruption or system disruption. Meanwhile, the spread of disinformation represents another serious challenge, potentially destabilizing democratic processes and public discourse. It is inappropriate for a democratic rule of law state to further disrupt the information provision in another country. This does not mean that foreign information campaigns are inadmissible. It may be useful to give critical Russian journalism a helping hand. But spreading disinformation that weakens the legal order is, in our opinion, comparable to the use of chemical weapons: an inadmissible means for a civilized democratic state.\nIn terms of countermeasures, the need for proportionate and responsible responses is paramount. Retaliatory cyber-attacks are risky and may not effectively enhance cybersecurity or deter aggressors. Instead, a combination of diplomatic, economic, and legal measures, alongside public exposure of malicious activities, may offer a more sustainable path to maintaining international peace and security in the digital age. Thus, the international community stands at a critical juncture, needing to balance the imperatives of security and cooperation against the backdrop of rapidly evolving cyber capabilities. The establishment of robust, clear, and widely accepted norms for cyberspace is essential to manage and mitigate the risks of cyber conflict effectively.\nA fundamental choice has to be made regarding the type of countermeasures that should be taken in response to a cyber-attack. One can fight fire with fire and launch a similar cyber counterattack. We have indicated that this is irresponsible in the case of undermining a democratic rule of law. Many other cyber-attacks directly affect civilian institutions and facilities -- targets that should be spared as much as possible even in wartime. It is therefore highly questionable whether a democratic rule of law state should retaliate in kind. European States can also respond with other means, for example, by using the European sanctions package, and taking diplomatic and economic\nmeasures. Considering these alternative means is not only of moral importance -- it is questionable whether cyber counterattacks structurally increase cyber security. Every attack contributes to the proliferation of weapons, and cyber conflicts have so far never ended with a decisive counterattack. Moreover, serious reservations are expressed in the literature about the deterrence strategy [19]. If a cyber counterattack is carried out, it must happen immediately and in cooperation with allies. If threats are made without follow-up, the deterrent effect disappears.\n### Ensure Responsible Management of the Cyber Arsenal\nMalware can spread across the world in seconds: that is the price we pay for a global internet. Whoever deploys a cyber weapon can expect the used code to end up in unforeseen hands and perhaps boomerang back in one's face. This means that cyber weapons must be deployed carefully and once-used vulnerabilities must be reported promptly. Because that is the unique opportunity for de-escalation that cyber conflict offers: programmers can neutralize much malicious code. Since these updates increase the security of the entire digital domain, this aspect must be optimally utilized. It is therefore of great importance that intelligence services and defense units work cooperatively with software producers and chip manufacturers to implement security updates as effectively as possible and distribute them among users. International intelligence services and defense units must cooperate with software producers and computer chip manufacturers in implementing security updates and distributing them among users. Moreover, intelligence services and defense units must continuously ask themselves what increases cyber security more: possessing a certain cyber weapon or releasing it?\nInternational allies should also be more open with each other and jointly monitor the management of vulnerabilities. It would be a pity if allies independently collect cyber weapons and keep them strictly secret: then, vulnerabilities could remain on the shelf that the services could have reported from a strategic point of view. Ultimately, in the long term, the importance of reliable and safe digital applications weighs more heavily than the interest in occasionally breaking through that security, however much this would enable specific operations. Responsible management of the cyber arsenal also has consequences for cooperation with private parties. Many large states possess a high-quality arsenal capable of conducting complex espionage, sabotage, and disinformation spreading, and master the simpler methods of committing cyber-attacks. This development has also led to a flourishing private or malicious industry that supplies these weapons, contributes to the proliferation of weapons, and gives opponents access to offensive cyber capabilities. Not for nothing did the German government in 2017 decide to have cyber weapons developed by its own state agency [4]. Government must seriously consider which private partners should be involved in the development of offensive cyber capabilities -- and whether there is enough reason to take this development more into its own hands. Strict conditions must also apply to ensure that dangerous technology is not sold to countries that cannot trust with these weapons. An international lobby for an updated system of export licenses could help in this regard.\n### Protect the Independence of Technology Companies\nTechnology companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Apple play a crucial role in ensuring international cyber security. They can patch the holes in their software and ensure the most robust possible digital applications. This means that it is of crucial importance that these companies do not become extensions of national governments. Kaspersky Labs and Huawei Technologies are under great pressure due to their connections with China and Russia. The governments of Russia and China do not respect the fundamental rights of their citizens and regularly use their power to intervene in the business world -- so why wouldn't they use these global players as pawns of their intelligence services? How exactly the Western governments should deal with companies like Huawei and Kaspersky depends on the extent to which the Chinese and Russian governments actually control these companies. American companies sometimes work intensively with intelligence services, whether or not under duress, as in the renewed PRISM program of the National Security Agency (NSA). The international community must prevent such situations, both within the prescribed frameworks and proactively, if it wants to maintain a reliable and safe international technology market. It is therefore encouraging to see that more than 60 global companies, including Microsoft, Facebook, and Dell, are part of the Cybersecurity Tech Accord and have joined the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace. The cooperation agreement contains a set of common promises that have consequences for how these companies relate to governments. Such as the promise never to help governments launch cyber-attacks against innocent civilians and businesses, and the promise to protect their products against covert influence and sabotage. Although the impact and precise meaning of the agreement in practice remain to be seen, this cooperation could greatly reduce the ability of governments to set up espionage and sabotage operations with the help of companies.\n### Invest in a Societal Debate on Geopolitical Cyber Security\nWar, peace, and international conflict are matters that the population should be particularly involved in a democracy: major societal interests are at stake. The nature of the current information conflict complicates this discussion because so many things are opaque or secret. However, the decision to acquire certain weapons and authorize certain operations cannot only be a matter for experts and officials with special authority: the ongoing cyber conflict must be thoroughly and deeply discussed in the public debate. Each of the four solution directions mentioned above should be addressed in the Dutch and international public debate. Therefore, secrecy by intelligence services and defense cannot be taken for granted -- this secrecy must be weighed against the interest of citizens in gaining insight into the government's cyber operations and forming an opinion about them. The greater the impact of international cyber conflicts on society, the greater the importance of making a relevant public debate possible. Moreover, the involvement of citizens is urgently needed: they are frequently the victims of disinformation, cyber espionage, and cyber sabotage. In the cyber conflict, all citizens have a role to play and should be equipped to recognize disinformation and take basic security measures. Only citizens who understand how technology affects their lives and who have meaningful input in the political choices made regarding new technology are resilient against\nBytes and Battles: Pathways to De-escalation in the Cyber Conflict Arena\nundermining cyber-attacks. The government has a special responsibility to enable this citizenship: by facilitating education, prioritizing the rights of citizens, and providing as much transparency as possible about the issues it faces in a threatening geopolitical situation.\n# 4 Conclusions\nMost actions currently undertaken by influential states fall within what we have described as the cyber conflict. In peacetime, countries build up their cyber security and try to infiltrate the digital systems of other countries as secretly as possible. Russia also actively spreads disinformation. This is a strategy that other autocratic countries do not seem to apply on a large scale, at least not in relation to other countries, but is part of the desire to control, censor, and manipulate the information that reaches their population. There are also several examples of serious cyber sabotage, such as Operation Olympic Games, attributed to Israel and the United States, and the WannaCry attack, attributed to North Korea. So far, cyber-attacks have never led to a cyber-physical war; in that sense, there is no 'cyberwar'. However, the current international situation is risky and worrying, and the disruptive effects of cyber capabilities underscore the risks in the international landscape, which could lead to the escalation of cyber-attacks. We have formulated five possible solutions for the de-escalation of the international cyber conflict. Perhaps the most important is that clear international agreements are made in the field of offensive cyber capabilities. However, in the current geopolitical environment, international support for multilateral cyber arms control agreements is declining, due to issues such as doubts about verification, perceived limited consequences for violators of agreements, and a lack of inclusivity of many agreements. Any multilateral framework for cyber weapons control will have to take this trend into account, especially since the verification of any agreement and the attribution of any violation will be even more complicated in the cyber domain than regular arms control. However, cyber weapons control frameworks limit expensive and destabilizing arms races and help prevent dangerous escalation toward armed conflict.\nAcknowledgment.

In the digital era, the rise of cyber conflict blurs traditional distinctions between war and peace, presenting complex challenges. This article investigates the intricate dynamics of cyber conflict, driven by state and state-sponsored actions in cyber sabotage, espionage, and disinformation spread. It reviews how nations like the US, Russia, and China use cyber capabilities to assert dominance, counter threats, and shape global politics, impacting national security, economic stability, and democratic integrity. The analysis highlights the difficulties in attributing cyber-attacks, limitations of current legal frameworks, and risks of escalation to physical conflict. We suggest five strategic approaches to mitigate cyber conflict, including enhancing international cybersecurity collaboration, setting clear cyber norms, managing cyber arsenals responsibly, safeguarding tech company independence, and promoting public discourse on cyber issues. These strategies aim for a transparent, cooperative resolution to cyber conflicts, aligning with the nuances of digital warfare.\nKeywords: Cyber Conflict · Cyber Attacks · De-escalation\n# 1 A Looming Geopolitical Situation\nCyber capabilities have emerged as a disruptive technological force, revolutionizing traditional warfare and conflict dynamics [20]. This technological evolution has empowered state and state-sponsored actors with unprecedented tools for sabotage, espionage, and manipulation, reshaping the geopolitical landscape into a domain marked by unpredictability and menace. The United States (US), suffering from an increasing number of threats to its critical infrastructure due to cyber-attacks [16] and recognizing the potential of cyber warfare, has adopted a proactive stance as outlined in its strategy to “Achieve and Maintain Cyberspace Superiority” [17]. This approach mandates a “defend forward”, necessitating preemptive infiltration into adversaries’ systems to enable swift retaliation, thus aiming for a deterrence-based dominance in cyberspace. Before 2018, the US maintained an approach of restraint to cyber operations outside the US Government, but this changed due to mainly Russia’s cyber-enables information operations in the 2026 US Presidential election. Obama administration contemplated but ultimately decided against initiating offensive cyber operations, largely due to apprehensions about the possibility of provoking further aggressive actions from Russia. Among the more robust\n© The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024\nD. H. de la Iglesia et al. (Eds.): DiTTEt 2024, AISC 1459, pp. 295-306, 2024.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-66635-3_25\ncyber strategies under consideration were proposals to neutralize websites disseminating leaked information, to execute cyber-attacks aimed at disrupting Russian media outlets, and to impair the command and control infrastructure utilized by Russian intelligence entities. Nonetheless, the chosen course of action by the administration veered away from cyber retaliation, opting instead for a response that encompassed diplomatic, economic, and law enforcement strategies. This led to a call from certain factions within the private sector and the Department of Defense to reevaluate existing beliefs regarding escalation dynamics, advocating for a more forward-leaning strategy [6].\nThe concept of cyber superiority was already vividly illustrated by Operation Olympic Games, where the U.S. in collaboration with Israel, reportedly deployed the Stuxnet virus against Iran's nuclear program [10]. Despite this show of offensive capability, the incident underscored the vulnerability of even technologically advanced nations to retaliatory cyber-attacks, highlighting the complex, double-edged nature of cyber power. Further exemplifying the strategic shift towards cyber warfare, Russia's actions in Ukraine since 2014 have demonstrated the seamless integration of cyber operations with traditional military tactics. Russian forces not only commandeered communication infrastructures but also launched cyber-attacks against critical services, employing disinformation campaigns to undermine the state and influence global perceptions. For example, nowadays in the Ukraine war, Russia repeatedly has claimed that Ukraine is filled with “Nazis”, and persists in promoting this demonstrably false claim, both internally and externally [2]. Similarly, China's cyber activities, including economic and state espionage, have prompted international tensions, leading to agreements aimed at curbing cyber espionage -- a testament to the global recognition of the seriousness of cyber threats.\nThe digital realm has thus become a critical fifth dimension of military strategy, with nations deploying viruses, ransomware, and exploiting vulnerabilities to assert their interests [12]. All major world powers have established military cyber commands and reformed their intelligence services, and in some states, like Russia and China, there are close ties between government agencies and patriotic or even criminal hackers. States often operate from the shadows, and typically neither confirm nor deny their involvement in a cyber-attack. Instead, they provide ambiguous responses such as ‘non-denial denials' or refuse to address the allegations' [3]. This approach allows states to pursue dual objectives: they can maintain crisis stability while leaving open the possibility of their participation in the cyber-attack. By intentionally remaining under suspicion, a state can influence how rivals perceive its cyber capabilities and determination. Additionally, by not denying responsibility, a state can also affect how rivals view the capabilities of its allies, thereby bolstering the credibility of deterrence. This approach achieves these ends without the escalatory dangers associated with explicitly admitting responsibility.\nThe establishment of military cyber commands and the collaboration between governments and hacker groups underscore the strategic importance of cyberspace. In this shadowy warfare, the lines between peace and conflict blur, as states engage in continuous digital skirmishing, preparing the battlefield with espionage tools, traps, and offensive weapons, even during peacetime. This transformation into a world where cyber conflict is an “always on” phenomenon demands a reevaluation of traditional notions of warfare and security [1]. Cyber operations, from sabotage and espionage to disinformation\ncampaigns, have become integral components of national defense and offensive strategies. These operations not only pose significant challenges to societal security but also offer strategic tools to achieve political and military objectives. As the digital landscape evolves, so too will the nature of conflict and the strategies nations employ to protect their interests and assert their power on the global stage.\n## The Cyber Conflict\nThe cyber conflict lies between peace and war, which has implications for how we should think about peacetime and wartime (see Table 1). Traditionally, war and peace form a binary distinction: it is either war or peace between countries. This distinction can still be maintained, provided we distinguish peacetime from cyber peace, and understand war as cyber-physical war. In a time of cyber peace, it is not only peacetime, but there is also no cyber conflict. Countries do not engage in cyber espionage and do not use cyber means to cause damage in another country. Disinformation campaigns are also not undertaken. The focus in this situation is on strengthening cybersecurity. States can also train cyber soldiers and acquire weapons. However, the ability to build offensive cyber capabilities is limited: gaining intelligence about the cyber capabilities and systems of the opponent is of great importance for both setting up one's defense and creating offensive capacity. The goals in the cyber conflict vary: sometimes a state seeks economic advantages by spying, sometimes a state wants to prepare the military battlefield in its favor, and sometimes a state wants to pressure or manipulate the political decision-making in another state. But cyber-attacks have never escalated to the point where countries have declared war on each other. Moreover, in this cyber conflict, there is an important difference between cyber sabotage that directly causes severe damage, and cyber espionage and disinformation spreading that serve the interests of a particular state much more indirectly. The victim is not supposed to notice cyber espionage and disinformation spreading, while cyber sabotage immediately affects the physical world of people -- for example, because financial services break down or a power plant fails.\nWe therefore distinguish between cold and hot aspects of the cyber conflict. In situations of cold cyber conflict, it seems as if no conflict is taking place at all since countries use cyber espionage and the spread of disinformation. In situations of hot cyber conflict, the information struggle flares up because facilities are openly damaged and people directly experience the consequences of cyber sabotage in their own living environment. An example of such a hot cyber conflict was the Stuxnet operation, which caused serious physical damage in peacetime. The damage was so severe that there has been broad discussion about whether the attack should even be classified as an armed attack under humanitarian law [14]. The cold and hot aspects of the cyber conflict are not mutually exclusive. For example, cyber sabotage generally presupposes cyber espionage. A particular cyber conflict has more or fewer cold and hot aspects. And it's not that a hot cyber-attack is necessarily more dangerous than a cold cyber-attack -- perhaps nothing is more dangerous than corrupting a democratic rule of law state's information provision from within. But it is true that serious cyber sabotage borders on an act of war, as acts of war are characterized by very serious physical damage.\nL. Royakkers\nTable 1. The action strategies within the four phases in cyberspace.\n|  Situation | Intent  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Cyber peace (peacetime) | Peace/neutrality; Strengthening of (inter)national cybersecurity: • Establishment of (inter)national Computer Emergency Response Teams, detecting, preventing, and addressing cyber incidents and risks  |\n|  Cold Cyber Conflict (peacetime) | Strengthening national offensive cyber capacity: • The significant increase in defense spending on cyber weapons in most states Acquiring (strategic) information: • The espionage operations of the American security agency NSA (revealed by Edward Snowden) e.g., to eavesdrop on European allies Influencing public opinion or democratic processes: • Russian disinformation about MH17 • Alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections  |\n|  Warm Cyber Conflict (peacetime) | Preparing the digital battlefield: • The American strategy of ‘forward defense,’ where foreign vital structures are hacked in advance to quickly retaliate upon infiltration Exerting political pressure: • Russian cyber-attacks in 2007 on internet sites of the Estonian government, banks, media, and companies, due to a conflict over the relocation of a Russian war monument in the Estonian capital Tallinn Damaging, disrupting, or destroying (vital) systems: • The American Stuxnet attack on the Iranian nuclear program  |\n|  Cyber-Physical War (wartime) | Military victory: • In the wars in Eastern Ukraine, Russia made/makes extensive use of cyber-attacks alongside conventional weapons  |\nWe must nuance our understanding of war. In wartime, offensive cyber capabilities will likely play a significant role: more and more military equipment is becoming digitalized, and it can be very advantageous to mislead the opponent's air defense through disinformation, as happened during Operation Orchard of the Israeli Air Force on a Syrian nuclear reactor. Therefore, it makes sense to speak of cyber-physical warfare, integrating digital applications into the conventional arsenal of warfare. Russia's cyber activity in Ukraine transcends warm cyber conflict because the cyber-attacks coincided with conventional military deployment. However, it is questionable whether the cyber sabotage carried out by Russia would be sufficient to fall under the prohibition of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. The severity of the consequences is usually considered the measure to determine whether a particular cyber-attack falls under the\nprohibition of force (see [18]). In international humanitarian law, the ‘physical effects' standard is used to define what is considered ‘use of force'. This standard states that there is only force if it leads to an actual or potentially harmful physical effect on the targeted state. These physical effects include death, bodily injury, or significant damage to vital infrastructures or military installations. Technically, a sabotaging cyber-attack could lead to civilian casualties or significant infrastructural damage, for example, as a result of long-term disabling of power plants. Yet, it is challenging to find cyber-attacks that meet that standard. Sabotaging cyber-attacks generally do not result in civilian casualties -- at least not in a direct sense, but can endanger human health and well-being [16]. Most sabotaging cyber-attacks do cause serious societal damage but do not cripple vital infrastructures. For example, sabotaging cyber-attacks occasionally disrupt banking services, but the financial sector has never been completely shut down. Similarly, in 2015 in Ukraine, the power supply was shut down, but the lights came back on a few hours later. Therefore, it is questionable where the turning point lies between an attack that damages vital infrastructure and an attack that causes significant damage to vital infrastructure. Experts indicate that international law does not clearly answer this question [15]. For example, there is no consensus on whether the Stuxnet attack should be considered an armed attack. This is significant, as that attack is marked as one of the most far-reaching cyber-attacks. In addition, some authors argue that certain cyber-attacks that do not cause physical damage should still be considered armed attacks (see, e.g. [7]). In this case, we should think of cyber-attacks that can have a socially disruptive effect, such as crashing a stock market through digital manipulations. However, yet in practice, cyber conflicts have tended to be of low intensity, staying beneath the threshold that would categorize them as armed attacks [8]. Furthermore, to this day, cyber operations have no direct impact on the battlefield, but rather target broader national and civilian resilience (see, [11, 20]). Also nowadays in the Ukrainian war, Russia mounts sophisticated cyber-attacks, but it still does not happen in any fashion that is decisive to the war [2].\nIn our opinion, relaxing the ‘physical effects' standard is counterproductive and completely negates the intentions of de-escalation, as it would give countries more opportunities to respond with traditional violence to a cyber-attack under Article 51 of the UN Charter, which allows self-defense in the case of armed violence. Cyber sabotage is an infringement on the sovereignty of the state. This could also apply to cyber espionage and the spread of disinformation. The norm of sovereignty restriction (Article 2(7) of the UN Charter) could provide a framework to critically examine cyber-attacks and even declare them contrary to international law. In the Tallinn Manual 2.0, where a special group of experts proposes applying international law to cyber-attacks, it is also stated that the norm of sovereignty restriction applies to cyber-attacks [15]. However, the norm is very generally formulated, and the Tallinn Manual 2.0 offers, at best, an ambiguous stance regarding the interpretation of the norm and when and which countermeasures are permitted. The norm itself constitutes a less severe offense than an attack or armed attack. A violation of the prohibition of force justifies a stronger response than a violation of sovereignty -- and it could well be that states want to take a strong countermeasure in some situations. However, the legal problems that arise in cyberspace can only be very limitedly interpreted in terms of positive international law,\nand cyberspace continuously ‘escapes' existing forms of regulation. We will not further discuss the legal complications that cyber-attacks entail in this article, but we can at least state that a clear, elaborated, and widely supported normative framework for the majority of cyber-attacks that states face during a cyber conflict is lacking. The cyber conflict does not fit the traditional patterns of thought about peace and war and may even be considered an “other-than-war” phenomenon [13].\nTherefore, cyber-attacks are poised to occupy a distinct place within the moral hierarchy of foreign policy tools, nestled between diplomacy and kinetic warfare, similar to severe economic sanctions. Larry May [9] proposes reclassifying these cyber operations not as acts of war but as akin to embargoes, serving as political and economic levers. This reimagining suggests cyber-attacks could be a strategic alternative to conflict, potentially guiding how NATO responds to attacks on its members. The effectiveness of traditional economic sanctions is debated, especially given globalization's role in diluting their impact. Instances like the UN's sanctions against Libya and the EU's against Russia illustrate sanctions' complex consequences, including retaliation that can harm the sanctioning states themselves. Cyber-attacks offer, according to May, an additional strategy in coercive diplomacy, potentially pressuring states towards compliance without the drawbacks of conventional sanctions. They could prompt states to cease unlawful activities by threatening their digital infrastructure, such as the Stuxnet virus against Iran's nuclear program. This approach, leveraging cyber capabilities for targeted pressure while minimizing civilian distress, could serve as a peaceful yet potent means to enforce international norms and laws. However, the potential for retaliatory cyber-attacks by the targeted state may increase escalation.\nIn addition, many states invest significant amounts of money in building offensive cyber capabilities. They all want to have a high-quality arsenal capable of conducting complex espionage, sabotage, and disinformation spreading. These factors contribute to a risky cyber conflict, where attackers have the means and opportunity to attack vulnerable systems, and where these attackers rarely face repercussions. In this threatening geopolitical situation, countries will likely continue to suffer from cyber-attacks carried out by other states. Moreover, there is a chance that cyber-attacks will escalate, in the sense that both the harmfulness and frequency of cyber-attacks increase. Given the danger to the security of the digital environment, international efforts must be made to effectively de-escalate cyber-attacks: the frequency of cyber-attacks must decrease, and the cyber-attacks that society experiences must become less severe. The question is how this turnaround can be achieved, and who should take responsibility for it. In the next section, we will discuss five solution directions that support this de-escalation.\n## Solution for the De-escalation of the International Information Conflict\n### Continue Cooperation to Improve International Cyber Security\nIn addition to the national steps taken to increase resilience and cyber security, states need to continue investing in international cooperation in the field of cyber security. The emphasis of NATO's cyber policy is on strengthening the defense of NATO member\nstates: “The keynote is defense, whether an attack comes from state, criminal, or other sources,” according to a NATO spokesperson. NATO's defensive doctrine is mainly based on deterrence or passive deterrence: ‘deterrence by denial.' This means that security measures must be strengthened to the point that it becomes practically impossible, or at least very expensive, for attackers to infiltrate systems. The cooperation to further improve digital security at the EU and NATO level must be continued and intensified. Some good examples of this cooperation include the rollout of a broad network of Cyber Emergency Incident Response Teams (the CERT network) and the release of an initial standard (ETSI TS 103 645) by the European Telecommunications Standardisation Institute (ETSI) for securing Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices to support all parties involved in the development and production of IoT for consumers with guidance on securing their products.\nImplementing a policy where NATO refrains from initiating cyber-attacks first, supported by credible military deterrents, can effectively communicate its commitment to restraint and establish boundaries for acceptable cyber-attacks. This strategy would define a baseline for cyber operations that won't provoke a violent response, highlighting that only countermeasures against cyber adversaries are permissible, while attacks on civilian infrastructure are explicitly excluded [6]. However, the dynamic between attackers and defenders in cyberspace remains unresolved, with attackers often gaining the upper hand. Strengthening global cooperation through the sharing of intelligence, best practices, and joint response strategies is essential. Additionally, creating global forums for cybersecurity intelligence and coordination will facilitate timely responses to threats. Despite this, international support for multilateral cyber arms control is waning due to challenges in verification, perceived minimal consequences for violators, and the exclusivity of agreements. Any effective framework must address these issues and consider the complexity of verifying and attributing violations in cyberspace. Furthermore, developing and promoting international cybersecurity standards will help define responsible state behavior, protect civilian networks, and promote a rules-based approach to managing cyber conflict, thus preventing escalation towards armed conflict [18].\n### Make Clear International Agreements Regarding Cyber Sabotage, Disinformation, and Cyber Espionage\nThe geopolitical landscape of cyber-attacks suffers from a notable absence of specific, binding international rules tailored to the unique dynamics of cyber conflict. Consequently, states often rely on generic international legal frameworks, which are ambiguous and open to varied interpretations concerning cyber-attacks. This ambiguity tends to benefit the attackers by fostering an environment of uncertainty that they can exploit. Establishing clear and concrete rules would enable the international community to respond promptly and decisively to cyber incidents, setting clear expectations and consequences for state actions.\nProposals for international agreements on cyber conflict include a “Geneva Convention for cyber-attacks” to establish norms akin to those that govern traditional warfare. However, the feasibility of such a treaty remains in question due to significant geopolitical divisions. For instance, the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context\nof International Security (GGE) has struggled to reach consensus, with major powers diverging sharply on key issues like the right to retaliate following a cyber-attack. The debate over how international humanitarian law applies to cyber operations continues to be contentious, reflecting broader disagreements on the militarization of cyberspace. The diplomatic efforts to forge a consensus have led to a bifurcation in approaches [5]. The U.S. and its allies have pursued one track, while a coalition led by Russia and China has followed another, both proposing different norms for state behavior in cyberspace. This division underscores the challenges in achieving a unified global stance on cyber conflicts.\nBeyond formal treaties, there is potential for building confidence through voluntary agreements that enhance state cooperation and transparency. Such measures could reduce misunderstandings and prevent conflicts, involving multilateral commitments to share intelligence on cyber threats and refrain from targeting civilian infrastructure during peacetime. At the national level, countries could independently declare their responses to cyber incidents, creating predictable standards and responses. This approach includes categorizing types of cyber-attacks and the corresponding responses, which the European Union began implementing in 2019 with a framework for targeted measures against cyber threats.\nThe debate over cyber espionage and its implications for state sovereignty is particularly complex. Cyber espionage often involves tactics that could be seen as violating sovereignty if they cause harm, such as data corruption or system disruption. Meanwhile, the spread of disinformation represents another serious challenge, potentially destabilizing democratic processes and public discourse. It is inappropriate for a democratic rule of law state to further disrupt the information provision in another country. This does not mean that foreign information campaigns are inadmissible. It may be useful to give critical Russian journalism a helping hand. But spreading disinformation that weakens the legal order is, in our opinion, comparable to the use of chemical weapons: an inadmissible means for a civilized democratic state.\nIn terms of countermeasures, the need for proportionate and responsible responses is paramount. Retaliatory cyber-attacks are risky and may not effectively enhance cybersecurity or deter aggressors. Instead, a combination of diplomatic, economic, and legal measures, alongside public exposure of malicious activities, may offer a more sustainable path to maintaining international peace and security in the digital age. Thus, the international community stands at a critical juncture, needing to balance the imperatives of security and cooperation against the backdrop of rapidly evolving cyber capabilities. The establishment of robust, clear, and widely accepted norms for cyberspace is essential to manage and mitigate the risks of cyber conflict effectively.\nA fundamental choice has to be made regarding the type of countermeasures that should be taken in response to a cyber-attack. One can fight fire with fire and launch a similar cyber counterattack. We have indicated that this is irresponsible in the case of undermining a democratic rule of law. Many other cyber-attacks directly affect civilian institutions and facilities -- targets that should be spared as much as possible even in wartime. It is therefore highly questionable whether a democratic rule of law state should retaliate in kind. European States can also respond with other means, for example, by using the European sanctions package, and taking diplomatic and economic\nmeasures. Considering these alternative means is not only of moral importance -- it is questionable whether cyber counterattacks structurally increase cyber security. Every attack contributes to the proliferation of weapons, and cyber conflicts have so far never ended with a decisive counterattack. Moreover, serious reservations are expressed in the literature about the deterrence strategy [19]. If a cyber counterattack is carried out, it must happen immediately and in cooperation with allies. If threats are made without follow-up, the deterrent effect disappears.\n### Ensure Responsible Management of the Cyber Arsenal\nMalware can spread across the world in seconds: that is the price we pay for a global internet. Whoever deploys a cyber weapon can expect the used code to end up in unforeseen hands and perhaps boomerang back in one's face. This means that cyber weapons must be deployed carefully and once-used vulnerabilities must be reported promptly. Because that is the unique opportunity for de-escalation that cyber conflict offers: programmers can neutralize much malicious code. Since these updates increase the security of the entire digital domain, this aspect must be optimally utilized. It is therefore of great importance that intelligence services and defense units work cooperatively with software producers and chip manufacturers to implement security updates as effectively as possible and distribute them among users. International intelligence services and defense units must cooperate with software producers and computer chip manufacturers in implementing security updates and distributing them among users. Moreover, intelligence services and defense units must continuously ask themselves what increases cyber security more: possessing a certain cyber weapon or releasing it?\nInternational allies should also be more open with each other and jointly monitor the management of vulnerabilities. It would be a pity if allies independently collect cyber weapons and keep them strictly secret: then, vulnerabilities could remain on the shelf that the services could have reported from a strategic point of view. Ultimately, in the long term, the importance of reliable and safe digital applications weighs more heavily than the interest in occasionally breaking through that security, however much this would enable specific operations. Responsible management of the cyber arsenal also has consequences for cooperation with private parties. Many large states possess a high-quality arsenal capable of conducting complex espionage, sabotage, and disinformation spreading, and master the simpler methods of committing cyber-attacks. This development has also led to a flourishing private or malicious industry that supplies these weapons, contributes to the proliferation of weapons, and gives opponents access to offensive cyber capabilities. Not for nothing did the German government in 2017 decide to have cyber weapons developed by its own state agency [4]. Government must seriously consider which private partners should be involved in the development of offensive cyber capabilities -- and whether there is enough reason to take this development more into its own hands. Strict conditions must also apply to ensure that dangerous technology is not sold to countries that cannot trust with these weapons. An international lobby for an updated system of export licenses could help in this regard.\n### Protect the Independence of Technology Companies\nTechnology companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Apple play a crucial role in ensuring international cyber security. They can patch the holes in their software and ensure the most robust possible digital applications. This means that it is of crucial importance that these companies do not become extensions of national governments. Kaspersky Labs and Huawei Technologies are under great pressure due to their connections with China and Russia. The governments of Russia and China do not respect the fundamental rights of their citizens and regularly use their power to intervene in the business world -- so why wouldn't they use these global players as pawns of their intelligence services? How exactly the Western governments should deal with companies like Huawei and Kaspersky depends on the extent to which the Chinese and Russian governments actually control these companies. American companies sometimes work intensively with intelligence services, whether or not under duress, as in the renewed PRISM program of the National Security Agency (NSA). The international community must prevent such situations, both within the prescribed frameworks and proactively, if it wants to maintain a reliable and safe international technology market. It is therefore encouraging to see that more than 60 global companies, including Microsoft, Facebook, and Dell, are part of the Cybersecurity Tech Accord and have joined the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace. The cooperation agreement contains a set of common promises that have consequences for how these companies relate to governments. Such as the promise never to help governments launch cyber-attacks against innocent civilians and businesses, and the promise to protect their products against covert influence and sabotage. Although the impact and precise meaning of the agreement in practice remain to be seen, this cooperation could greatly reduce the ability of governments to set up espionage and sabotage operations with the help of companies.\n### Invest in a Societal Debate on Geopolitical Cyber Security\nWar, peace, and international conflict are matters that the population should be particularly involved in a democracy: major societal interests are at stake. The nature of the current information conflict complicates this discussion because so many things are opaque or secret. However, the decision to acquire certain weapons and authorize certain operations cannot only be a matter for experts and officials with special authority: the ongoing cyber conflict must be thoroughly and deeply discussed in the public debate. Each of the four solution directions mentioned above should be addressed in the Dutch and international public debate. Therefore, secrecy by intelligence services and defense cannot be taken for granted -- this secrecy must be weighed against the interest of citizens in gaining insight into the government's cyber operations and forming an opinion about them. The greater the impact of international cyber conflicts on society, the greater the importance of making a relevant public debate possible. Moreover, the involvement of citizens is urgently needed: they are frequently the victims of disinformation, cyber espionage, and cyber sabotage. In the cyber conflict, all citizens have a role to play and should be equipped to recognize disinformation and take basic security measures. Only citizens who understand how technology affects their lives and who have meaningful input in the political choices made regarding new technology are resilient against\nBytes and Battles: Pathways to De-escalation in the Cyber Conflict Arena\nundermining cyber-attacks. The government has a special responsibility to enable this citizenship: by facilitating education, prioritizing the rights of citizens, and providing as much transparency as possible about the issues it faces in a threatening geopolitical situation.\n# 4 Conclusions\nMost actions currently undertaken by influential states fall within what we have described as the cyber conflict. In peacetime, countries build up their cyber security and try to infiltrate the digital systems of other countries as secretly as possible. Russia also actively spreads disinformation. This is a strategy that other autocratic countries do not seem to apply on a large scale, at least not in relation to other countries, but is part of the desire to control, censor, and manipulate the information that reaches their population. There are also several examples of serious cyber sabotage, such as Operation Olympic Games, attributed to Israel and the United States, and the WannaCry attack, attributed to North Korea. So far, cyber-attacks have never led to a cyber-physical war; in that sense, there is no 'cyberwar'. However, the current international situation is risky and worrying, and the disruptive effects of cyber capabilities underscore the risks in the international landscape, which could lead to the escalation of cyber-attacks. We have formulated five possible solutions for the de-escalation of the international cyber conflict. Perhaps the most important is that clear international agreements are made in the field of offensive cyber capabilities. However, in the current geopolitical environment, international support for multilateral cyber arms control agreements is declining, due to issues such as doubts about verification, perceived limited consequences for violators of agreements, and a lack of inclusivity of many agreements. Any multilateral framework for cyber weapons control will have to take this trend into account, especially since the verification of any agreement and the attribution of any violation will be even more complicated in the cyber domain than regular arms control. However, cyber weapons control frameworks limit expensive and destabilizing arms races and help prevent dangerous escalation toward armed conflict.\nAcknowledgment.

In the digital era, the rise of cyber conflict blurs traditional distinctions between war and peace, presenting complex challenges. This article investigates the intricate dynamics of cyber conflict, driven by state and state-sponsored actions in cyber sabotage, espionage, and disinformation spread. It reviews how nations like the US, Russia, and China use cyber capabilities to assert dominance, counter threats, and shape global politics, impacting national security, economic stability, and democratic integrity. The analysis highlights the difficulties in attributing cyber-attacks, limitations of current legal frameworks, and risks of escalation to physical conflict. We suggest five strategic approaches to mitigate cyber conflict, including enhancing international cybersecurity collaboration, setting clear cyber norms, managing cyber arsenals responsibly, safeguarding tech company independence, and promoting public discourse on cyber issues. These strategies aim for a transparent, cooperative resolution to cyber conflicts, aligning with the nuances of digital warfare.\nKeywords: Cyber Conflict · Cyber Attacks · De-escalation\n# 1 A Looming Geopolitical Situation\nCyber capabilities have emerged as a disruptive technological force, revolutionizing traditional warfare and conflict dynamics [20]. This technological evolution has empowered state and state-sponsored actors with unprecedented tools for sabotage, espionage, and manipulation, reshaping the geopolitical landscape into a domain marked by unpredictability and menace. The United States (US), suffering from an increasing number of threats to its critical infrastructure due to cyber-attacks [16] and recognizing the potential of cyber warfare, has adopted a proactive stance as outlined in its strategy to “Achieve and Maintain Cyberspace Superiority” [17]. This approach mandates a “defend forward”, necessitating preemptive infiltration into adversaries’ systems to enable swift retaliation, thus aiming for a deterrence-based dominance in cyberspace. Before 2018, the US maintained an approach of restraint to cyber operations outside the US Government, but this changed due to mainly Russia’s cyber-enables information operations in the 2026 US Presidential election. Obama administration contemplated but ultimately decided against initiating offensive cyber operations, largely due to apprehensions about the possibility of provoking further aggressive actions from Russia. Among the more robust\n© The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024\nD. H. de la Iglesia et al. (Eds.): DiTTEt 2024, AISC 1459, pp. 295-306, 2024.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-66635-3_25\ncyber strategies under consideration were proposals to neutralize websites disseminating leaked information, to execute cyber-attacks aimed at disrupting Russian media outlets, and to impair the command and control infrastructure utilized by Russian intelligence entities. Nonetheless, the chosen course of action by the administration veered away from cyber retaliation, opting instead for a response that encompassed diplomatic, economic, and law enforcement strategies. This led to a call from certain factions within the private sector and the Department of Defense to reevaluate existing beliefs regarding escalation dynamics, advocating for a more forward-leaning strategy [6].\nThe concept of cyber superiority was already vividly illustrated by Operation Olympic Games, where the U.S. in collaboration with Israel, reportedly deployed the Stuxnet virus against Iran's nuclear program [10]. Despite this show of offensive capability, the incident underscored the vulnerability of even technologically advanced nations to retaliatory cyber-attacks, highlighting the complex, double-edged nature of cyber power. Further exemplifying the strategic shift towards cyber warfare, Russia's actions in Ukraine since 2014 have demonstrated the seamless integration of cyber operations with traditional military tactics. Russian forces not only commandeered communication infrastructures but also launched cyber-attacks against critical services, employing disinformation campaigns to undermine the state and influence global perceptions. For example, nowadays in the Ukraine war, Russia repeatedly has claimed that Ukraine is filled with “Nazis”, and persists in promoting this demonstrably false claim, both internally and externally [2]. Similarly, China's cyber activities, including economic and state espionage, have prompted international tensions, leading to agreements aimed at curbing cyber espionage -- a testament to the global recognition of the seriousness of cyber threats.\nThe digital realm has thus become a critical fifth dimension of military strategy, with nations deploying viruses, ransomware, and exploiting vulnerabilities to assert their interests [12]. All major world powers have established military cyber commands and reformed their intelligence services, and in some states, like Russia and China, there are close ties between government agencies and patriotic or even criminal hackers. States often operate from the shadows, and typically neither confirm nor deny their involvement in a cyber-attack. Instead, they provide ambiguous responses such as ‘non-denial denials' or refuse to address the allegations' [3]. This approach allows states to pursue dual objectives: they can maintain crisis stability while leaving open the possibility of their participation in the cyber-attack. By intentionally remaining under suspicion, a state can influence how rivals perceive its cyber capabilities and determination. Additionally, by not denying responsibility, a state can also affect how rivals view the capabilities of its allies, thereby bolstering the credibility of deterrence. This approach achieves these ends without the escalatory dangers associated with explicitly admitting responsibility.\nThe establishment of military cyber commands and the collaboration between governments and hacker groups underscore the strategic importance of cyberspace. In this shadowy warfare, the lines between peace and conflict blur, as states engage in continuous digital skirmishing, preparing the battlefield with espionage tools, traps, and offensive weapons, even during peacetime. This transformation into a world where cyber conflict is an “always on” phenomenon demands a reevaluation of traditional notions of warfare and security [1]. Cyber operations, from sabotage and espionage to disinformation\ncampaigns, have become integral components of national defense and offensive strategies. These operations not only pose significant challenges to societal security but also offer strategic tools to achieve political and military objectives. As the digital landscape evolves, so too will the nature of conflict and the strategies nations employ to protect their interests and assert their power on the global stage.\n## The Cyber Conflict\nThe cyber conflict lies between peace and war, which has implications for how we should think about peacetime and wartime (see Table 1). Traditionally, war and peace form a binary distinction: it is either war or peace between countries. This distinction can still be maintained, provided we distinguish peacetime from cyber peace, and understand war as cyber-physical war. In a time of cyber peace, it is not only peacetime, but there is also no cyber conflict. Countries do not engage in cyber espionage and do not use cyber means to cause damage in another country. Disinformation campaigns are also not undertaken. The focus in this situation is on strengthening cybersecurity. States can also train cyber soldiers and acquire weapons. However, the ability to build offensive cyber capabilities is limited: gaining intelligence about the cyber capabilities and systems of the opponent is of great importance for both setting up one's defense and creating offensive capacity. The goals in the cyber conflict vary: sometimes a state seeks economic advantages by spying, sometimes a state wants to prepare the military battlefield in its favor, and sometimes a state wants to pressure or manipulate the political decision-making in another state. But cyber-attacks have never escalated to the point where countries have declared war on each other. Moreover, in this cyber conflict, there is an important difference between cyber sabotage that directly causes severe damage, and cyber espionage and disinformation spreading that serve the interests of a particular state much more indirectly. The victim is not supposed to notice cyber espionage and disinformation spreading, while cyber sabotage immediately affects the physical world of people -- for example, because financial services break down or a power plant fails.\nWe therefore distinguish between cold and hot aspects of the cyber conflict. In situations of cold cyber conflict, it seems as if no conflict is taking place at all since countries use cyber espionage and the spread of disinformation. In situations of hot cyber conflict, the information struggle flares up because facilities are openly damaged and people directly experience the consequences of cyber sabotage in their own living environment. An example of such a hot cyber conflict was the Stuxnet operation, which caused serious physical damage in peacetime. The damage was so severe that there has been broad discussion about whether the attack should even be classified as an armed attack under humanitarian law [14]. The cold and hot aspects of the cyber conflict are not mutually exclusive. For example, cyber sabotage generally presupposes cyber espionage. A particular cyber conflict has more or fewer cold and hot aspects. And it's not that a hot cyber-attack is necessarily more dangerous than a cold cyber-attack -- perhaps nothing is more dangerous than corrupting a democratic rule of law state's information provision from within. But it is true that serious cyber sabotage borders on an act of war, as acts of war are characterized by very serious physical damage.\nL. Royakkers\nTable 1. The action strategies within the four phases in cyberspace.\n|  Situation | Intent  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Cyber peace (peacetime) | Peace/neutrality; Strengthening of (inter)national cybersecurity: • Establishment of (inter)national Computer Emergency Response Teams, detecting, preventing, and addressing cyber incidents and risks  |\n|  Cold Cyber Conflict (peacetime) | Strengthening national offensive cyber capacity: • The significant increase in defense spending on cyber weapons in most states Acquiring (strategic) information: • The espionage operations of the American security agency NSA (revealed by Edward Snowden) e.g., to eavesdrop on European allies Influencing public opinion or democratic processes: • Russian disinformation about MH17 • Alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections  |\n|  Warm Cyber Conflict (peacetime) | Preparing the digital battlefield: • The American strategy of ‘forward defense,’ where foreign vital structures are hacked in advance to quickly retaliate upon infiltration Exerting political pressure: • Russian cyber-attacks in 2007 on internet sites of the Estonian government, banks, media, and companies, due to a conflict over the relocation of a Russian war monument in the Estonian capital Tallinn Damaging, disrupting, or destroying (vital) systems: • The American Stuxnet attack on the Iranian nuclear program  |\n|  Cyber-Physical War (wartime) | Military victory: • In the wars in Eastern Ukraine, Russia made/makes extensive use of cyber-attacks alongside conventional weapons  |\nWe must nuance our understanding of war. In wartime, offensive cyber capabilities will likely play a significant role: more and more military equipment is becoming digitalized, and it can be very advantageous to mislead the opponent's air defense through disinformation, as happened during Operation Orchard of the Israeli Air Force on a Syrian nuclear reactor. Therefore, it makes sense to speak of cyber-physical warfare, integrating digital applications into the conventional arsenal of warfare. Russia's cyber activity in Ukraine transcends warm cyber conflict because the cyber-attacks coincided with conventional military deployment. However, it is questionable whether the cyber sabotage carried out by Russia would be sufficient to fall under the prohibition of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. The severity of the consequences is usually considered the measure to determine whether a particular cyber-attack falls under the\nprohibition of force (see [18]). In international humanitarian law, the ‘physical effects' standard is used to define what is considered ‘use of force'. This standard states that there is only force if it leads to an actual or potentially harmful physical effect on the targeted state. These physical effects include death, bodily injury, or significant damage to vital infrastructures or military installations. Technically, a sabotaging cyber-attack could lead to civilian casualties or significant infrastructural damage, for example, as a result of long-term disabling of power plants. Yet, it is challenging to find cyber-attacks that meet that standard. Sabotaging cyber-attacks generally do not result in civilian casualties -- at least not in a direct sense, but can endanger human health and well-being [16]. Most sabotaging cyber-attacks do cause serious societal damage but do not cripple vital infrastructures. For example, sabotaging cyber-attacks occasionally disrupt banking services, but the financial sector has never been completely shut down. Similarly, in 2015 in Ukraine, the power supply was shut down, but the lights came back on a few hours later. Therefore, it is questionable where the turning point lies between an attack that damages vital infrastructure and an attack that causes significant damage to vital infrastructure. Experts indicate that international law does not clearly answer this question [15]. For example, there is no consensus on whether the Stuxnet attack should be considered an armed attack. This is significant, as that attack is marked as one of the most far-reaching cyber-attacks. In addition, some authors argue that certain cyber-attacks that do not cause physical damage should still be considered armed attacks (see, e.g. [7]). In this case, we should think of cyber-attacks that can have a socially disruptive effect, such as crashing a stock market through digital manipulations. However, yet in practice, cyber conflicts have tended to be of low intensity, staying beneath the threshold that would categorize them as armed attacks [8]. Furthermore, to this day, cyber operations have no direct impact on the battlefield, but rather target broader national and civilian resilience (see, [11, 20]). Also nowadays in the Ukrainian war, Russia mounts sophisticated cyber-attacks, but it still does not happen in any fashion that is decisive to the war [2].\nIn our opinion, relaxing the ‘physical effects' standard is counterproductive and completely negates the intentions of de-escalation, as it would give countries more opportunities to respond with traditional violence to a cyber-attack under Article 51 of the UN Charter, which allows self-defense in the case of armed violence. Cyber sabotage is an infringement on the sovereignty of the state. This could also apply to cyber espionage and the spread of disinformation. The norm of sovereignty restriction (Article 2(7) of the UN Charter) could provide a framework to critically examine cyber-attacks and even declare them contrary to international law. In the Tallinn Manual 2.0, where a special group of experts proposes applying international law to cyber-attacks, it is also stated that the norm of sovereignty restriction applies to cyber-attacks [15]. However, the norm is very generally formulated, and the Tallinn Manual 2.0 offers, at best, an ambiguous stance regarding the interpretation of the norm and when and which countermeasures are permitted. The norm itself constitutes a less severe offense than an attack or armed attack. A violation of the prohibition of force justifies a stronger response than a violation of sovereignty -- and it could well be that states want to take a strong countermeasure in some situations. However, the legal problems that arise in cyberspace can only be very limitedly interpreted in terms of positive international law,\nand cyberspace continuously ‘escapes' existing forms of regulation. We will not further discuss the legal complications that cyber-attacks entail in this article, but we can at least state that a clear, elaborated, and widely supported normative framework for the majority of cyber-attacks that states face during a cyber conflict is lacking. The cyber conflict does not fit the traditional patterns of thought about peace and war and may even be considered an “other-than-war” phenomenon [13].\nTherefore, cyber-attacks are poised to occupy a distinct place within the moral hierarchy of foreign policy tools, nestled between diplomacy and kinetic warfare, similar to severe economic sanctions. Larry May [9] proposes reclassifying these cyber operations not as acts of war but as akin to embargoes, serving as political and economic levers. This reimagining suggests cyber-attacks could be a strategic alternative to conflict, potentially guiding how NATO responds to attacks on its members. The effectiveness of traditional economic sanctions is debated, especially given globalization's role in diluting their impact. Instances like the UN's sanctions against Libya and the EU's against Russia illustrate sanctions' complex consequences, including retaliation that can harm the sanctioning states themselves. Cyber-attacks offer, according to May, an additional strategy in coercive diplomacy, potentially pressuring states towards compliance without the drawbacks of conventional sanctions. They could prompt states to cease unlawful activities by threatening their digital infrastructure, such as the Stuxnet virus against Iran's nuclear program. This approach, leveraging cyber capabilities for targeted pressure while minimizing civilian distress, could serve as a peaceful yet potent means to enforce international norms and laws. However, the potential for retaliatory cyber-attacks by the targeted state may increase escalation.\nIn addition, many states invest significant amounts of money in building offensive cyber capabilities. They all want to have a high-quality arsenal capable of conducting complex espionage, sabotage, and disinformation spreading. These factors contribute to a risky cyber conflict, where attackers have the means and opportunity to attack vulnerable systems, and where these attackers rarely face repercussions. In this threatening geopolitical situation, countries will likely continue to suffer from cyber-attacks carried out by other states. Moreover, there is a chance that cyber-attacks will escalate, in the sense that both the harmfulness and frequency of cyber-attacks increase. Given the danger to the security of the digital environment, international efforts must be made to effectively de-escalate cyber-attacks: the frequency of cyber-attacks must decrease, and the cyber-attacks that society experiences must become less severe. The question is how this turnaround can be achieved, and who should take responsibility for it. In the next section, we will discuss five solution directions that support this de-escalation.\n## Solution for the De-escalation of the International Information Conflict\n### Continue Cooperation to Improve International Cyber Security\nIn addition to the national steps taken to increase resilience and cyber security, states need to continue investing in international cooperation in the field of cyber security. The emphasis of NATO's cyber policy is on strengthening the defense of NATO member\nstates: “The keynote is defense, whether an attack comes from state, criminal, or other sources,” according to a NATO spokesperson. NATO's defensive doctrine is mainly based on deterrence or passive deterrence: ‘deterrence by denial.' This means that security measures must be strengthened to the point that it becomes practically impossible, or at least very expensive, for attackers to infiltrate systems. The cooperation to further improve digital security at the EU and NATO level must be continued and intensified. Some good examples of this cooperation include the rollout of a broad network of Cyber Emergency Incident Response Teams (the CERT network) and the release of an initial standard (ETSI TS 103 645) by the European Telecommunications Standardisation Institute (ETSI) for securing Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices to support all parties involved in the development and production of IoT for consumers with guidance on securing their products.\nImplementing a policy where NATO refrains from initiating cyber-attacks first, supported by credible military deterrents, can effectively communicate its commitment to restraint and establish boundaries for acceptable cyber-attacks. This strategy would define a baseline for cyber operations that won't provoke a violent response, highlighting that only countermeasures against cyber adversaries are permissible, while attacks on civilian infrastructure are explicitly excluded [6]. However, the dynamic between attackers and defenders in cyberspace remains unresolved, with attackers often gaining the upper hand. Strengthening global cooperation through the sharing of intelligence, best practices, and joint response strategies is essential. Additionally, creating global forums for cybersecurity intelligence and coordination will facilitate timely responses to threats. Despite this, international support for multilateral cyber arms control is waning due to challenges in verification, perceived minimal consequences for violators, and the exclusivity of agreements. Any effective framework must address these issues and consider the complexity of verifying and attributing violations in cyberspace. Furthermore, developing and promoting international cybersecurity standards will help define responsible state behavior, protect civilian networks, and promote a rules-based approach to managing cyber conflict, thus preventing escalation towards armed conflict [18].\n### Make Clear International Agreements Regarding Cyber Sabotage, Disinformation, and Cyber Espionage\nThe geopolitical landscape of cyber-attacks suffers from a notable absence of specific, binding international rules tailored to the unique dynamics of cyber conflict. Consequently, states often rely on generic international legal frameworks, which are ambiguous and open to varied interpretations concerning cyber-attacks. This ambiguity tends to benefit the attackers by fostering an environment of uncertainty that they can exploit. Establishing clear and concrete rules would enable the international community to respond promptly and decisively to cyber incidents, setting clear expectations and consequences for state actions.\nProposals for international agreements on cyber conflict include a “Geneva Convention for cyber-attacks” to establish norms akin to those that govern traditional warfare. However, the feasibility of such a treaty remains in question due to significant geopolitical divisions. For instance, the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context\nof International Security (GGE) has struggled to reach consensus, with major powers diverging sharply on key issues like the right to retaliate following a cyber-attack. The debate over how international humanitarian law applies to cyber operations continues to be contentious, reflecting broader disagreements on the militarization of cyberspace. The diplomatic efforts to forge a consensus have led to a bifurcation in approaches [5]. The U.S. and its allies have pursued one track, while a coalition led by Russia and China has followed another, both proposing different norms for state behavior in cyberspace. This division underscores the challenges in achieving a unified global stance on cyber conflicts.\nBeyond formal treaties, there is potential for building confidence through voluntary agreements that enhance state cooperation and transparency. Such measures could reduce misunderstandings and prevent conflicts, involving multilateral commitments to share intelligence on cyber threats and refrain from targeting civilian infrastructure during peacetime. At the national level, countries could independently declare their responses to cyber incidents, creating predictable standards and responses. This approach includes categorizing types of cyber-attacks and the corresponding responses, which the European Union began implementing in 2019 with a framework for targeted measures against cyber threats.\nThe debate over cyber espionage and its implications for state sovereignty is particularly complex. Cyber espionage often involves tactics that could be seen as violating sovereignty if they cause harm, such as data corruption or system disruption. Meanwhile, the spread of disinformation represents another serious challenge, potentially destabilizing democratic processes and public discourse. It is inappropriate for a democratic rule of law state to further disrupt the information provision in another country. This does not mean that foreign information campaigns are inadmissible. It may be useful to give critical Russian journalism a helping hand. But spreading disinformation that weakens the legal order is, in our opinion, comparable to the use of chemical weapons: an inadmissible means for a civilized democratic state.\nIn terms of countermeasures, the need for proportionate and responsible responses is paramount. Retaliatory cyber-attacks are risky and may not effectively enhance cybersecurity or deter aggressors. Instead, a combination of diplomatic, economic, and legal measures, alongside public exposure of malicious activities, may offer a more sustainable path to maintaining international peace and security in the digital age. Thus, the international community stands at a critical juncture, needing to balance the imperatives of security and cooperation against the backdrop of rapidly evolving cyber capabilities. The establishment of robust, clear, and widely accepted norms for cyberspace is essential to manage and mitigate the risks of cyber conflict effectively.\nA fundamental choice has to be made regarding the type of countermeasures that should be taken in response to a cyber-attack. One can fight fire with fire and launch a similar cyber counterattack. We have indicated that this is irresponsible in the case of undermining a democratic rule of law. Many other cyber-attacks directly affect civilian institutions and facilities -- targets that should be spared as much as possible even in wartime. It is therefore highly questionable whether a democratic rule of law state should retaliate in kind. European States can also respond with other means, for example, by using the European sanctions package, and taking diplomatic and economic\nmeasures. Considering these alternative means is not only of moral importance -- it is questionable whether cyber counterattacks structurally increase cyber security. Every attack contributes to the proliferation of weapons, and cyber conflicts have so far never ended with a decisive counterattack. Moreover, serious reservations are expressed in the literature about the deterrence strategy [19]. If a cyber counterattack is carried out, it must happen immediately and in cooperation with allies. If threats are made without follow-up, the deterrent effect disappears.\n### Ensure Responsible Management of the Cyber Arsenal\nMalware can spread across the world in seconds: that is the price we pay for a global internet. Whoever deploys a cyber weapon can expect the used code to end up in unforeseen hands and perhaps boomerang back in one's face. This means that cyber weapons must be deployed carefully and once-used vulnerabilities must be reported promptly. Because that is the unique opportunity for de-escalation that cyber conflict offers: programmers can neutralize much malicious code. Since these updates increase the security of the entire digital domain, this aspect must be optimally utilized. It is therefore of great importance that intelligence services and defense units work cooperatively with software producers and chip manufacturers to implement security updates as effectively as possible and distribute them among users. International intelligence services and defense units must cooperate with software producers and computer chip manufacturers in implementing security updates and distributing them among users. Moreover, intelligence services and defense units must continuously ask themselves what increases cyber security more: possessing a certain cyber weapon or releasing it?\nInternational allies should also be more open with each other and jointly monitor the management of vulnerabilities. It would be a pity if allies independently collect cyber weapons and keep them strictly secret: then, vulnerabilities could remain on the shelf that the services could have reported from a strategic point of view. Ultimately, in the long term, the importance of reliable and safe digital applications weighs more heavily than the interest in occasionally breaking through that security, however much this would enable specific operations. Responsible management of the cyber arsenal also has consequences for cooperation with private parties. Many large states possess a high-quality arsenal capable of conducting complex espionage, sabotage, and disinformation spreading, and master the simpler methods of committing cyber-attacks. This development has also led to a flourishing private or malicious industry that supplies these weapons, contributes to the proliferation of weapons, and gives opponents access to offensive cyber capabilities. Not for nothing did the German government in 2017 decide to have cyber weapons developed by its own state agency [4]. Government must seriously consider which private partners should be involved in the development of offensive cyber capabilities -- and whether there is enough reason to take this development more into its own hands. Strict conditions must also apply to ensure that dangerous technology is not sold to countries that cannot trust with these weapons. An international lobby for an updated system of export licenses could help in this regard.\n### Protect the Independence of Technology Companies\nTechnology companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Apple play a crucial role in ensuring international cyber security. They can patch the holes in their software and ensure the most robust possible digital applications. This means that it is of crucial importance that these companies do not become extensions of national governments. Kaspersky Labs and Huawei Technologies are under great pressure due to their connections with China and Russia. The governments of Russia and China do not respect the fundamental rights of their citizens and regularly use their power to intervene in the business world -- so why wouldn't they use these global players as pawns of their intelligence services? How exactly the Western governments should deal with companies like Huawei and Kaspersky depends on the extent to which the Chinese and Russian governments actually control these companies. American companies sometimes work intensively with intelligence services, whether or not under duress, as in the renewed PRISM program of the National Security Agency (NSA). The international community must prevent such situations, both within the prescribed frameworks and proactively, if it wants to maintain a reliable and safe international technology market. It is therefore encouraging to see that more than 60 global companies, including Microsoft, Facebook, and Dell, are part of the Cybersecurity Tech Accord and have joined the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace. The cooperation agreement contains a set of common promises that have consequences for how these companies relate to governments. Such as the promise never to help governments launch cyber-attacks against innocent civilians and businesses, and the promise to protect their products against covert influence and sabotage. Although the impact and precise meaning of the agreement in practice remain to be seen, this cooperation could greatly reduce the ability of governments to set up espionage and sabotage operations with the help of companies.\n### Invest in a Societal Debate on Geopolitical Cyber Security\nWar, peace, and international conflict are matters that the population should be particularly involved in a democracy: major societal interests are at stake. The nature of the current information conflict complicates this discussion because so many things are opaque or secret. However, the decision to acquire certain weapons and authorize certain operations cannot only be a matter for experts and officials with special authority: the ongoing cyber conflict must be thoroughly and deeply discussed in the public debate. Each of the four solution directions mentioned above should be addressed in the Dutch and international public debate. Therefore, secrecy by intelligence services and defense cannot be taken for granted -- this secrecy must be weighed against the interest of citizens in gaining insight into the government's cyber operations and forming an opinion about them. The greater the impact of international cyber conflicts on society, the greater the importance of making a relevant public debate possible. Moreover, the involvement of citizens is urgently needed: they are frequently the victims of disinformation, cyber espionage, and cyber sabotage. In the cyber conflict, all citizens have a role to play and should be equipped to recognize disinformation and take basic security measures. Only citizens who understand how technology affects their lives and who have meaningful input in the political choices made regarding new technology are resilient against\nBytes and Battles: Pathways to De-escalation in the Cyber Conflict Arena\nundermining cyber-attacks. The government has a special responsibility to enable this citizenship: by facilitating education, prioritizing the rights of citizens, and providing as much transparency as possible about the issues it faces in a threatening geopolitical situation.\n# 4 Conclusions\nMost actions currently undertaken by influential states fall within what we have described as the cyber conflict. In peacetime, countries build up their cyber security and try to infiltrate the digital systems of other countries as secretly as possible. Russia also actively spreads disinformation. This is a strategy that other autocratic countries do not seem to apply on a large scale, at least not in relation to other countries, but is part of the desire to control, censor, and manipulate the information that reaches their population. There are also several examples of serious cyber sabotage, such as Operation Olympic Games, attributed to Israel and the United States, and the WannaCry attack, attributed to North Korea. So far, cyber-attacks have never led to a cyber-physical war; in that sense, there is no 'cyberwar'. However, the current international situation is risky and worrying, and the disruptive effects of cyber capabilities underscore the risks in the international landscape, which could lead to the escalation of cyber-attacks. We have formulated five possible solutions for the de-escalation of the international cyber conflict. Perhaps the most important is that clear international agreements are made in the field of offensive cyber capabilities. However, in the current geopolitical environment, international support for multilateral cyber arms control agreements is declining, due to issues such as doubts about verification, perceived limited consequences for violators of agreements, and a lack of inclusivity of many agreements. Any multilateral framework for cyber weapons control will have to take this trend into account, especially since the verification of any agreement and the attribution of any violation will be even more complicated in the cyber domain than regular arms control. However, cyber weapons control frameworks limit expensive and destabilizing arms races and help prevent dangerous escalation toward armed conflict.\nAcknowledgment.

In the digital era, the rise of cyber conflict blurs traditional distinctions between war and peace, presenting complex challenges. This article investigates the intricate dynamics of cyber conflict, driven by state and state-sponsored actions in cyber sabotage, espionage, and disinformation spread. It reviews how nations like the US, Russia, and China use cyber capabilities to assert dominance, counter threats, and shape global politics, impacting national security, economic stability, and democratic integrity. The analysis highlights the difficulties in attributing cyber-attacks, limitations of current legal frameworks, and risks of escalation to physical conflict. We suggest five strategic approaches to mitigate cyber conflict, including enhancing international cybersecurity collaboration, setting clear cyber norms, managing cyber arsenals responsibly, safeguarding tech company independence, and promoting public discourse on cyber issues. These strategies aim for a transparent, cooperative resolution to cyber conflicts, aligning with the nuances of digital warfare.\nKeywords: Cyber Conflict · Cyber Attacks · De-escalation\n# 1 A Looming Geopolitical Situation\nCyber capabilities have emerged as a disruptive technological force, revolutionizing traditional warfare and conflict dynamics . This technological evolution has empowered state and state-sponsored actors with unprecedented tools for sabotage, espionage, and manipulation, reshaping the geopolitical landscape into a domain marked by unpredictability and menace. The United States (US), suffering from an increasing number of threats to its critical infrastructure due to cyber-attacks  and recognizing the potential of cyber warfare, has adopted a proactive stance as outlined in its strategy to “Achieve and Maintain Cyberspace Superiority” . This approach mandates a “defend forward”, necessitating preemptive infiltration into adversaries’ systems to enable swift retaliation, thus aiming for a deterrence-based dominance in cyberspace. Before 2018, the US maintained an approach of restraint to cyber operations outside the US Government, but this changed due to mainly Russia’s cyber-enables information operations in the 2026 US Presidential election. Obama administration contemplated but ultimately decided against initiating offensive cyber operations, largely due to apprehensions about the possibility of provoking further aggressive actions from Russia. Among the more robust\n© The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024\nD. H. de la Iglesia et al. (Eds.): DiTTEt 2024, AISC 1459, pp. 295-306, 2024.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-66635-3_25\ncyber strategies under consideration were proposals to neutralize websites disseminating leaked information, to execute cyber-attacks aimed at disrupting Russian media outlets, and to impair the command and control infrastructure utilized by Russian intelligence entities. Nonetheless, the chosen course of action by the administration veered away from cyber retaliation, opting instead for a response that encompassed diplomatic, economic, and law enforcement strategies. This led to a call from certain factions within the private sector and the Department of Defense to reevaluate existing beliefs regarding escalation dynamics, advocating for a more forward-leaning strategy .\nThe concept of cyber superiority was already vividly illustrated by Operation Olympic Games, where the U.S. in collaboration with Israel, reportedly deployed the Stuxnet virus against Iran's nuclear program . Despite this show of offensive capability, the incident underscored the vulnerability of even technologically advanced nations to retaliatory cyber-attacks, highlighting the complex, double-edged nature of cyber power. Further exemplifying the strategic shift towards cyber warfare, Russia's actions in Ukraine since 2014 have demonstrated the seamless integration of cyber operations with traditional military tactics. Russian forces not only commandeered communication infrastructures but also launched cyber-attacks against critical services, employing disinformation campaigns to undermine the state and influence global perceptions. For example, nowadays in the Ukraine war, Russia repeatedly has claimed that Ukraine is filled with “Nazis”, and persists in promoting this demonstrably false claim, both internally and externally . Similarly, China's cyber activities, including economic and state espionage, have prompted international tensions, leading to agreements aimed at curbing cyber espionage -- a testament to the global recognition of the seriousness of cyber threats.\nThe digital realm has thus become a critical fifth dimension of military strategy, with nations deploying viruses, ransomware, and exploiting vulnerabilities to assert their interests . All major world powers have established military cyber commands and reformed their intelligence services, and in some states, like Russia and China, there are close ties between government agencies and patriotic or even criminal hackers. States often operate from the shadows, and typically neither confirm nor deny their involvement in a cyber-attack. Instead, they provide ambiguous responses such as ‘non-denial denials' or refuse to address the allegations' . This approach allows states to pursue dual objectives: they can maintain crisis stability while leaving open the possibility of their participation in the cyber-attack. By intentionally remaining under suspicion, a state can influence how rivals perceive its cyber capabilities and determination. Additionally, by not denying responsibility, a state can also affect how rivals view the capabilities of its allies, thereby bolstering the credibility of deterrence. This approach achieves these ends without the escalatory dangers associated with explicitly admitting responsibility.\nThe establishment of military cyber commands and the collaboration between governments and hacker groups underscore the strategic importance of cyberspace. In this shadowy warfare, the lines between peace and conflict blur, as states engage in continuous digital skirmishing, preparing the battlefield with espionage tools, traps, and offensive weapons, even during peacetime. This transformation into a world where cyber conflict is an “always on” phenomenon demands a reevaluation of traditional notions of warfare and security . Cyber operations, from sabotage and espionage to disinformation\ncampaigns, have become integral components of national defense and offensive strategies. These operations not only pose significant challenges to societal security but also offer strategic tools to achieve political and military objectives. As the digital landscape evolves, so too will the nature of conflict and the strategies nations employ to protect their interests and assert their power on the global stage.\n## The Cyber Conflict\nThe cyber conflict lies between peace and war, which has implications for how we should think about peacetime and wartime (see Table 1). Traditionally, war and peace form a binary distinction: it is either war or peace between countries. This distinction can still be maintained, provided we distinguish peacetime from cyber peace, and understand war as cyber-physical war. In a time of cyber peace, it is not only peacetime, but there is also no cyber conflict. Countries do not engage in cyber espionage and do not use cyber means to cause damage in another country. Disinformation campaigns are also not undertaken. The focus in this situation is on strengthening cybersecurity. States can also train cyber soldiers and acquire weapons. However, the ability to build offensive cyber capabilities is limited: gaining intelligence about the cyber capabilities and systems of the opponent is of great importance for both setting up one's defense and creating offensive capacity. The goals in the cyber conflict vary: sometimes a state seeks economic advantages by spying, sometimes a state wants to prepare the military battlefield in its favor, and sometimes a state wants to pressure or manipulate the political decision-making in another state. But cyber-attacks have never escalated to the point where countries have declared war on each other. Moreover, in this cyber conflict, there is an important difference between cyber sabotage that directly causes severe damage, and cyber espionage and disinformation spreading that serve the interests of a particular state much more indirectly. The victim is not supposed to notice cyber espionage and disinformation spreading, while cyber sabotage immediately affects the physical world of people -- for example, because financial services break down or a power plant fails.\nWe therefore distinguish between cold and hot aspects of the cyber conflict. In situations of cold cyber conflict, it seems as if no conflict is taking place at all since countries use cyber espionage and the spread of disinformation. In situations of hot cyber conflict, the information struggle flares up because facilities are openly damaged and people directly experience the consequences of cyber sabotage in their own living environment. An example of such a hot cyber conflict was the Stuxnet operation, which caused serious physical damage in peacetime. The damage was so severe that there has been broad discussion about whether the attack should even be classified as an armed attack under humanitarian law . The cold and hot aspects of the cyber conflict are not mutually exclusive. For example, cyber sabotage generally presupposes cyber espionage. A particular cyber conflict has more or fewer cold and hot aspects. And it's not that a hot cyber-attack is necessarily more dangerous than a cold cyber-attack -- perhaps nothing is more dangerous than corrupting a democratic rule of law state's information provision from within. But it is true that serious cyber sabotage borders on an act of war, as acts of war are characterized by very serious physical damage.\nL. Royakkers\nTable 1. The action strategies within the four phases in cyberspace.\n|  Situation | Intent  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Cyber peace (peacetime) | Peace/neutrality; Strengthening of (inter)national cybersecurity: • Establishment of (inter)national Computer Emergency Response Teams, detecting, preventing, and addressing cyber incidents and risks  |\n|  Cold Cyber Conflict (peacetime) | Strengthening national offensive cyber capacity: • The significant increase in defense spending on cyber weapons in most states Acquiring (strategic) information: • The espionage operations of the American security agency NSA (revealed by Edward Snowden) e.g., to eavesdrop on European allies Influencing public opinion or democratic processes: • Russian disinformation about MH17 • Alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections  |\n|  Warm Cyber Conflict (peacetime) | Preparing the digital battlefield: • The American strategy of ‘forward defense,’ where foreign vital structures are hacked in advance to quickly retaliate upon infiltration Exerting political pressure: • Russian cyber-attacks in 2007 on internet sites of the Estonian government, banks, media, and companies, due to a conflict over the relocation of a Russian war monument in the Estonian capital Tallinn Damaging, disrupting, or destroying (vital) systems: • The American Stuxnet attack on the Iranian nuclear program  |\n|  Cyber-Physical War (wartime) | Military victory: • In the wars in Eastern Ukraine, Russia made/makes extensive use of cyber-attacks alongside conventional weapons  |\nWe must nuance our understanding of war. In wartime, offensive cyber capabilities will likely play a significant role: more and more military equipment is becoming digitalized, and it can be very advantageous to mislead the opponent's air defense through disinformation, as happened during Operation Orchard of the Israeli Air Force on a Syrian nuclear reactor. Therefore, it makes sense to speak of cyber-physical warfare, integrating digital applications into the conventional arsenal of warfare. Russia's cyber activity in Ukraine transcends warm cyber conflict because the cyber-attacks coincided with conventional military deployment. However, it is questionable whether the cyber sabotage carried out by Russia would be sufficient to fall under the prohibition of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. The severity of the consequences is usually considered the measure to determine whether a particular cyber-attack falls under the\nprohibition of force (see ). In international humanitarian law, the ‘physical effects' standard is used to define what is considered ‘use of force'. This standard states that there is only force if it leads to an actual or potentially harmful physical effect on the targeted state. These physical effects include death, bodily injury, or significant damage to vital infrastructures or military installations. Technically, a sabotaging cyber-attack could lead to civilian casualties or significant infrastructural damage, for example, as a result of long-term disabling of power plants. Yet, it is challenging to find cyber-attacks that meet that standard. Sabotaging cyber-attacks generally do not result in civilian casualties -- at least not in a direct sense, but can endanger human health and well-being . Most sabotaging cyber-attacks do cause serious societal damage but do not cripple vital infrastructures. For example, sabotaging cyber-attacks occasionally disrupt banking services, but the financial sector has never been completely shut down. Similarly, in 2015 in Ukraine, the power supply was shut down, but the lights came back on a few hours later. Therefore, it is questionable where the turning point lies between an attack that damages vital infrastructure and an attack that causes significant damage to vital infrastructure. Experts indicate that international law does not clearly answer this question . For example, there is no consensus on whether the Stuxnet attack should be considered an armed attack. This is significant, as that attack is marked as one of the most far-reaching cyber-attacks. In addition, some authors argue that certain cyber-attacks that do not cause physical damage should still be considered armed attacks (see, e.g. ). In this case, we should think of cyber-attacks that can have a socially disruptive effect, such as crashing a stock market through digital manipulations. However, yet in practice, cyber conflicts have tended to be of low intensity, staying beneath the threshold that would categorize them as armed attacks . Furthermore, to this day, cyber operations have no direct impact on the battlefield, but rather target broader national and civilian resilience (see, ). Also nowadays in the Ukrainian war, Russia mounts sophisticated cyber-attacks, but it still does not happen in any fashion that is decisive to the war .\nIn our opinion, relaxing the ‘physical effects' standard is counterproductive and completely negates the intentions of de-escalation, as it would give countries more opportunities to respond with traditional violence to a cyber-attack under Article 51 of the UN Charter, which allows self-defense in the case of armed violence. Cyber sabotage is an infringement on the sovereignty of the state. This could also apply to cyber espionage and the spread of disinformation. The norm of sovereignty restriction (Article 2(7) of the UN Charter) could provide a framework to critically examine cyber-attacks and even declare them contrary to international law. In the Tallinn Manual 2.0, where a special group of experts proposes applying international law to cyber-attacks, it is also stated that the norm of sovereignty restriction applies to cyber-attacks . However, the norm is very generally formulated, and the Tallinn Manual 2.0 offers, at best, an ambiguous stance regarding the interpretation of the norm and when and which countermeasures are permitted. The norm itself constitutes a less severe offense than an attack or armed attack. A violation of the prohibition of force justifies a stronger response than a violation of sovereignty -- and it could well be that states want to take a strong countermeasure in some situations. However, the legal problems that arise in cyberspace can only be very limitedly interpreted in terms of positive international law,\nand cyberspace continuously ‘escapes' existing forms of regulation. We will not further discuss the legal complications that cyber-attacks entail in this article, but we can at least state that a clear, elaborated, and widely supported normative framework for the majority of cyber-attacks that states face during a cyber conflict is lacking. The cyber conflict does not fit the traditional patterns of thought about peace and war and may even be considered an “other-than-war” phenomenon .\nTherefore, cyber-attacks are poised to occupy a distinct place within the moral hierarchy of foreign policy tools, nestled between diplomacy and kinetic warfare, similar to severe economic sanctions. Larry May  proposes reclassifying these cyber operations not as acts of war but as akin to embargoes, serving as political and economic levers. This reimagining suggests cyber-attacks could be a strategic alternative to conflict, potentially guiding how NATO responds to attacks on its members. The effectiveness of traditional economic sanctions is debated, especially given globalization's role in diluting their impact. Instances like the UN's sanctions against Libya and the EU's against Russia illustrate sanctions' complex consequences, including retaliation that can harm the sanctioning states themselves. Cyber-attacks offer, according to May, an additional strategy in coercive diplomacy, potentially pressuring states towards compliance without the drawbacks of conventional sanctions. They could prompt states to cease unlawful activities by threatening their digital infrastructure, such as the Stuxnet virus against Iran's nuclear program. This approach, leveraging cyber capabilities for targeted pressure while minimizing civilian distress, could serve as a peaceful yet potent means to enforce international norms and laws. However, the potential for retaliatory cyber-attacks by the targeted state may increase escalation.\nIn addition, many states invest significant amounts of money in building offensive cyber capabilities. They all want to have a high-quality arsenal capable of conducting complex espionage, sabotage, and disinformation spreading. These factors contribute to a risky cyber conflict, where attackers have the means and opportunity to attack vulnerable systems, and where these attackers rarely face repercussions. In this threatening geopolitical situation, countries will likely continue to suffer from cyber-attacks carried out by other states. Moreover, there is a chance that cyber-attacks will escalate, in the sense that both the harmfulness and frequency of cyber-attacks increase. Given the danger to the security of the digital environment, international efforts must be made to effectively de-escalate cyber-attacks: the frequency of cyber-attacks must decrease, and the cyber-attacks that society experiences must become less severe. The question is how this turnaround can be achieved, and who should take responsibility for it. In the next section, we will discuss five solution directions that support this de-escalation.\n## Solution for the De-escalation of the International Information Conflict\n### Continue Cooperation to Improve International Cyber Security\nIn addition to the national steps taken to increase resilience and cyber security, states need to continue investing in international cooperation in the field of cyber security. The emphasis of NATO's cyber policy is on strengthening the defense of NATO member\nstates: “The keynote is defense, whether an attack comes from state, criminal, or other sources,” according to a NATO spokesperson. NATO's defensive doctrine is mainly based on deterrence or passive deterrence: ‘deterrence by denial.' This means that security measures must be strengthened to the point that it becomes practically impossible, or at least very expensive, for attackers to infiltrate systems. The cooperation to further improve digital security at the EU and NATO level must be continued and intensified. Some good examples of this cooperation include the rollout of a broad network of Cyber Emergency Incident Response Teams (the CERT network) and the release of an initial standard (ETSI TS 103 645) by the European Telecommunications Standardisation Institute (ETSI) for securing Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices to support all parties involved in the development and production of IoT for consumers with guidance on securing their products.\nImplementing a policy where NATO refrains from initiating cyber-attacks first, supported by credible military deterrents, can effectively communicate its commitment to restraint and establish boundaries for acceptable cyber-attacks. This strategy would define a baseline for cyber operations that won't provoke a violent response, highlighting that only countermeasures against cyber adversaries are permissible, while attacks on civilian infrastructure are explicitly excluded . However, the dynamic between attackers and defenders in cyberspace remains unresolved, with attackers often gaining the upper hand. Strengthening global cooperation through the sharing of intelligence, best practices, and joint response strategies is essential. Additionally, creating global forums for cybersecurity intelligence and coordination will facilitate timely responses to threats. Despite this, international support for multilateral cyber arms control is waning due to challenges in verification, perceived minimal consequences for violators, and the exclusivity of agreements. Any effective framework must address these issues and consider the complexity of verifying and attributing violations in cyberspace. Furthermore, developing and promoting international cybersecurity standards will help define responsible state behavior, protect civilian networks, and promote a rules-based approach to managing cyber conflict, thus preventing escalation towards armed conflict .\n### Make Clear International Agreements Regarding Cyber Sabotage, Disinformation, and Cyber Espionage\nThe geopolitical landscape of cyber-attacks suffers from a notable absence of specific, binding international rules tailored to the unique dynamics of cyber conflict. Consequently, states often rely on generic international legal frameworks, which are ambiguous and open to varied interpretations concerning cyber-attacks. This ambiguity tends to benefit the attackers by fostering an environment of uncertainty that they can exploit. Establishing clear and concrete rules would enable the international community to respond promptly and decisively to cyber incidents, setting clear expectations and consequences for state actions.\nProposals for international agreements on cyber conflict include a “Geneva Convention for cyber-attacks” to establish norms akin to those that govern traditional warfare. However, the feasibility of such a treaty remains in question due to significant geopolitical divisions. For instance, the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context\nof International Security (GGE) has struggled to reach consensus, with major powers diverging sharply on key issues like the right to retaliate following a cyber-attack. The debate over how international humanitarian law applies to cyber operations continues to be contentious, reflecting broader disagreements on the militarization of cyberspace. The diplomatic efforts to forge a consensus have led to a bifurcation in approaches . The U.S. and its allies have pursued one track, while a coalition led by Russia and China has followed another, both proposing different norms for state behavior in cyberspace. This division underscores the challenges in achieving a unified global stance on cyber conflicts.\nBeyond formal treaties, there is potential for building confidence through voluntary agreements that enhance state cooperation and transparency. Such measures could reduce misunderstandings and prevent conflicts, involving multilateral commitments to share intelligence on cyber threats and refrain from targeting civilian infrastructure during peacetime. At the national level, countries could independently declare their responses to cyber incidents, creating predictable standards and responses. This approach includes categorizing types of cyber-attacks and the corresponding responses, which the European Union began implementing in 2019 with a framework for targeted measures against cyber threats.\nThe debate over cyber espionage and its implications for state sovereignty is particularly complex. Cyber espionage often involves tactics that could be seen as violating sovereignty if they cause harm, such as data corruption or system disruption. Meanwhile, the spread of disinformation represents another serious challenge, potentially destabilizing democratic processes and public discourse. It is inappropriate for a democratic rule of law state to further disrupt the information provision in another country. This does not mean that foreign information campaigns are inadmissible. It may be useful to give critical Russian journalism a helping hand. But spreading disinformation that weakens the legal order is, in our opinion, comparable to the use of chemical weapons: an inadmissible means for a civilized democratic state.\nIn terms of countermeasures, the need for proportionate and responsible responses is paramount. Retaliatory cyber-attacks are risky and may not effectively enhance cybersecurity or deter aggressors. Instead, a combination of diplomatic, economic, and legal measures, alongside public exposure of malicious activities, may offer a more sustainable path to maintaining international peace and security in the digital age. Thus, the international community stands at a critical juncture, needing to balance the imperatives of security and cooperation against the backdrop of rapidly evolving cyber capabilities. The establishment of robust, clear, and widely accepted norms for cyberspace is essential to manage and mitigate the risks of cyber conflict effectively.\nA fundamental choice has to be made regarding the type of countermeasures that should be taken in response to a cyber-attack. One can fight fire with fire and launch a similar cyber counterattack. We have indicated that this is irresponsible in the case of undermining a democratic rule of law. Many other cyber-attacks directly affect civilian institutions and facilities -- targets that should be spared as much as possible even in wartime. It is therefore highly questionable whether a democratic rule of law state should retaliate in kind. European States can also respond with other means, for example, by using the European sanctions package, and taking diplomatic and economic\nmeasures. Considering these alternative means is not only of moral importance -- it is questionable whether cyber counterattacks structurally increase cyber security. Every attack contributes to the proliferation of weapons, and cyber conflicts have so far never ended with a decisive counterattack. Moreover, serious reservations are expressed in the literature about the deterrence strategy . If a cyber counterattack is carried out, it must happen immediately and in cooperation with allies. If threats are made without follow-up, the deterrent effect disappears.\n### Ensure Responsible Management of the Cyber Arsenal\nMalware can spread across the world in seconds: that is the price we pay for a global internet. Whoever deploys a cyber weapon can expect the used code to end up in unforeseen hands and perhaps boomerang back in one's face. This means that cyber weapons must be deployed carefully and once-used vulnerabilities must be reported promptly. Because that is the unique opportunity for de-escalation that cyber conflict offers: programmers can neutralize much malicious code. Since these updates increase the security of the entire digital domain, this aspect must be optimally utilized. It is therefore of great importance that intelligence services and defense units work cooperatively with software producers and chip manufacturers to implement security updates as effectively as possible and distribute them among users. International intelligence services and defense units must cooperate with software producers and computer chip manufacturers in implementing security updates and distributing them among users. Moreover, intelligence services and defense units must continuously ask themselves what increases cyber security more: possessing a certain cyber weapon or releasing it?\nInternational allies should also be more open with each other and jointly monitor the management of vulnerabilities. It would be a pity if allies independently collect cyber weapons and keep them strictly secret: then, vulnerabilities could remain on the shelf that the services could have reported from a strategic point of view. Ultimately, in the long term, the importance of reliable and safe digital applications weighs more heavily than the interest in occasionally breaking through that security, however much this would enable specific operations. Responsible management of the cyber arsenal also has consequences for cooperation with private parties. Many large states possess a high-quality arsenal capable of conducting complex espionage, sabotage, and disinformation spreading, and master the simpler methods of committing cyber-attacks. This development has also led to a flourishing private or malicious industry that supplies these weapons, contributes to the proliferation of weapons, and gives opponents access to offensive cyber capabilities. Not for nothing did the German government in 2017 decide to have cyber weapons developed by its own state agency . Government must seriously consider which private partners should be involved in the development of offensive cyber capabilities -- and whether there is enough reason to take this development more into its own hands. Strict conditions must also apply to ensure that dangerous technology is not sold to countries that cannot trust with these weapons. An international lobby for an updated system of export licenses could help in this regard.\n### Protect the Independence of Technology Companies\nTechnology companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Apple play a crucial role in ensuring international cyber security. They can patch the holes in their software and ensure the most robust possible digital applications. This means that it is of crucial importance that these companies do not become extensions of national governments. Kaspersky Labs and Huawei Technologies are under great pressure due to their connections with China and Russia. The governments of Russia and China do not respect the fundamental rights of their citizens and regularly use their power to intervene in the business world -- so why wouldn't they use these global players as pawns of their intelligence services? How exactly the Western governments should deal with companies like Huawei and Kaspersky depends on the extent to which the Chinese and Russian governments actually control these companies. American companies sometimes work intensively with intelligence services, whether or not under duress, as in the renewed PRISM program of the National Security Agency (NSA). The international community must prevent such situations, both within the prescribed frameworks and proactively, if it wants to maintain a reliable and safe international technology market. It is therefore encouraging to see that more than 60 global companies, including Microsoft, Facebook, and Dell, are part of the Cybersecurity Tech Accord and have joined the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace. The cooperation agreement contains a set of common promises that have consequences for how these companies relate to governments. Such as the promise never to help governments launch cyber-attacks against innocent civilians and businesses, and the promise to protect their products against covert influence and sabotage. Although the impact and precise meaning of the agreement in practice remain to be seen, this cooperation could greatly reduce the ability of governments to set up espionage and sabotage operations with the help of companies.\n### Invest in a Societal Debate on Geopolitical Cyber Security\nWar, peace, and international conflict are matters that the population should be particularly involved in a democracy: major societal interests are at stake. The nature of the current information conflict complicates this discussion because so many things are opaque or secret. However, the decision to acquire certain weapons and authorize certain operations cannot only be a matter for experts and officials with special authority: the ongoing cyber conflict must be thoroughly and deeply discussed in the public debate. Each of the four solution directions mentioned above should be addressed in the Dutch and international public debate. Therefore, secrecy by intelligence services and defense cannot be taken for granted -- this secrecy must be weighed against the interest of citizens in gaining insight into the government's cyber operations and forming an opinion about them. The greater the impact of international cyber conflicts on society, the greater the importance of making a relevant public debate possible. Moreover, the involvement of citizens is urgently needed: they are frequently the victims of disinformation, cyber espionage, and cyber sabotage. In the cyber conflict, all citizens have a role to play and should be equipped to recognize disinformation and take basic security measures. Only citizens who understand how technology affects their lives and who have meaningful input in the political choices made regarding new technology are resilient against\nBytes and Battles: Pathways to De-escalation in the Cyber Conflict Arena\nundermining cyber-attacks. The government has a special responsibility to enable this citizenship: by facilitating education, prioritizing the rights of citizens, and providing as much transparency as possible about the issues it faces in a threatening geopolitical situation.\n# 4 Conclusions\nMost actions currently undertaken by influential states fall within what we have described as the cyber conflict. In peacetime, countries build up their cyber security and try to infiltrate the digital systems of other countries as secretly as possible. Russia also actively spreads disinformation. This is a strategy that other autocratic countries do not seem to apply on a large scale, at least not in relation to other countries, but is part of the desire to control, censor, and manipulate the information that reaches their population. There are also several examples of serious cyber sabotage, such as Operation Olympic Games, attributed to Israel and the United States, and the WannaCry attack, attributed to North Korea. So far, cyber-attacks have never led to a cyber-physical war; in that sense, there is no 'cyberwar'. However, the current international situation is risky and worrying, and the disruptive effects of cyber capabilities underscore the risks in the international landscape, which could lead to the escalation of cyber-attacks. We have formulated five possible solutions for the de-escalation of the international cyber conflict. Perhaps the most important is that clear international agreements are made in the field of offensive cyber capabilities. However, in the current geopolitical environment, international support for multilateral cyber arms control agreements is declining, due to issues such as doubts about verification, perceived limited consequences for violators of agreements, and a lack of inclusivity of many agreements. Any multilateral framework for cyber weapons control will have to take this trend into account, especially since the verification of any agreement and the attribution of any violation will be even more complicated in the cyber domain than regular arms control. However, cyber weapons control frameworks limit expensive and destabilizing arms races and help prevent dangerous escalation toward armed conflict.\nAcknowledgment.

In the digital era, the rise of cyber conflict blurs traditional distinctions between war and peace, presenting complex challenges. This article investigates the intricate dynamics of cyber conflict, driven by state and state-sponsored actions in cyber sabotage, espionage, and disinformation spread. It reviews how nations like the US, Russia, and China use cyber capabilities to assert dominance, counter threats, and shape global politics, impacting national security, economic stability, and democratic integrity. The analysis highlights the difficulties in attributing cyber-attacks, limitations of current legal frameworks, and risks of escalation to physical conflict. We suggest five strategic approaches to mitigate cyber conflict, including enhancing international cybersecurity collaboration, setting clear cyber norms, managing cyber arsenals responsibly, safeguarding tech company independence, and promoting public discourse on cyber issues. These strategies aim for a transparent, cooperative resolution to cyber conflicts, aligning with the nuances of digital warfare.\nKeywords: Cyber Conflict · Cyber Attacks · De-escalation\n# 1 A Looming Geopolitical Situation\nCyber capabilities have emerged as a disruptive technological force, revolutionizing traditional warfare and conflict dynamics [20]. This technological evolution has empowered state and state-sponsored actors with unprecedented tools for sabotage, espionage, and manipulation, reshaping the geopolitical landscape into a domain marked by unpredictability and menace. The United States (US), suffering from an increasing number of threats to its critical infrastructure due to cyber-attacks [16] and recognizing the potential of cyber warfare, has adopted a proactive stance as outlined in its strategy to “Achieve and Maintain Cyberspace Superiority” [17]. This approach mandates a “defend forward”, necessitating preemptive infiltration into adversaries’ systems to enable swift retaliation, thus aiming for a deterrence-based dominance in cyberspace. Before 2018, the US maintained an approach of restraint to cyber operations outside the US Government, but this changed due to mainly Russia’s cyber-enables information operations in the 2026 US Presidential election. Obama administration contemplated but ultimately decided against initiating offensive cyber operations, largely due to apprehensions about the possibility of provoking further aggressive actions from Russia. Among the more robust\n© The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024\nD. H. de la Iglesia et al. (Eds.): DiTTEt 2024, AISC 1459, pp. 295-306, 2024.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-66635-3_25\ncyber strategies under consideration were proposals to neutralize websites disseminating leaked information, to execute cyber-attacks aimed at disrupting Russian media outlets, and to impair the command and control infrastructure utilized by Russian intelligence entities. Nonetheless, the chosen course of action by the administration veered away from cyber retaliation, opting instead for a response that encompassed diplomatic, economic, and law enforcement strategies. This led to a call from certain factions within the private sector and the Department of Defense to reevaluate existing beliefs regarding escalation dynamics, advocating for a more forward-leaning strategy [6].\nThe concept of cyber superiority was already vividly illustrated by Operation Olympic Games, where the U.S. in collaboration with Israel, reportedly deployed the Stuxnet virus against Iran's nuclear program [10]. Despite this show of offensive capability, the incident underscored the vulnerability of even technologically advanced nations to retaliatory cyber-attacks, highlighting the complex, double-edged nature of cyber power. Further exemplifying the strategic shift towards cyber warfare, Russia's actions in Ukraine since 2014 have demonstrated the seamless integration of cyber operations with traditional military tactics. Russian forces not only commandeered communication infrastructures but also launched cyber-attacks against critical services, employing disinformation campaigns to undermine the state and influence global perceptions. For example, nowadays in the Ukraine war, Russia repeatedly has claimed that Ukraine is filled with “Nazis”, and persists in promoting this demonstrably false claim, both internally and externally [2]. Similarly, China's cyber activities, including economic and state espionage, have prompted international tensions, leading to agreements aimed at curbing cyber espionage -- a testament to the global recognition of the seriousness of cyber threats.\nThe digital realm has thus become a critical fifth dimension of military strategy, with nations deploying viruses, ransomware, and exploiting vulnerabilities to assert their interests [12]. All major world powers have established military cyber commands and reformed their intelligence services, and in some states, like Russia and China, there are close ties between government agencies and patriotic or even criminal hackers. States often operate from the shadows, and typically neither confirm nor deny their involvement in a cyber-attack. Instead, they provide ambiguous responses such as ‘non-denial denials' or refuse to address the allegations' [3]. This approach allows states to pursue dual objectives: they can maintain crisis stability while leaving open the possibility of their participation in the cyber-attack. By intentionally remaining under suspicion, a state can influence how rivals perceive its cyber capabilities and determination. Additionally, by not denying responsibility, a state can also affect how rivals view the capabilities of its allies, thereby bolstering the credibility of deterrence. This approach achieves these ends without the escalatory dangers associated with explicitly admitting responsibility.\nThe establishment of military cyber commands and the collaboration between governments and hacker groups underscore the strategic importance of cyberspace. In this shadowy warfare, the lines between peace and conflict blur, as states engage in continuous digital skirmishing, preparing the battlefield with espionage tools, traps, and offensive weapons, even during peacetime. This transformation into a world where cyber conflict is an “always on” phenomenon demands a reevaluation of traditional notions of warfare and security [1]. Cyber operations, from sabotage and espionage to disinformation\ncampaigns, have become integral components of national defense and offensive strategies. These operations not only pose significant challenges to societal security but also offer strategic tools to achieve political and military objectives. As the digital landscape evolves, so too will the nature of conflict and the strategies nations employ to protect their interests and assert their power on the global stage.\n## The Cyber Conflict\nThe cyber conflict lies between peace and war, which has implications for how we should think about peacetime and wartime (see Table 1). Traditionally, war and peace form a binary distinction: it is either war or peace between countries. This distinction can still be maintained, provided we distinguish peacetime from cyber peace, and understand war as cyber-physical war. In a time of cyber peace, it is not only peacetime, but there is also no cyber conflict. Countries do not engage in cyber espionage and do not use cyber means to cause damage in another country. Disinformation campaigns are also not undertaken. The focus in this situation is on strengthening cybersecurity. States can also train cyber soldiers and acquire weapons. However, the ability to build offensive cyber capabilities is limited: gaining intelligence about the cyber capabilities and systems of the opponent is of great importance for both setting up one's defense and creating offensive capacity. The goals in the cyber conflict vary: sometimes a state seeks economic advantages by spying, sometimes a state wants to prepare the military battlefield in its favor, and sometimes a state wants to pressure or manipulate the political decision-making in another state. But cyber-attacks have never escalated to the point where countries have declared war on each other. Moreover, in this cyber conflict, there is an important difference between cyber sabotage that directly causes severe damage, and cyber espionage and disinformation spreading that serve the interests of a particular state much more indirectly. The victim is not supposed to notice cyber espionage and disinformation spreading, while cyber sabotage immediately affects the physical world of people -- for example, because financial services break down or a power plant fails.\nWe therefore distinguish between cold and hot aspects of the cyber conflict. In situations of cold cyber conflict, it seems as if no conflict is taking place at all since countries use cyber espionage and the spread of disinformation. In situations of hot cyber conflict, the information struggle flares up because facilities are openly damaged and people directly experience the consequences of cyber sabotage in their own living environment. An example of such a hot cyber conflict was the Stuxnet operation, which caused serious physical damage in peacetime. The damage was so severe that there has been broad discussion about whether the attack should even be classified as an armed attack under humanitarian law [14]. The cold and hot aspects of the cyber conflict are not mutually exclusive. For example, cyber sabotage generally presupposes cyber espionage. A particular cyber conflict has more or fewer cold and hot aspects. And it's not that a hot cyber-attack is necessarily more dangerous than a cold cyber-attack -- perhaps nothing is more dangerous than corrupting a democratic rule of law state's information provision from within. But it is true that serious cyber sabotage borders on an act of war, as acts of war are characterized by very serious physical damage.\nL. Royakkers\nTable 1. The action strategies within the four phases in cyberspace.\n|  Situation | Intent  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Cyber peace (peacetime) | Peace/neutrality; Strengthening of (inter)national cybersecurity: • Establishment of (inter)national Computer Emergency Response Teams, detecting, preventing, and addressing cyber incidents and risks  |\n|  Cold Cyber Conflict (peacetime) | Strengthening national offensive cyber capacity: • The significant increase in defense spending on cyber weapons in most states Acquiring (strategic) information: • The espionage operations of the American security agency NSA (revealed by Edward Snowden) e.g., to eavesdrop on European allies Influencing public opinion or democratic processes: • Russian disinformation about MH17 • Alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections  |\n|  Warm Cyber Conflict (peacetime) | Preparing the digital battlefield: • The American strategy of ‘forward defense,’ where foreign vital structures are hacked in advance to quickly retaliate upon infiltration Exerting political pressure: • Russian cyber-attacks in 2007 on internet sites of the Estonian government, banks, media, and companies, due to a conflict over the relocation of a Russian war monument in the Estonian capital Tallinn Damaging, disrupting, or destroying (vital) systems: • The American Stuxnet attack on the Iranian nuclear program  |\n|  Cyber-Physical War (wartime) | Military victory: • In the wars in Eastern Ukraine, Russia made/makes extensive use of cyber-attacks alongside conventional weapons  |\nWe must nuance our understanding of war. In wartime, offensive cyber capabilities will likely play a significant role: more and more military equipment is becoming digitalized, and it can be very advantageous to mislead the opponent's air defense through disinformation, as happened during Operation Orchard of the Israeli Air Force on a Syrian nuclear reactor. Therefore, it makes sense to speak of cyber-physical warfare, integrating digital applications into the conventional arsenal of warfare. Russia's cyber activity in Ukraine transcends warm cyber conflict because the cyber-attacks coincided with conventional military deployment. However, it is questionable whether the cyber sabotage carried out by Russia would be sufficient to fall under the prohibition of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. The severity of the consequences is usually considered the measure to determine whether a particular cyber-attack falls under the\nprohibition of force (see [18]). In international humanitarian law, the ‘physical effects' standard is used to define what is considered ‘use of force'. This standard states that there is only force if it leads to an actual or potentially harmful physical effect on the targeted state. These physical effects include death, bodily injury, or significant damage to vital infrastructures or military installations. Technically, a sabotaging cyber-attack could lead to civilian casualties or significant infrastructural damage, for example, as a result of long-term disabling of power plants. Yet, it is challenging to find cyber-attacks that meet that standard. Sabotaging cyber-attacks generally do not result in civilian casualties -- at least not in a direct sense, but can endanger human health and well-being [16]. Most sabotaging cyber-attacks do cause serious societal damage but do not cripple vital infrastructures. For example, sabotaging cyber-attacks occasionally disrupt banking services, but the financial sector has never been completely shut down. Similarly, in 2015 in Ukraine, the power supply was shut down, but the lights came back on a few hours later. Therefore, it is questionable where the turning point lies between an attack that damages vital infrastructure and an attack that causes significant damage to vital infrastructure. Experts indicate that international law does not clearly answer this question [15]. For example, there is no consensus on whether the Stuxnet attack should be considered an armed attack. This is significant, as that attack is marked as one of the most far-reaching cyber-attacks. In addition, some authors argue that certain cyber-attacks that do not cause physical damage should still be considered armed attacks (see, e.g. [7]). In this case, we should think of cyber-attacks that can have a socially disruptive effect, such as crashing a stock market through digital manipulations. However, yet in practice, cyber conflicts have tended to be of low intensity, staying beneath the threshold that would categorize them as armed attacks [8]. Furthermore, to this day, cyber operations have no direct impact on the battlefield, but rather target broader national and civilian resilience (see, [11, 20]). Also nowadays in the Ukrainian war, Russia mounts sophisticated cyber-attacks, but it still does not happen in any fashion that is decisive to the war [2].\nIn our opinion, relaxing the ‘physical effects' standard is counterproductive and completely negates the intentions of de-escalation, as it would give countries more opportunities to respond with traditional violence to a cyber-attack under Article 51 of the UN Charter, which allows self-defense in the case of armed violence. Cyber sabotage is an infringement on the sovereignty of the state. This could also apply to cyber espionage and the spread of disinformation. The norm of sovereignty restriction (Article 2(7) of the UN Charter) could provide a framework to critically examine cyber-attacks and even declare them contrary to international law. In the Tallinn Manual 2.0, where a special group of experts proposes applying international law to cyber-attacks, it is also stated that the norm of sovereignty restriction applies to cyber-attacks [15]. However, the norm is very generally formulated, and the Tallinn Manual 2.0 offers, at best, an ambiguous stance regarding the interpretation of the norm and when and which countermeasures are permitted. The norm itself constitutes a less severe offense than an attack or armed attack. A violation of the prohibition of force justifies a stronger response than a violation of sovereignty -- and it could well be that states want to take a strong countermeasure in some situations. However, the legal problems that arise in cyberspace can only be very limitedly interpreted in terms of positive international law,\nand cyberspace continuously ‘escapes' existing forms of regulation. We will not further discuss the legal complications that cyber-attacks entail in this article, but we can at least state that a clear, elaborated, and widely supported normative framework for the majority of cyber-attacks that states face during a cyber conflict is lacking. The cyber conflict does not fit the traditional patterns of thought about peace and war and may even be considered an “other-than-war” phenomenon [13].\nTherefore, cyber-attacks are poised to occupy a distinct place within the moral hierarchy of foreign policy tools, nestled between diplomacy and kinetic warfare, similar to severe economic sanctions. Larry May [9] proposes reclassifying these cyber operations not as acts of war but as akin to embargoes, serving as political and economic levers. This reimagining suggests cyber-attacks could be a strategic alternative to conflict, potentially guiding how NATO responds to attacks on its members. The effectiveness of traditional economic sanctions is debated, especially given globalization's role in diluting their impact. Instances like the UN's sanctions against Libya and the EU's against Russia illustrate sanctions' complex consequences, including retaliation that can harm the sanctioning states themselves. Cyber-attacks offer, according to May, an additional strategy in coercive diplomacy, potentially pressuring states towards compliance without the drawbacks of conventional sanctions. They could prompt states to cease unlawful activities by threatening their digital infrastructure, such as the Stuxnet virus against Iran's nuclear program. This approach, leveraging cyber capabilities for targeted pressure while minimizing civilian distress, could serve as a peaceful yet potent means to enforce international norms and laws. However, the potential for retaliatory cyber-attacks by the targeted state may increase escalation.\nIn addition, many states invest significant amounts of money in building offensive cyber capabilities. They all want to have a high-quality arsenal capable of conducting complex espionage, sabotage, and disinformation spreading. These factors contribute to a risky cyber conflict, where attackers have the means and opportunity to attack vulnerable systems, and where these attackers rarely face repercussions. In this threatening geopolitical situation, countries will likely continue to suffer from cyber-attacks carried out by other states. Moreover, there is a chance that cyber-attacks will escalate, in the sense that both the harmfulness and frequency of cyber-attacks increase. Given the danger to the security of the digital environment, international efforts must be made to effectively de-escalate cyber-attacks: the frequency of cyber-attacks must decrease, and the cyber-attacks that society experiences must become less severe. The question is how this turnaround can be achieved, and who should take responsibility for it. In the next section, we will discuss five solution directions that support this de-escalation.\n## Solution for the De-escalation of the International Information Conflict\n### Continue Cooperation to Improve International Cyber Security\nIn addition to the national steps taken to increase resilience and cyber security, states need to continue investing in international cooperation in the field of cyber security. The emphasis of NATO's cyber policy is on strengthening the defense of NATO member\nstates: “The keynote is defense, whether an attack comes from state, criminal, or other sources,” according to a NATO spokesperson. NATO's defensive doctrine is mainly based on deterrence or passive deterrence: ‘deterrence by denial.' This means that security measures must be strengthened to the point that it becomes practically impossible, or at least very expensive, for attackers to infiltrate systems. The cooperation to further improve digital security at the EU and NATO level must be continued and intensified. Some good examples of this cooperation include the rollout of a broad network of Cyber Emergency Incident Response Teams (the CERT network) and the release of an initial standard (ETSI TS 103 645) by the European Telecommunications Standardisation Institute (ETSI) for securing Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices to support all parties involved in the development and production of IoT for consumers with guidance on securing their products.\nImplementing a policy where NATO refrains from initiating cyber-attacks first, supported by credible military deterrents, can effectively communicate its commitment to restraint and establish boundaries for acceptable cyber-attacks. This strategy would define a baseline for cyber operations that won't provoke a violent response, highlighting that only countermeasures against cyber adversaries are permissible, while attacks on civilian infrastructure are explicitly excluded [6]. However, the dynamic between attackers and defenders in cyberspace remains unresolved, with attackers often gaining the upper hand. Strengthening global cooperation through the sharing of intelligence, best practices, and joint response strategies is essential. Additionally, creating global forums for cybersecurity intelligence and coordination will facilitate timely responses to threats. Despite this, international support for multilateral cyber arms control is waning due to challenges in verification, perceived minimal consequences for violators, and the exclusivity of agreements. Any effective framework must address these issues and consider the complexity of verifying and attributing violations in cyberspace. Furthermore, developing and promoting international cybersecurity standards will help define responsible state behavior, protect civilian networks, and promote a rules-based approach to managing cyber conflict, thus preventing escalation towards armed conflict [18].\n### Make Clear International Agreements Regarding Cyber Sabotage, Disinformation, and Cyber Espionage\nThe geopolitical landscape of cyber-attacks suffers from a notable absence of specific, binding international rules tailored to the unique dynamics of cyber conflict. Consequently, states often rely on generic international legal frameworks, which are ambiguous and open to varied interpretations concerning cyber-attacks. This ambiguity tends to benefit the attackers by fostering an environment of uncertainty that they can exploit. Establishing clear and concrete rules would enable the international community to respond promptly and decisively to cyber incidents, setting clear expectations and consequences for state actions.\nProposals for international agreements on cyber conflict include a “Geneva Convention for cyber-attacks” to establish norms akin to those that govern traditional warfare. However, the feasibility of such a treaty remains in question due to significant geopolitical divisions. For instance, the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context\nof International Security (GGE) has struggled to reach consensus, with major powers diverging sharply on key issues like the right to retaliate following a cyber-attack. The debate over how international humanitarian law applies to cyber operations continues to be contentious, reflecting broader disagreements on the militarization of cyberspace. The diplomatic efforts to forge a consensus have led to a bifurcation in approaches [5]. The U.S. and its allies have pursued one track, while a coalition led by Russia and China has followed another, both proposing different norms for state behavior in cyberspace. This division underscores the challenges in achieving a unified global stance on cyber conflicts.\nBeyond formal treaties, there is potential for building confidence through voluntary agreements that enhance state cooperation and transparency. Such measures could reduce misunderstandings and prevent conflicts, involving multilateral commitments to share intelligence on cyber threats and refrain from targeting civilian infrastructure during peacetime. At the national level, countries could independently declare their responses to cyber incidents, creating predictable standards and responses. This approach includes categorizing types of cyber-attacks and the corresponding responses, which the European Union began implementing in 2019 with a framework for targeted measures against cyber threats.\nThe debate over cyber espionage and its implications for state sovereignty is particularly complex. Cyber espionage often involves tactics that could be seen as violating sovereignty if they cause harm, such as data corruption or system disruption. Meanwhile, the spread of disinformation represents another serious challenge, potentially destabilizing democratic processes and public discourse. It is inappropriate for a democratic rule of law state to further disrupt the information provision in another country. This does not mean that foreign information campaigns are inadmissible. It may be useful to give critical Russian journalism a helping hand. But spreading disinformation that weakens the legal order is, in our opinion, comparable to the use of chemical weapons: an inadmissible means for a civilized democratic state.\nIn terms of countermeasures, the need for proportionate and responsible responses is paramount. Retaliatory cyber-attacks are risky and may not effectively enhance cybersecurity or deter aggressors. Instead, a combination of diplomatic, economic, and legal measures, alongside public exposure of malicious activities, may offer a more sustainable path to maintaining international peace and security in the digital age. Thus, the international community stands at a critical juncture, needing to balance the imperatives of security and cooperation against the backdrop of rapidly evolving cyber capabilities. The establishment of robust, clear, and widely accepted norms for cyberspace is essential to manage and mitigate the risks of cyber conflict effectively.\nA fundamental choice has to be made regarding the type of countermeasures that should be taken in response to a cyber-attack. One can fight fire with fire and launch a similar cyber counterattack. We have indicated that this is irresponsible in the case of undermining a democratic rule of law. Many other cyber-attacks directly affect civilian institutions and facilities -- targets that should be spared as much as possible even in wartime. It is therefore highly questionable whether a democratic rule of law state should retaliate in kind. European States can also respond with other means, for example, by using the European sanctions package, and taking diplomatic and economic\nmeasures. Considering these alternative means is not only of moral importance -- it is questionable whether cyber counterattacks structurally increase cyber security. Every attack contributes to the proliferation of weapons, and cyber conflicts have so far never ended with a decisive counterattack. Moreover, serious reservations are expressed in the literature about the deterrence strategy [19]. If a cyber counterattack is carried out, it must happen immediately and in cooperation with allies. If threats are made without follow-up, the deterrent effect disappears.\n### Ensure Responsible Management of the Cyber Arsenal\nMalware can spread across the world in seconds: that is the price we pay for a global internet. Whoever deploys a cyber weapon can expect the used code to end up in unforeseen hands and perhaps boomerang back in one's face. This means that cyber weapons must be deployed carefully and once-used vulnerabilities must be reported promptly. Because that is the unique opportunity for de-escalation that cyber conflict offers: programmers can neutralize much malicious code. Since these updates increase the security of the entire digital domain, this aspect must be optimally utilized. It is therefore of great importance that intelligence services and defense units work cooperatively with software producers and chip manufacturers to implement security updates as effectively as possible and distribute them among users. International intelligence services and defense units must cooperate with software producers and computer chip manufacturers in implementing security updates and distributing them among users. Moreover, intelligence services and defense units must continuously ask themselves what increases cyber security more: possessing a certain cyber weapon or releasing it?\nInternational allies should also be more open with each other and jointly monitor the management of vulnerabilities. It would be a pity if allies independently collect cyber weapons and keep them strictly secret: then, vulnerabilities could remain on the shelf that the services could have reported from a strategic point of view. Ultimately, in the long term, the importance of reliable and safe digital applications weighs more heavily than the interest in occasionally breaking through that security, however much this would enable specific operations. Responsible management of the cyber arsenal also has consequences for cooperation with private parties. Many large states possess a high-quality arsenal capable of conducting complex espionage, sabotage, and disinformation spreading, and master the simpler methods of committing cyber-attacks. This development has also led to a flourishing private or malicious industry that supplies these weapons, contributes to the proliferation of weapons, and gives opponents access to offensive cyber capabilities. Not for nothing did the German government in 2017 decide to have cyber weapons developed by its own state agency [4]. Government must seriously consider which private partners should be involved in the development of offensive cyber capabilities -- and whether there is enough reason to take this development more into its own hands. Strict conditions must also apply to ensure that dangerous technology is not sold to countries that cannot trust with these weapons. An international lobby for an updated system of export licenses could help in this regard.\n### Protect the Independence of Technology Companies\nTechnology companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Apple play a crucial role in ensuring international cyber security. They can patch the holes in their software and ensure the most robust possible digital applications. This means that it is of crucial importance that these companies do not become extensions of national governments. Kaspersky Labs and Huawei Technologies are under great pressure due to their connections with China and Russia. The governments of Russia and China do not respect the fundamental rights of their citizens and regularly use their power to intervene in the business world -- so why wouldn't they use these global players as pawns of their intelligence services? How exactly the Western governments should deal with companies like Huawei and Kaspersky depends on the extent to which the Chinese and Russian governments actually control these companies. American companies sometimes work intensively with intelligence services, whether or not under duress, as in the renewed PRISM program of the National Security Agency (NSA). The international community must prevent such situations, both within the prescribed frameworks and proactively, if it wants to maintain a reliable and safe international technology market. It is therefore encouraging to see that more than 60 global companies, including Microsoft, Facebook, and Dell, are part of the Cybersecurity Tech Accord and have joined the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace. The cooperation agreement contains a set of common promises that have consequences for how these companies relate to governments. Such as the promise never to help governments launch cyber-attacks against innocent civilians and businesses, and the promise to protect their products against covert influence and sabotage. Although the impact and precise meaning of the agreement in practice remain to be seen, this cooperation could greatly reduce the ability of governments to set up espionage and sabotage operations with the help of companies.\n### Invest in a Societal Debate on Geopolitical Cyber Security\nWar, peace, and international conflict are matters that the population should be particularly involved in a democracy: major societal interests are at stake. The nature of the current information conflict complicates this discussion because so many things are opaque or secret. However, the decision to acquire certain weapons and authorize certain operations cannot only be a matter for experts and officials with special authority: the ongoing cyber conflict must be thoroughly and deeply discussed in the public debate. Each of the four solution directions mentioned above should be addressed in the Dutch and international public debate. Therefore, secrecy by intelligence services and defense cannot be taken for granted -- this secrecy must be weighed against the interest of citizens in gaining insight into the government's cyber operations and forming an opinion about them. The greater the impact of international cyber conflicts on society, the greater the importance of making a relevant public debate possible. Moreover, the involvement of citizens is urgently needed: they are frequently the victims of disinformation, cyber espionage, and cyber sabotage. In the cyber conflict, all citizens have a role to play and should be equipped to recognize disinformation and take basic security measures. Only citizens who understand how technology affects their lives and who have meaningful input in the political choices made regarding new technology are resilient against\nBytes and Battles: Pathways to De-escalation in the Cyber Conflict Arena\nundermining cyber-attacks. The government has a special responsibility to enable this citizenship: by facilitating education, prioritizing the rights of citizens, and providing as much transparency as possible about the issues it faces in a threatening geopolitical situation.\n# 4 Conclusions\nMost actions currently undertaken by influential states fall within what we have described as the cyber conflict. In peacetime, countries build up their cyber security and try to infiltrate the digital systems of other countries as secretly as possible. Russia also actively spreads disinformation. This is a strategy that other autocratic countries do not seem to apply on a large scale, at least not in relation to other countries, but is part of the desire to control, censor, and manipulate the information that reaches their population. There are also several examples of serious cyber sabotage, such as Operation Olympic Games, attributed to Israel and the United States, and the WannaCry attack, attributed to North Korea. So far, cyber-attacks have never led to a cyber-physical war; in that sense, there is no 'cyberwar'. However, the current international situation is risky and worrying, and the disruptive effects of cyber capabilities underscore the risks in the international landscape, which could lead to the escalation of cyber-attacks. We have formulated five possible solutions for the de-escalation of the international cyber conflict. Perhaps the most important is that clear international agreements are made in the field of offensive cyber capabilities. However, in the current geopolitical environment, international support for multilateral cyber arms control agreements is declining, due to issues such as doubts about verification, perceived limited consequences for violators of agreements, and a lack of inclusivity of many agreements. Any multilateral framework for cyber weapons control will have to take this trend into account, especially since the verification of any agreement and the attribution of any violation will be even more complicated in the cyber domain than regular arms control. However, cyber weapons control frameworks limit expensive and destabilizing arms races and help prevent dangerous escalation toward armed conflict.\nAcknowledgment.

This article investigates the intricate dynamics of cyber conflict, driven by state and state-sponsored actions in cyber sabotage, espionage, and disinformation spread. It reviews how nations like the US, Russia, and China use cyber capabilities to assert dominance, counter threats, and shape global politics, impacting national security, economic stability, and democratic integrity. The analysis highlights the difficulties in attributing cyber-attacks, limitations of current legal frameworks, and risks of escalation to physical conflict. We suggest five strategic approaches to mitigate cyber conflict, including enhancing international cybersecurity collaboration, setting clear cyber norms, managing cyber arsenals responsibly, safeguarding tech company independence, and promoting public discourse on cyber issues. These strategies aim for a transparent, cooperative resolution to cyber conflicts, aligning with the nuances of digital warfare.",
