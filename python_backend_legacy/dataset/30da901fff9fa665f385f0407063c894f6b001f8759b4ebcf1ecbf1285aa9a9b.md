Introduction: The Growing Concerns of Cyber-Warfare\nThe threat of cyber-warfare is a current and continuing issue that our nation must address. President Obama, the Department of Defense (DoD), and even the private sector comprehend this issue and have been attempting to update our defense strategies to better protect this nation. The following quotations explain how concerned authorities from all levels of the nation are with the threat of cyber-warfare:\nIt’s the great irony of our Information Age -- the very technologies that empower us to create and to build also empower those who would disrupt and destroy. And this paradox -- seen and unseen -- is something that we experience every day... cyber threat is one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation.¹\nOur daily life, economic vitality, and national security depend on a stable, safe, and resilient cyberspace. . . . Yet cyber intrusions and attacks have increased dramatically over the last decade. . . .²\n[Google is] under attack all the time, primarily via unsophisticated channels . . . I can’t go into detail to demonstrate the level of sophistication, but [the company] doesn’t use that term lightly, and it is quite deliberate. . . . This is truly, truly beyond the pale . . . The political nature of this.\n¹ Barrack Obama, President of the United States of America, *Remarks by the President on Securing our Nation’s Cyber Infrastructure* (May 29, 2009).\n² *Cybersecurity Overview*, HOMELAND SECURITY, http://www.dhs.gov/cybersecurity-overview (last visited Oct. 24, 2013).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n. . is chilling.³\nThe threat of cyber-warfare is not only real; the threat is increasing daily as many countries use and develop information warfare systems.⁴ It is important to note, not all these warfare systems are created solely to attack—some are created for defense purposes.⁵ Nevertheless, cyber-warfare is a real and dangerous threat that has already affected many countries around the world.⁶ Given the tangible and mounting threat of cyber-warfare, the United States must continue to build on the already existing policies and strategies that currently exist.⁷ Moreover, the United States must be prepared to classify and possibly respond to a cyber-attack on either a governmental or\n³ Kim Zetter, Google to Stop Censoring Search Results in China After Hack Attack, WIRED (Jan. 12, 2010), http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/01/google-censorship-china/.\n⁴ Natasha Solce, The Battlefield of Cyberspace: The Inevitable New Militray Branch—The Cyber Force, 18 ALB.

What is Cyber-Warfare: Definitions and Conflicts\n### Therein\nBefore moving into an in-depth discussion regarding cyber-warfare, the possibility of a cyber-attack on a government or civilian target, and a cyber-attack’s relation to the international rules of war, a definition of cyber-warfare must be established. The definition’s importance is exemplified in the international law of war setting because an attack must be analyzed using the “use of force” and/or “armed attack” tests, which are further discussed later in this paper.⁸\n⁸ See generally TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Cambridge University Press 2013) (explaining the use of force in terms of cyber-warfare); U.N. Charter art. 51 (explaining the amount force needed to respond to an armed attack).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n## A. Basic Definition of Cyber-Warfare\nThe most basic definition of cyber-warfare can be established by combining the terms “cyber” and “war.” Cyber is defined in an English dictionary as “of, relating to, or involving computers or computer networks.”⁹ War, as defined in a legal dictionary, is “[h]ostile conflict by means of armed forces, carried on between nations, states, or rulers, or sometimes between parties within the same nation or state.”¹⁰ Thus, cyber-warfare would be a hostile conflict via armed forces that involves computers or computer networks.¹¹ The problem with this definition is that it requires “armed forces,” whereas cyber-warfare usually does not include actual armed forces invading or defending a country.¹² To the contrary, cyber-warfare usually involves a conflict within computer systems, which were programmed by humans, but does not involve forces equipped with actual kinetic weapons.¹³\n## B. Definition Based on the Object Being Attacked\nBeyond this basic attempt to define cyber-warfare,\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\ntwo other mainstream ideologies have defined cyber-warfare: object-based vs. medium-based.¹⁴ The object based definition concentrates on whether the object being attacked is “cyber” in nature. The U.S. National Research Council created such a definition in 2009 in an attempt to clarify cyber-warfare and cyber-attacks.¹⁵ The definition described a cyber-attack as “the use of deliberate actions—perhaps over an extended period of time—to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy adversary computer systems or networks or the information and/or programs resident in or transiting these systems or networks.”¹⁶ Other commentators have offered similar definitions, such as defining cyber-warfare as “actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation’s computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption.”¹⁷ The main problem with any object-based definition is that it is overly broad; that is, such definitions would include attacks on computers via kinetic weapons.¹⁸ For example, these definitions would define a\n14 See Reese Nguyen, *Navigating Jus Ad Bellum in the Age of Cyber Warfare*, 101 CAL. L. REV. 1079, 1078-91(2013).\n15 COMM. ON OFFENSIVE INFO. WARFARE, NAT’L RES. COUNCIL, TECHNOLOGY, POLICY, LAW, AND ETHICS REGARDING U.S. ACQUISITION AND USE OF CYBERATTACK CAPABILITIES 80 (William A. Owens et al. eds., 2009).\n16 Id.\n17 RICHARD A. CLARKE &amp; ROBERT K. KNAKE, CYBER WAR: THE NEXT THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT 6 (2010).\n18 See Nguyen, supra note 14, at 1087 (explaining that attacks via kinetic weapons should not be included in the discussion of cyber-warfare because such\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nbombing of a server farm as a cyber-attack that could lead to cyber-warfare; however, the act of using a physical bomb seems far beyond the purview of a cyber-attack. Therefore, such object-based definitions of cyber-warfare, and in turn cyber-attacks, are too broad in nature.\nAlternatively, object-based definitions of cyber-warfare are equally too narrow. Because object-based definitions require the object being attacked to be cyber in nature, these definitions would exclude attacks from a computer network that affect non-computers. For example, the Stuxnet attacks involved a malicious worm that used computer networks to attack, but and actually affected Iran’s nuclear centrifuges.¹⁹ Thus, under the object-based definition of cyber-warfare, the Stuxnet attack would not have qualified as a cyber-attack or an act of cyber-warfare. In short, the object-based definition of cyber-warfare fails in numerous ways, being both overly broad and narrow.\n## C. Definition Based on the Medium Being Used to Attack\nThe medium-based definition concentrates on whether the object *used* in the attack is “cyber” in nature. Essentially, a medium-based definition of cyber-warfare focuses on the\nkinetic attacks have already been readily defined in a number of international treaties and laws of war).\n¹⁹ See Dennis Fisher &amp; Paul Roberts, *Spotlight Series: Stuxnet*, THREATPOST: THE KASPERSKY LAB SECURITY NEWS SERVICE.\nVolume XVIII 2014 254\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nmethod used in the attack rather than the target being attacked—much in the same way an aerial attack involves planes. The DoD seems to imply this type of understanding through its definition of cyberspace operations: “[t]he employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace.”²⁰ Importantly, this definition highlights the medium used in the operation, which parallels the way a medium-based definition of cyber-warfare focuses on whether cyberspace is used during an attack. An example of a medium-based definition for cyber-warfare can be seen in the Cambridge Dictionary as “the activity of using the internet to attack a country’s computers in order to damage things such as communication and transport systems or water and electricity supplies.”²¹ Moreover, a medium-based definition works best with the international laws of war because these laws rely on concepts that revolve around the force exerted on a target as opposed to the type of target being\n20 Joint Publication 1-02, DOD DICTIONARY OF MILITARY AND ASSOCIATED TERMS (Sept. 15, 2013), http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/ (emphasis added) (noting the DoD does not have a definition for cyber-warfare, cyber-war, or cyber-attack).\n21 CAMBRIDGE DICTIONARIES, http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/british/cyberwarfare?q=+cyberwarfare (last visited Oct. 29, 2013) (emphasis added) (noting that many other mainstream dictionaries did not include a definition of cyber-warfare, cyber-war, or cyber-attack).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nattacked.²² For the forgoing reasons, a medium-based definition should be used to define cyber-warfare. Thus, the definition of cyber-warfare should look similar, but not necessarily exactly like, the definition provided in the Cambridge Dictionary.²³\nFor example, a proper definition of cyber-warfare could be: hostile acts via cyberspace that damage or disturb a country’s infrastructure or related networks for a governmental or national security purpose.\n## III. Potential Types of Cyber-Attacks that Could Occur During Cyber-Warfare\nNow that a logical and adequate definition of cyber-warfare has been established, understanding the types of attacks a nation could experience becomes imperative to understanding how and if an attack could constitute an act of cyber-warfare. There are three main categories of cyber-attacks: syntactic, semantic, and hybrid attacks.²⁴\n### A. Syntactic Attacks\nSyntactic attacks are aimed at a computer’s operating\n²² See e.g., TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 48-49 (Cambridge University Press 2013) (explaining the use of force factors—severity, directness, measurability of effects, etc.); U.N. Charter art. 51 (implying the use of self-defense must be proportionate).\n²³ See supra note 21.\n²⁴ Susan W. Brenner &amp; Marc D. Goodman, In Defense of Cyberterrorism: An Argument for Anticipating Cyberattacks, 2022 U. ILL. J. L. TECH &amp; POL’Y 1, 27-42 (2002).\nVolume XVIII 2014 256\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nsystem and “modify the logic of the system in order to introduce delays or to make the system unpredictable.”²⁵ There are two main types of syntactic attacks: penetration and denial of service (DoS) attacks.²⁶\n## 1. PENETRATION ATTACKS\nPenetration attacks, as the name indicates, penetrate a computer system or computer network and transport whatever the programmer wants to “drop” into the system/network.²⁷ Examples of penetration attacks include the implantation of malware, viruses, Trojan horses, and worms.²⁸ All these types of penetration attacks cause actual damage to the system/network in different ways.²⁹ For example, worms replicate within the system but do not infect the host computer; nevertheless, the worm spreads throughout the entire system and eventually can cause the system to completely shut down.³⁰ Viruses effect computer systems is a different way, creating codes that become active once a user opens the file, and subsequently, the\n25  Id. at 27.\n26  See Nguyen, supra note 14, at 1092-93.\n27  Id.\n28  CDR Vida M.

REV. 132, 139 (2005).\n29  Id.\n30  Id.\n257\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nvirus corrupts, destroys, or steals files.³¹ Any of these types of penetration attacks can lead to the destruction or alterations of a computer system, and in turn, can lead to physical or economic damage.³²\n## 2. DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS\nDenial of service (DoS) attacks disrupt a computer system or network by overloading the system/network, and thus, reduce its functionality.³³ Essentially, a DoS attack can completely shut down a system/network by flooding the target with false requests for service, therefore causing the system to overload.³⁴ When this happens, legitimate requests for service are blocked, and the actual purpose of the system is devastated.³⁵ Importantly, for anonymity reasons, attackers will often use distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks. A DDoS attack has the same purpose as a DoS attack; however, the attacker uses other people’s computers in addition to their own, which makes tracing the source of the attack much more difficult. Both DoS\n³¹ *Id.*\n³² See e.g., *Fisher &amp; Roberts*, *supra* note 19 (explaining how the Stuxnet worm caused actual damage to Iranian nuclear program).\n³³ JOSEPH MIGGA KIZZA, *COMPUTER NETWORK SECURITY AND CYBER ETHICS* 76 (2002).\n³⁴ Mindi McDowell, *Understanding Denial-of-Service Attacks*, UNITED STATES COMPUTER EMERGENCY READINESS TEAM (Feb. 6, 2013), http://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-015.\n³⁵ *Id.*\nVolume XVIII 2014 258\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nand DDoS attacks can harm a nation via physical or economic damages.³⁶\n## B. Semantic Attacks\nSemantic attacks do not attempt to shut down, steal information, or destroy a computer network/system; rather, they affect the accuracy of the network’s information. Essentially, “[a] system under semantic attack operates and will be perceived as operating correctly (otherwise the semantic attack is failure), but it will generate answers at variance with reality.”³⁷ While such an attack seems petty, computer users tend to accept the information given to them, especially if such information derives from a government website.³⁸ For example, if a semantic attack occurred to an important government website, such information could cause people ignore a legitimate threat or falsely perceive an innocent act as a legitimate attack. Such a semantic attack could cause people to unnecessarily bunker down or, alternatively, riot out of fear. Thus, such a semantic attack could have severe consequences\n³⁶ See e.g., John Markoff, *Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks*, New York Times (Aug. 12, 2008), http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html?_r=0 (explaining that the Russian cyber-attack on Georgia consisted of a DoS attack).\n³⁷ Brenner &amp; Goodman, *supra* note 24, at 31-32.\n³⁸ See Antolin-Jenkins, *supra* note 28, at 140 (noting how gullible or ignorant many computer users are when reading information off the internet).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\non the population.³⁹ As demonstrated above, semantic attacks can be as detrimental to a nation as syntactic attacks.\n## C. Hybrid Attacks\nHybrid attacks are exactly what the term seems to imply: a hybrid of syntactic and semantic cyber-attacks.⁴⁰ Such attacks have the greatest likelihood of causing the most destruction because the attacker could actually destroy a certain computer system (and, in turn, whatever other infrastructure was affected) and then tell the people that something completely different happened—only furthering the confusion, distrust, and destruction.⁴¹\n³⁹ See id. at 140-41 (noting that such attacks could cause great civil unrest); Brenner &amp; Goodman, supra note 24 at 31-39.\n⁴⁰ See Antolin-Jenkins, supra note 28, at 140.\n⁴¹ See id. For example,\nTerrorists can mount complex attacks by combining syntactic and semantic attacks. Imagine that terrorists target Boston, Atlanta, Miami, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles for an attack which begins with a syntactic assault on computer systems that stops the delivery of state public assistance. General public awareness of the attack will emerge gradually, as successive waves of frustrated welfare recipients file complaints with the appropriate agencies. Eventually, the realization will spread that the distribution of benefits had been deliberately shut down. Once it becomes clear that the funds are not coming, the terrorists can follow up with a semantic attack assigning responsibility for their efforts to carefully-selected right-wing groups whose views are known to carry at least the taint of racial bias. If the terrorists manage to sustain the welfare gridlock, the freezing of the resources upon which thousands depend for their survival will produce civil disobedience and localized chaos. National Guardsmen might have to be sent into these cities to maintain\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nWith an understanding of the definition of cyber-warfare and the types of cyber-attacks that could occur during cyber-warfare, we must move forward to the international laws of war that apply to any sort of attack, whether kinetic or cyber.\n## IV. International Laws of War: An Application to Cyber-Warfare\nIn this section, I will explain the major components of the international laws of war in the cyber-warfare context. First, I will briefly explain the United Nations Charter (UN Charter) and how it applies to cyber-warfare.⁴² Subsequently, I will discuss the creation and purpose of the Tallinn Manual (the Manual).⁴³ And lastly, I will explain the United States’ approach and strategies to handing the possibility of cyber-warfare.⁴⁴ Each of these components is essential in understanding how to properly respond to an act of warfare, specifically cyber-\norder. To make things even more interesting, the terrorists can then direct a syntactic attack at ATM and banking system computers in these cities. Such a shutdown will add to the problem by causing outrage among citizens who do not depend on welfare funds. The cumulative effects of all these efforts will be riots, targeted violence and a National Guard stretched to its limit (which will create an excellent opportunity for the terrorists to stage a CBERN attack in other areas of the country).\nBrenner &amp; Goodman, supra note 24, at 39-40.\n42 See infra Part IV.A.\n43 See infra Part IV.B.\n44 See infra Part IV.C.\n261\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nwarfare.\n## A. The United Nations Charter\nThe UN Charter functions as the backbone to the current international laws of war.⁴⁵ It sets forth many rules and guidelines that apply to war; including starting a conflict, responding to an attack, and how the UN should respond to an attack on a member nation.⁴⁶ Understanding the UN Charter is crucial to understanding the later developments that deal specifically with cyber-warfare.\n## 1. GENERAL BACKGROUND\nThe UN Charter was created to “save succeeding generations from the scourge of war . . . to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights . . . to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other resources of international law . . . and to promote social progress.”⁴⁷ Moreover, the overarching goals of the UN Charter were to allow countries to live tolerantly and in peace, to strengthen international peace and security, to ensure that armed forces are a last resort, and to promote\n⁴⁵ See History of the United Nations, http://www.un.org/en/aboutun/history/charter_history.shtml (last visited Oct. 30, 2013).\n⁴⁶ See generally U.N. Charter arts. 2, 4, 42, 51 (explaining the rules regarding starting a conflict, responding to an attack, and assisting an ally who has been attacked).\n⁴⁷ Id. pmbl.\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nsocial and economic advancement for all people.⁴⁸ Notably, the United States is a member of United Nations along with many other world powers, including Russia, China, and the United Kingdom.⁴⁹ Furthermore, the UN Charter is binding upon the United States under Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution.⁵⁰ As discussed below, the UN Charter successfully created rules that allow for a far more humane world, even in the face of war, but unfortunately, these rules may be obsolete in terms of cyber-warfare.\n## 2. ARTICLE 2(4): PROHIBITING THE THREAT OR USE OF FORCE\nArticle 2, paragraph 4 of the UN Charter provides a quintessential rule: “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.”⁵¹ Essentially, this rule prohibits a country from threatening or using “force” on another country, provided\n48  Id.\n49  Member States of the United Nations, http://www.un.org/en/members/ (last visited Oct. 30, 2013) (noting there are 193 member nation with only Vatican City, Kosovo, The Republic of Taiwan, and Palestine not being members).\n50  U.S. CONST. art. II, § 2, cl. 1 (noting this is known as the Treaty Clause).\n51  Id. art. 2, para. 4.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nthe exception of self-defense discussed later in this section.⁵² Unfortunately, however, the term “threat or use of force” is never defined in the UN Charter, causing unrest and numerous debates.⁵³ Nevertheless, academics over the years have determined that this term involves only the uses or threat of *military* forces or attacks affecting the victim nation’s *military*, precluding economic and political coercion.⁵⁴ Notably, the UN Charter also specifically precludes espionage.⁵⁵\nThis rule is important in the cyber-warfare context because article 4(2) would prevent a victim country from attacking the aggressor country that committed the cyber-attack.⁵⁶ Thus, a country who falls victim to an act of cyber-warfare may not retaliate unless such an attack falls within the self-defense exception of article 51 via qualifying as an armed attack. The vagueness concerning the meaning of “use of force” presents an issue in the cyber-warfare context because at what point does a cyber-attack qualify as a use of *military* force?⁵⁷\n⁵² *Id.* art. 51.\n⁵³ See generally *id.* arts. 2, 4, 41, 42, 51 (noting that there is no definition section or individual definition for “threat or use of force”).\n⁵⁴ See e.g., MATTHEW C.

ARTICLES 41 AND 42\nArticles 41 and 42 of the UN Charter provide directions for how the UN can support a country that is being attacked.⁵⁸ Article 41 focuses on a way to counter an attack that does not mount to a “use of force,” whereas article 42 provides the UN the power to use force to counter such an attack, but only if it is determined that the attack qualified as a “use of force” and article 41 remedies would be inadequate.⁵⁹ Article 41’s non-forceful remedies would include economic blockades and political pressure.⁶⁰ While these two articles do not analyze whether a country can defend itself, they do provide structure and direction for how UN members should respond to an attack on their own country or on an ally.⁶¹ Primarily, articles 41 and 42 allow the UN to analyze the extent of the attack—whether there was a use of force—and, subsequently, allow the UN to\n⁵⁸ See U.N. Charter arts. 41, 42.\n⁵⁹ See id. Article 41 states “The Security Council may decide what measures not involving the use of armed force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and it may call upon the Members of the United Nations to apply such measures. These may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations. Id. art 41. If the UN decides that article 41 relief would be insufficient, it may “take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security. Such action may include demonstrations, blockade, and other operations by air, sea, or land forces of Members of the United Nations.” Id. art. 42.\n⁶⁰ See id. art. 41.\n⁶¹ See id. arts. 41, 42.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\ndecide to either use non-forceful or forceful remedies.⁶² While the substance of articles 41 and 42 are important, the most essential aspect of these articles is their purpose—to prevent forceful responses to an attack unless absolutely necessary to maintain international security and peace.⁶³\nIn discussing cyber-warfare, the most important aspect of articles 41 and 42 is their purpose as discussed directly above.⁶⁴ Thus, unless there is a clear use of force during a cyber-attack, it seems the United States or any other member of the UN could only respond via a non-forceful response—i.e., an economic blockade or political pressures.⁶⁵\n## 4. ARTICLE 51\nArticle 51 of the UN Charter provides the exception to general rule of article 2(4), which prohibits the use of force against other nations. Article 51 states:\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately\n⁶² See id.\n⁶³ See id.\n⁶⁴ See id. pmbl, arts. 41, 42.\n⁶⁵ See id. arts. 41, 42.\nVolume XVIII 2014 266\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nreported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.⁶⁶\nWhile Article 51 expressly creates an exception for the use of force in self-defense, some issues arise in the cyber-warfare context, especially when looking at the specific wording.⁶⁷ Much like the issue with our basic definition of cyber-warfare, article 51 allows a nation to defend itself only if the attack amounts to an “armed attack,” which a cyber-attack would never seem to qualify as.⁶⁸ Nevertheless, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) adjusted the definition of an armed attack by defining it more broadly and explaining that armed attacks “do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”⁶⁹ Thus, the term armed attack actually functions more as an expansion to “use of force” as opposed to an attack with actual kinetic weapons.⁷⁰\nMoreover, the ICJ decided in *Nicaragua v.

GENERAL BACKGROUND\nThe Manual, which was published in 2013, was put together by an international group of approximately twenty-five experts from 2009 to 2012.⁷⁸ These experts met in Tallinn, Estonia, which in turn, helped produce the name of the Manual.⁷⁹ The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), specifically NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, invited these experts to put together the rules of cyber-warfare into a single document.⁸⁰ The Manual was put together in response to the growing fear of cyber-warfare and, more specifically, the lack of well-defined rules regulating cyber-warfare.⁸¹ Notably, the Manual only discusses the laws\n⁷⁶ See id.\n⁷⁷ Id. (explaining the Manual is a “non-binding document applying existing law to cyber-warfare”).\n⁷⁸ Id. at 16-17, 22 (noting these experts included legal practitioners, technical experts, and academics).\n⁷⁹ Id. at 22.\n⁸⁰ Id.\n⁸¹ Id. at 17-18 (explaining the Manual was created “in hope of bringing some degree of clarity to the complex legal issues surrounding cyber operations, with particular attention paid to those involving the jus ad bellum and the jus\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nof cyber-warfare, thus excluding cyber-espionage (to the extent espionage does not involve “use of force”) and cyber-crimes.⁸² To reiterate, “it is essential to understand that the Tallinn Manual is not an official document” and, thus, is not binding on any nation.⁸³\n## 2. RULES 11 AND 12: DEFINITIONS OF FORCE AND THREAT OF FORCE\nImportantly, and unlike the UN Charter, the Manual actually defines both the crucial terms “use of force” and “threat of force.”⁸⁴ Starting with these definitions will allow for a better understanding of the Manual, even though these definitions come after some important rules within the Manual.⁸⁵\n### a. Rule 11: Definition of Use of Force\nThe Manual directly refers back to Nicaragua v. United States when determining what actions constitute a use of in bello”).\n⁸² *Id.* at 18.\n⁸³ *Id.* at 23. Nevertheless, the Manual could function in a similar way to the Lieber Code—an aspirational attempt to regulate warfare during the civil war—in that the Lieber Code eventually “became a core text in the modern laws of war recognized worldwide, and many elements of his code continue to inform our public debate how best to respond to a new form of warfare in both an effective and a moral manner.” Nick Beard, *The Liber Codes*, *THE NEW YORK TIMES: THE OPINION PAGES* (Apr. 24, 2013, 12:59 PM), http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/the-lieber-codes/?_r=0.\n⁸⁴ *TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE* 47-53.\n⁸⁵ *Id.* at 45, 47-53 (noting that the Prohibition of Threat or Use of Force, Rule 10, comes before the definitions of “use of force” and “threat of force”).\nVolume XVIII 2014 270\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nforce—applying the “scale and effects” test.⁸⁶ While the scale and effects test is not black and white, it provides a nation with a decent idea of what constitutes a use of force.⁸⁷ The Manual, however, does create some black and white rules.⁸⁸ For example, the Manual unequivocally states that “[a]cts that injure or kill persons or damage or destroy objects are unambiguously uses of force.”⁸⁹ Notably, like the UN Charter, the Manual excludes economic and political coercion from qualifying as use of force.⁹⁰ The Manual, moreover, explicitly rejects the notion that a non-destructive cyber-attack that is intended solely to undermine the confidence in a government would qualify as a use of force.⁹¹ As the Manual progresses through the definition of use of force, it designates eight factors that are supposed to help a nation determine whether a non-obvious act qualifies as a use of force—essentially adding factors to the scale and effects test.⁹² The list of factors includes the following: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects,\n⁸⁶ See id. at 47; Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. United States), 1986 I.C.J. 14, 103-04 (June 27).\n⁸⁷ Id.\n⁸⁸ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 49.\n⁸⁹ Id.\n⁹⁰ See id. at 48.\n⁹¹ Id.

Rule 12: Definition of Threat of Force\nRule 12 of the Manual breaks down the functional meaning of “threat of force” in the cyber-warfare context.⁹⁴ Importantly, the rule explains that a threat could occur in two situations: (1) “a cyber operation that is used to communicate a threat to use force” and (2) “a threat carried out by any means . . . to carry out cyber operations qualifying as use of force.”⁹⁵ The rule further notes that a demand need not accompany the threat to qualify as such under this rule; however, actions alone that seem threatening do not qualify as a threat because a threat must be “communicative in nature.”⁹⁶ The rule also states that a threat of force could technically derive form a nation that seems unequipped to follow through will such a threat; nonetheless, it’s the threat that matters.⁹⁷ Interestingly, the rule explains that\n⁹³ *Id.* (explaining out that the list of factors is not exhaustive and functions only as a starting point).\n⁹⁴ *Id.* at 52-53.\n⁹⁵ *Id.* at 52.\n⁹⁶ *Id.* at 53 (explaining that developing technology that could be used in an act that qualifies as a use of force *does not* qualify as a threat of force).\n⁹⁷ *Id.* (noting the experts were split with this portion of the rule).\nVolume XVIII 2014 272\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\na nation will not be considered to have actually made a threat of force, even if that nation makes such a threat and has the capability of following through with such threat, as long as that nation does not truly intend on attacking—essentially requiring actual intent.⁹⁸ Much like the definition of use of force, this definition lacks perfect clarity and contains many intricacies, but should be of great help in determining what actually constitutes a threat of force.\n## 3. RULE 10: PROHIBITION OF THREAT OR USE OF FORCE\nRule 10 of the Manual parallels article 2(4) of the UN Charter by making “[a] cyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force . . . unlawful.”⁹⁹ The commentary following Rule 10 clarifies that the “use of force” does not need to be committed by a country’s armed forces; rather, the force could derive from an intelligence agency or any private contractor of the nation. Rule 10 also discusses a nation “intervening” in another nation’s affairs—political, economic, social, cultural, or otherwise.¹⁰⁰ The rule explains that it is unlawful for another nation to intervene but goes on to explain that the term\n⁹⁸ *Id.* (noting, once again, that the experts were split with this portion of the rule).\n⁹⁹ *See id.* at 45 (Cambridge University Press 2013); U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4 (noting that both prohibit the threat or use of force).\n¹⁰⁰ *TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE* 46.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n\"intervene\" does have the same meaning as in a layman context; instead, intervention in the cyber-war context, as well as for the UN Charter, must involve coercion.¹⁰¹ The rule further explains that an unlawful act of intervention does not per se qualify as a use of force; the intervention still must breach the threshold for use of force independently.¹⁰² Thus, when determining whether an intervention is unlawful, a nation must ascertain if coercion is involved, and moreover, must decide if the intervention reached the level of use of force.¹⁰³ Fundamentally, Rule 10 applies article 2(4) of the UN Charter to the cyber-warfare setting.\n## 4. RULES 13, 14, 15 AND 16: THE RIGHT AND REGULATIONS FOR SELF-DEFENSE AND COLLECTIVE SELF-DEFENSE\nRules 13, 14, 15, and 16 of the Manual all explain the ability of a victim nation to launch a defensive response—in a parallel manner to article 51 of the UN Charter.¹⁰⁴ Rule 13 discusses an individual nation’s right to protect itself; rule 14 examines how an act of self-defense must be necessary and proportionate to the original attack; rule 15 delves into\n¹⁰¹ *Id.* at 47 (“intervention pure and simple is not intervention [in the UN Charter or Tallinn Manual context]”).\n¹⁰² *Id.* at 46.\n¹⁰³ *Id.* at 46-47; see UN Charter art. 51.\n¹⁰⁴ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 53-64.\nVolume XVIII 2014 274\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nthe ability of a nation to preemptively strike in an act of self-defense; and rule 16 examines the possibility of collective self-defense, that is a third party nation(s) coming to the aid of a victim nation.¹⁰⁵ These rules are essential to the completeness of the Manual, especially in the Manual’s attempt to mimic article 51 of the UN Charter.¹⁰⁶\n## a. Rule 13: Self-Defense Against Armed Attack\nRule 13 of the Manual allows a nation to exercise the right of self-defense, given that such nation faced an attack—cyber or kinetic—that qualified as an armed attack.¹⁰⁷ The term “armed attack” is quantified by the scale and effects of the attack, much like the use of force threshold in rule 11, but has an even heightened threshold beyond use of force.¹⁰⁸ Plainly, an armed attack is the “gravest” form of a use of force.¹⁰⁹ Unfortunately, however, the Manual never defines what the exact threshold is for the scale and effects test—only causing confusion.¹¹⁰ The scale and effects of an attack, though, must\n105 Id.\n106 See id.; UN Charter art. 51.\n107 See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 53-59 (explaining that “some cyber-attacks may be sufficiently grave to warrant classifying them as an ‘armed attack’”).\n108 See id. at 48-49, 54-55 (noting that while the two thresholds—armed attack and use of force—use the same threshold test, an armed attack holds a higher threshold).\n109 Id. at 48.\n110 See id. at 55-56 (indicating that the scale and effects test must be\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nbe reasonably foreseeable. Therefore, an attack that causes grave damage far beyond any reasonable foresight would not constitute an armed attack.¹¹¹ Notably, an armed attack must have a trans-border component; thus, a purely domestic attack can never qualify as an armed attack within the Manual’s framework.¹¹² The rule further explains that an armed attack can originate from a state or a non-state actor who is directed by the state to take such actions.¹¹³ Additionally, the rule states that individual attacks that alone do not qualify as armed attacks can be classified as armed attacks if that single attack is just one in a series of attacks. Accordingly, aggregated non-armed attacks can elevate and cross the threshold of an armed attack.¹¹⁴ The comments for rule 13 continue in detail about the irrelevance of intentions, the ability of a third party nation to defend itself if the scale and effects of the attack bleed over borders, and the ability of a victim nation to retaliate against persons who are located in an innocent third party nation—so as long the victim nation has permission to do so or the innocent third party nation\napplied on a case-by-case basis).\n¹¹¹ *Id.* at 56.\n¹¹² *Id.* at 54.\n¹¹³ *Id.* at 54-58 (detailing the intricacies and problems with attributing a non-state actor’s actions to a state).\n¹¹⁴ *Id.* at 55 (explaining that there must be convincing evidence that the multiple attacks are related).\nVolume XVIII 2014 276\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nis unable to take action.¹¹⁵ In short, a nation has the right to defend itself if attacked by another nation via an armed attack as determined by the scale and effects test.¹¹⁶\n## b. Rule 14: Necessity and Proportionality\nEven if it is determined that a nation has the right to defend itself—either via kinetic or cyber action—that nation’s defensive response must be necessary and proportionate.¹¹⁷ Simply put, if any non-use of force action could be taken to solve the problem, such action must be taken.¹¹⁸ Notably, this “necessity” is judged from the victim nation’s perspective.¹¹⁹ The rule also discusses proportionality.¹²⁰ Proportionality addresses how much force a victim nation may use in the defensive action. Factors such as scale, scope, duration, and intensity play a role in this determination.¹²¹ Importantly, this proportionality test does not require a victim nation to mirror the scale, scope, duration, and intensity of the offensive attack; but rather, the defensive action must be proportionate to the\n115 *Id.* at 58-59.\n116 *See id.* at 53-59.\n117 *Id.* at 59.\n118 *Id.* (“[This rule] merely requires that non-forceful measures be insufficient to address the situation.”).\n119 *Id.* at 60.\n120 *Id.*\n121 *Id.* (explaining that a kinetic attack could be used to respond to a cyber-attack and vice-versa).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nforce needed to successfully defend against the offensive attack.¹²² Moreover, the rule indicates that kinetic attacks may be used in defense of certain cyber-attacks, given that the kinetic attack is necessary and proportionate.¹²³ The rule concerning necessity and proportionality is of great importance when deciding how to properly respond to an offensive armed attack.¹²⁴\n## c. Rule 15: Imminence and Immediacy\nThe Manual takes a step beyond the UN Charter by detailing when a nation can preemptively defend itself and the general time frame allowed for a defensive attack.¹²⁵ Rule 15 specifically allows for preemptive defense actions if an armed attack from an enemy nation is imminent.¹²⁶ To be considered imminent, the need to defend must be “instant, overwhelming, [and] leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.”¹²⁷ Interestingly, the experts involved in writing\n¹²² *Id.* (indicating that the defensive attack is judged on “the level of force needed to successfully mount a defense . . . more force may be necessary, or less force may be sufficient [ ] to repel the attack or defeat one that is imminent”).\n¹²³ *Id.*\n¹²⁴ *See id.* at 59-60.\n¹²⁵ *See id.* at 60-63.\n¹²⁶ *Id.* at 60.

Rule 16: Collective Self-Defense\nThe Manual allows a third party nation to assist a victim nation, but only if the victim nation requests such assistance.¹³² More than one third of a party nation can help a victim nation, but in any situation involving collective self-defense, both the\n¹²⁸ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 61 (noting that this standard was not universally agreed to).\n¹²⁹ Id. at 62.\n¹³⁰ Id. at 63.\n¹³¹ See id. at 60-64.\n¹³² Id. at 63.\n279\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nassisting and victim nations must determine that the offensive act qualifies as an armed attack or imminent armed attack.¹³³ Moreover, the assisting nation must still follow the rules of necessity, proportionality, imminence, and immediacy.¹³⁴ Notably, an assisting nation can only aid to the extent that the victim nation condones. For example, if the victim state only wants to respond via a cyber action, the assisting nation cannot use kinetic weapons—even if the use of such weapons would be allowed under the rules of the Manual.¹³⁵ The Manual also recognizes certain *ad hoc* agreements as constituting consent of the victim state, i.e. NATO agreements. Essentially, collective self-defense follows the same rules discussed above yet also contains additional rules to protect the victim state from losing control over the defensive response.¹³⁶\n## 5. SUMMARY OF THE TALLINN MANUAL\nAs valuable and progressive as the Manual might be, it still suffers from not being binding on any nation, therefore, functioning only as “a product of a group of independent experts acting solely in their personal capacity.”¹³⁷ Nevertheless,\n¹³³ *Id.*\n¹³⁴ *Id.* at 64.\n¹³⁵ *Id.* at 63.\n¹³⁶ *See id.* at 59-64.\n¹³⁷ *Id.* at 23.\nVolume XVIII 2014 280\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nthe Manual provides a solid basis for possible future codifications regarding the international laws of cyber-warfare. By formulating an authority that applies the UN Charter and many other recognized international principles of law to a cyber-warfare setting, the Manual has greatly advanced the understanding of how the international laws of war will apply to cyber-warfare.\n## C. United States’ Strategies and Approaches\nWhile the United States has not created an official policy in the same light or depth as the Tallinn Manual, President Obama has signed several executive orders and presidential policy directives that discuss how the United States needs to better protect itself, specifically its critical infrastructure, from the possibility of cyber-attacks.¹³⁸ These orders and directives, however, solely discuss how the United States can better protect itself via improved communications and updated cyber-security tactics. They gloss over how the United States would and could respond to a cyber-attack—specifically an attack that could lead to cyber-warfare.¹³⁹ The most relevant and\n¹³⁸ See e.g., Exec.

HAROLD KOH’S SPEECH AT THE UNITED STATES CYBER COMMAND CONFERENCE\nThe timing of Koh’s speech was impeccable and purposeful as it was given a mere three weeks after the non-official release of the Tallinn Manual—providing a strong indication that the speech was a direct response to the ideas and policies within the Manual.¹⁴¹ Much like the Manual, Koh acknowledged that international principles of law should apply to cyber-warfare and emphasized that the cyber world is anything but law-free.¹⁴² Moreover, Koh applied the “use of force” test of the UN Charter article 2(4) and gave a number of factors (like the Manual) including, “the context of the event, the actor perpetrating the action (recognizing challenging issues of attribution in cyberspace), the target and location, [and the]\n¹⁴⁰ Harold Honhgu Koh, Legal Advisor of the Dep’t of State, International Law in Cyberspace, Address to the USCYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference (Sept. 18, 2012), available at http://www.state.gov/s/l/releases/remarks/197924.htm [hereinafter Koh’s Speech] (noting that Koh has been an international lawyer for over thirty years, with the State Department for three and one half years, and is known as a premier legal-mind in the field).\n¹⁴¹ *Id.*\n¹⁴² *Id.*\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\neffects and intent,” to help determine if a cyber-attack crosses the threshold of use of force.¹⁴³ Koh also recognized that the United States may defend itself if the offensive attack reaches the extent of an armed attack under article 51 of the UN Charter, but in the same fashion as the Manual and UN Charter, the defense action must be proportionate, necessary, and distinct.¹⁴⁴ Notably, Koh emphasized that the United States, and any other nation for that matter, should ensure its cyber weapons are not “inherently indiscriminate,” preventing unnecessary and unpredictable damage.¹⁴⁵ Koh further recognized that cyber-warfare could bleed over borders into innocent third party countries, and most importantly, explained that any nation should be held responsible for the actions of a non-state actor that conducted a cyber-attack at the direction of such nation.¹⁴⁶\nAfter essentially reiterating the rules and policies of the UN Charter and Manual, Koh moved forward to the issues that arise when applying such rules and policies to cyber-warfare.¹⁴⁷ First, Koh addressed the issue of how to determine the scope and effect of a cyber-attack that does not cause the same type\n143 *Id.*; see U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4.\n144 Koh’s Speech; see U.N. Charter art. 51.\n145 Koh’s Speech.\n146 *Id.*\n147 *Id.*\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nof damage as a kinetic attack. Koh, however, left the question open and merely stated that the United States holds the right to defensively act against any attack that could be viewed as an armed attack under the UN Charter.¹⁴⁸ Koh next discussed the innate difficulties in analyzing an attack on a civilian target but, unfortunately, gave no solution—only raising the issue.¹⁴⁹ Lastly, Koh spoke to the issue of attribution, but like the previous two issues, he only mentioned the problem of attribution and never truly analyzed it.¹⁵⁰ Koh simply stated, “[n]ot all of the issues I’ve mentioned are susceptible to clear legal answers derived from existing precedents.”¹⁵¹ Essentially, Koh recognized these issues but gave no defined answers, simply leaving the issues to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.¹⁵²\nIn closing his speech, Koh explained that international humanitarian laws, i.e. the UN Charter, are not the only laws applying to cyber-warfare, recognizing that the cyber world is so interconnected that laws applying to human rights, criminal activity, and many others should also be applied to\n¹⁴⁸ See id. (noting that the United States would still have to follow the laws regarding a defensive response); U.N. Charter art. 51.\n¹⁴⁹ See Koh’s Speech.\n¹⁵⁰ Id.\n¹⁵¹ Id.\n¹⁵² See id.\nVolume XVIII 2014 284\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\ncyber-warfare.¹⁵³ Lastly, Koh emphasized the importance of understanding international laws in the cyber-warfare context and, equally, the ability to openly discuss the problems of applying such laws to cyber-warfare. Koh’s speech, while lacking some definite answers, was still educational on how the United States government views cyber-warfare in the same manner as the Manual and anticipates on applying the laws of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare in a similar fashion to the Manual.¹⁵⁴\n## V. Issues in Applying the International Laws of War to Cyber-Warfare\nEven as the legal field attempts to define cyber-warfare and apply internationally recognized laws of war to cyber-warfare, many issues still arise in the application of these laws. In this section, I will discuss several issues, including the differences in applying the terms “use of force” and “armed attack,” problems with the scale and effects test, the always troublesome issue of attribution, and the accumulation of such issues during an attack on a civilian target.\n¹⁵³ See id.\n¹⁵⁴ See id.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n## A. The Different Applications of Use of Force and Armed Attack\nThe problem of figuring out if a cyber-attack reached the level of a “use of force” and/or an “armed attack” is a genuine and difficult issue. While these thresholds create a basis for evaluating an attack, they are both vague and indecisive.¹⁵⁵ For example, the UN Charter does not even attempt to solve the issue of what “use of force” entails and applies the scale and effects test to only armed attacks, while the Manual—which Koh seems to side with—applies the scales and effects test to both.¹⁵⁶ The disparities in opinion continue beyond the differences in the application of the tests; the UN charter seems to imply a use of force or armed attack must occur through armed forces and/or cause physical damage to a nation’s military, while the Tallinn Manual and Koh would disagree.¹⁵⁷ Moreover, the scale and effects test has many of its own flaws\n---\n¹⁵⁵ See e.g., Waxman, *supra* note 54, at 44-46 (explaining the vagueness of use of force in the UN Charter); see TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-49 (Cambridge University Press 2013) (noting that the Manual had to use examples and factors to try and explain the usage of the definition for use of force and still admitted the definition is anything but foolproof).\n¹⁵⁶ See U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4, art. 51; TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-59; Koh’s Speech.\n¹⁵⁷ Waxman, *supra* note 53, at 44-46; TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 55.\nVolume XVIII 2014 286\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nas discussed in the next section.¹⁵⁸ The dissimilarities between the Manual, Koh’s speech, and the UN Charter alone cause a great amount of confusion and uncertainty. Significantly, and to reiterate, of the (potential) rules discussed, only the UN Charter is binding; thus, its interpretation has the most significance and, seemingly, the only relevance at the current time. In short, the lack of cohesiveness and uniformity between the UN Charter and Manual only creates greater confusion in an already perplexed field.\n## B. Issues with the Scale and Effects Test\nThe scale and effects test used in the UN Charter, Tallinn Manual, and Koh’s speech faces some major challenges in the cyber-warfare context, including unpredictability, reversible effects, and differentiating effects.¹⁵⁹ Regarding unpredictability, programmers can fall victim to coding error, or cyber-security defenses that cause the programmer to adjust the attack on the fly, thus triggering unknown effects.¹⁶⁰ Consequently, the attack could either collapse or reach new levels of destruction.¹⁶¹ This unpredictability could have effects on intent, especially if the attack was never meant to reach the threshold of “use of force”\n158 See supra Part.V.B.\n159 See Nguyen, supra note 14, at 1100-1124.\n160 See id. at 1100.\n161 See id.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nand/or an “armed attack.”¹⁶² Notably, the UN Charter takes intent in account when determining whether an attack breached the thresholds for either use of force or an armed attack, whereas the Manual *does not* base its analysis on intention whatsoever—solely analyzing the scale and effects of the attack.¹⁶³ Thus, the unpredictability of cyber-attacks affects the scale and effects test differently depending on whether the UN Charter or Manual is being applied. From another perspective, a nation’s cyber-security defenses could interact with an attack in unforeseen ways, causing a chain reaction that overwhelms or shuts down a network. In this scenario, is the attacker blamed for scale and effects of the shutdown, or is the victim nation’s faulty defenses to blame? The unpredictability of cyber-attacks will continuously cause problems in applying the scale and effects test.\nThe ability of cyber-attacks to cause reversible damages as well as delayed or prolonged damages also raises concerns.¹⁶⁴ Presumably, if the effects were reversible, the scale and effects of an attack would be greatly diminished—even if such an\n¹⁶² *See id.* at 1103-04.\n¹⁶³ *See supra* Part.IV.B.4.a.\n¹⁶⁴ *See* Martin Libiki, *Pulling Punches in Cyberspace*, *PROCEEDINGS OF A WORKSHOP ON DETERRING CYBERATTACKS: INFORMING STRATEGIES AND DEVELOPING OPTIONS FOR U.S. POLICY* 123, 124-129 (2010).\nVolume XVIII 2014 288\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nattack had immense effects in the short term.¹⁶⁵ Nevertheless, the essential factor would be the immediate scale and effects, and thus, if the immediate scale and effects constituted a use of force or armed attack, then a victim nation could take the prescribed measures under the applicable laws of war. Alternatively, how can the laws of war apply to a cyber-attack that affects two countries differently?¹⁶⁶ For example, what if a cyber-attack caused minimal damage to a more advanced country and significant damage to a less advanced country? Could only the less advanced country respond to the attack? The answer to this question, is likely that only the less advanced country could respond. While this answer adheres to the international laws of war, it seems rather illogical that the exact same attack could lead to such different defensive responses.¹⁶⁷ Even though the scales and effects test has been widely acknowledge in the UN Charter, Manual, and Koh’s speech, the test is anything but flawless.\n## C. Issues of Attribution\nThe issue of attribution may be the most troublesome of the many issues that arise in applying the international laws\n¹⁶⁵ See id.\n¹⁶⁶ See Nguyen, supra note 14, at 1124.\n¹⁶⁷ See id. at 1124-25.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nof war to cyber-warfare. Unlike traditional warfare when it is relatively simple to discover who launched an attack against a nation, a cyber-attack can be nearly impossible to attribute to a particular nation, especially if a non-state actor is working at the direction of a nation.¹⁶⁸ Such is true because the cyber world offers so many options for anonymity and hiding attacks behind other networks.¹⁶⁹ People experienced within the cyber world can easily forge or conceal their identity, especially if motivated to hide an illegal attack.¹⁷⁰ Moreover, even if a nation is identified, such nation can easily deny that the attack derived from their networks—instead claiming that they were hacked.¹⁷¹ Even more troublesome, if a non-state actor is identified as the originator of an attack, an accused nation could deny any nexus with the attacking non-state actor. The numerous loopholes involved with attributing an attack to a particular nation presents some serious problems in applying the international laws of war to cyber-warfare.\n---\n¹⁶⁸ *See e.g.,* Broad, Markoff &amp; Sanger, *supra* note 6 (explaining that no one is still one hundred percent certain where Stuxnet derived from)\n¹⁶⁹ *See* Nguyen, *supra* note 14, at 1104-05.\n¹⁷⁰ *See id.* at 1104-06.\n¹⁷¹ *See id.*\n*Volume XVIII 2014*                                                                 290\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\n## D. Applying the UN Charter and Tallinn Manual to an Attack on a Civilian Target\nIn this section, I will pose a couple of hypothetical situations to explain how a nation, specifically the United States, should respond to a cyber-attack that may or may not qualify as an act of cyber-warfare according to the UN Charter and the Manual—given Koh essentially adheres to the Manual. The two hypothetical situations involve (1) an attack on a civilian target that has some military aspects and (2) an attack on a purely civilian target. Notably, I will assume these attacks can be accurately attributed to the originator of the attack—a non-state actor directed by such state.\nSignificantly, this assumption would require the attack to affect the United States’ military to be considered having military characteristics. The issue of attribution is of such concern that the following examples could not be analyzed without making this assumption.\n### 1. ATTACK ON A CIVILIAN TARGET WITH MILITARY ASPECTS\nThe following fact pattern will present an opportunity to analyze an attack on a civilian target with military aspects: A foreign country attacks Boeing—a civilian aerospace company that, among many other things, helps the United States Military\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nresearch, test, and maintain aerospace technologies—via a cyber invasion that both steals and destroys both civilian and military related information.\nBefore moving forward and analyzing this attack under both the UN Charter and Manual, it is important to distinguish the espionage portion of the attack (the stealing) from the attacking portion of the attack (the destruction) because neither the UN Charter nor the Manual were created to analyze mere acts of espionage; but rather, they were created to analyze actual attacks.¹⁷² And to reiterate, we are assuming this attack can be accurately attributed to a non-sate actor working for such foreign country.\nUnder the UN Charter, this “attack” might constitute a use of force but unlikely would be classified as an armed attack. Importantly, only the military information that was destroyed could be considered in this analysis because the UN Charter requires the attack to have some sort of military aspect, and in this hypothetical, the civilian information lacks any sort of military character.¹⁷³ The destruction of the military information from Boeing could result in a use of force or armed attack depending on what exactly was destroyed and, more\n¹⁷² See supra Parts IVA.1, IV.B.1.\n¹⁷³ See supra Part IV.A.2.\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nimportantly, the consequence of destroying such information. If the destroyed military information involved details regarding national security that generated the scale and effects equivalent of military force, then the United States could likely classify the attack as a use of force. Classifying the attack as an armed attack, however, would be far more difficult because there was no physical damage in the sense of the UN Charter.¹⁷⁴ The United States could argue the destruction of computer files constitutes physical damage because such damage equates that of a kinetic attack, but this argument would be weak in these circumstances because the attack had no effect on Boeing’s operations like a kinetic attack would. Notably, this same type of analysis would be used regardless of where the information was destroyed, even if from the Pentagon.¹⁷⁵ Essentially, the scale and effects of the attack determine what actions are or are not allowed under the UN Charter. In short, this example epitomizes the rigorousness of the UN Charter’s requirement of military force and physical damage, especially in terms of cyber-warfare.\nUnder the Manual, a country potentially could have\n¹⁷⁴ See supra Part IV.A.4.\n¹⁷⁵ See supra Part IV (noting that the location being the Pentagon would likely cause of the information destroyed to have military character).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nan easier time defining this attack as a use of force and/or an armed attack. Unlike the UN Charter’s requirement of military character, the Manual strictly analyses the scale and effects of an attack; therefore, both the civilian and military information that was destroyed must be analyzed. In doing so, the United State must use the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, state involvement, military character, and presumptive legality.¹⁷⁶ When applying these factors to this hypothetical, it seems the attack would constitute a use force because of the attack’s mild severity, high invasiveness, partial military character, attributable state involvement, and presumptive illegality. While the attack seems to be a use of force, the attack will not likely be considered an armed attack, especially given the high standard provided by the Manual—an armed attack is the *gravest* form of use of force.¹⁷⁷ Here, the attack seems significant but not in the same category of the *gravest* uses of force. Thus, the attack will likely constitute a use of force but not an armed attack.\nGiven that under both the UN Charter and Manual this attack is merely a use of force but not an armed attack, the\n¹⁷⁶ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 51-52. (Cambridge University Press 2013).\n¹⁷⁷ See id. at 48.\nVolume XVIII 2014 294\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nUnited States would not be able to defensively respond via article 51 or rule 13.¹⁷⁸ Thus, the United States would have to respond by finding out why the foreign nation wanted to destroy such information and, moreover, the United States might have to destroy the information that was stolen.¹⁷⁹ Moreover, the United States could put political and economic pressure on the foreign country committing this illegal use of force.¹⁸⁰ The UN Charter also would provide the United States with the ability to request the UN’s assistance in properly responding to the attack.¹⁸¹ Alternatively, under the Manual, the United States could choose to take preemptive action via rule 15 in fear of the scale and effects of the destroyed information. Notably, the United States would have to show the immediacy and imminence of the foreign nation’s possible armed attack.¹⁸² Showing this immediacy and imminence would require more facts, but the more liberal attitude of the Manual can be seen in both the analyses of the attack as well as the United States’ ability to respond to this kind of attack\nEssentially, the Manual provides a more liberal outlook\n¹⁷⁸ See supra Part IV (noting that if it determined an attack constitutes a use of force, the defensive response must be necessary and proportionate).\n¹⁷⁹ See id.\n¹⁸⁰ See id.\n¹⁸¹ See supra Part IV.A.3.\n¹⁸² See supra Part.IV.B.4.c.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\non attacks that do not directly and physically damage something or someone, even if there are certain military aspects involved in the attack. While both the UN Charter and the Manual could allow the United States to classify this attack as a use of force—especially given the partial military characteristic of the attack—the Manual more easily provides such a classification and could allow the United States to take more action regarding this attack. In short, this hypothetical provides an example of how the Manual is more adaptive and on-point with attacks that could lead to cyber-warfare.\n## 2. ATTACK ON A PURELY CIVILIAN TARGET\nThe following fact pattern will present an opportunity to analyze an attack on a purely civilian target: A foreign country attacks the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) that results in the market crashing and/or freezing for a period of time.\nUnder the UN Charter, this attack would not constitute a use of force or armed attack. Attacking a country’s economy, while devastating, lacks any sort of military characteristic; thus, the UN Charter’s requirement of military force would not be met.¹⁸³ The United States could attempt to argue that even though the attack lacked any military character, the attack\n¹⁸³ See supra Part IV.A.1.\nVolume XVIII 2014 296\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\naffected the military somehow. This argument, however, would not be nearly as persuasive in this hypothetical as compared the previous hypothetical because the effect would be quite attenuated. In short, the complete lack of any military force and, seemingly, military effects would prevent the United States from classifying this attack as a use of force or an armed attack under the UN Charter.\nOnce again, the Manual provides a more liberal analysis of the attack than the UN Charter. To reiterate, the Manual does not require an attack to be of military character to qualify as a use of force or an armed attack.[184] Thus, only the scale and effects of the attack on the NYSE need to be analyzed—using the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, military character, state involvement, and presumptive legality.[185] The attack would likely be determined as a use of force because of its extended and severe detrimental effects, presumptive illegality, attributable state involvement, and intense invasiveness; however, classifying the attack as an armed attack would be more difficult—given an armed attack is the gravest form of use of force.[186] Nevertheless, the\n184 See supra Part. IV.B.1.\n185 See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 49-52 (Cambridge University Press 2013).\n186 See id. (noting that the experts of the Manual were split as to whether\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nUnited States could point out the importance of the NYSE and the collapse’s grave effect beyond the economy. While this hypothetical presents a controversial and difficult question, I believe the United States would be able to classify this attack as a use of force and an armed attack given the extremely detrimental and lasting effects of crashing the NYSE. The United States would have to deeply analyze each of the factors explained in the Manual to ensure certain prerequisites are met, but the United States would be able to defensively respond via rule 13 to such an attack.¹⁸⁷ Subsequently, the United States would have to properly respond with a proportionate and necessary attack.¹⁸⁸ In sum, under the Manual, such an attack that completely crashes the NYSE would constitute a use of force, and more importantly, an armed attack resulting in the United States’s ability to act in self-defense.\n## 3. SUMMARY OF HYPOTHETICAL SITUATIONS\nWhile both hypothetical situations seem relatively open for interpretation, there is a major lesson to be learned from the application of the UN Charter, Manual, and in turn, Koh’s speech: cyber-warfare presents an unprecedented\nsuch an attack could constitute an armed attack).\n¹⁸⁷ See id. at 53-59.\n¹⁸⁸ See id. at 59-60.\n298\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\namount of uncertainty and vagueness in the context of the international laws of war. As seen, when the attack has certain military characteristics, the attack is much easier to define. Unfortunately, cyber-attacks need not and most likely will not be of strict military character, causing the UN Charter to seem obsolete in many situations. Thus, the liberal approach of the Manual functions more efficiently and accurately than that of the UN Charter in the cyber-warfare context. Effectively, each cyber-attack must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis, concentrating on how the scale and effects of the attack affect the government, military, and civilian population.\n## VI. Recommendation: A Possible Solution to the Issues in Applying the International Laws of War to Cyber-Warfare\nBecause cyber-warfare is a new and evolving medium for warfare, an international convention must occur, and in turn, create an internationally recognized cyber-warfare treaty. While the UN Charter provides a legitimate basis for such a treaty, the UN Charter seems obsolete to handle the intricacies involved in cyber-warfare.¹⁸⁹ The Manual, for the most part, is successful in applying the rules of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but fails at the most critical point: functioning as a binding\n¹⁸⁹ See supra Part.V.\nVolume XVIII 2014 299\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nauthority. Instead, it is merely functioning as “suggestions.”¹⁹⁰ Koh, who essentially agrees with the Manual, simply discussed the problems surrounding cyber-warfare, but no solutions whatsoever.¹⁹¹ Therefore, nations from around the world must come together and create binding rules for cyber-warfare before it is too late. In my opinion, the United States should address this problem now and be a leader in creating this treaty.\n## A. The Need for an International Convention, and in turn, an Internationally Recognized Cyber-Warfare Treaty\nWith the UN Charter and the Manual presenting valuable rules, exceptions to such rules, and recommendations involving all types of warfare—including cyber-warfare—the next step for regulating cyber-warfare is to create a binding international treaty focusing solely on cyber-warfare. For the effective creation of such a treaty, nations from around the world—not just experts in the field—will have to work together during an international convention, in a similar fashion as the creation of the UN Charter. During this convention, I believe the United States should take a progressive stance on this issue and become the world leader in regulating cyber-warfare.\n¹⁹⁰ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 16.\n¹⁹¹ See supra Part.IV.C.1.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nRegarding the details of this treaty, different aspects of both the UN Charter and Manual should be used, yet the treaty should also include further provisions. Overall, the treaty should follow the substance of the Manual as it does a remarkable job at applying the UN charter to a cyber-warfare setting. Nevertheless, certain decisions have to be made where the UN Charter and Manual disagree. For example, I believe the treaty should follow the Manual’s usage of the scale and effects test for both use of force and armed attack.¹⁹² However, there needs to be a definition or a sort of sliding scale to quantify the scale and effects of an attack—beyond listing an open set of factors.¹⁹³ Moreover, in accordance with the Manual, there should be no need for military character or death to constitute use of force or an armed attack.¹⁹⁴ While this standard might seem too liberal, the rules regarding self-defense will combat this liberalness by requiring the response to be proportionate and necessary—as both the Manual and UN Charter explain.¹⁹⁵ Notably, the use of examples within the Manual help clarify its rules, with each example explaining certain aspects of the\n¹⁹² See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-59.\n¹⁹³ See id. at 49-52.\n¹⁹⁴ See supra Parts IVA.1, IV.B.1.\n¹⁹⁵ See e.g., TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 59-60.\nVolume XVIII 2014 301\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nrule; therefore, given the positive affect of these examples, such examples should also be used in this cyber-warfare treaty.¹⁹⁶\nThese examples will allow readers to truly understand the rules and, more importantly, their applicability in the real world.\nFurthermore, each nation should be forced to present their case to the other members of the treaty before taking action, unless the defensive response is an absolute and immediate necessity.\nThis “meeting” will prevent a nation from applying the treaty in any way it sees fit, regardless of the treaty’s true meaning and the beliefs of other countries. Moreover, like the Manual, the treaty should include factor tests whenever answers will not be clear.¹⁹⁷ These factors will allow countries to apply the facts of an attack to numerous factors as opposed to the strict reading of rules. Unlike the Manual, however, one of these factors should involve intent because the intent of an attacking nation should be taken into account when determining whether a country has illegally used force or an armed attack.¹⁹⁸ Lastly, like the UN Charter, the treaty should include some rule or article that provides that members of the treaty shall ensure that non-\n¹⁹⁶ See e.g., id. at 55 (giving an example of an attack on a civilian target).\n¹⁹⁷ See e.g., id. at 49-52 (noting that this treaty should not be over-dependent on such factor tests).\n¹⁹⁸ See id. at 53-59 (noting that the Manual does not consider intent).\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nmembers still act in accordance with the treaty but only to the extent that is necessary to maintain international peace.¹⁹⁹ This provision would allow the treaty to have a worldwide affect, beyond the countries that signed. The treaty, effectively, will use the Manual’s application of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but bind of all member-nations to the treaty, much like the UN Charter did with United Nations members.\nIn short, some sort of binding action must occur to regulate cyber-warfare, and the United States should be at the forefront of this movement. In regulating cyber-warfare, the ideals and the binding effect of the UN Charter should be applied to cyber-warfare in a similar fashion as the Tallinn Manual. By taking action in this questionable area of law, the United States can ensure its safety now and into the future.\n## VII. Conclusion\nThe lack of regulations involving cyber-warfare is a growing and real threat. Cyber-warfare might be a confusing and seemingly futuristic concept, but countries from around the world need to address this lack of regulation sooner than\n¹⁹⁹ See e.g., U.N. Charter art. 2(6) (“The Organization shall ensure that states which are not Members of the United Nations act in accordance with these Principles so far as may be necessary for the maintenance of international peace and security.”).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nlater. While countries can attempt to apply the UN Charter to cyber-warfare situations, the UN Charter lacks the flexibility and modernization to properly handle the intricacies of cyber-attacks. The UN Charter is undoubtedly effective in handling kinetic warfare; however, it seems obsolete in the cyber-warfare context. Experts in the field recognized this issue and, in response, created the Tallinn Manual, which was effective in applying the UN Charter to cyber-warfare. Nevertheless, the Manual functions simply as a suggestion booklet and provides zero binding rules or regulations. Therefore, the United States needs to take the lead in regulating cyber-warfare. The United States needs to hold an international conference that will produce a binding treaty involving the regulations of cyber-warfare. This treaty should use the Manual’s concepts of applying the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but needs to go further in an attempt to leave as few questions unanswered as possible. While such a task will be difficult, the difficulties in creating a cyber-warfare treaty are minimal compared to the damage that will occur without such regulations.\nVolume XVIII 2014\n304",

Introduction: The Growing Concerns of Cyber-Warfare\nThe threat of cyber-warfare is a current and continuing issue that our nation must address. President Obama, the Department of Defense (DoD), and even the private sector comprehend this issue and have been attempting to update our defense strategies to better protect this nation. The following quotations explain how concerned authorities from all levels of the nation are with the threat of cyber-warfare:\nIt’s the great irony of our Information Age -- the very technologies that empower us to create and to build also empower those who would disrupt and destroy.

It is important to note, not all these warfare systems are created solely to attack—some are created for defense purposes. Nevertheless, cyber-warfare is a real and dangerous threat that has already affected many countries around the world. Given the tangible and mounting threat of cyber-warfare, the United States must continue to build on the already existing policies and strategies that currently exist.

What is Cyber-Warfare: Definitions and Conflicts\n### Therein\nBefore moving into an in-depth discussion regarding cyber-warfare, the possibility of a cyber-attack on a government or civilian target, and a cyber-attack’s relation to the international rules of war, a definition of cyber-warfare must be established. The definition’s importance is exemplified in the international law of war setting because an attack must be analyzed using the “use of force” and/or “armed attack” tests, which are further discussed later in this paper.\n See generally TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Cambridge University Press 2013) (explaining the use of force in terms of cyber-warfare); U.N. Charter art. 51 (explaining the amount force needed to respond to an armed attack).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n## A. Basic Definition of Cyber-Warfare\nThe most basic definition of cyber-warfare can be established by combining the terms “cyber” and “war.” Cyber is defined in an English dictionary as “of, relating to, or involving computers or computer networks.” War, as defined in a legal dictionary, is “[h]ostile conflict by means of armed forces, carried on between nations, states, or rulers, or sometimes between parties within the same nation or state.” Thus, cyber-warfare would be a hostile conflict via armed forces that involves computers or computer networks. The problem with this definition is that it requires “armed forces,” whereas cyber-warfare usually does not include actual armed forces invading or defending a country. To the contrary, cyber-warfare usually involves a conflict within computer systems, which were programmed by humans, but does not involve forces equipped with actual kinetic weapons.\n## B. Definition Based on the Object Being Attacked\nBeyond this basic attempt to define cyber-warfare,\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\ntwo other mainstream ideologies have defined cyber-warfare: object-based vs. medium-based. The object based definition concentrates on whether the object being attacked is “cyber” in nature. The U.S. National Research Council created such a definition in 2009 in an attempt to clarify cyber-warfare and cyber-attacks. The definition described a cyber-attack as “the use of deliberate actions—perhaps over an extended period of time—to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy adversary computer systems or networks or the information and/or programs resident in or transiting these systems or networks.” Other commentators have offered similar definitions, such as defining cyber-warfare as “actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation’s computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption.” The main problem with any object-based definition is that it is overly broad; that is, such definitions would include attacks on computers via kinetic weapons. For example, these definitions would define a\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nbombing of a server farm as a cyber-attack that could lead to cyber-warfare; however, the act of using a physical bomb seems far beyond the purview of a cyber-attack. Therefore, such object-based definitions of cyber-warfare, and in turn cyber-attacks, are too broad in nature.\nAlternatively, object-based definitions of cyber-warfare are equally too narrow. Because object-based definitions require the object being attacked to be cyber in nature, these definitions would exclude attacks from a computer network that affect non-computers. For example, the Stuxnet attacks involved a malicious worm that used computer networks to attack, but and actually affected Iran’s nuclear centrifuges. Thus, under the object-based definition of cyber-warfare, the Stuxnet attack would not have qualified as a cyber-attack or an act of cyber-warfare. In short, the object-based definition of cyber-warfare fails in numerous ways, being both overly broad and narrow.\n## C. Definition Based on the Medium Being Used to Attack\nThe medium-based definition concentrates on whether the object *used* in the attack is “cyber” in nature. Essentially, a medium-based definition of cyber-warfare focuses on the\nkinetic attacks have already been readily defined in a number of international treaties and laws of war).\n See Dennis Fisher &amp; Paul Roberts, *Spotlight Series: Stuxnet*, THREATPOST: THE KASPERSKY LAB SECURITY NEWS SERVICE.\nVolume XVIII 2014 254\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nmethod used in the attack rather than the target being attacked—much in the same way an aerial attack involves planes. The DoD seems to imply this type of understanding through its definition of cyberspace operations: “[t]he employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace.” Importantly, this definition highlights the medium used in the operation, which parallels the way a medium-based definition of cyber-warfare focuses on whether cyberspace is used during an attack. An example of a medium-based definition for cyber-warfare can be seen in the Cambridge Dictionary as “the activity of using the internet to attack a country’s computers in order to damage things such as communication and transport systems or water and electricity supplies.” Moreover, a medium-based definition works best with the international laws of war because these laws rely on concepts that revolve around the force exerted on a target as opposed to the type of target being\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nattacked. For the forgoing reasons, a medium-based definition should be used to define cyber-warfare. Thus, the definition of cyber-warfare should look similar, but not necessarily exactly like, the definition provided in the Cambridge Dictionary.\nFor example, a proper definition of cyber-warfare could be: hostile acts via cyberspace that damage or disturb a country’s infrastructure or related networks for a governmental or national security purpose.\n## III. Potential Types of Cyber-Attacks that Could Occur During Cyber-Warfare\nNow that a logical and adequate definition of cyber-warfare has been established, understanding the types of attacks a nation could experience becomes imperative to understanding how and if an attack could constitute an act of cyber-warfare. There are three main categories of cyber-attacks: syntactic, semantic, and hybrid attacks.\n### A. Syntactic Attacks\nSyntactic attacks are aimed at a computer’s operating\n See e.g., TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 48-49 (Cambridge University Press 2013) (explaining the use of force factors—severity, directness, measurability of effects, etc.); U.N. Charter art. 51 (implying the use of self-defense must be proportionate).\n See supra note 21.\n Susan W. Brenner &amp; Marc D. Goodman, In Defense of Cyberterrorism: An Argument for Anticipating Cyberattacks, 2022 U. ILL. J. L. TECH &amp; POL’Y 1, 27-42 (2002).\nVolume XVIII 2014 256\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nsystem and “modify the logic of the system in order to introduce delays or to make the system unpredictable.” There are two main types of syntactic attacks: penetration and denial of service (DoS) attacks.\n## 1. PENETRATION ATTACKS\nPenetration attacks, as the name indicates, penetrate a computer system or computer network and transport whatever the programmer wants to “drop” into the system/network. Examples of penetration attacks include the implantation of malware, viruses, Trojan horses, and worms. All these types of penetration attacks cause actual damage to the system/network in different ways. For example, worms replicate within the system but do not infect the host computer; nevertheless, the worm spreads throughout the entire system and eventually can cause the system to completely shut down. Viruses effect computer systems is a different way, creating codes that become active once a user opens the file, and subsequently, the\n\nvirus corrupts, destroys, or steals files. Any of these types of penetration attacks can lead to the destruction or alterations of a computer system, and in turn, can lead to physical or economic damage.\n## 2. DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS\nDenial of service (DoS) attacks disrupt a computer system or network by overloading the system/network, and thus, reduce its functionality. Essentially, a DoS attack can completely shut down a system/network by flooding the target with false requests for service, therefore causing the system to overload. When this happens, legitimate requests for service are blocked, and the actual purpose of the system is devastated. Importantly, for anonymity reasons, attackers will often use distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks. A DDoS attack has the same purpose as a DoS attack; however, the attacker uses other people’s computers in addition to their own, which makes tracing the source of the attack much more difficult. Both DoS\n *Id.*\n See e.g., *Fisher &amp; Roberts*, *supra* note 19 (explaining how the Stuxnet worm caused actual damage to Iranian nuclear program).\n JOSEPH MIGGA KIZZA, *COMPUTER NETWORK SECURITY AND CYBER ETHICS* 76 (2002).\n Mindi McDowell, *Understanding Denial-of-Service Attacks*, UNITED STATES COMPUTER EMERGENCY READINESS TEAM (Feb. 6, 2013), http://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-015.\n *Id.*\nVolume XVIII 2014 258\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nand DDoS attacks can harm a nation via physical or economic damages.\n## B. Semantic Attacks\nSemantic attacks do not attempt to shut down, steal information, or destroy a computer network/system; rather, they affect the accuracy of the network’s information. Essentially, “[a] system under semantic attack operates and will be perceived as operating correctly (otherwise the semantic attack is failure), but it will generate answers at variance with reality.” While such an attack seems petty, computer users tend to accept the information given to them, especially if such information derives from a government website. For example, if a semantic attack occurred to an important government website, such information could cause people ignore a legitimate threat or falsely perceive an innocent act as a legitimate attack. Such a semantic attack could cause people to unnecessarily bunker down or, alternatively, riot out of fear. Thus, such a semantic attack could have severe consequences\n See e.g., John Markoff, *Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks*, New York Times (Aug. 12, 2008), http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html?_r=0 (explaining that the Russian cyber-attack on Georgia consisted of a DoS attack).\n Brenner &amp; Goodman, *supra* note 24, at 31-32.\n See Antolin-Jenkins, *supra* note 28, at 140 (noting how gullible or ignorant many computer users are when reading information off the internet).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\non the population. As demonstrated above, semantic attacks can be as detrimental to a nation as syntactic attacks.\n## C. Hybrid Attacks\nHybrid attacks are exactly what the term seems to imply: a hybrid of syntactic and semantic cyber-attacks. Such attacks have the greatest likelihood of causing the most destruction because the attacker could actually destroy a certain computer system (and, in turn, whatever other infrastructure was affected) and then tell the people that something completely different happened—only furthering the confusion, distrust, and destruction.\n See id. at 140-41 (noting that such attacks could cause great civil unrest); Brenner &amp; Goodman, supra note 24 at 31-39.\n See Antolin-Jenkins, supra note 28, at 140.\n See id. For example,\nTerrorists can mount complex attacks by combining syntactic and semantic attacks. Imagine that terrorists target Boston, Atlanta, Miami, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles for an attack which begins with a syntactic assault on computer systems that stops the delivery of state public assistance. General public awareness of the attack will emerge gradually, as successive waves of frustrated welfare recipients file complaints with the appropriate agencies. Eventually, the realization will spread that the distribution of benefits had been deliberately shut down. Once it becomes clear that the funds are not coming, the terrorists can follow up with a semantic attack assigning responsibility for their efforts to carefully-selected right-wing groups whose views are known to carry at least the taint of racial bias. If the terrorists manage to sustain the welfare gridlock, the freezing of the resources upon which thousands depend for their survival will produce civil disobedience and localized chaos. National Guardsmen might have to be sent into these cities to maintain\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nWith an understanding of the definition of cyber-warfare and the types of cyber-attacks that could occur during cyber-warfare, we must move forward to the international laws of war that apply to any sort of attack, whether kinetic or cyber.\n## IV. International Laws of War: An Application to Cyber-Warfare\nIn this section, I will explain the major components of the international laws of war in the cyber-warfare context. First, I will briefly explain the United Nations Charter (UN Charter) and how it applies to cyber-warfare. Subsequently, I will discuss the creation and purpose of the Tallinn Manual (the Manual). And lastly, I will explain the United States’ approach and strategies to handing the possibility of cyber-warfare. Each of these components is essential in understanding how to properly respond to an act of warfare, specifically cyber-\norder. To make things even more interesting, the terrorists can then direct a syntactic attack at ATM and banking system computers in these cities. Such a shutdown will add to the problem by causing outrage among citizens who do not depend on welfare funds. The cumulative effects of all these efforts will be riots, targeted violence and a National Guard stretched to its limit (which will create an excellent opportunity for the terrorists to stage a CBERN attack in other areas of the country).\nBrenner &amp; Goodman, supra note 24, at 39-40.\n\nwarfare.\n## A. The United Nations Charter\nThe UN Charter functions as the backbone to the current international laws of war. It sets forth many rules and guidelines that apply to war; including starting a conflict, responding to an attack, and how the UN should respond to an attack on a member nation. Understanding the UN Charter is crucial to understanding the later developments that deal specifically with cyber-warfare.\n## 1. GENERAL BACKGROUND\nThe UN Charter was created to “save succeeding generations from the scourge of war . . . to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights . . . to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other resources of international law . . . and to promote social progress.” Moreover, the overarching goals of the UN Charter were to allow countries to live tolerantly and in peace, to strengthen international peace and security, to ensure that armed forces are a last resort, and to promote\n See History of the United Nations, http://www.un.org/en/aboutun/history/charter_history.shtml (last visited Oct. 30, 2013).\n See generally U.N. Charter arts. 2, 4, 42, 51 (explaining the rules regarding starting a conflict, responding to an attack, and assisting an ally who has been attacked).\n Id. pmbl.\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nsocial and economic advancement for all people. Notably, the United States is a member of United Nations along with many other world powers, including Russia, China, and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, the UN Charter is binding upon the United States under Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution. As discussed below, the UN Charter successfully created rules that allow for a far more humane world, even in the face of war, but unfortunately, these rules may be obsolete in terms of cyber-warfare.\n## 2. ARTICLE 2(4): PROHIBITING THE THREAT OR USE OF FORCE\nArticle 2, paragraph 4 of the UN Charter provides a quintessential rule: “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.” Essentially, this rule prohibits a country from threatening or using “force” on another country, provided\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nthe exception of self-defense discussed later in this section. Unfortunately, however, the term “threat or use of force” is never defined in the UN Charter, causing unrest and numerous debates. Nevertheless, academics over the years have determined that this term involves only the uses or threat of *military* forces or attacks affecting the victim nation’s *military*, precluding economic and political coercion. Notably, the UN Charter also specifically precludes espionage.\nThis rule is important in the cyber-warfare context because article 4(2) would prevent a victim country from attacking the aggressor country that committed the cyber-attack. Thus, a country who falls victim to an act of cyber-warfare may not retaliate unless such an attack falls within the self-defense exception of article 51 via qualifying as an armed attack. The vagueness concerning the meaning of “use of force” presents an issue in the cyber-warfare context because at what point does a cyber-attack qualify as a use of *military* force?\n *Id.* art. 51.\n See generally *id.* arts. 2, 4, 41, 42, 51 (noting that there is no definition section or individual definition for “threat or use of force”).\n See e.g., MATTHEW C. WAXMAN, *Cyber Attacks as “Force” under UN Charter Article 2(4)*, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE CHANGING CHARACTER OF WAR 43 (Raul A. “Pete” Pedorzo et al. eds. 2011).\n See *id.*\n See U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4; WAXMAN, *supra* note 54, at 44-45.\n See U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4; WAXMAN, *supra* note 54, at 44-45.\nVolume XVIII 2014 264\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\n## 3. ARTICLES 41 AND 42\nArticles 41 and 42 of the UN Charter provide directions for how the UN can support a country that is being attacked. Article 41 focuses on a way to counter an attack that does not mount to a “use of force,” whereas article 42 provides the UN the power to use force to counter such an attack, but only if it is determined that the attack qualified as a “use of force” and article 41 remedies would be inadequate. Article 41’s non-forceful remedies would include economic blockades and political pressure. While these two articles do not analyze whether a country can defend itself, they do provide structure and direction for how UN members should respond to an attack on their own country or on an ally. Primarily, articles 41 and 42 allow the UN to analyze the extent of the attack—whether there was a use of force—and, subsequently, allow the UN to\n See U.N. Charter arts. 41, 42.\n See id. Article 41 states “The Security Council may decide what measures not involving the use of armed force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and it may call upon the Members of the United Nations to apply such measures. These may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations. Id. art 41. If the UN decides that article 41 relief would be insufficient, it may “take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security. Such action may include demonstrations, blockade, and other operations by air, sea, or land forces of Members of the United Nations.” Id. art. 42.\n See id. art. 41.\n See id. arts. 41, 42.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\ndecide to either use non-forceful or forceful remedies. While the substance of articles 41 and 42 are important, the most essential aspect of these articles is their purpose—to prevent forceful responses to an attack unless absolutely necessary to maintain international security and peace.\nIn discussing cyber-warfare, the most important aspect of articles 41 and 42 is their purpose as discussed directly above. Thus, unless there is a clear use of force during a cyber-attack, it seems the United States or any other member of the UN could only respond via a non-forceful response—i.e., an economic blockade or political pressures.\n## 4. ARTICLE 51\nArticle 51 of the UN Charter provides the exception to general rule of article 2(4), which prohibits the use of force against other nations. Article 51 states:\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately\n See id.\n See id.\n See id. pmbl, arts. 41, 42.\n See id. arts. 41, 42.\nVolume XVIII 2014 266\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nreported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.\nWhile Article 51 expressly creates an exception for the use of force in self-defense, some issues arise in the cyber-warfare context, especially when looking at the specific wording. Much like the issue with our basic definition of cyber-warfare, article 51 allows a nation to defend itself only if the attack amounts to an “armed attack,” which a cyber-attack would never seem to qualify as. Nevertheless, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) adjusted the definition of an armed attack by defining it more broadly and explaining that armed attacks “do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.” Thus, the term armed attack actually functions more as an expansion to “use of force” as opposed to an attack with actual kinetic weapons.\nMoreover, the ICJ decided in *Nicaragua v. United States* that\n *Id.* art. 51. (emphasis added).\n *See id.*\n *See supra* Part II.A.; U.N. Charter art. 51.\n International Court of Justice, *The legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* (Jul. 8, 1996), http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?sum=498&amp;code=unan&amp;p1=3&amp;p2=4&amp;case=95&amp;k=e1&amp;p3=5.\n *See id.*\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nthe “scale and effects” of an attack are the determining factors of whether such action constitutes an armed attack, not the inclusion of kinetic weapons. Therefore, a cyber-attack could qualify as an armed attack if its scale and effects reached a level equivalent to that of an attack with kinetic weapons. Given the working definition of armed attack, article 51 will play a role in the way and extent the United States responds to a cyber-attack.\nThe UN Charter’s importance is unparalleled in determining whether or not a nation has been the victim of force, whether such country can legally retaliate via self-defense, and what actions the UN can take in support of the victim country. While the UN Charter is of great help in determining all of the aforementioned questions, many issues still arise when trying to apply the UN Charter to cyber-warfare.\n## B.

Before delving into the background and specifics of the Manual, one must understand that the Manual is not binding on any nation.\n## 1. GENERAL BACKGROUND\nThe Manual, which was published in 2013, was put together by an international group of approximately twenty-five experts from 2009 to 2012. These experts met in Tallinn, Estonia, which in turn, helped produce the name of the Manual. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), specifically NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, invited these experts to put together the rules of cyber-warfare into a single document. The Manual was put together in response to the growing fear of cyber-warfare and, more specifically, the lack of well-defined rules regulating cyber-warfare. Notably, the Manual only discusses the laws\n See id.\n Id. (explaining the Manual is a “non-binding document applying existing law to cyber-warfare”).\n Id. at 16-17, 22 (noting these experts included legal practitioners, technical experts, and academics).\n Id. at 22.\n Id.\n Id. at 17-18 (explaining the Manual was created “in hope of bringing some degree of clarity to the complex legal issues surrounding cyber operations, with particular attention paid to those involving the jus ad bellum and the jus\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nof cyber-warfare, thus excluding cyber-espionage (to the extent espionage does not involve “use of force”) and cyber-crimes. To reiterate, “it is essential to understand that the Tallinn Manual is not an official document” and, thus, is not binding on any nation.\n## 2. RULES 11 AND 12: DEFINITIONS OF FORCE AND THREAT OF FORCE\nImportantly, and unlike the UN Charter, the Manual actually defines both the crucial terms “use of force” and “threat of force.” Starting with these definitions will allow for a better understanding of the Manual, even though these definitions come after some important rules within the Manual.\n### a. Rule 11: Definition of Use of Force\nThe Manual directly refers back to Nicaragua v. United States when determining what actions constitute a use of in bello”).\n *Id.* at 18.\n *Id.* at 23. Nevertheless, the Manual could function in a similar way to the Lieber Code—an aspirational attempt to regulate warfare during the civil war—in that the Lieber Code eventually “became a core text in the modern laws of war recognized worldwide, and many elements of his code continue to inform our public debate how best to respond to a new form of warfare in both an effective and a moral manner.” Nick Beard, *The Liber Codes*, *THE NEW YORK TIMES: THE OPINION PAGES* (Apr. 24, 2013, 12:59 PM), http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/the-lieber-codes/?_r=0.\n *TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE* 47-53.\n *Id.* at 45, 47-53 (noting that the Prohibition of Threat or Use of Force, Rule 10, comes before the definitions of “use of force” and “threat of force”).\nVolume XVIII 2014 270\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nforce—applying the “scale and effects” test. While the scale and effects test is not black and white, it provides a nation with a decent idea of what constitutes a use of force. The Manual, however, does create some black and white rules. For example, the Manual unequivocally states that “[a]cts that injure or kill persons or damage or destroy objects are unambiguously uses of force.” Notably, like the UN Charter, the Manual excludes economic and political coercion from qualifying as use of force. The Manual, moreover, explicitly rejects the notion that a non-destructive cyber-attack that is intended solely to undermine the confidence in a government would qualify as a use of force. As the Manual progresses through the definition of use of force, it designates eight factors that are supposed to help a nation determine whether a non-obvious act qualifies as a use of force—essentially adding factors to the scale and effects test. The list of factors includes the following: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects,\n See id. at 47; Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. United States), 1986 I.C.J. 14, 103-04 (June 27).\n Id.\n See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 49.\n Id.\n See id. at 48.\n Id. (stating that “merely funding a hacktivist group conducting cyber operations as part of an insurgency would not be a use of force”).\n Id. at 49-52.\n\nmilitary character, state involvement, and presumptive legality. This definition of use of force, while not black and white, should greatly help nations determine what constitutes a use of force in the cyber-warfare setting.\n## b. Rule 12: Definition of Threat of Force\nRule 12 of the Manual breaks down the functional meaning of “threat of force” in the cyber-warfare context. Importantly, the rule explains that a threat could occur in two situations: (1) “a cyber operation that is used to communicate a threat to use force” and (2) “a threat carried out by any means . . . to carry out cyber operations qualifying as use of force.” The rule further notes that a demand need not accompany the threat to qualify as such under this rule; however, actions alone that seem threatening do not qualify as a threat because a threat must be “communicative in nature.” The rule also states that a threat of force could technically derive form a nation that seems unequipped to follow through will such a threat; nonetheless, it’s the threat that matters. Interestingly, the rule explains that\n *Id.* (explaining out that the list of factors is not exhaustive and functions only as a starting point).\n *Id.* at 52-53.\n *Id.* at 52.\n *Id.* at 53 (explaining that developing technology that could be used in an act that qualifies as a use of force *does not* qualify as a threat of force).\n *Id.* (noting the experts were split with this portion of the rule).\nVolume XVIII 2014 272\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\na nation will not be considered to have actually made a threat of force, even if that nation makes such a threat and has the capability of following through with such threat, as long as that nation does not truly intend on attacking—essentially requiring actual intent. Much like the definition of use of force, this definition lacks perfect clarity and contains many intricacies, but should be of great help in determining what actually constitutes a threat of force.\n## 3. RULE 10: PROHIBITION OF THREAT OR USE OF FORCE\nRule 10 of the Manual parallels article 2(4) of the UN Charter by making “[a] cyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force . . . unlawful.” The commentary following Rule 10 clarifies that the “use of force” does not need to be committed by a country’s armed forces; rather, the force could derive from an intelligence agency or any private contractor of the nation. Rule 10 also discusses a nation “intervening” in another nation’s affairs—political, economic, social, cultural, or otherwise. The rule explains that it is unlawful for another nation to intervene but goes on to explain that the term\n *Id.* (noting, once again, that the experts were split with this portion of the rule).\n *See id.* at 45 (Cambridge University Press 2013); U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4 (noting that both prohibit the threat or use of force).\n *TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE* 46.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n\"intervene\" does have the same meaning as in a layman context; instead, intervention in the cyber-war context, as well as for the UN Charter, must involve coercion. The rule further explains that an unlawful act of intervention does not per se qualify as a use of force; the intervention still must breach the threshold for use of force independently. Thus, when determining whether an intervention is unlawful, a nation must ascertain if coercion is involved, and moreover, must decide if the intervention reached the level of use of force. Fundamentally, Rule 10 applies article 2(4) of the UN Charter to the cyber-warfare setting.\n## 4. RULES 13, 14, 15 AND 16: THE RIGHT AND REGULATIONS FOR SELF-DEFENSE AND COLLECTIVE SELF-DEFENSE\nRules 13, 14, 15, and 16 of the Manual all explain the ability of a victim nation to launch a defensive response—in a parallel manner to article 51 of the UN Charter. Rule 13 discusses an individual nation’s right to protect itself; rule 14 examines how an act of self-defense must be necessary and proportionate to the original attack; rule 15 delves into\n *Id.* at 47 (“intervention pure and simple is not intervention [in the UN Charter or Tallinn Manual context]”).\n *Id.* at 46.\n *Id.* at 46-47; see UN Charter art. 51.\n See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 53-64.\nVolume XVIII 2014 274\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nthe ability of a nation to preemptively strike in an act of self-defense; and rule 16 examines the possibility of collective self-defense, that is a third party nation(s) coming to the aid of a victim nation. These rules are essential to the completeness of the Manual, especially in the Manual’s attempt to mimic article 51 of the UN Charter.\n## a. Rule 13: Self-Defense Against Armed Attack\nRule 13 of the Manual allows a nation to exercise the right of self-defense, given that such nation faced an attack—cyber or kinetic—that qualified as an armed attack. The term “armed attack” is quantified by the scale and effects of the attack, much like the use of force threshold in rule 11, but has an even heightened threshold beyond use of force. Plainly, an armed attack is the “gravest” form of a use of force. Unfortunately, however, the Manual never defines what the exact threshold is for the scale and effects test—only causing confusion. The scale and effects of an attack, though, must\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nbe reasonably foreseeable. Therefore, an attack that causes grave damage far beyond any reasonable foresight would not constitute an armed attack. Notably, an armed attack must have a trans-border component; thus, a purely domestic attack can never qualify as an armed attack within the Manual’s framework. The rule further explains that an armed attack can originate from a state or a non-state actor who is directed by the state to take such actions. Additionally, the rule states that individual attacks that alone do not qualify as armed attacks can be classified as armed attacks if that single attack is just one in a series of attacks. Accordingly, aggregated non-armed attacks can elevate and cross the threshold of an armed attack. The comments for rule 13 continue in detail about the irrelevance of intentions, the ability of a third party nation to defend itself if the scale and effects of the attack bleed over borders, and the ability of a victim nation to retaliate against persons who are located in an innocent third party nation—so as long the victim nation has permission to do so or the innocent third party nation\napplied on a case-by-case basis).\n *Id.* at 56.\n *Id.* at 54.\n *Id.* at 54-58 (detailing the intricacies and problems with attributing a non-state actor’s actions to a state).\n *Id.* at 55 (explaining that there must be convincing evidence that the multiple attacks are related).\nVolume XVIII 2014 276\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nis unable to take action. In short, a nation has the right to defend itself if attacked by another nation via an armed attack as determined by the scale and effects test.\n## b. Rule 14: Necessity and Proportionality\nEven if it is determined that a nation has the right to defend itself—either via kinetic or cyber action—that nation’s defensive response must be necessary and proportionate. Simply put, if any non-use of force action could be taken to solve the problem, such action must be taken. Notably, this “necessity” is judged from the victim nation’s perspective. The rule also discusses proportionality. Proportionality addresses how much force a victim nation may use in the defensive action. Factors such as scale, scope, duration, and intensity play a role in this determination. Importantly, this proportionality test does not require a victim nation to mirror the scale, scope, duration, and intensity of the offensive attack; but rather, the defensive action must be proportionate to the\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nforce needed to successfully defend against the offensive attack. Moreover, the rule indicates that kinetic attacks may be used in defense of certain cyber-attacks, given that the kinetic attack is necessary and proportionate. The rule concerning necessity and proportionality is of great importance when deciding how to properly respond to an offensive armed attack.\n## c. Rule 15: Imminence and Immediacy\nThe Manual takes a step beyond the UN Charter by detailing when a nation can preemptively defend itself and the general time frame allowed for a defensive attack. Rule 15 specifically allows for preemptive defense actions if an armed attack from an enemy nation is imminent. To be considered imminent, the need to defend must be “instant, overwhelming, [and] leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.” Interestingly, the experts involved in writing\n *Id.* (indicating that the defensive attack is judged on “the level of force needed to successfully mount a defense . . . more force may be necessary, or less force may be sufficient [ ] to repel the attack or defeat one that is imminent”).\n *Id.*\n *See id.* at 59-60.\n *See id.* at 60-63.\n *Id.* at 60.

Regarding the immediacy of the defensive response, factors such as the period necessary to identify the attacker, the temporal proximity between the attack and response, and the time required to prepare a response are considered. Additionally, the rule discusses the length of time allowed for continuous defensive responses, stating that the victim nation “must reasonably conclude that that further cyber operations are likely to follow,” or else such nation could be liable for the continuing defensive responses. Therefore, a nation must be cautious in preemptively attacking an enemy nation, attacking the enemy nation at a too attenuated period of time, or attacking the enemy nation for too long a period of time.\n## d. Rule 16: Collective Self-Defense\nThe Manual allows a third party nation to assist a victim nation, but only if the victim nation requests such assistance.

Moreover, the assisting nation must still follow the rules of necessity, proportionality, imminence, and immediacy. Notably, an assisting nation can only aid to the extent that the victim nation condones. For example, if the victim state only wants to respond via a cyber action, the assisting nation cannot use kinetic weapons—even if the use of such weapons would be allowed under the rules of the Manual. The Manual also recognizes certain *ad hoc* agreements as constituting consent of the victim state, i.e. NATO agreements. Essentially, collective self-defense follows the same rules discussed above yet also contains additional rules to protect the victim state from losing control over the defensive response.\n## 5. SUMMARY OF THE TALLINN MANUAL\nAs valuable and progressive as the Manual might be, it still suffers from not being binding on any nation, therefore, functioning only as “a product of a group of independent experts acting solely in their personal capacity.” Nevertheless,\n *Id.*\n *Id.* at 64.\n *Id.* at 63.\n *See id.* at 59-64.\n *Id.* at 23.\nVolume XVIII 2014 280\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nthe Manual provides a solid basis for possible future codifications regarding the international laws of cyber-warfare. By formulating an authority that applies the UN Charter and many other recognized international principles of law to a cyber-warfare setting, the Manual has greatly advanced the understanding of how the international laws of war will apply to cyber-warfare.\n## C. United States’ Strategies and Approaches\nWhile the United States has not created an official policy in the same light or depth as the Tallinn Manual, President Obama has signed several executive orders and presidential policy directives that discuss how the United States needs to better protect itself, specifically its critical infrastructure, from the possibility of cyber-attacks. These orders and directives, however, solely discuss how the United States can better protect itself via improved communications and updated cyber-security tactics. They gloss over how the United States would and could respond to a cyber-attack—specifically an attack that could lead to cyber-warfare. The most relevant and\n See e.g., Exec.

HAROLD KOH’S SPEECH AT THE UNITED STATES CYBER COMMAND CONFERENCE\nThe timing of Koh’s speech was impeccable and purposeful as it was given a mere three weeks after the non-official release of the Tallinn Manual—providing a strong indication that the speech was a direct response to the ideas and policies within the Manual. Much like the Manual, Koh acknowledged that international principles of law should apply to cyber-warfare and emphasized that the cyber world is anything but law-free. Moreover, Koh applied the “use of force” test of the UN Charter article 2(4) and gave a number of factors (like the Manual) including, “the context of the event, the actor perpetrating the action (recognizing challenging issues of attribution in cyberspace), the target and location, [and the]\n Harold Honhgu Koh, Legal Advisor of the Dep’t of State, International Law in Cyberspace, Address to the USCYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference (Sept. 18, 2012), available at http://www.state.gov/s/l/releases/remarks/197924.htm [hereinafter Koh’s Speech] (noting that Koh has been an international lawyer for over thirty years, with the State Department for three and one half years, and is known as a premier legal-mind in the field).\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\neffects and intent,” to help determine if a cyber-attack crosses the threshold of use of force. Koh also recognized that the United States may defend itself if the offensive attack reaches the extent of an armed attack under article 51 of the UN Charter, but in the same fashion as the Manual and UN Charter, the defense action must be proportionate, necessary, and distinct. Notably, Koh emphasized that the United States, and any other nation for that matter, should ensure its cyber weapons are not “inherently indiscriminate,” preventing unnecessary and unpredictable damage. Koh further recognized that cyber-warfare could bleed over borders into innocent third party countries, and most importantly, explained that any nation should be held responsible for the actions of a non-state actor that conducted a cyber-attack at the direction of such nation.\nAfter essentially reiterating the rules and policies of the UN Charter and Manual, Koh moved forward to the issues that arise when applying such rules and policies to cyber-warfare. First, Koh addressed the issue of how to determine the scope and effect of a cyber-attack that does not cause the same type\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nof damage as a kinetic attack. Koh, however, left the question open and merely stated that the United States holds the right to defensively act against any attack that could be viewed as an armed attack under the UN Charter. Koh next discussed the innate difficulties in analyzing an attack on a civilian target but, unfortunately, gave no solution—only raising the issue. Lastly, Koh spoke to the issue of attribution, but like the previous two issues, he only mentioned the problem of attribution and never truly analyzed it. Koh simply stated, “[n]ot all of the issues I’ve mentioned are susceptible to clear legal answers derived from existing precedents.” Essentially, Koh recognized these issues but gave no defined answers, simply leaving the issues to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.\nIn closing his speech, Koh explained that international humanitarian laws, i.e. the UN Charter, are not the only laws applying to cyber-warfare, recognizing that the cyber world is so interconnected that laws applying to human rights, criminal activity, and many others should also be applied to\n See id. (noting that the United States would still have to follow the laws regarding a defensive response); U.N. Charter art. 51.\n See Koh’s Speech.\n Id.\n Id.\n See id.\nVolume XVIII 2014 284\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\ncyber-warfare. Lastly, Koh emphasized the importance of understanding international laws in the cyber-warfare context and, equally, the ability to openly discuss the problems of applying such laws to cyber-warfare. Koh’s speech, while lacking some definite answers, was still educational on how the United States government views cyber-warfare in the same manner as the Manual and anticipates on applying the laws of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare in a similar fashion to the Manual.\n## V. Issues in Applying the International Laws of War to Cyber-Warfare\nEven as the legal field attempts to define cyber-warfare and apply internationally recognized laws of war to cyber-warfare, many issues still arise in the application of these laws. In this section, I will discuss several issues, including the differences in applying the terms “use of force” and “armed attack,” problems with the scale and effects test, the always troublesome issue of attribution, and the accumulation of such issues during an attack on a civilian target.\n See id.\n See id.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n## A. The Different Applications of Use of Force and Armed Attack\nThe problem of figuring out if a cyber-attack reached the level of a “use of force” and/or an “armed attack” is a genuine and difficult issue. While these thresholds create a basis for evaluating an attack, they are both vague and indecisive. For example, the UN Charter does not even attempt to solve the issue of what “use of force” entails and applies the scale and effects test to only armed attacks, while the Manual—which Koh seems to side with—applies the scales and effects test to both. The disparities in opinion continue beyond the differences in the application of the tests; the UN charter seems to imply a use of force or armed attack must occur through armed forces and/or cause physical damage to a nation’s military, while the Tallinn Manual and Koh would disagree. Moreover, the scale and effects test has many of its own flaws\n---\n See e.g., Waxman, *supra* note 54, at 44-46 (explaining the vagueness of use of force in the UN Charter); see TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-49 (Cambridge University Press 2013) (noting that the Manual had to use examples and factors to try and explain the usage of the definition for use of force and still admitted the definition is anything but foolproof).\n See U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4, art. 51; TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-59; Koh’s Speech.\n Waxman, *supra* note 53, at 44-46; TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 55.\nVolume XVIII 2014 286\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nas discussed in the next section. The dissimilarities between the Manual, Koh’s speech, and the UN Charter alone cause a great amount of confusion and uncertainty. Significantly, and to reiterate, of the (potential) rules discussed, only the UN Charter is binding; thus, its interpretation has the most significance and, seemingly, the only relevance at the current time. In short, the lack of cohesiveness and uniformity between the UN Charter and Manual only creates greater confusion in an already perplexed field.\n## B. Issues with the Scale and Effects Test\nThe scale and effects test used in the UN Charter, Tallinn Manual, and Koh’s speech faces some major challenges in the cyber-warfare context, including unpredictability, reversible effects, and differentiating effects. Regarding unpredictability, programmers can fall victim to coding error, or cyber-security defenses that cause the programmer to adjust the attack on the fly, thus triggering unknown effects. Consequently, the attack could either collapse or reach new levels of destruction. This unpredictability could have effects on intent, especially if the attack was never meant to reach the threshold of “use of force”\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nand/or an “armed attack.” Notably, the UN Charter takes intent in account when determining whether an attack breached the thresholds for either use of force or an armed attack, whereas the Manual *does not* base its analysis on intention whatsoever—solely analyzing the scale and effects of the attack. Thus, the unpredictability of cyber-attacks affects the scale and effects test differently depending on whether the UN Charter or Manual is being applied. From another perspective, a nation’s cyber-security defenses could interact with an attack in unforeseen ways, causing a chain reaction that overwhelms or shuts down a network. In this scenario, is the attacker blamed for scale and effects of the shutdown, or is the victim nation’s faulty defenses to blame? The unpredictability of cyber-attacks will continuously cause problems in applying the scale and effects test.\nThe ability of cyber-attacks to cause reversible damages as well as delayed or prolonged damages also raises concerns. Presumably, if the effects were reversible, the scale and effects of an attack would be greatly diminished—even if such an\n *See id.* at 1103-04.\n *See supra* Part.IV.B.4.a.\n *See* Martin Libiki, *Pulling Punches in Cyberspace*, *PROCEEDINGS OF A WORKSHOP ON DETERRING CYBERATTACKS: INFORMING STRATEGIES AND DEVELOPING OPTIONS FOR U.S. POLICY* 123, 124-129 (2010).\nVolume XVIII 2014 288\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nattack had immense effects in the short term. Nevertheless, the essential factor would be the immediate scale and effects, and thus, if the immediate scale and effects constituted a use of force or armed attack, then a victim nation could take the prescribed measures under the applicable laws of war. Alternatively, how can the laws of war apply to a cyber-attack that affects two countries differently? For example, what if a cyber-attack caused minimal damage to a more advanced country and significant damage to a less advanced country? Could only the less advanced country respond to the attack? The answer to this question, is likely that only the less advanced country could respond. While this answer adheres to the international laws of war, it seems rather illogical that the exact same attack could lead to such different defensive responses. Even though the scales and effects test has been widely acknowledge in the UN Charter, Manual, and Koh’s speech, the test is anything but flawless.\n## C. Issues of Attribution\nThe issue of attribution may be the most troublesome of the many issues that arise in applying the international laws\n See id.\n See Nguyen, supra note 14, at 1124.\n See id. at 1124-25.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nof war to cyber-warfare. Unlike traditional warfare when it is relatively simple to discover who launched an attack against a nation, a cyber-attack can be nearly impossible to attribute to a particular nation, especially if a non-state actor is working at the direction of a nation. Such is true because the cyber world offers so many options for anonymity and hiding attacks behind other networks. People experienced within the cyber world can easily forge or conceal their identity, especially if motivated to hide an illegal attack. Moreover, even if a nation is identified, such nation can easily deny that the attack derived from their networks—instead claiming that they were hacked. Even more troublesome, if a non-state actor is identified as the originator of an attack, an accused nation could deny any nexus with the attacking non-state actor. The numerous loopholes involved with attributing an attack to a particular nation presents some serious problems in applying the international laws of war to cyber-warfare.\n---\n *See e.g.,* Broad, Markoff &amp; Sanger, *supra* note 6 (explaining that no one is still one hundred percent certain where Stuxnet derived from)\n *See* Nguyen, *supra* note 14, at 1104-05.\n *See id.* at 1104-06.\n *See id.*\n*Volume XVIII 2014*                                                                 290\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\n## D. Applying the UN Charter and Tallinn Manual to an Attack on a Civilian Target\nIn this section, I will pose a couple of hypothetical situations to explain how a nation, specifically the United States, should respond to a cyber-attack that may or may not qualify as an act of cyber-warfare according to the UN Charter and the Manual—given Koh essentially adheres to the Manual. The two hypothetical situations involve (1) an attack on a civilian target that has some military aspects and (2) an attack on a purely civilian target. Notably, I will assume these attacks can be accurately attributed to the originator of the attack—a non-state actor directed by such state.\nSignificantly, this assumption would require the attack to affect the United States’ military to be considered having military characteristics. The issue of attribution is of such concern that the following examples could not be analyzed without making this assumption.\n### 1. ATTACK ON A CIVILIAN TARGET WITH MILITARY ASPECTS\nThe following fact pattern will present an opportunity to analyze an attack on a civilian target with military aspects: A foreign country attacks Boeing—a civilian aerospace company that, among many other things, helps the United States Military\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nresearch, test, and maintain aerospace technologies—via a cyber invasion that both steals and destroys both civilian and military related information.\nBefore moving forward and analyzing this attack under both the UN Charter and Manual, it is important to distinguish the espionage portion of the attack (the stealing) from the attacking portion of the attack (the destruction) because neither the UN Charter nor the Manual were created to analyze mere acts of espionage; but rather, they were created to analyze actual attacks. And to reiterate, we are assuming this attack can be accurately attributed to a non-sate actor working for such foreign country.\nUnder the UN Charter, this “attack” might constitute a use of force but unlikely would be classified as an armed attack. Importantly, only the military information that was destroyed could be considered in this analysis because the UN Charter requires the attack to have some sort of military aspect, and in this hypothetical, the civilian information lacks any sort of military character. The destruction of the military information from Boeing could result in a use of force or armed attack depending on what exactly was destroyed and, more\n See supra Parts IVA.1, IV.B.1.\n See supra Part IV.A.2.\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nimportantly, the consequence of destroying such information. If the destroyed military information involved details regarding national security that generated the scale and effects equivalent of military force, then the United States could likely classify the attack as a use of force. Classifying the attack as an armed attack, however, would be far more difficult because there was no physical damage in the sense of the UN Charter. The United States could argue the destruction of computer files constitutes physical damage because such damage equates that of a kinetic attack, but this argument would be weak in these circumstances because the attack had no effect on Boeing’s operations like a kinetic attack would. Notably, this same type of analysis would be used regardless of where the information was destroyed, even if from the Pentagon. Essentially, the scale and effects of the attack determine what actions are or are not allowed under the UN Charter. In short, this example epitomizes the rigorousness of the UN Charter’s requirement of military force and physical damage, especially in terms of cyber-warfare.\nUnder the Manual, a country potentially could have\n See supra Part IV.A.4.\n See supra Part IV (noting that the location being the Pentagon would likely cause of the information destroyed to have military character).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nan easier time defining this attack as a use of force and/or an armed attack. Unlike the UN Charter’s requirement of military character, the Manual strictly analyses the scale and effects of an attack; therefore, both the civilian and military information that was destroyed must be analyzed. In doing so, the United State must use the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, state involvement, military character, and presumptive legality. When applying these factors to this hypothetical, it seems the attack would constitute a use force because of the attack’s mild severity, high invasiveness, partial military character, attributable state involvement, and presumptive illegality. While the attack seems to be a use of force, the attack will not likely be considered an armed attack, especially given the high standard provided by the Manual—an armed attack is the *gravest* form of use of force. Here, the attack seems significant but not in the same category of the *gravest* uses of force. Thus, the attack will likely constitute a use of force but not an armed attack.\nGiven that under both the UN Charter and Manual this attack is merely a use of force but not an armed attack, the\n See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 51-52. (Cambridge University Press 2013).\n See id. at 48.\nVolume XVIII 2014 294\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nUnited States would not be able to defensively respond via article 51 or rule 13. Thus, the United States would have to respond by finding out why the foreign nation wanted to destroy such information and, moreover, the United States might have to destroy the information that was stolen. Moreover, the United States could put political and economic pressure on the foreign country committing this illegal use of force. The UN Charter also would provide the United States with the ability to request the UN’s assistance in properly responding to the attack. Alternatively, under the Manual, the United States could choose to take preemptive action via rule 15 in fear of the scale and effects of the destroyed information. Notably, the United States would have to show the immediacy and imminence of the foreign nation’s possible armed attack. Showing this immediacy and imminence would require more facts, but the more liberal attitude of the Manual can be seen in both the analyses of the attack as well as the United States’ ability to respond to this kind of attack\nEssentially, the Manual provides a more liberal outlook\n See supra Part IV (noting that if it determined an attack constitutes a use of force, the defensive response must be necessary and proportionate).\n See id.\n See id.\n See supra Part IV.A.3.\n See supra Part.IV.B.4.c.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\non attacks that do not directly and physically damage something or someone, even if there are certain military aspects involved in the attack. While both the UN Charter and the Manual could allow the United States to classify this attack as a use of force—especially given the partial military characteristic of the attack—the Manual more easily provides such a classification and could allow the United States to take more action regarding this attack. In short, this hypothetical provides an example of how the Manual is more adaptive and on-point with attacks that could lead to cyber-warfare.\n## 2. ATTACK ON A PURELY CIVILIAN TARGET\nThe following fact pattern will present an opportunity to analyze an attack on a purely civilian target: A foreign country attacks the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) that results in the market crashing and/or freezing for a period of time.\nUnder the UN Charter, this attack would not constitute a use of force or armed attack. Attacking a country’s economy, while devastating, lacks any sort of military characteristic; thus, the UN Charter’s requirement of military force would not be met. The United States could attempt to argue that even though the attack lacked any military character, the attack\n See supra Part IV.A.1.\nVolume XVIII 2014 296\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\naffected the military somehow. This argument, however, would not be nearly as persuasive in this hypothetical as compared the previous hypothetical because the effect would be quite attenuated. In short, the complete lack of any military force and, seemingly, military effects would prevent the United States from classifying this attack as a use of force or an armed attack under the UN Charter.\nOnce again, the Manual provides a more liberal analysis of the attack than the UN Charter. To reiterate, the Manual does not require an attack to be of military character to qualify as a use of force or an armed attack.[184] Thus, only the scale and effects of the attack on the NYSE need to be analyzed—using the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, military character, state involvement, and presumptive legality.[185] The attack would likely be determined as a use of force because of its extended and severe detrimental effects, presumptive illegality, attributable state involvement, and intense invasiveness; however, classifying the attack as an armed attack would be more difficult—given an armed attack is the gravest form of use of force.[186] Nevertheless, the\n\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nUnited States could point out the importance of the NYSE and the collapse’s grave effect beyond the economy. While this hypothetical presents a controversial and difficult question, I believe the United States would be able to classify this attack as a use of force and an armed attack given the extremely detrimental and lasting effects of crashing the NYSE. The United States would have to deeply analyze each of the factors explained in the Manual to ensure certain prerequisites are met, but the United States would be able to defensively respond via rule 13 to such an attack. Subsequently, the United States would have to properly respond with a proportionate and necessary attack. In sum, under the Manual, such an attack that completely crashes the NYSE would constitute a use of force, and more importantly, an armed attack resulting in the United States’s ability to act in self-defense.\n## 3. SUMMARY OF HYPOTHETICAL SITUATIONS\nWhile both hypothetical situations seem relatively open for interpretation, there is a major lesson to be learned from the application of the UN Charter, Manual, and in turn, Koh’s speech: cyber-warfare presents an unprecedented\nsuch an attack could constitute an armed attack).\n See id. at 53-59.\n See id. at 59-60.\n\namount of uncertainty and vagueness in the context of the international laws of war. As seen, when the attack has certain military characteristics, the attack is much easier to define. Unfortunately, cyber-attacks need not and most likely will not be of strict military character, causing the UN Charter to seem obsolete in many situations. Thus, the liberal approach of the Manual functions more efficiently and accurately than that of the UN Charter in the cyber-warfare context. Effectively, each cyber-attack must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis, concentrating on how the scale and effects of the attack affect the government, military, and civilian population.\n## VI. Recommendation: A Possible Solution to the Issues in Applying the International Laws of War to Cyber-Warfare\nBecause cyber-warfare is a new and evolving medium for warfare, an international convention must occur, and in turn, create an internationally recognized cyber-warfare treaty. While the UN Charter provides a legitimate basis for such a treaty, the UN Charter seems obsolete to handle the intricacies involved in cyber-warfare. The Manual, for the most part, is successful in applying the rules of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but fails at the most critical point: functioning as a binding\n See supra Part.V.\nVolume XVIII 2014 299\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nauthority. Instead, it is merely functioning as “suggestions.” Koh, who essentially agrees with the Manual, simply discussed the problems surrounding cyber-warfare, but no solutions whatsoever. Therefore, nations from around the world must come together and create binding rules for cyber-warfare before it is too late. In my opinion, the United States should address this problem now and be a leader in creating this treaty.\n## A. The Need for an International Convention, and in turn, an Internationally Recognized Cyber-Warfare Treaty\nWith the UN Charter and the Manual presenting valuable rules, exceptions to such rules, and recommendations involving all types of warfare—including cyber-warfare—the next step for regulating cyber-warfare is to create a binding international treaty focusing solely on cyber-warfare. For the effective creation of such a treaty, nations from around the world—not just experts in the field—will have to work together during an international convention, in a similar fashion as the creation of the UN Charter. During this convention, I believe the United States should take a progressive stance on this issue and become the world leader in regulating cyber-warfare.\n See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 16.\n See supra Part.IV.C.1.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nRegarding the details of this treaty, different aspects of both the UN Charter and Manual should be used, yet the treaty should also include further provisions. Overall, the treaty should follow the substance of the Manual as it does a remarkable job at applying the UN charter to a cyber-warfare setting. Nevertheless, certain decisions have to be made where the UN Charter and Manual disagree. For example, I believe the treaty should follow the Manual’s usage of the scale and effects test for both use of force and armed attack. However, there needs to be a definition or a sort of sliding scale to quantify the scale and effects of an attack—beyond listing an open set of factors. Moreover, in accordance with the Manual, there should be no need for military character or death to constitute use of force or an armed attack. While this standard might seem too liberal, the rules regarding self-defense will combat this liberalness by requiring the response to be proportionate and necessary—as both the Manual and UN Charter explain. Notably, the use of examples within the Manual help clarify its rules, with each example explaining certain aspects of the\n See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-59.\n See id. at 49-52.\n See supra Parts IVA.1, IV.B.1.\n See e.g., TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 59-60.\nVolume XVIII 2014 301\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nrule; therefore, given the positive affect of these examples, such examples should also be used in this cyber-warfare treaty.\nThese examples will allow readers to truly understand the rules and, more importantly, their applicability in the real world.\nFurthermore, each nation should be forced to present their case to the other members of the treaty before taking action, unless the defensive response is an absolute and immediate necessity.\nThis “meeting” will prevent a nation from applying the treaty in any way it sees fit, regardless of the treaty’s true meaning and the beliefs of other countries. Moreover, like the Manual, the treaty should include factor tests whenever answers will not be clear. These factors will allow countries to apply the facts of an attack to numerous factors as opposed to the strict reading of rules. Unlike the Manual, however, one of these factors should involve intent because the intent of an attacking nation should be taken into account when determining whether a country has illegally used force or an armed attack. Lastly, like the UN Charter, the treaty should include some rule or article that provides that members of the treaty shall ensure that non-\n See e.g., id. at 55 (giving an example of an attack on a civilian target).\n See e.g., id. at 49-52 (noting that this treaty should not be over-dependent on such factor tests).\n See id. at 53-59 (noting that the Manual does not consider intent).\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nmembers still act in accordance with the treaty but only to the extent that is necessary to maintain international peace. This provision would allow the treaty to have a worldwide affect, beyond the countries that signed. The treaty, effectively, will use the Manual’s application of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but bind of all member-nations to the treaty, much like the UN Charter did with United Nations members.\nIn short, some sort of binding action must occur to regulate cyber-warfare, and the United States should be at the forefront of this movement. In regulating cyber-warfare, the ideals and the binding effect of the UN Charter should be applied to cyber-warfare in a similar fashion as the Tallinn Manual. By taking action in this questionable area of law, the United States can ensure its safety now and into the future.\n## VII. Conclusion\nThe lack of regulations involving cyber-warfare is a growing and real threat. Cyber-warfare might be a confusing and seemingly futuristic concept, but countries from around the world need to address this lack of regulation sooner than\n See e.g., U.N. Charter art. 2(6) (“The Organization shall ensure that states which are not Members of the United Nations act in accordance with these Principles so far as may be necessary for the maintenance of international peace and security.”).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nlater. While countries can attempt to apply the UN Charter to cyber-warfare situations, the UN Charter lacks the flexibility and modernization to properly handle the intricacies of cyber-attacks. The UN Charter is undoubtedly effective in handling kinetic warfare; however, it seems obsolete in the cyber-warfare context. Experts in the field recognized this issue and, in response, created the Tallinn Manual, which was effective in applying the UN Charter to cyber-warfare. Nevertheless, the Manual functions simply as a suggestion booklet and provides zero binding rules or regulations. Therefore, the United States needs to take the lead in regulating cyber-warfare. The United States needs to hold an international conference that will produce a binding treaty involving the regulations of cyber-warfare. This treaty should use the Manual’s concepts of applying the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but needs to go further in an attempt to leave as few questions unanswered as possible. While such a task will be difficult, the difficulties in creating a cyber-warfare treaty are minimal compared to the damage that will occur without such regulations.\nVolume XVIII 2014\n304",

    "## 1. PENETRATION ATTACKS": "Penetration attacks, as the name indicates, penetrate a computer system or computer network and transport whatever the programmer wants to “drop” into the system/network.²⁷ Examples of penetration attacks include the implantation of malware, viruses, Trojan horses, and worms.²⁸ All these types of penetration attacks cause actual damage to the system/network in different ways.²⁹ For example, worms replicate within the system but do not infect the host computer; nevertheless, the worm spreads throughout the entire system and eventually can cause the system to completely shut down.³⁰ Viruses effect computer systems is a different way, creating codes that become active once a user opens the file, and subsequently, the\nvirus corrupts, destroys, or steals files.³¹ Any of these types of penetration attacks can lead to the destruction or alterations of a computer system, and in turn, can lead to physical or economic damage.³² ## 2. DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS Denial of service (DoS) attacks disrupt a computer system or network by overloading the system/network, and thus, reduce its functionality.³³ Essentially, a DoS attack can completely shut down a system/network by flooding the target with false requests for service, therefore causing the system to overload.³⁴ When this happens, legitimate requests for service are blocked, and the actual purpose of the system is devastated.³⁵ Importantly, for anonymity reasons, attackers will often use distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks. A DDoS attack has the same purpose as a DoS attack; however, the attacker uses other people’s computers in addition to their own, which makes tracing the source of the attack much more difficult. Both DoS ³¹ *Id.* ³² See e.g., *Fisher &amp; Roberts*, *supra* note 19 (explaining how the Stuxnet worm caused actual damage to Iranian nuclear program).\n³³ JOSEPH MIGGA KIZZA, *COMPUTER NETWORK SECURITY AND CYBER ETHICS* 76 (2002).\n³⁴ Mindi McDowell, *Understanding Denial-of-Service Attacks*, UNITED STATES COMPUTER EMERGENCY READINESS TEAM (Feb. 6, 2013), http://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-015.\n³⁵ *Id.* Volume XVIII 2014 258 Volume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE and DDoS attacks can harm a nation via physical or economic damages.³⁶ ## B. Semantic Attacks Semantic attacks do not attempt to shut down, steal information, or destroy a computer network/system; rather, they affect the accuracy of the network’s information. Essentially, “[a] system under semantic attack operates and will be perceived as operating correctly (otherwise the semantic attack is failure), but it will generate answers at variance with reality.”³⁷ While such an attack seems petty, computer users tend to accept the information given to them, especially if such information derives from a government website.³⁸ For example, if a semantic attack occurred to an important government website, such information could cause people ignore a legitimate threat or falsely perceive an innocent act as a legitimate attack. Such a semantic attack could cause people to unnecessarily bunker down or, alternatively, riot out of fear. Thus, such a semantic attack could have severe consequences ³⁶ See e.g., John Markoff, *Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks*, New York Times (Aug. 12, 2008), http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html?_r=0 (explaining that the Russian cyber-attack on Georgia consisted of a DoS attack).\n³⁷ Brenner &amp; Goodman, *supra* note 24, at 31-32.\n³⁸ See Antolin-Jenkins, *supra* note 28, at 140 (noting how gullible or ignorant many computer users are when reading information off the internet).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY on the population.³⁹ As demonstrated above, semantic attacks can be as detrimental to a nation as syntactic attacks.\n## C. Hybrid Attacks Hybrid attacks are exactly what the term seems to imply: a hybrid of syntactic and semantic cyber-attacks.⁴⁰ Such attacks have the greatest likelihood of causing the most destruction because the attacker could actually destroy a certain computer system (and, in turn, whatever other infrastructure was affected) and then tell the people that something completely different happened—only furthering the confusion, distrust, and destruction.⁴¹ ³⁹ See id. at 140-41 (noting that such attacks could cause great civil unrest); Brenner &amp; Goodman, supra note 24 at 31-39.\n⁴⁰ See Antolin-Jenkins, supra note 28, at 140.\n⁴¹ See id. For example, Terrorists can mount complex attacks by combining syntactic and semantic attacks. Imagine that terrorists target Boston, Atlanta, Miami, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles for an attack which begins with a syntactic assault on computer systems that stops the delivery of state public assistance. General public awareness of the attack will emerge gradually, as successive waves of frustrated welfare recipients file complaints with the appropriate agencies. Eventually, the realization will spread that the distribution of benefits had been deliberately shut down. Once it becomes clear that the funds are not coming, the terrorists can follow up with a semantic attack assigning responsibility for their efforts to carefully-selected right-wing groups whose views are known to carry at least the taint of racial bias. If the terrorists manage to sustain the welfare gridlock, the freezing of the resources upon which thousands depend for their survival will produce civil disobedience and localized chaos.

International Laws of War: An Application to Cyber-Warfare In this section, I will explain the major components of the international laws of war in the cyber-warfare context. First, I will briefly explain the United Nations Charter (UN Charter) and how it applies to cyber-warfare.⁴² Subsequently, I will discuss the creation and purpose of the Tallinn Manual (the Manual).⁴³ And lastly, I will explain the United States’ approach and strategies to handing the possibility of cyber-warfare.⁴⁴ Each of these components is essential in understanding how to properly respond to an act of warfare, specifically cyberorder. To make things even more interesting, the terrorists can then direct a syntactic attack at ATM and banking system computers in these cities. Such a shutdown will add to the problem by causing outrage among citizens who do not depend on welfare funds. The cumulative effects of all these efforts will be riots, targeted violence and a National Guard stretched to its limit (which will create an excellent opportunity for the terrorists to stage a CBERN attack in other areas of the country).\nBrenner &amp; Goodman, supra note 24, at 39-40.\nwarfare.\n## A. The United Nations Charter The UN Charter functions as the backbone to the current international laws of war.⁴⁵ It sets forth many rules and guidelines that apply to war; including starting a conflict, responding to an attack, and how the UN should respond to an attack on a member nation.⁴⁶ Understanding the UN Charter is crucial to understanding the later developments that deal specifically with cyber-warfare.\n## 1. GENERAL BACKGROUND The UN Charter was created to “save succeeding generations from the scourge of war... to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights... to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other resources of international law... and to promote social progress.”⁴⁷ Moreover, the overarching goals of the UN Charter were to allow countries to live tolerantly and in peace, to strengthen international peace and security, to ensure that armed forces are a last resort, and to promote ⁴⁵ See History of the United Nations, http://www.un.org/en/aboutun/history/charter_history.shtml (last visited Oct. 30, 2013).\n⁴⁶ See generally U.N.

    "## 2. ARTICLE 2(4): PROHIBITING THE THREAT OR USE OF FORCE Article 2, paragraph 4 of the UN Charter provides a quintessential rule: “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.”⁵¹ Essentially, this rule prohibits a country from threatening or using “force” on another country, provided": "# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nthe exception of self-defense discussed later in this section.⁵² Unfortunately, however, the term “threat or use of force” is never defined in the UN Charter, causing unrest and numerous debates.⁵³ Nevertheless, academics over the years have determined that this term involves only the uses or threat of *military* forces or attacks affecting the victim nation’s *military*, precluding economic and political coercion.⁵⁴ Notably, the UN Charter also specifically precludes espionage.⁵⁵\nThis rule is important in the cyber-warfare context because article 4(2) would prevent a victim country from attacking the aggressor country that committed the cyber-attack.⁵⁶ Thus, a country who falls victim to an act of cyber-warfare may not retaliate unless such an attack falls within the self-defense exception of article 51 via qualifying as an armed attack. The vagueness concerning the meaning of “use of force” presents an issue in the cyber-warfare context because at what point does a cyber-attack qualify as a use of *military* force?⁵⁷\n⁵² *Id.* art. 51.\n⁵³ See generally *id.* arts. 2, 4, 41, 42, 51 (noting that there is no definition section or individual definition for “threat or use of force”).\n⁵⁴ See e.g., MATTHEW C.

    "## 3. ARTICLES 41 AND 42": "Articles 41 and 42 of the UN Charter provide directions for how the UN can support a country that is being attacked.⁵⁸ Article 41 focuses on a way to counter an attack that does not mount to a “use of force,” whereas article 42 provides the UN the power to use force to counter such an attack, but only if it is determined that the attack qualified as a “use of force” and article 41 remedies would be inadequate.⁵⁹ Article 41’s non-forceful remedies would include economic blockades and political pressure.⁶⁰ While these two articles do not analyze whether a country can defend itself, they do provide structure and direction for how UN members should respond to an attack on their own country or on an ally.⁶¹ Primarily, articles 41 and 42 allow the UN to analyze the extent of the attack—whether there was a use of force—and, subsequently, allow the UN to\n⁵⁸ See U.N. Charter arts. 41, 42.\n⁵⁹ See id. Article 41 states “The Security Council may decide what measures not involving the use of armed force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and it may call upon the Members of the United Nations to apply such measures. These may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations. Id. art 41. If the UN decides that article 41 relief would be insufficient, it may “take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security. Such action may include demonstrations, blockade, and other operations by air, sea, or land forces of Members of the United Nations.” Id. art. 42.\n⁶⁰ See id. art. 41.\n⁶¹ See id. arts. 41, 42.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\ndecide to either use non-forceful or forceful remedies.⁶² While the substance of articles 41 and 42 are important, the most essential aspect of these articles is their purpose—to prevent forceful responses to an attack unless absolutely necessary to maintain international security and peace.⁶³\nIn discussing cyber-warfare, the most important aspect of articles 41 and 42 is their purpose as discussed directly above.⁶⁴ Thus, unless there is a clear use of force during a cyber-attack, it seems the United States or any other member of the UN could only respond via a non-forceful response—i.e., an economic blockade or political pressures.⁶⁵",
    "## 4. ARTICLE 51": "Article 51 of the UN Charter provides the exception to general rule of article 2(4), which prohibits the use of force against other nations. Article 51 states:\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately\n⁶² See id.\n⁶³ See id.\n⁶⁴ See id. pmbl, arts. 41, 42.\n⁶⁵ See id. arts. 41, 42.\nVolume XVIII 2014 266\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nreported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.⁶⁶\nWhile Article 51 expressly creates an exception for the use of force in self-defense, some issues arise in the cyber-warfare context, especially when looking at the specific wording.⁶⁷ Much like the issue with our basic definition of cyber-warfare, article 51 allows a nation to defend itself only if the attack amounts to an “armed attack,” which a cyber-attack would never seem to qualify as.⁶⁸ Nevertheless, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) adjusted the definition of an armed attack by defining it more broadly and explaining that armed attacks “do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”⁶⁹ Thus, the term armed attack actually functions more as an expansion to “use of force” as opposed to an attack with actual kinetic weapons.⁷⁰\nMoreover, the ICJ decided in *Nicaragua v. United States* that\n⁶⁶ *Id.* art. 51. (emphasis added).\n⁶⁷ *See id.*\n⁶⁸ *See supra* Part II.A.; U.N.

GENERAL BACKGROUND\nThe Manual, which was published in 2013, was put together by an international group of approximately twenty-five experts from 2009 to 2012.⁷⁸ These experts met in Tallinn, Estonia, which in turn, helped produce the name of the Manual.⁷⁹ The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), specifically NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, invited these experts to put together the rules of cyber-warfare into a single document.⁸⁰ The Manual was put together in response to the growing fear of cyber-warfare and, more specifically, the lack of well-defined rules regulating cyber-warfare.⁸¹ Notably, the Manual only discusses the laws\n⁷⁶ See id.\n⁷⁷ Id. (explaining the Manual is a “non-binding document applying existing law to cyber-warfare”).\n⁷⁸ Id. at 16-17, 22 (noting these experts included legal practitioners, technical experts, and academics).\n⁷⁹ Id. at 22.\n⁸⁰ Id.\n⁸¹ Id. at 17-18 (explaining the Manual was created “in hope of bringing some degree of clarity to the complex legal issues surrounding cyber operations, with particular attention paid to those involving the jus ad bellum and the jus\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nof cyber-warfare, thus excluding cyber-espionage (to the extent espionage does not involve “use of force”) and cyber-crimes.⁸² To reiterate, “it is essential to understand that the Tallinn Manual is not an official document” and, thus, is not binding on any nation.⁸³\n## 2. RULES 11 AND 12: DEFINITIONS OF FORCE AND THREAT OF FORCE\nImportantly, and unlike the UN Charter, the Manual actually defines both the crucial terms “use of force” and “threat of force.”⁸⁴ Starting with these definitions will allow for a better understanding of the Manual, even though these definitions come after some important rules within the Manual.⁸⁵\n### a. Rule 11: Definition of Use of Force\nThe Manual directly refers back to Nicaragua v. United States when determining what actions constitute a use of in bello”).\n⁸² *Id.* at 18.\n⁸³ *Id.* at 23. Nevertheless, the Manual could function in a similar way to the Lieber Code—an aspirational attempt to regulate warfare during the civil war—in that the Lieber Code eventually “became a core text in the modern laws of war recognized worldwide, and many elements of his code continue to inform our public debate how best to respond to a new form of warfare in both an effective and a moral manner.” Nick Beard, *The Liber Codes*, *THE NEW YORK TIMES: THE OPINION PAGES* (Apr. 24, 2013, 12:59 PM), http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/the-lieber-codes/?_r=0.\n⁸⁴ *TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE* 47-53.\n⁸⁵ *Id.* at 45, 47-53 (noting that the Prohibition of Threat or Use of Force, Rule 10, comes before the definitions of “use of force” and “threat of force”).\nVolume XVIII 2014 270\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nforce—applying the “scale and effects” test.⁸⁶ While the scale and effects test is not black and white, it provides a nation with a decent idea of what constitutes a use of force.⁸⁷ The Manual, however, does create some black and white rules.⁸⁸ For example, the Manual unequivocally states that “[a]cts that injure or kill persons or damage or destroy objects are unambiguously uses of force.”⁸⁹ Notably, like the UN Charter, the Manual excludes economic and political coercion from qualifying as use of force.⁹⁰ The Manual, moreover, explicitly rejects the notion that a non-destructive cyber-attack that is intended solely to undermine the confidence in a government would qualify as a use of force.⁹¹ As the Manual progresses through the definition of use of force, it designates eight factors that are supposed to help a nation determine whether a non-obvious act qualifies as a use of force—essentially adding factors to the scale and effects test.⁹² The list of factors includes the following: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects,\n⁸⁶ See id. at 47; Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. United States), 1986 I.C.J. 14, 103-04 (June 27).\n⁸⁷ Id.\n⁸⁸ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 49.\n⁸⁹ Id.\n⁹⁰ See id. at 48.\n⁹¹ Id.

Rule 12: Definition of Threat of Force Rule 12 of the Manual breaks down the functional meaning of “threat of force” in the cyber-warfare context.⁹⁴ Importantly, the rule explains that a threat could occur in two situations: (1) “a cyber operation that is used to communicate a threat to use force” and (2) “a threat carried out by any means... to carry out cyber operations qualifying as use of force.”⁹⁵ The rule further notes that a demand need not accompany the threat to qualify as such under this rule; however, actions alone that seem threatening do not qualify as a threat because a threat must be “communicative in nature.”⁹⁶ The rule also states that a threat of force could technically derive form a nation that seems unequipped to follow through will such a threat; nonetheless, it’s the threat that matters.⁹⁷ Interestingly, the rule explains that ⁹³ *Id.* (explaining out that the list of factors is not exhaustive and functions only as a starting point).\n⁹⁴ *Id.* at 52-53.\n⁹⁵ *Id.* at 52.\n⁹⁶ *Id.* at 53 (explaining that developing technology that could be used in an act that qualifies as a use of force *does not* qualify as a threat of force).\n⁹⁷ *Id.* (noting the experts were split with this portion of the rule).\nVolume XVIII 2014 272 Volume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE a nation will not be considered to have actually made a threat of force, even if that nation makes such a threat and has the capability of following through with such threat, as long as that nation does not truly intend on attacking—essentially requiring actual intent.⁹⁸ Much like the definition of use of force, this definition lacks perfect clarity and contains many intricacies, but should be of great help in determining what actually constitutes a threat of force.\n## 3. RULE 10: PROHIBITION OF THREAT OR USE OF FORCE Rule 10 of the Manual parallels article 2(4) of the UN Charter by making “[a] cyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force... unlawful.”⁹⁹ The commentary following Rule 10 clarifies that the “use of force” does not need to be committed by a country’s armed forces; rather, the force could derive from an intelligence agency or any private contractor of the nation. Rule 10 also discusses a nation “intervening” in another nation’s affairs—political, economic, social, cultural, or otherwise.¹⁰⁰ The rule explains that it is unlawful for another nation to intervene but goes on to explain that the term ⁹⁸ *Id.* (noting, once again, that the experts were split with this portion of the rule).\n⁹⁹ *See id.* at 45 (Cambridge University Press 2013); U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4 (noting that both prohibit the threat or use of force).\n¹⁰⁰ *TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE* 46.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\"intervene\"does have the same meaning as in a layman context; instead, intervention in the cyber-war context, as well as for the UN Charter, must involve coercion.¹⁰¹ The rule further explains that an unlawful act of intervention does not per se qualify as a use of force; the intervention still must breach the threshold for use of force independently.¹⁰² Thus, when determining whether an intervention is unlawful, a nation must ascertain if coercion is involved, and moreover, must decide if the intervention reached the level of use of force.¹⁰³ Fundamentally, Rule 10 applies article 2(4) of the UN Charter to the cyber-warfare setting.\n## 4. RULES 13, 14, 15 AND 16: THE RIGHT AND REGULATIONS FOR SELF-DEFENSE AND COLLECTIVE SELF-DEFENSE Rules 13, 14, 15, and 16 of the Manual all explain the ability of a victim nation to launch a defensive response—in a parallel manner to article 51 of the UN Charter.¹⁰⁴ Rule 13 discusses an individual nation’s right to protect itself; rule 14 examines how an act of self-defense must be necessary and proportionate to the original attack; rule 15 delves into ¹⁰¹ *Id.* at 47 (“intervention pure and simple is not intervention [in the UN Charter or Tallinn Manual context]”).\n¹⁰² *Id.* at 46.\n¹⁰³ *Id.* at 46-47; see UN Charter art. 51.\n¹⁰⁴ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 53-64.\nVolume XVIII 2014 274 Volume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE the ability of a nation to preemptively strike in an act of self-defense; and rule 16 examines the possibility of collective self-defense, that is a third party nation(s) coming to the aid of a victim nation.¹⁰⁵ These rules are essential to the completeness of the Manual, especially in the Manual’s attempt to mimic article 51 of the UN Charter.¹⁰⁶ ## a. Rule 13: Self-Defense Against Armed Attack Rule 13 of the Manual allows a nation to exercise the right of self-defense, given that such nation faced an attack—cyber or kinetic—that qualified as an armed attack.¹⁰⁷ The term “armed attack” is quantified by the scale and effects of the attack, much like the use of force threshold in rule 11, but has an even heightened threshold beyond use of force.¹⁰⁸ Plainly, an armed attack is the “gravest” form of a use of force.¹⁰⁹ Unfortunately, however, the Manual never defines what the exact threshold is for the scale and effects test—only causing confusion.¹¹⁰ The scale and effects of an attack, though, must\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nbe reasonably foreseeable. Therefore, an attack that causes grave damage far beyond any reasonable foresight would not constitute an armed attack.¹¹¹ Notably, an armed attack must have a trans-border component; thus, a purely domestic attack can never qualify as an armed attack within the Manual’s framework.¹¹² The rule further explains that an armed attack can originate from a state or a non-state actor who is directed by the state to take such actions.¹¹³ Additionally, the rule states that individual attacks that alone do not qualify as armed attacks can be classified as armed attacks if that single attack is just one in a series of attacks. Accordingly, aggregated non-armed attacks can elevate and cross the threshold of an armed attack.¹¹⁴ The comments for rule 13 continue in detail about the irrelevance of intentions, the ability of a third party nation to defend itself if the scale and effects of the attack bleed over borders, and the ability of a victim nation to retaliate against persons who are located in an innocent third party nation—so as long the victim nation has permission to do so or the innocent third party nation\napplied on a case-by-case basis).\n¹¹¹ *Id.* at 56.\n¹¹² *Id.* at 54.\n¹¹³ *Id.* at 54-58 (detailing the intricacies and problems with attributing a non-state actor’s actions to a state).\n¹¹⁴ *Id.* at 55 (explaining that there must be convincing evidence that the multiple attacks are related).\nVolume XVIII 2014 276\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nis unable to take action.¹¹⁵ In short, a nation has the right to defend itself if attacked by another nation via an armed attack as determined by the scale and effects test.¹¹⁶\n## b. Rule 14: Necessity and Proportionality\nEven if it is determined that a nation has the right to defend itself—either via kinetic or cyber action—that nation’s defensive response must be necessary and proportionate.¹¹⁷ Simply put, if any non-use of force action could be taken to solve the problem, such action must be taken.¹¹⁸ Notably, this “necessity” is judged from the victim nation’s perspective.¹¹⁹ The rule also discusses proportionality.¹²⁰ Proportionality addresses how much force a victim nation may use in the defensive action. Factors such as scale, scope, duration, and intensity play a role in this determination.¹²¹ Importantly, this proportionality test does not require a victim nation to mirror the scale, scope, duration, and intensity of the offensive attack; but rather, the defensive action must be proportionate to the\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nforce needed to successfully defend against the offensive attack.¹²² Moreover, the rule indicates that kinetic attacks may be used in defense of certain cyber-attacks, given that the kinetic attack is necessary and proportionate.¹²³ The rule concerning necessity and proportionality is of great importance when deciding how to properly respond to an offensive armed attack.¹²⁴\n## c. Rule 15: Imminence and Immediacy\nThe Manual takes a step beyond the UN Charter by detailing when a nation can preemptively defend itself and the general time frame allowed for a defensive attack.¹²⁵ Rule 15 specifically allows for preemptive defense actions if an armed attack from an enemy nation is imminent.¹²⁶ To be considered imminent, the need to defend must be “instant, overwhelming, [and] leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.”¹²⁷ Interestingly, the experts involved in writing\n¹²² *Id.* (indicating that the defensive attack is judged on “the level of force needed to successfully mount a defense . . . more force may be necessary, or less force may be sufficient [ ] to repel the attack or defeat one that is imminent”).\n¹²³ *Id.*\n¹²⁴ *See id.* at 59-60.\n¹²⁵ *See id.* at 60-63.\n¹²⁶ *Id.* at 60.

Rule 16: Collective Self-Defense\nThe Manual allows a third party nation to assist a victim nation, but only if the victim nation requests such assistance.¹³² More than one third of a party nation can help a victim nation, but in any situation involving collective self-defense, both the\n¹²⁸ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 61 (noting that this standard was not universally agreed to).\n¹²⁹ Id. at 62.\n¹³⁰ Id. at 63.\n¹³¹ See id. at 60-64.\n¹³² Id. at 63.\nassisting and victim nations must determine that the offensive act qualifies as an armed attack or imminent armed attack.¹³³ Moreover, the assisting nation must still follow the rules of necessity, proportionality, imminence, and immediacy.¹³⁴ Notably, an assisting nation can only aid to the extent that the victim nation condones. For example, if the victim state only wants to respond via a cyber action, the assisting nation cannot use kinetic weapons—even if the use of such weapons would be allowed under the rules of the Manual.¹³⁵ The Manual also recognizes certain *ad hoc* agreements as constituting consent of the victim state, i.e. NATO agreements. Essentially, collective self-defense follows the same rules discussed above yet also contains additional rules to protect the victim state from losing control over the defensive response.¹³⁶ ## 5. SUMMARY OF THE TALLINN MANUAL As valuable and progressive as the Manual might be, it still suffers from not being binding on any nation, therefore, functioning only as “a product of a group of independent experts acting solely in their personal capacity.”¹³⁷ Nevertheless, ¹³³ *Id.* ¹³⁴ *Id.* at 64.\n¹³⁵ *Id.* at 63.\n¹³⁶ *See id.* at 59-64.\n¹³⁷ *Id.* at 23.\nVolume XVIII 2014 280 Volume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE the Manual provides a solid basis for possible future codifications regarding the international laws of cyber-warfare. By formulating an authority that applies the UN Charter and many other recognized international principles of law to a cyber-warfare setting, the Manual has greatly advanced the understanding of how the international laws of war will apply to cyber-warfare.\n## C. United States’ Strategies and Approaches While the United States has not created an official policy in the same light or depth as the Tallinn Manual, President Obama has signed several executive orders and presidential policy directives that discuss how the United States needs to better protect itself, specifically its critical infrastructure, from the possibility of cyber-attacks.¹³⁸ These orders and directives, however, solely discuss how the United States can better protect itself via improved communications and updated cyber-security tactics. They gloss over how the United States would and could respond to a cyber-attack—specifically an attack that could lead to cyber-warfare.¹³⁹ The most relevant and ¹³⁸ See e.g., Exec.

HAROLD KOH’S SPEECH AT THE UNITED STATES CYBER COMMAND CONFERENCE The timing of Koh’s speech was impeccable and purposeful as it was given a mere three weeks after the non-official release of the Tallinn Manual—providing a strong indication that the speech was a direct response to the ideas and policies within the Manual.¹⁴¹ Much like the Manual, Koh acknowledged that international principles of law should apply to cyber-warfare and emphasized that the cyber world is anything but law-free.¹⁴² Moreover, Koh applied the “use of force” test of the UN Charter article 2(4) and gave a number of factors (like the Manual) including, “the context of the event, the actor perpetrating the action (recognizing challenging issues of attribution in cyberspace), the target and location, [and the] ¹⁴⁰ Harold Honhgu Koh, Legal Advisor of the Dep’t of State, International Law in Cyberspace, Address to the USCYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference (Sept. 18, 2012), available at http://www.state.gov/s/l/releases/remarks/197924.htm [hereinafter Koh’s Speech] (noting that Koh has been an international lawyer for over thirty years, with the State Department for three and one half years, and is known as a premier legal-mind in the field).\n¹⁴¹ *Id.* ¹⁴² *Id.* Volume XVIII 2014 Volume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE effects and intent,” to help determine if a cyber-attack crosses the threshold of use of force.¹⁴³ Koh also recognized that the United States may defend itself if the offensive attack reaches the extent of an armed attack under article 51 of the UN Charter, but in the same fashion as the Manual and UN Charter, the defense action must be proportionate, necessary, and distinct.¹⁴⁴ Notably, Koh emphasized that the United States, and any other nation for that matter, should ensure its cyber weapons are not “inherently indiscriminate,” preventing unnecessary and unpredictable damage.¹⁴⁵ Koh further recognized that cyber-warfare could bleed over borders into innocent third party countries, and most importantly, explained that any nation should be held responsible for the actions of a non-state actor that conducted a cyber-attack at the direction of such nation.¹⁴⁶ After essentially reiterating the rules and policies of the UN Charter and Manual, Koh moved forward to the issues that arise when applying such rules and policies to cyber-warfare.¹⁴⁷ First, Koh addressed the issue of how to determine the scope and effect of a cyber-attack that does not cause the same type\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nof damage as a kinetic attack. Koh, however, left the question open and merely stated that the United States holds the right to defensively act against any attack that could be viewed as an armed attack under the UN Charter.¹⁴⁸ Koh next discussed the innate difficulties in analyzing an attack on a civilian target but, unfortunately, gave no solution—only raising the issue.¹⁴⁹ Lastly, Koh spoke to the issue of attribution, but like the previous two issues, he only mentioned the problem of attribution and never truly analyzed it.¹⁵⁰ Koh simply stated, “[n]ot all of the issues I’ve mentioned are susceptible to clear legal answers derived from existing precedents.”¹⁵¹ Essentially, Koh recognized these issues but gave no defined answers, simply leaving the issues to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.¹⁵²\nIn closing his speech, Koh explained that international humanitarian laws, i.e. the UN Charter, are not the only laws applying to cyber-warfare, recognizing that the cyber world is so interconnected that laws applying to human rights, criminal activity, and many others should also be applied to\n¹⁴⁸ See id.

Charter art. 51.\n¹⁴⁹ See Koh’s Speech.\n¹⁵⁰ Id.\n¹⁵¹ Id.\n¹⁵² See id.\nVolume XVIII 2014 284\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\ncyber-warfare.¹⁵³ Lastly, Koh emphasized the importance of understanding international laws in the cyber-warfare context and, equally, the ability to openly discuss the problems of applying such laws to cyber-warfare. Koh’s speech, while lacking some definite answers, was still educational on how the United States government views cyber-warfare in the same manner as the Manual and anticipates on applying the laws of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare in a similar fashion to the Manual.¹⁵⁴\n## V. Issues in Applying the International Laws of War to Cyber-Warfare\nEven as the legal field attempts to define cyber-warfare and apply internationally recognized laws of war to cyber-warfare, many issues still arise in the application of these laws. In this section, I will discuss several issues, including the differences in applying the terms “use of force” and “armed attack,” problems with the scale and effects test, the always troublesome issue of attribution, and the accumulation of such issues during an attack on a civilian target.\n¹⁵³ See id.\n¹⁵⁴ See id.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n## A. The Different Applications of Use of Force and Armed Attack\nThe problem of figuring out if a cyber-attack reached the level of a “use of force” and/or an “armed attack” is a genuine and difficult issue. While these thresholds create a basis for evaluating an attack, they are both vague and indecisive.¹⁵⁵ For example, the UN Charter does not even attempt to solve the issue of what “use of force” entails and applies the scale and effects test to only armed attacks, while the Manual—which Koh seems to side with—applies the scales and effects test to both.¹⁵⁶ The disparities in opinion continue beyond the differences in the application of the tests; the UN charter seems to imply a use of force or armed attack must occur through armed forces and/or cause physical damage to a nation’s military, while the Tallinn Manual and Koh would disagree.¹⁵⁷ Moreover, the scale and effects test has many of its own flaws\n---\n¹⁵⁵ See e.g., Waxman, *supra* note 54, at 44-46 (explaining the vagueness of use of force in the UN Charter); see TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-49 (Cambridge University Press 2013) (noting that the Manual had to use examples and factors to try and explain the usage of the definition for use of force and still admitted the definition is anything but foolproof).\n¹⁵⁶ See U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4, art. 51; TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-59; Koh’s Speech.\n¹⁵⁷ Waxman, *supra* note 53, at 44-46; TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 55.\nVolume XVIII 2014 286\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nas discussed in the next section.¹⁵⁸ The dissimilarities between the Manual, Koh’s speech, and the UN Charter alone cause a great amount of confusion and uncertainty. Significantly, and to reiterate, of the (potential) rules discussed, only the UN Charter is binding; thus, its interpretation has the most significance and, seemingly, the only relevance at the current time. In short, the lack of cohesiveness and uniformity between the UN Charter and Manual only creates greater confusion in an already perplexed field.\n## B. Issues with the Scale and Effects Test\nThe scale and effects test used in the UN Charter, Tallinn Manual, and Koh’s speech faces some major challenges in the cyber-warfare context, including unpredictability, reversible effects, and differentiating effects.¹⁵⁹ Regarding unpredictability, programmers can fall victim to coding error, or cyber-security defenses that cause the programmer to adjust the attack on the fly, thus triggering unknown effects.¹⁶⁰ Consequently, the attack could either collapse or reach new levels of destruction.¹⁶¹ This unpredictability could have effects on intent, especially if the attack was never meant to reach the threshold of “use of force”\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nand/or an “armed attack.”¹⁶² Notably, the UN Charter takes intent in account when determining whether an attack breached the thresholds for either use of force or an armed attack, whereas the Manual *does not* base its analysis on intention whatsoever—solely analyzing the scale and effects of the attack.¹⁶³ Thus, the unpredictability of cyber-attacks affects the scale and effects test differently depending on whether the UN Charter or Manual is being applied. From another perspective, a nation’s cyber-security defenses could interact with an attack in unforeseen ways, causing a chain reaction that overwhelms or shuts down a network. In this scenario, is the attacker blamed for scale and effects of the shutdown, or is the victim nation’s faulty defenses to blame? The unpredictability of cyber-attacks will continuously cause problems in applying the scale and effects test.\nThe ability of cyber-attacks to cause reversible damages as well as delayed or prolonged damages also raises concerns.¹⁶⁴ Presumably, if the effects were reversible, the scale and effects of an attack would be greatly diminished—even if such an\n¹⁶² *See id.* at 1103-04.\n¹⁶³ *See supra* Part.IV.B.4.a.\n¹⁶⁴ *See* Martin Libiki, *Pulling Punches in Cyberspace*, *PROCEEDINGS OF A WORKSHOP ON DETERRING CYBERATTACKS: INFORMING STRATEGIES AND DEVELOPING OPTIONS FOR U.S. POLICY* 123, 124-129 (2010).\nVolume XVIII 2014 288\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nattack had immense effects in the short term.¹⁶⁵ Nevertheless, the essential factor would be the immediate scale and effects, and thus, if the immediate scale and effects constituted a use of force or armed attack, then a victim nation could take the prescribed measures under the applicable laws of war. Alternatively, how can the laws of war apply to a cyber-attack that affects two countries differently?¹⁶⁶ For example, what if a cyber-attack caused minimal damage to a more advanced country and significant damage to a less advanced country? Could only the less advanced country respond to the attack? The answer to this question, is likely that only the less advanced country could respond. While this answer adheres to the international laws of war, it seems rather illogical that the exact same attack could lead to such different defensive responses.¹⁶⁷ Even though the scales and effects test has been widely acknowledge in the UN Charter, Manual, and Koh’s speech, the test is anything but flawless.\n## C. Issues of Attribution\nThe issue of attribution may be the most troublesome of the many issues that arise in applying the international laws\n¹⁶⁵ See id.\n¹⁶⁶ See Nguyen, supra note 14, at 1124.\n¹⁶⁷ See id. at 1124-25.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nof war to cyber-warfare. Unlike traditional warfare when it is relatively simple to discover who launched an attack against a nation, a cyber-attack can be nearly impossible to attribute to a particular nation, especially if a non-state actor is working at the direction of a nation.¹⁶⁸ Such is true because the cyber world offers so many options for anonymity and hiding attacks behind other networks.¹⁶⁹ People experienced within the cyber world can easily forge or conceal their identity, especially if motivated to hide an illegal attack.¹⁷⁰ Moreover, even if a nation is identified, such nation can easily deny that the attack derived from their networks—instead claiming that they were hacked.¹⁷¹ Even more troublesome, if a non-state actor is identified as the originator of an attack, an accused nation could deny any nexus with the attacking non-state actor. The numerous loopholes involved with attributing an attack to a particular nation presents some serious problems in applying the international laws of war to cyber-warfare.\n---\n¹⁶⁸ *See e.g.,* Broad, Markoff &amp; Sanger, *supra* note 6 (explaining that no one is still one hundred percent certain where Stuxnet derived from)\n¹⁶⁹ *See* Nguyen, *supra* note 14, at 1104-05.\n¹⁷⁰ *See id.* at 1104-06.\n¹⁷¹ *See id.*\n*Volume XVIII 2014*                                                                 290\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\n## D. Applying the UN Charter and Tallinn Manual to an Attack on a Civilian Target\nIn this section, I will pose a couple of hypothetical situations to explain how a nation, specifically the United States, should respond to a cyber-attack that may or may not qualify as an act of cyber-warfare according to the UN Charter and the Manual—given Koh essentially adheres to the Manual. The two hypothetical situations involve (1) an attack on a civilian target that has some military aspects and (2) an attack on a purely civilian target. Notably, I will assume these attacks can be accurately attributed to the originator of the attack—a non-state actor directed by such state.\nSignificantly, this assumption would require the attack to affect the United States’ military to be considered having military characteristics. The issue of attribution is of such concern that the following examples could not be analyzed without making this assumption.\n### 1. ATTACK ON A CIVILIAN TARGET WITH MILITARY ASPECTS\nThe following fact pattern will present an opportunity to analyze an attack on a civilian target with military aspects: A foreign country attacks Boeing—a civilian aerospace company that, among many other things, helps the United States Military\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nresearch, test, and maintain aerospace technologies—via a cyber invasion that both steals and destroys both civilian and military related information.\nBefore moving forward and analyzing this attack under both the UN Charter and Manual, it is important to distinguish the espionage portion of the attack (the stealing) from the attacking portion of the attack (the destruction) because neither the UN Charter nor the Manual were created to analyze mere acts of espionage; but rather, they were created to analyze actual attacks.¹⁷² And to reiterate, we are assuming this attack can be accurately attributed to a non-sate actor working for such foreign country.\nUnder the UN Charter, this “attack” might constitute a use of force but unlikely would be classified as an armed attack. Importantly, only the military information that was destroyed could be considered in this analysis because the UN Charter requires the attack to have some sort of military aspect, and in this hypothetical, the civilian information lacks any sort of military character.¹⁷³ The destruction of the military information from Boeing could result in a use of force or armed attack depending on what exactly was destroyed and, more\n¹⁷² See supra Parts IVA.1, IV.B.1.\n¹⁷³ See supra Part IV.A.2.\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nimportantly, the consequence of destroying such information. If the destroyed military information involved details regarding national security that generated the scale and effects equivalent of military force, then the United States could likely classify the attack as a use of force. Classifying the attack as an armed attack, however, would be far more difficult because there was no physical damage in the sense of the UN Charter.¹⁷⁴ The United States could argue the destruction of computer files constitutes physical damage because such damage equates that of a kinetic attack, but this argument would be weak in these circumstances because the attack had no effect on Boeing’s operations like a kinetic attack would. Notably, this same type of analysis would be used regardless of where the information was destroyed, even if from the Pentagon.¹⁷⁵ Essentially, the scale and effects of the attack determine what actions are or are not allowed under the UN Charter. In short, this example epitomizes the rigorousness of the UN Charter’s requirement of military force and physical damage, especially in terms of cyber-warfare.\nUnder the Manual, a country potentially could have\n¹⁷⁴ See supra Part IV.A.4.\n¹⁷⁵ See supra Part IV (noting that the location being the Pentagon would likely cause of the information destroyed to have military character).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nan easier time defining this attack as a use of force and/or an armed attack. Unlike the UN Charter’s requirement of military character, the Manual strictly analyses the scale and effects of an attack; therefore, both the civilian and military information that was destroyed must be analyzed. In doing so, the United State must use the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, state involvement, military character, and presumptive legality.¹⁷⁶ When applying these factors to this hypothetical, it seems the attack would constitute a use force because of the attack’s mild severity, high invasiveness, partial military character, attributable state involvement, and presumptive illegality. While the attack seems to be a use of force, the attack will not likely be considered an armed attack, especially given the high standard provided by the Manual—an armed attack is the *gravest* form of use of force.¹⁷⁷ Here, the attack seems significant but not in the same category of the *gravest* uses of force. Thus, the attack will likely constitute a use of force but not an armed attack.\nGiven that under both the UN Charter and Manual this attack is merely a use of force but not an armed attack, the\n¹⁷⁶ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 51-52. (Cambridge University Press 2013).\n¹⁷⁷ See id. at 48.\nVolume XVIII 2014 294\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nUnited States would not be able to defensively respond via article 51 or rule 13.¹⁷⁸ Thus, the United States would have to respond by finding out why the foreign nation wanted to destroy such information and, moreover, the United States might have to destroy the information that was stolen.¹⁷⁹ Moreover, the United States could put political and economic pressure on the foreign country committing this illegal use of force.¹⁸⁰ The UN Charter also would provide the United States with the ability to request the UN’s assistance in properly responding to the attack.¹⁸¹ Alternatively, under the Manual, the United States could choose to take preemptive action via rule 15 in fear of the scale and effects of the destroyed information. Notably, the United States would have to show the immediacy and imminence of the foreign nation’s possible armed attack.¹⁸² Showing this immediacy and imminence would require more facts, but the more liberal attitude of the Manual can be seen in both the analyses of the attack as well as the United States’ ability to respond to this kind of attack\nEssentially, the Manual provides a more liberal outlook\n¹⁷⁸ See supra Part IV (noting that if it determined an attack constitutes a use of force, the defensive response must be necessary and proportionate).\n¹⁷⁹ See id.\n¹⁸⁰ See id.\n¹⁸¹ See supra Part IV.A.3.\n¹⁸² See supra Part.IV.B.4.c.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\non attacks that do not directly and physically damage something or someone, even if there are certain military aspects involved in the attack. While both the UN Charter and the Manual could allow the United States to classify this attack as a use of force—especially given the partial military characteristic of the attack—the Manual more easily provides such a classification and could allow the United States to take more action regarding this attack. In short, this hypothetical provides an example of how the Manual is more adaptive and on-point with attacks that could lead to cyber-warfare.\n## 2. ATTACK ON A PURELY CIVILIAN TARGET\nThe following fact pattern will present an opportunity to analyze an attack on a purely civilian target: A foreign country attacks the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) that results in the market crashing and/or freezing for a period of time.\nUnder the UN Charter, this attack would not constitute a use of force or armed attack. Attacking a country’s economy, while devastating, lacks any sort of military characteristic; thus, the UN Charter’s requirement of military force would not be met.¹⁸³ The United States could attempt to argue that even though the attack lacked any military character, the attack\n¹⁸³ See supra Part IV.A.1.\nVolume XVIII 2014 296\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\naffected the military somehow. This argument, however, would not be nearly as persuasive in this hypothetical as compared the previous hypothetical because the effect would be quite attenuated. In short, the complete lack of any military force and, seemingly, military effects would prevent the United States from classifying this attack as a use of force or an armed attack under the UN Charter.\nOnce again, the Manual provides a more liberal analysis of the attack than the UN Charter. To reiterate, the Manual does not require an attack to be of military character to qualify as a use of force or an armed attack.[184] Thus, only the scale and effects of the attack on the NYSE need to be analyzed—using the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, military character, state involvement, and presumptive legality.[185] The attack would likely be determined as a use of force because of its extended and severe detrimental effects, presumptive illegality, attributable state involvement, and intense invasiveness; however, classifying the attack as an armed attack would be more difficult—given an armed attack is the gravest form of use of force.[186] Nevertheless, the\nVolume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE United States could point out the importance of the NYSE and the collapse’s grave effect beyond the economy. While this hypothetical presents a controversial and difficult question, I believe the United States would be able to classify this attack as a use of force and an armed attack given the extremely detrimental and lasting effects of crashing the NYSE. The United States would have to deeply analyze each of the factors explained in the Manual to ensure certain prerequisites are met, but the United States would be able to defensively respond via rule 13 to such an attack.¹⁸⁷ Subsequently, the United States would have to properly respond with a proportionate and necessary attack.¹⁸⁸ In sum, under the Manual, such an attack that completely crashes the NYSE would constitute a use of force, and more importantly, an armed attack resulting in the United States’s ability to act in self-defense.\n## 3. SUMMARY OF HYPOTHETICAL SITUATIONS While both hypothetical situations seem relatively open for interpretation, there is a major lesson to be learned from the application of the UN Charter, Manual, and in turn, Koh’s speech: cyber-warfare presents an unprecedented such an attack could constitute an armed attack).\n¹⁸⁷ See id. at 53-59.\n¹⁸⁸ See id. at 59-60.\namount of uncertainty and vagueness in the context of the international laws of war. As seen, when the attack has certain military characteristics, the attack is much easier to define. Unfortunately, cyber-attacks need not and most likely will not be of strict military character, causing the UN Charter to seem obsolete in many situations. Thus, the liberal approach of the Manual functions more efficiently and accurately than that of the UN Charter in the cyber-warfare context. Effectively, each cyber-attack must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis, concentrating on how the scale and effects of the attack affect the government, military, and civilian population.\n## VI. Recommendation: A Possible Solution to the Issues in Applying the International Laws of War to Cyber-Warfare Because cyber-warfare is a new and evolving medium for warfare, an international convention must occur, and in turn, create an internationally recognized cyber-warfare treaty. While the UN Charter provides a legitimate basis for such a treaty, the UN Charter seems obsolete to handle the intricacies involved in cyber-warfare.¹⁸⁹ The Manual, for the most part, is successful in applying the rules of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but fails at the most critical point: functioning as a binding ¹⁸⁹ See supra Part.V.\nVolume XVIII 2014 299 Volume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE authority. Instead, it is merely functioning as “suggestions.”¹⁹⁰ Koh, who essentially agrees with the Manual, simply discussed the problems surrounding cyber-warfare, but no solutions whatsoever.¹⁹¹ Therefore, nations from around the world must come together and create binding rules for cyber-warfare before it is too late. In my opinion, the United States should address this problem now and be a leader in creating this treaty.\n## A. The Need for an International Convention, and in turn, an Internationally Recognized Cyber-Warfare Treaty With the UN Charter and the Manual presenting valuable rules, exceptions to such rules, and recommendations involving all types of warfare—including cyber-warfare—the next step for regulating cyber-warfare is to create a binding international treaty focusing solely on cyber-warfare. For the effective creation of such a treaty, nations from around the world—not just experts in the field—will have to work together during an international convention, in a similar fashion as the creation of the UN Charter. During this convention, I believe the United States should take a progressive stance on this issue and become the world leader in regulating cyber-warfare.\n¹⁹⁰ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 16.\n¹⁹¹ See supra Part.IV.C.1.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY Regarding the details of this treaty, different aspects of both the UN Charter and Manual should be used, yet the treaty should also include further provisions. Overall, the treaty should follow the substance of the Manual as it does a remarkable job at applying the UN charter to a cyber-warfare setting. Nevertheless, certain decisions have to be made where the UN Charter and Manual disagree. For example, I believe the treaty should follow the Manual’s usage of the scale and effects test for both use of force and armed attack.¹⁹² However, there needs to be a definition or a sort of sliding scale to quantify the scale and effects of an attack—beyond listing an open set of factors.¹⁹³ Moreover, in accordance with the Manual, there should be no need for military character or death to constitute use of force or an armed attack.¹⁹⁴ While this standard might seem too liberal, the rules regarding self-defense will combat this liberalness by requiring the response to be proportionate and necessary—as both the Manual and UN Charter explain.¹⁹⁵ Notably, the use of examples within the Manual help clarify its rules, with each example explaining certain aspects of the ¹⁹² See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-59.\n¹⁹³ See id. at 49-52.\n¹⁹⁴ See supra Parts IVA.1, IV.B.1.\n¹⁹⁵ See e.g., TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 59-60.\nVolume XVIII 2014 301 Volume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE rule; therefore, given the positive affect of these examples, such examples should also be used in this cyber-warfare treaty.¹⁹⁶ These examples will allow readers to truly understand the rules and, more importantly, their applicability in the real world.\nFurthermore, each nation should be forced to present their case to the other members of the treaty before taking action, unless the defensive response is an absolute and immediate necessity.\nThis “meeting” will prevent a nation from applying the treaty in any way it sees fit, regardless of the treaty’s true meaning and the beliefs of other countries. Moreover, like the Manual, the treaty should include factor tests whenever answers will not be clear.¹⁹⁷ These factors will allow countries to apply the facts of an attack to numerous factors as opposed to the strict reading of rules. Unlike the Manual, however, one of these factors should involve intent because the intent of an attacking nation should be taken into account when determining whether a country has illegally used force or an armed attack.¹⁹⁸ Lastly, like the UN Charter, the treaty should include some rule or article that provides that members of the treaty shall ensure that non- ¹⁹⁶ See e.g., id. at 55 (giving an example of an attack on a civilian target).\n¹⁹⁷ See e.g., id. at 49-52 (noting that this treaty should not be over-dependent on such factor tests).\n¹⁹⁸ See id. at 53-59 (noting that the Manual does not consider intent).\nVolume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE members still act in accordance with the treaty but only to the extent that is necessary to maintain international peace.¹⁹⁹ This provision would allow the treaty to have a worldwide affect, beyond the countries that signed. The treaty, effectively, will use the Manual’s application of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but bind of all member-nations to the treaty, much like the UN Charter did with United Nations members.\nIn short, some sort of binding action must occur to regulate cyber-warfare, and the United States should be at the forefront of this movement. In regulating cyber-warfare, the ideals and the binding effect of the UN Charter should be applied to cyber-warfare in a similar fashion as the Tallinn Manual. By taking action in this questionable area of law, the United States can ensure its safety now and into the future.\n## VII. Conclusion The lack of regulations involving cyber-warfare is a growing and real threat. Cyber-warfare might be a confusing and seemingly futuristic concept, but countries from around the world need to address this lack of regulation sooner than ¹⁹⁹ See e.g., U.N. Charter art. 2(6) (“The Organization shall ensure that states which are not Members of the United Nations act in accordance with these Principles so far as may be necessary for the maintenance of international peace and security.”).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY later. While countries can attempt to apply the UN Charter to cyber-warfare situations, the UN Charter lacks the flexibility and modernization to properly handle the intricacies of cyber-attacks. The UN Charter is undoubtedly effective in handling kinetic warfare; however, it seems obsolete in the cyber-warfare context. Experts in the field recognized this issue and, in response, created the Tallinn Manual, which was effective in applying the UN Charter to cyber-warfare. Nevertheless, the Manual functions simply as a suggestion booklet and provides zero binding rules or regulations. Therefore, the United States needs to take the lead in regulating cyber-warfare. The United States needs to hold an international conference that will produce a binding treaty involving the regulations of cyber-warfare. This treaty should use the Manual’s concepts of applying the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but needs to go further in an attempt to leave as few questions unanswered as possible. While such a task will be difficult, the difficulties in creating a cyber-warfare treaty are minimal compared to the damage that will occur without such regulations.\nVolume XVIII 2014 304"

Introduction: The Growing Concerns of Cyber-Warfare\nThe threat of cyber-warfare is a current and continuing issue that our nation must address. President Obama, the Department of Defense (DoD), and even the private sector comprehend this issue and have been attempting to update our defense strategies to better protect this nation. The following quotations explain how concerned authorities from all levels of the nation are with the threat of cyber-warfare:\nIt’s the great irony of our Information Age -- the very technologies that empower us to create and to build also empower those who would disrupt and destroy. And this paradox -- seen and unseen -- is something that we experience every day... cyber threat is one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation.\nOur daily life, economic vitality, and national security depend on a stable, safe, and resilient cyberspace. . . . Yet cyber intrusions and attacks have increased dramatically over the last decade. . . .\n[Google is] under attack all the time, primarily via unsophisticated channels . . . I can’t go into detail to demonstrate the level of sophistication, but [the company] doesn’t use that term lightly, and it is quite deliberate. . . . This is truly, truly beyond the pale . . . The political nature of this.\n Barrack Obama, President of the United States of America, *Remarks by the President on Securing our Nation’s Cyber Infrastructure* (May 29, 2009).\n *Cybersecurity Overview*, HOMELAND SECURITY, http://www.dhs.gov/cybersecurity-overview (last visited Oct. 24, 2013).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n. . is chilling.\nThe threat of cyber-warfare is not only real; the threat is increasing daily as many countries use and develop information warfare systems. It is important to note, not all these warfare systems are created solely to attack—some are created for defense purposes. Nevertheless, cyber-warfare is a real and dangerous threat that has already affected many countries around the world. Given the tangible and mounting threat of cyber-warfare, the United States must continue to build on the already existing policies and strategies that currently exist. Moreover, the United States must be prepared to classify and possibly respond to a cyber-attack on either a governmental or\n Kim Zetter, Google to Stop Censoring Search Results in China After Hack Attack, WIRED (Jan. 12, 2010), http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/01/google-censorship-china/.\n Natasha Solce, The Battlefield of Cyberspace: The Inevitable New Militray Branch—The Cyber Force, 18 ALB.

What is Cyber-Warfare: Definitions and Conflicts\n### Therein\nBefore moving into an in-depth discussion regarding cyber-warfare, the possibility of a cyber-attack on a government or civilian target, and a cyber-attack’s relation to the international rules of war, a definition of cyber-warfare must be established. The definition’s importance is exemplified in the international law of war setting because an attack must be analyzed using the “use of force” and/or “armed attack” tests, which are further discussed later in this paper.\n See generally TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Cambridge University Press 2013) (explaining the use of force in terms of cyber-warfare); U.N. Charter art. 51 (explaining the amount force needed to respond to an armed attack).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n## A. Basic Definition of Cyber-Warfare\nThe most basic definition of cyber-warfare can be established by combining the terms “cyber” and “war.” Cyber is defined in an English dictionary as “of, relating to, or involving computers or computer networks.” War, as defined in a legal dictionary, is “[h]ostile conflict by means of armed forces, carried on between nations, states, or rulers, or sometimes between parties within the same nation or state.” Thus, cyber-warfare would be a hostile conflict via armed forces that involves computers or computer networks. The problem with this definition is that it requires “armed forces,” whereas cyber-warfare usually does not include actual armed forces invading or defending a country. To the contrary, cyber-warfare usually involves a conflict within computer systems, which were programmed by humans, but does not involve forces equipped with actual kinetic weapons.\n## B. Definition Based on the Object Being Attacked\nBeyond this basic attempt to define cyber-warfare,\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\ntwo other mainstream ideologies have defined cyber-warfare: object-based vs. medium-based. The object based definition concentrates on whether the object being attacked is “cyber” in nature. The U.S. National Research Council created such a definition in 2009 in an attempt to clarify cyber-warfare and cyber-attacks. The definition described a cyber-attack as “the use of deliberate actions—perhaps over an extended period of time—to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy adversary computer systems or networks or the information and/or programs resident in or transiting these systems or networks.” Other commentators have offered similar definitions, such as defining cyber-warfare as “actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation’s computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption.” The main problem with any object-based definition is that it is overly broad; that is, such definitions would include attacks on computers via kinetic weapons. For example, these definitions would define a\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nbombing of a server farm as a cyber-attack that could lead to cyber-warfare; however, the act of using a physical bomb seems far beyond the purview of a cyber-attack. Therefore, such object-based definitions of cyber-warfare, and in turn cyber-attacks, are too broad in nature.\nAlternatively, object-based definitions of cyber-warfare are equally too narrow. Because object-based definitions require the object being attacked to be cyber in nature, these definitions would exclude attacks from a computer network that affect non-computers. For example, the Stuxnet attacks involved a malicious worm that used computer networks to attack, but and actually affected Iran’s nuclear centrifuges. Thus, under the object-based definition of cyber-warfare, the Stuxnet attack would not have qualified as a cyber-attack or an act of cyber-warfare. In short, the object-based definition of cyber-warfare fails in numerous ways, being both overly broad and narrow.\n## C. Definition Based on the Medium Being Used to Attack\nThe medium-based definition concentrates on whether the object *used* in the attack is “cyber” in nature. Essentially, a medium-based definition of cyber-warfare focuses on the\nkinetic attacks have already been readily defined in a number of international treaties and laws of war).\n See Dennis Fisher &amp; Paul Roberts, *Spotlight Series: Stuxnet*, THREATPOST: THE KASPERSKY LAB SECURITY NEWS SERVICE.\nVolume XVIII 2014 254\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nmethod used in the attack rather than the target being attacked—much in the same way an aerial attack involves planes. The DoD seems to imply this type of understanding through its definition of cyberspace operations: “[t]he employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace.” Importantly, this definition highlights the medium used in the operation, which parallels the way a medium-based definition of cyber-warfare focuses on whether cyberspace is used during an attack. An example of a medium-based definition for cyber-warfare can be seen in the Cambridge Dictionary as “the activity of using the internet to attack a country’s computers in order to damage things such as communication and transport systems or water and electricity supplies.” Moreover, a medium-based definition works best with the international laws of war because these laws rely on concepts that revolve around the force exerted on a target as opposed to the type of target being\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nattacked. For the forgoing reasons, a medium-based definition should be used to define cyber-warfare. Thus, the definition of cyber-warfare should look similar, but not necessarily exactly like, the definition provided in the Cambridge Dictionary.\nFor example, a proper definition of cyber-warfare could be: hostile acts via cyberspace that damage or disturb a country’s infrastructure or related networks for a governmental or national security purpose.\n## III. Potential Types of Cyber-Attacks that Could Occur During Cyber-Warfare\nNow that a logical and adequate definition of cyber-warfare has been established, understanding the types of attacks a nation could experience becomes imperative to understanding how and if an attack could constitute an act of cyber-warfare. There are three main categories of cyber-attacks: syntactic, semantic, and hybrid attacks.\n### A. Syntactic Attacks\nSyntactic attacks are aimed at a computer’s operating\n See e.g., TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 48-49 (Cambridge University Press 2013) (explaining the use of force factors—severity, directness, measurability of effects, etc.); U.N. Charter art. 51 (implying the use of self-defense must be proportionate).\n See supra note 21.\n Susan W. Brenner &amp; Marc D. Goodman, In Defense of Cyberterrorism: An Argument for Anticipating Cyberattacks, 2022 U. ILL. J. L. TECH &amp; POL’Y 1, 27-42 (2002).\nVolume XVIII 2014 256\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nsystem and “modify the logic of the system in order to introduce delays or to make the system unpredictable.” There are two main types of syntactic attacks: penetration and denial of service (DoS) attacks.\n## 1. PENETRATION ATTACKS\nPenetration attacks, as the name indicates, penetrate a computer system or computer network and transport whatever the programmer wants to “drop” into the system/network. Examples of penetration attacks include the implantation of malware, viruses, Trojan horses, and worms. All these types of penetration attacks cause actual damage to the system/network in different ways. For example, worms replicate within the system but do not infect the host computer; nevertheless, the worm spreads throughout the entire system and eventually can cause the system to completely shut down. Viruses effect computer systems is a different way, creating codes that become active once a user opens the file, and subsequently, the\n\nvirus corrupts, destroys, or steals files. Any of these types of penetration attacks can lead to the destruction or alterations of a computer system, and in turn, can lead to physical or economic damage.\n## 2. DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS\nDenial of service (DoS) attacks disrupt a computer system or network by overloading the system/network, and thus, reduce its functionality. Essentially, a DoS attack can completely shut down a system/network by flooding the target with false requests for service, therefore causing the system to overload. When this happens, legitimate requests for service are blocked, and the actual purpose of the system is devastated. Importantly, for anonymity reasons, attackers will often use distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks. A DDoS attack has the same purpose as a DoS attack; however, the attacker uses other people’s computers in addition to their own, which makes tracing the source of the attack much more difficult. Both DoS\n *Id.*\n See e.g., *Fisher &amp; Roberts*, *supra* note 19 (explaining how the Stuxnet worm caused actual damage to Iranian nuclear program).\n JOSEPH MIGGA KIZZA, *COMPUTER NETWORK SECURITY AND CYBER ETHICS* 76 (2002).\n Mindi McDowell, *Understanding Denial-of-Service Attacks*, UNITED STATES COMPUTER EMERGENCY READINESS TEAM (Feb. 6, 2013), http://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-015.\n *Id.*\nVolume XVIII 2014 258\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nand DDoS attacks can harm a nation via physical or economic damages.\n## B. Semantic Attacks\nSemantic attacks do not attempt to shut down, steal information, or destroy a computer network/system; rather, they affect the accuracy of the network’s information. Essentially, “[a] system under semantic attack operates and will be perceived as operating correctly (otherwise the semantic attack is failure), but it will generate answers at variance with reality.” While such an attack seems petty, computer users tend to accept the information given to them, especially if such information derives from a government website. For example, if a semantic attack occurred to an important government website, such information could cause people ignore a legitimate threat or falsely perceive an innocent act as a legitimate attack. Such a semantic attack could cause people to unnecessarily bunker down or, alternatively, riot out of fear. Thus, such a semantic attack could have severe consequences\n See e.g., John Markoff, *Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks*, New York Times (Aug. 12, 2008), http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html?_r=0 (explaining that the Russian cyber-attack on Georgia consisted of a DoS attack).\n Brenner &amp; Goodman, *supra* note 24, at 31-32.\n See Antolin-Jenkins, *supra* note 28, at 140 (noting how gullible or ignorant many computer users are when reading information off the internet).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\non the population. As demonstrated above, semantic attacks can be as detrimental to a nation as syntactic attacks.\n## C. Hybrid Attacks\nHybrid attacks are exactly what the term seems to imply: a hybrid of syntactic and semantic cyber-attacks. Such attacks have the greatest likelihood of causing the most destruction because the attacker could actually destroy a certain computer system (and, in turn, whatever other infrastructure was affected) and then tell the people that something completely different happened—only furthering the confusion, distrust, and destruction.\n See id. at 140-41 (noting that such attacks could cause great civil unrest); Brenner &amp; Goodman, supra note 24 at 31-39.\n See Antolin-Jenkins, supra note 28, at 140.\n See id. For example,\nTerrorists can mount complex attacks by combining syntactic and semantic attacks. Imagine that terrorists target Boston, Atlanta, Miami, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles for an attack which begins with a syntactic assault on computer systems that stops the delivery of state public assistance. General public awareness of the attack will emerge gradually, as successive waves of frustrated welfare recipients file complaints with the appropriate agencies. Eventually, the realization will spread that the distribution of benefits had been deliberately shut down. Once it becomes clear that the funds are not coming, the terrorists can follow up with a semantic attack assigning responsibility for their efforts to carefully-selected right-wing groups whose views are known to carry at least the taint of racial bias. If the terrorists manage to sustain the welfare gridlock, the freezing of the resources upon which thousands depend for their survival will produce civil disobedience and localized chaos. National Guardsmen might have to be sent into these cities to maintain\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nWith an understanding of the definition of cyber-warfare and the types of cyber-attacks that could occur during cyber-warfare, we must move forward to the international laws of war that apply to any sort of attack, whether kinetic or cyber.\n## IV. International Laws of War: An Application to Cyber-Warfare\nIn this section, I will explain the major components of the international laws of war in the cyber-warfare context. First, I will briefly explain the United Nations Charter (UN Charter) and how it applies to cyber-warfare. Subsequently, I will discuss the creation and purpose of the Tallinn Manual (the Manual). And lastly, I will explain the United States’ approach and strategies to handing the possibility of cyber-warfare. Each of these components is essential in understanding how to properly respond to an act of warfare, specifically cyber-\norder. To make things even more interesting, the terrorists can then direct a syntactic attack at ATM and banking system computers in these cities. Such a shutdown will add to the problem by causing outrage among citizens who do not depend on welfare funds. The cumulative effects of all these efforts will be riots, targeted violence and a National Guard stretched to its limit (which will create an excellent opportunity for the terrorists to stage a CBERN attack in other areas of the country).\nBrenner &amp; Goodman, supra note 24, at 39-40.\n\nwarfare.\n## A. The United Nations Charter\nThe UN Charter functions as the backbone to the current international laws of war. It sets forth many rules and guidelines that apply to war; including starting a conflict, responding to an attack, and how the UN should respond to an attack on a member nation. Understanding the UN Charter is crucial to understanding the later developments that deal specifically with cyber-warfare.\n## 1. GENERAL BACKGROUND\nThe UN Charter was created to “save succeeding generations from the scourge of war . . . to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights . . . to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other resources of international law . . . and to promote social progress.” Moreover, the overarching goals of the UN Charter were to allow countries to live tolerantly and in peace, to strengthen international peace and security, to ensure that armed forces are a last resort, and to promote\n See History of the United Nations, http://www.un.org/en/aboutun/history/charter_history.shtml (last visited Oct. 30, 2013).\n See generally U.N. Charter arts. 2, 4, 42, 51 (explaining the rules regarding starting a conflict, responding to an attack, and assisting an ally who has been attacked).\n Id. pmbl.\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nsocial and economic advancement for all people. Notably, the United States is a member of United Nations along with many other world powers, including Russia, China, and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, the UN Charter is binding upon the United States under Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution. As discussed below, the UN Charter successfully created rules that allow for a far more humane world, even in the face of war, but unfortunately, these rules may be obsolete in terms of cyber-warfare.\n## 2. ARTICLE 2(4): PROHIBITING THE THREAT OR USE OF FORCE\nArticle 2, paragraph 4 of the UN Charter provides a quintessential rule: “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.” Essentially, this rule prohibits a country from threatening or using “force” on another country, provided\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nthe exception of self-defense discussed later in this section. Unfortunately, however, the term “threat or use of force” is never defined in the UN Charter, causing unrest and numerous debates. Nevertheless, academics over the years have determined that this term involves only the uses or threat of *military* forces or attacks affecting the victim nation’s *military*, precluding economic and political coercion. Notably, the UN Charter also specifically precludes espionage.\nThis rule is important in the cyber-warfare context because article 4(2) would prevent a victim country from attacking the aggressor country that committed the cyber-attack. Thus, a country who falls victim to an act of cyber-warfare may not retaliate unless such an attack falls within the self-defense exception of article 51 via qualifying as an armed attack. The vagueness concerning the meaning of “use of force” presents an issue in the cyber-warfare context because at what point does a cyber-attack qualify as a use of *military* force?\n *Id.* art. 51.\n See generally *id.* arts. 2, 4, 41, 42, 51 (noting that there is no definition section or individual definition for “threat or use of force”).\n See e.g., MATTHEW C. WAXMAN, *Cyber Attacks as “Force” under UN Charter Article 2(4)*, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE CHANGING CHARACTER OF WAR 43 (Raul A. “Pete” Pedorzo et al. eds. 2011).\n See *id.*\n See U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4; WAXMAN, *supra* note 54, at 44-45.\n See U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4; WAXMAN, *supra* note 54, at 44-45.\nVolume XVIII 2014 264\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\n## 3. ARTICLES 41 AND 42\nArticles 41 and 42 of the UN Charter provide directions for how the UN can support a country that is being attacked. Article 41 focuses on a way to counter an attack that does not mount to a “use of force,” whereas article 42 provides the UN the power to use force to counter such an attack, but only if it is determined that the attack qualified as a “use of force” and article 41 remedies would be inadequate. Article 41’s non-forceful remedies would include economic blockades and political pressure. While these two articles do not analyze whether a country can defend itself, they do provide structure and direction for how UN members should respond to an attack on their own country or on an ally. Primarily, articles 41 and 42 allow the UN to analyze the extent of the attack—whether there was a use of force—and, subsequently, allow the UN to\n See U.N. Charter arts. 41, 42.\n See id. Article 41 states “The Security Council may decide what measures not involving the use of armed force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and it may call upon the Members of the United Nations to apply such measures. These may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations. Id. art 41. If the UN decides that article 41 relief would be insufficient, it may “take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.

While the substance of articles 41 and 42 are important, the most essential aspect of these articles is their purpose—to prevent forceful responses to an attack unless absolutely necessary to maintain international security and peace.\nIn discussing cyber-warfare, the most important aspect of articles 41 and 42 is their purpose as discussed directly above. Thus, unless there is a clear use of force during a cyber-attack, it seems the United States or any other member of the UN could only respond via a non-forceful response—i.e., an economic blockade or political pressures.\n## 4. ARTICLE 51\nArticle 51 of the UN Charter provides the exception to general rule of article 2(4), which prohibits the use of force against other nations. Article 51 states:\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately\n See id.\n See id.\n See id. pmbl, arts. 41, 42.\n See id. arts. 41, 42.\nVolume XVIII 2014 266\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nreported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.\nWhile Article 51 expressly creates an exception for the use of force in self-defense, some issues arise in the cyber-warfare context, especially when looking at the specific wording. Much like the issue with our basic definition of cyber-warfare, article 51 allows a nation to defend itself only if the attack amounts to an “armed attack,” which a cyber-attack would never seem to qualify as. Nevertheless, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) adjusted the definition of an armed attack by defining it more broadly and explaining that armed attacks “do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.” Thus, the term armed attack actually functions more as an expansion to “use of force” as opposed to an attack with actual kinetic weapons.\nMoreover, the ICJ decided in *Nicaragua v. United States* that\n *Id.* art. 51. (emphasis added).\n *See id.*\n *See supra* Part II.A.; U.N. Charter art. 51.\n International Court of Justice, *The legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* (Jul. 8, 1996), http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?sum=498&amp;code=unan&amp;p1=3&amp;p2=4&amp;case=95&amp;k=e1&amp;p3=5.\n *See id.*\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nthe “scale and effects” of an attack are the determining factors of whether such action constitutes an armed attack, not the inclusion of kinetic weapons. Therefore, a cyber-attack could qualify as an armed attack if its scale and effects reached a level equivalent to that of an attack with kinetic weapons. Given the working definition of armed attack, article 51 will play a role in the way and extent the United States responds to a cyber-attack.\nThe UN Charter’s importance is unparalleled in determining whether or not a nation has been the victim of force, whether such country can legally retaliate via self-defense, and what actions the UN can take in support of the victim country. While the UN Charter is of great help in determining all of the aforementioned questions, many issues still arise when trying to apply the UN Charter to cyber-warfare.\n## B.

Before delving into the background and specifics of the Manual, one must understand that the Manual is not binding on any nation.\n## 1. GENERAL BACKGROUND\nThe Manual, which was published in 2013, was put together by an international group of approximately twenty-five experts from 2009 to 2012. These experts met in Tallinn, Estonia, which in turn, helped produce the name of the Manual. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), specifically NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, invited these experts to put together the rules of cyber-warfare into a single document. The Manual was put together in response to the growing fear of cyber-warfare and, more specifically, the lack of well-defined rules regulating cyber-warfare. Notably, the Manual only discusses the laws\n See id.\n Id. (explaining the Manual is a “non-binding document applying existing law to cyber-warfare”).\n Id. at 16-17, 22 (noting these experts included legal practitioners, technical experts, and academics).\n Id. at 22.\n Id.\n Id. at 17-18 (explaining the Manual was created “in hope of bringing some degree of clarity to the complex legal issues surrounding cyber operations, with particular attention paid to those involving the jus ad bellum and the jus\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nof cyber-warfare, thus excluding cyber-espionage (to the extent espionage does not involve “use of force”) and cyber-crimes. To reiterate, “it is essential to understand that the Tallinn Manual is not an official document” and, thus, is not binding on any nation.\n## 2. RULES 11 AND 12: DEFINITIONS OF FORCE AND THREAT OF FORCE\nImportantly, and unlike the UN Charter, the Manual actually defines both the crucial terms “use of force” and “threat of force.” Starting with these definitions will allow for a better understanding of the Manual, even though these definitions come after some important rules within the Manual.\n### a. Rule 11: Definition of Use of Force\nThe Manual directly refers back to Nicaragua v. United States when determining what actions constitute a use of in bello”).\n *Id.* at 18.\n *Id.* at 23. Nevertheless, the Manual could function in a similar way to the Lieber Code—an aspirational attempt to regulate warfare during the civil war—in that the Lieber Code eventually “became a core text in the modern laws of war recognized worldwide, and many elements of his code continue to inform our public debate how best to respond to a new form of warfare in both an effective and a moral manner.” Nick Beard, *The Liber Codes*, *THE NEW YORK TIMES: THE OPINION PAGES* (Apr. 24, 2013, 12:59 PM), http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/the-lieber-codes/?_r=0.\n *TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE* 47-53.\n *Id.* at 45, 47-53 (noting that the Prohibition of Threat or Use of Force, Rule 10, comes before the definitions of “use of force” and “threat of force”).\nVolume XVIII 2014 270\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nforce—applying the “scale and effects” test. While the scale and effects test is not black and white, it provides a nation with a decent idea of what constitutes a use of force. The Manual, however, does create some black and white rules. For example, the Manual unequivocally states that “[a]cts that injure or kill persons or damage or destroy objects are unambiguously uses of force.” Notably, like the UN Charter, the Manual excludes economic and political coercion from qualifying as use of force. The Manual, moreover, explicitly rejects the notion that a non-destructive cyber-attack that is intended solely to undermine the confidence in a government would qualify as a use of force. As the Manual progresses through the definition of use of force, it designates eight factors that are supposed to help a nation determine whether a non-obvious act qualifies as a use of force—essentially adding factors to the scale and effects test. The list of factors includes the following: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects,\n See id. at 47; Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. United States), 1986 I.C.J. 14, 103-04 (June 27).\n Id.\n See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 49.\n Id.\n See id. at 48.\n Id. (stating that “merely funding a hacktivist group conducting cyber operations as part of an insurgency would not be a use of force”).\n Id. at 49-52.\n\nmilitary character, state involvement, and presumptive legality. This definition of use of force, while not black and white, should greatly help nations determine what constitutes a use of force in the cyber-warfare setting.\n## b. Rule 12: Definition of Threat of Force\nRule 12 of the Manual breaks down the functional meaning of “threat of force” in the cyber-warfare context. Importantly, the rule explains that a threat could occur in two situations: (1) “a cyber operation that is used to communicate a threat to use force” and (2) “a threat carried out by any means . . . to carry out cyber operations qualifying as use of force.” The rule further notes that a demand need not accompany the threat to qualify as such under this rule; however, actions alone that seem threatening do not qualify as a threat because a threat must be “communicative in nature.” The rule also states that a threat of force could technically derive form a nation that seems unequipped to follow through will such a threat; nonetheless, it’s the threat that matters. Interestingly, the rule explains that\n *Id.* (explaining out that the list of factors is not exhaustive and functions only as a starting point).\n *Id.* at 52-53.\n *Id.* at 52.\n *Id.* at 53 (explaining that developing technology that could be used in an act that qualifies as a use of force *does not* qualify as a threat of force).\n *Id.* (noting the experts were split with this portion of the rule).\nVolume XVIII 2014 272\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\na nation will not be considered to have actually made a threat of force, even if that nation makes such a threat and has the capability of following through with such threat, as long as that nation does not truly intend on attacking—essentially requiring actual intent. Much like the definition of use of force, this definition lacks perfect clarity and contains many intricacies, but should be of great help in determining what actually constitutes a threat of force.\n## 3. RULE 10: PROHIBITION OF THREAT OR USE OF FORCE\nRule 10 of the Manual parallels article 2(4) of the UN Charter by making “[a] cyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force . . . unlawful.” The commentary following Rule 10 clarifies that the “use of force” does not need to be committed by a country’s armed forces; rather, the force could derive from an intelligence agency or any private contractor of the nation. Rule 10 also discusses a nation “intervening” in another nation’s affairs—political, economic, social, cultural, or otherwise. The rule explains that it is unlawful for another nation to intervene but goes on to explain that the term\n *Id.* (noting, once again, that the experts were split with this portion of the rule).\n *See id.* at 45 (Cambridge University Press 2013); U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4 (noting that both prohibit the threat or use of force).\n *TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE* 46.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n\"intervene\" does have the same meaning as in a layman context; instead, intervention in the cyber-war context, as well as for the UN Charter, must involve coercion. The rule further explains that an unlawful act of intervention does not per se qualify as a use of force; the intervention still must breach the threshold for use of force independently. Thus, when determining whether an intervention is unlawful, a nation must ascertain if coercion is involved, and moreover, must decide if the intervention reached the level of use of force. Fundamentally, Rule 10 applies article 2(4) of the UN Charter to the cyber-warfare setting.\n## 4. RULES 13, 14, 15 AND 16: THE RIGHT AND REGULATIONS FOR SELF-DEFENSE AND COLLECTIVE SELF-DEFENSE\nRules 13, 14, 15, and 16 of the Manual all explain the ability of a victim nation to launch a defensive response—in a parallel manner to article 51 of the UN Charter. Rule 13 discusses an individual nation’s right to protect itself; rule 14 examines how an act of self-defense must be necessary and proportionate to the original attack; rule 15 delves into\n *Id.* at 47 (“intervention pure and simple is not intervention [in the UN Charter or Tallinn Manual context]”).\n *Id.* at 46.\n *Id.* at 46-47; see UN Charter art. 51.\n See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 53-64.\nVolume XVIII 2014 274\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nthe ability of a nation to preemptively strike in an act of self-defense; and rule 16 examines the possibility of collective self-defense, that is a third party nation(s) coming to the aid of a victim nation. These rules are essential to the completeness of the Manual, especially in the Manual’s attempt to mimic article 51 of the UN Charter.\n## a. Rule 13: Self-Defense Against Armed Attack\nRule 13 of the Manual allows a nation to exercise the right of self-defense, given that such nation faced an attack—cyber or kinetic—that qualified as an armed attack. The term “armed attack” is quantified by the scale and effects of the attack, much like the use of force threshold in rule 11, but has an even heightened threshold beyond use of force. Plainly, an armed attack is the “gravest” form of a use of force. Unfortunately, however, the Manual never defines what the exact threshold is for the scale and effects test—only causing confusion. The scale and effects of an attack, though, must\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nbe reasonably foreseeable. Therefore, an attack that causes grave damage far beyond any reasonable foresight would not constitute an armed attack. Notably, an armed attack must have a trans-border component; thus, a purely domestic attack can never qualify as an armed attack within the Manual’s framework. The rule further explains that an armed attack can originate from a state or a non-state actor who is directed by the state to take such actions. Additionally, the rule states that individual attacks that alone do not qualify as armed attacks can be classified as armed attacks if that single attack is just one in a series of attacks. Accordingly, aggregated non-armed attacks can elevate and cross the threshold of an armed attack. The comments for rule 13 continue in detail about the irrelevance of intentions, the ability of a third party nation to defend itself if the scale and effects of the attack bleed over borders, and the ability of a victim nation to retaliate against persons who are located in an innocent third party nation—so as long the victim nation has permission to do so or the innocent third party nation\napplied on a case-by-case basis).\n *Id.* at 56.\n *Id.* at 54.\n *Id.* at 54-58 (detailing the intricacies and problems with attributing a non-state actor’s actions to a state).\n *Id.* at 55 (explaining that there must be convincing evidence that the multiple attacks are related).\nVolume XVIII 2014 276\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nis unable to take action. In short, a nation has the right to defend itself if attacked by another nation via an armed attack as determined by the scale and effects test.\n## b. Rule 14: Necessity and Proportionality\nEven if it is determined that a nation has the right to defend itself—either via kinetic or cyber action—that nation’s defensive response must be necessary and proportionate. Simply put, if any non-use of force action could be taken to solve the problem, such action must be taken. Notably, this “necessity” is judged from the victim nation’s perspective. The rule also discusses proportionality. Proportionality addresses how much force a victim nation may use in the defensive action. Factors such as scale, scope, duration, and intensity play a role in this determination. Importantly, this proportionality test does not require a victim nation to mirror the scale, scope, duration, and intensity of the offensive attack; but rather, the defensive action must be proportionate to the\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nforce needed to successfully defend against the offensive attack. Moreover, the rule indicates that kinetic attacks may be used in defense of certain cyber-attacks, given that the kinetic attack is necessary and proportionate. The rule concerning necessity and proportionality is of great importance when deciding how to properly respond to an offensive armed attack.\n## c. Rule 15: Imminence and Immediacy\nThe Manual takes a step beyond the UN Charter by detailing when a nation can preemptively defend itself and the general time frame allowed for a defensive attack. Rule 15 specifically allows for preemptive defense actions if an armed attack from an enemy nation is imminent. To be considered imminent, the need to defend must be “instant, overwhelming, [and] leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.” Interestingly, the experts involved in writing\n *Id.* (indicating that the defensive attack is judged on “the level of force needed to successfully mount a defense . . . more force may be necessary, or less force may be sufficient [ ] to repel the attack or defeat one that is imminent”).\n *Id.*\n *See id.* at 59-60.\n *See id.* at 60-63.\n *Id.* at 60. (noting the Manual uses the term “anticipatory self-defence”).\n *Id.* (quoting Letter from Daniel Webster to Lord Ashburton (Aug. 6, 1842), reprinted in 2 *INTERNATIONAL LAW DIGEST* 412 (John Bassett Moore ed. 1906)).\nVolume XVIII 2014 278\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nthe Manual chose to use this standard because of its flexibility and applicability for case-by-case analyses. Regarding the immediacy of the defensive response, factors such as the period necessary to identify the attacker, the temporal proximity between the attack and response, and the time required to prepare a response are considered. Additionally, the rule discusses the length of time allowed for continuous defensive responses, stating that the victim nation “must reasonably conclude that that further cyber operations are likely to follow,” or else such nation could be liable for the continuing defensive responses. Therefore, a nation must be cautious in preemptively attacking an enemy nation, attacking the enemy nation at a too attenuated period of time, or attacking the enemy nation for too long a period of time.\n## d. Rule 16: Collective Self-Defense\nThe Manual allows a third party nation to assist a victim nation, but only if the victim nation requests such assistance. More than one third of a party nation can help a victim nation, but in any situation involving collective self-defense, both the\n See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 61 (noting that this standard was not universally agreed to).\n Id. at 62.\n Id. at 63.\n See id. at 60-64.\n Id. at 63.\n\nassisting and victim nations must determine that the offensive act qualifies as an armed attack or imminent armed attack. Moreover, the assisting nation must still follow the rules of necessity, proportionality, imminence, and immediacy. Notably, an assisting nation can only aid to the extent that the victim nation condones. For example, if the victim state only wants to respond via a cyber action, the assisting nation cannot use kinetic weapons—even if the use of such weapons would be allowed under the rules of the Manual. The Manual also recognizes certain *ad hoc* agreements as constituting consent of the victim state, i.e. NATO agreements. Essentially, collective self-defense follows the same rules discussed above yet also contains additional rules to protect the victim state from losing control over the defensive response.\n## 5. SUMMARY OF THE TALLINN MANUAL\nAs valuable and progressive as the Manual might be, it still suffers from not being binding on any nation, therefore, functioning only as “a product of a group of independent experts acting solely in their personal capacity.” Nevertheless,\n *Id.*\n *Id.* at 64.\n *Id.* at 63.\n *See id.* at 59-64.\n *Id.* at 23.\nVolume XVIII 2014 280\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nthe Manual provides a solid basis for possible future codifications regarding the international laws of cyber-warfare. By formulating an authority that applies the UN Charter and many other recognized international principles of law to a cyber-warfare setting, the Manual has greatly advanced the understanding of how the international laws of war will apply to cyber-warfare.\n## C. United States’ Strategies and Approaches\nWhile the United States has not created an official policy in the same light or depth as the Tallinn Manual, President Obama has signed several executive orders and presidential policy directives that discuss how the United States needs to better protect itself, specifically its critical infrastructure, from the possibility of cyber-attacks. These orders and directives, however, solely discuss how the United States can better protect itself via improved communications and updated cyber-security tactics. They gloss over how the United States would and could respond to a cyber-attack—specifically an attack that could lead to cyber-warfare. The most relevant and\n See e.g., Exec.

Order No. 13,636, 78 C.F.R. 33, 11739-44; Presidential Policy Directive 21, *Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience* (Feb. 12, 2013).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\neducational information regarding the United States’ policies about cyber-warfare are seen through the State Department’s Legal Advisor’s, Harlod Koh, speech at the United States Cyber Command Conference.\n## 1. HAROLD KOH’S SPEECH AT THE UNITED STATES CYBER COMMAND CONFERENCE\nThe timing of Koh’s speech was impeccable and purposeful as it was given a mere three weeks after the non-official release of the Tallinn Manual—providing a strong indication that the speech was a direct response to the ideas and policies within the Manual. Much like the Manual, Koh acknowledged that international principles of law should apply to cyber-warfare and emphasized that the cyber world is anything but law-free. Moreover, Koh applied the “use of force” test of the UN Charter article 2(4) and gave a number of factors (like the Manual) including, “the context of the event, the actor perpetrating the action (recognizing challenging issues of attribution in cyberspace), the target and location, [and the]\n Harold Honhgu Koh, Legal Advisor of the Dep’t of State, International Law in Cyberspace, Address to the USCYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference (Sept. 18, 2012), available at http://www.state.gov/s/l/releases/remarks/197924.htm [hereinafter Koh’s Speech] (noting that Koh has been an international lawyer for over thirty years, with the State Department for three and one half years, and is known as a premier legal-mind in the field).\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\neffects and intent,” to help determine if a cyber-attack crosses the threshold of use of force. Koh also recognized that the United States may defend itself if the offensive attack reaches the extent of an armed attack under article 51 of the UN Charter, but in the same fashion as the Manual and UN Charter, the defense action must be proportionate, necessary, and distinct. Notably, Koh emphasized that the United States, and any other nation for that matter, should ensure its cyber weapons are not “inherently indiscriminate,” preventing unnecessary and unpredictable damage. Koh further recognized that cyber-warfare could bleed over borders into innocent third party countries, and most importantly, explained that any nation should be held responsible for the actions of a non-state actor that conducted a cyber-attack at the direction of such nation.\nAfter essentially reiterating the rules and policies of the UN Charter and Manual, Koh moved forward to the issues that arise when applying such rules and policies to cyber-warfare. First, Koh addressed the issue of how to determine the scope and effect of a cyber-attack that does not cause the same type\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nof damage as a kinetic attack. Koh, however, left the question open and merely stated that the United States holds the right to defensively act against any attack that could be viewed as an armed attack under the UN Charter. Koh next discussed the innate difficulties in analyzing an attack on a civilian target but, unfortunately, gave no solution—only raising the issue. Lastly, Koh spoke to the issue of attribution, but like the previous two issues, he only mentioned the problem of attribution and never truly analyzed it. Koh simply stated, “[n]ot all of the issues I’ve mentioned are susceptible to clear legal answers derived from existing precedents.” Essentially, Koh recognized these issues but gave no defined answers, simply leaving the issues to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.\nIn closing his speech, Koh explained that international humanitarian laws, i.e. the UN Charter, are not the only laws applying to cyber-warfare, recognizing that the cyber world is so interconnected that laws applying to human rights, criminal activity, and many others should also be applied to\n See id. (noting that the United States would still have to follow the laws regarding a defensive response); U.N. Charter art. 51.\n See Koh’s Speech.\n Id.\n Id.\n See id.\nVolume XVIII 2014 284\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\ncyber-warfare. Lastly, Koh emphasized the importance of understanding international laws in the cyber-warfare context and, equally, the ability to openly discuss the problems of applying such laws to cyber-warfare. Koh’s speech, while lacking some definite answers, was still educational on how the United States government views cyber-warfare in the same manner as the Manual and anticipates on applying the laws of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare in a similar fashion to the Manual.\n## V. Issues in Applying the International Laws of War to Cyber-Warfare\nEven as the legal field attempts to define cyber-warfare and apply internationally recognized laws of war to cyber-warfare, many issues still arise in the application of these laws. In this section, I will discuss several issues, including the differences in applying the terms “use of force” and “armed attack,” problems with the scale and effects test, the always troublesome issue of attribution, and the accumulation of such issues during an attack on a civilian target.\n See id.\n See id.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n## A. The Different Applications of Use of Force and Armed Attack\nThe problem of figuring out if a cyber-attack reached the level of a “use of force” and/or an “armed attack” is a genuine and difficult issue. While these thresholds create a basis for evaluating an attack, they are both vague and indecisive. For example, the UN Charter does not even attempt to solve the issue of what “use of force” entails and applies the scale and effects test to only armed attacks, while the Manual—which Koh seems to side with—applies the scales and effects test to both. The disparities in opinion continue beyond the differences in the application of the tests; the UN charter seems to imply a use of force or armed attack must occur through armed forces and/or cause physical damage to a nation’s military, while the Tallinn Manual and Koh would disagree. Moreover, the scale and effects test has many of its own flaws\n---\n See e.g., Waxman, *supra* note 54, at 44-46 (explaining the vagueness of use of force in the UN Charter); see TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-49 (Cambridge University Press 2013) (noting that the Manual had to use examples and factors to try and explain the usage of the definition for use of force and still admitted the definition is anything but foolproof).\n See U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4, art. 51; TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-59; Koh’s Speech.\n Waxman, *supra* note 53, at 44-46; TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 55.\nVolume XVIII 2014 286\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nas discussed in the next section. The dissimilarities between the Manual, Koh’s speech, and the UN Charter alone cause a great amount of confusion and uncertainty. Significantly, and to reiterate, of the (potential) rules discussed, only the UN Charter is binding; thus, its interpretation has the most significance and, seemingly, the only relevance at the current time. In short, the lack of cohesiveness and uniformity between the UN Charter and Manual only creates greater confusion in an already perplexed field.\n## B. Issues with the Scale and Effects Test\nThe scale and effects test used in the UN Charter, Tallinn Manual, and Koh’s speech faces some major challenges in the cyber-warfare context, including unpredictability, reversible effects, and differentiating effects. Regarding unpredictability, programmers can fall victim to coding error, or cyber-security defenses that cause the programmer to adjust the attack on the fly, thus triggering unknown effects. Consequently, the attack could either collapse or reach new levels of destruction. This unpredictability could have effects on intent, especially if the attack was never meant to reach the threshold of “use of force”\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nand/or an “armed attack.” Notably, the UN Charter takes intent in account when determining whether an attack breached the thresholds for either use of force or an armed attack, whereas the Manual *does not* base its analysis on intention whatsoever—solely analyzing the scale and effects of the attack. Thus, the unpredictability of cyber-attacks affects the scale and effects test differently depending on whether the UN Charter or Manual is being applied. From another perspective, a nation’s cyber-security defenses could interact with an attack in unforeseen ways, causing a chain reaction that overwhelms or shuts down a network. In this scenario, is the attacker blamed for scale and effects of the shutdown, or is the victim nation’s faulty defenses to blame? The unpredictability of cyber-attacks will continuously cause problems in applying the scale and effects test.\nThe ability of cyber-attacks to cause reversible damages as well as delayed or prolonged damages also raises concerns. Presumably, if the effects were reversible, the scale and effects of an attack would be greatly diminished—even if such an\n *See id.* at 1103-04.\n *See supra* Part.IV.B.4.a.\n *See* Martin Libiki, *Pulling Punches in Cyberspace*, *PROCEEDINGS OF A WORKSHOP ON DETERRING CYBERATTACKS: INFORMING STRATEGIES AND DEVELOPING OPTIONS FOR U.S. POLICY* 123, 124-129 (2010).\nVolume XVIII 2014 288\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nattack had immense effects in the short term. Nevertheless, the essential factor would be the immediate scale and effects, and thus, if the immediate scale and effects constituted a use of force or armed attack, then a victim nation could take the prescribed measures under the applicable laws of war. Alternatively, how can the laws of war apply to a cyber-attack that affects two countries differently? For example, what if a cyber-attack caused minimal damage to a more advanced country and significant damage to a less advanced country? Could only the less advanced country respond to the attack? The answer to this question, is likely that only the less advanced country could respond. While this answer adheres to the international laws of war, it seems rather illogical that the exact same attack could lead to such different defensive responses. Even though the scales and effects test has been widely acknowledge in the UN Charter, Manual, and Koh’s speech, the test is anything but flawless.\n## C. Issues of Attribution\nThe issue of attribution may be the most troublesome of the many issues that arise in applying the international laws\n See id.\n See Nguyen, supra note 14, at 1124.\n See id. at 1124-25.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nof war to cyber-warfare. Unlike traditional warfare when it is relatively simple to discover who launched an attack against a nation, a cyber-attack can be nearly impossible to attribute to a particular nation, especially if a non-state actor is working at the direction of a nation. Such is true because the cyber world offers so many options for anonymity and hiding attacks behind other networks. People experienced within the cyber world can easily forge or conceal their identity, especially if motivated to hide an illegal attack. Moreover, even if a nation is identified, such nation can easily deny that the attack derived from their networks—instead claiming that they were hacked. Even more troublesome, if a non-state actor is identified as the originator of an attack, an accused nation could deny any nexus with the attacking non-state actor. The numerous loopholes involved with attributing an attack to a particular nation presents some serious problems in applying the international laws of war to cyber-warfare.\n---\n *See e.g.,* Broad, Markoff &amp; Sanger, *supra* note 6 (explaining that no one is still one hundred percent certain where Stuxnet derived from)\n *See* Nguyen, *supra* note 14, at 1104-05.\n *See id.* at 1104-06.\n *See id.*\n*Volume XVIII 2014*                                                                 290\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\n## D. Applying the UN Charter and Tallinn Manual to an Attack on a Civilian Target\nIn this section, I will pose a couple of hypothetical situations to explain how a nation, specifically the United States, should respond to a cyber-attack that may or may not qualify as an act of cyber-warfare according to the UN Charter and the Manual—given Koh essentially adheres to the Manual. The two hypothetical situations involve (1) an attack on a civilian target that has some military aspects and (2) an attack on a purely civilian target. Notably, I will assume these attacks can be accurately attributed to the originator of the attack—a non-state actor directed by such state.\nSignificantly, this assumption would require the attack to affect the United States’ military to be considered having military characteristics. The issue of attribution is of such concern that the following examples could not be analyzed without making this assumption.\n### 1. ATTACK ON A CIVILIAN TARGET WITH MILITARY ASPECTS\nThe following fact pattern will present an opportunity to analyze an attack on a civilian target with military aspects: A foreign country attacks Boeing—a civilian aerospace company that, among many other things, helps the United States Military\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nresearch, test, and maintain aerospace technologies—via a cyber invasion that both steals and destroys both civilian and military related information.\nBefore moving forward and analyzing this attack under both the UN Charter and Manual, it is important to distinguish the espionage portion of the attack (the stealing) from the attacking portion of the attack (the destruction) because neither the UN Charter nor the Manual were created to analyze mere acts of espionage; but rather, they were created to analyze actual attacks. And to reiterate, we are assuming this attack can be accurately attributed to a non-sate actor working for such foreign country.\nUnder the UN Charter, this “attack” might constitute a use of force but unlikely would be classified as an armed attack. Importantly, only the military information that was destroyed could be considered in this analysis because the UN Charter requires the attack to have some sort of military aspect, and in this hypothetical, the civilian information lacks any sort of military character. The destruction of the military information from Boeing could result in a use of force or armed attack depending on what exactly was destroyed and, more\n See supra Parts IVA.1, IV.B.1.\n See supra Part IV.A.2.\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nimportantly, the consequence of destroying such information. If the destroyed military information involved details regarding national security that generated the scale and effects equivalent of military force, then the United States could likely classify the attack as a use of force. Classifying the attack as an armed attack, however, would be far more difficult because there was no physical damage in the sense of the UN Charter. The United States could argue the destruction of computer files constitutes physical damage because such damage equates that of a kinetic attack, but this argument would be weak in these circumstances because the attack had no effect on Boeing’s operations like a kinetic attack would. Notably, this same type of analysis would be used regardless of where the information was destroyed, even if from the Pentagon. Essentially, the scale and effects of the attack determine what actions are or are not allowed under the UN Charter. In short, this example epitomizes the rigorousness of the UN Charter’s requirement of military force and physical damage, especially in terms of cyber-warfare.\nUnder the Manual, a country potentially could have\n See supra Part IV.A.4.\n See supra Part IV (noting that the location being the Pentagon would likely cause of the information destroyed to have military character).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nan easier time defining this attack as a use of force and/or an armed attack. Unlike the UN Charter’s requirement of military character, the Manual strictly analyses the scale and effects of an attack; therefore, both the civilian and military information that was destroyed must be analyzed. In doing so, the United State must use the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, state involvement, military character, and presumptive legality. When applying these factors to this hypothetical, it seems the attack would constitute a use force because of the attack’s mild severity, high invasiveness, partial military character, attributable state involvement, and presumptive illegality. While the attack seems to be a use of force, the attack will not likely be considered an armed attack, especially given the high standard provided by the Manual—an armed attack is the *gravest* form of use of force. Here, the attack seems significant but not in the same category of the *gravest* uses of force. Thus, the attack will likely constitute a use of force but not an armed attack.\nGiven that under both the UN Charter and Manual this attack is merely a use of force but not an armed attack, the\n See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 51-52. (Cambridge University Press 2013).\n See id. at 48.\nVolume XVIII 2014 294\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nUnited States would not be able to defensively respond via article 51 or rule 13. Thus, the United States would have to respond by finding out why the foreign nation wanted to destroy such information and, moreover, the United States might have to destroy the information that was stolen. Moreover, the United States could put political and economic pressure on the foreign country committing this illegal use of force. The UN Charter also would provide the United States with the ability to request the UN’s assistance in properly responding to the attack. Alternatively, under the Manual, the United States could choose to take preemptive action via rule 15 in fear of the scale and effects of the destroyed information. Notably, the United States would have to show the immediacy and imminence of the foreign nation’s possible armed attack. Showing this immediacy and imminence would require more facts, but the more liberal attitude of the Manual can be seen in both the analyses of the attack as well as the United States’ ability to respond to this kind of attack\nEssentially, the Manual provides a more liberal outlook\n See supra Part IV (noting that if it determined an attack constitutes a use of force, the defensive response must be necessary and proportionate).\n See id.\n See id.\n See supra Part IV.A.3.\n See supra Part.IV.B.4.c.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\non attacks that do not directly and physically damage something or someone, even if there are certain military aspects involved in the attack. While both the UN Charter and the Manual could allow the United States to classify this attack as a use of force—especially given the partial military characteristic of the attack—the Manual more easily provides such a classification and could allow the United States to take more action regarding this attack. In short, this hypothetical provides an example of how the Manual is more adaptive and on-point with attacks that could lead to cyber-warfare.\n## 2. ATTACK ON A PURELY CIVILIAN TARGET\nThe following fact pattern will present an opportunity to analyze an attack on a purely civilian target: A foreign country attacks the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) that results in the market crashing and/or freezing for a period of time.\nUnder the UN Charter, this attack would not constitute a use of force or armed attack. Attacking a country’s economy, while devastating, lacks any sort of military characteristic; thus, the UN Charter’s requirement of military force would not be met. The United States could attempt to argue that even though the attack lacked any military character, the attack\n See supra Part IV.A.1.\nVolume XVIII 2014 296\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\naffected the military somehow. This argument, however, would not be nearly as persuasive in this hypothetical as compared the previous hypothetical because the effect would be quite attenuated. In short, the complete lack of any military force and, seemingly, military effects would prevent the United States from classifying this attack as a use of force or an armed attack under the UN Charter.\nOnce again, the Manual provides a more liberal analysis of the attack than the UN Charter. To reiterate, the Manual does not require an attack to be of military character to qualify as a use of force or an armed attack.[184] Thus, only the scale and effects of the attack on the NYSE need to be analyzed—using the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, military character, state involvement, and presumptive legality.[185] The attack would likely be determined as a use of force because of its extended and severe detrimental effects, presumptive illegality, attributable state involvement, and intense invasiveness; however, classifying the attack as an armed attack would be more difficult—given an armed attack is the gravest form of use of force.[186] Nevertheless, the\n\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nUnited States could point out the importance of the NYSE and the collapse’s grave effect beyond the economy. While this hypothetical presents a controversial and difficult question, I believe the United States would be able to classify this attack as a use of force and an armed attack given the extremely detrimental and lasting effects of crashing the NYSE. The United States would have to deeply analyze each of the factors explained in the Manual to ensure certain prerequisites are met, but the United States would be able to defensively respond via rule 13 to such an attack. Subsequently, the United States would have to properly respond with a proportionate and necessary attack. In sum, under the Manual, such an attack that completely crashes the NYSE would constitute a use of force, and more importantly, an armed attack resulting in the United States’s ability to act in self-defense.\n## 3. SUMMARY OF HYPOTHETICAL SITUATIONS\nWhile both hypothetical situations seem relatively open for interpretation, there is a major lesson to be learned from the application of the UN Charter, Manual, and in turn, Koh’s speech: cyber-warfare presents an unprecedented\nsuch an attack could constitute an armed attack).\n See id. at 53-59.\n See id. at 59-60.\n\namount of uncertainty and vagueness in the context of the international laws of war. As seen, when the attack has certain military characteristics, the attack is much easier to define. Unfortunately, cyber-attacks need not and most likely will not be of strict military character, causing the UN Charter to seem obsolete in many situations. Thus, the liberal approach of the Manual functions more efficiently and accurately than that of the UN Charter in the cyber-warfare context. Effectively, each cyber-attack must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis, concentrating on how the scale and effects of the attack affect the government, military, and civilian population.\n## VI. Recommendation: A Possible Solution to the Issues in Applying the International Laws of War to Cyber-Warfare\nBecause cyber-warfare is a new and evolving medium for warfare, an international convention must occur, and in turn, create an internationally recognized cyber-warfare treaty. While the UN Charter provides a legitimate basis for such a treaty, the UN Charter seems obsolete to handle the intricacies involved in cyber-warfare. The Manual, for the most part, is successful in applying the rules of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but fails at the most critical point: functioning as a binding\n See supra Part.V.\nVolume XVIII 2014 299\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nauthority. Instead, it is merely functioning as “suggestions.” Koh, who essentially agrees with the Manual, simply discussed the problems surrounding cyber-warfare, but no solutions whatsoever. Therefore, nations from around the world must come together and create binding rules for cyber-warfare before it is too late. In my opinion, the United States should address this problem now and be a leader in creating this treaty.\n## A. The Need for an International Convention, and in turn, an Internationally Recognized Cyber-Warfare Treaty\nWith the UN Charter and the Manual presenting valuable rules, exceptions to such rules, and recommendations involving all types of warfare—including cyber-warfare—the next step for regulating cyber-warfare is to create a binding international treaty focusing solely on cyber-warfare. For the effective creation of such a treaty, nations from around the world—not just experts in the field—will have to work together during an international convention, in a similar fashion as the creation of the UN Charter. During this convention, I believe the United States should take a progressive stance on this issue and become the world leader in regulating cyber-warfare.\n See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 16.\n See supra Part.IV.C.1.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nRegarding the details of this treaty, different aspects of both the UN Charter and Manual should be used, yet the treaty should also include further provisions. Overall, the treaty should follow the substance of the Manual as it does a remarkable job at applying the UN charter to a cyber-warfare setting. Nevertheless, certain decisions have to be made where the UN Charter and Manual disagree. For example, I believe the treaty should follow the Manual’s usage of the scale and effects test for both use of force and armed attack. However, there needs to be a definition or a sort of sliding scale to quantify the scale and effects of an attack—beyond listing an open set of factors. Moreover, in accordance with the Manual, there should be no need for military character or death to constitute use of force or an armed attack. While this standard might seem too liberal, the rules regarding self-defense will combat this liberalness by requiring the response to be proportionate and necessary—as both the Manual and UN Charter explain. Notably, the use of examples within the Manual help clarify its rules, with each example explaining certain aspects of the\n See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-59.\n See id. at 49-52.\n See supra Parts IVA.1, IV.B.1.\n See e.g., TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 59-60.\nVolume XVIII 2014 301\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nrule; therefore, given the positive affect of these examples, such examples should also be used in this cyber-warfare treaty.\nThese examples will allow readers to truly understand the rules and, more importantly, their applicability in the real world.\nFurthermore, each nation should be forced to present their case to the other members of the treaty before taking action, unless the defensive response is an absolute and immediate necessity.\nThis “meeting” will prevent a nation from applying the treaty in any way it sees fit, regardless of the treaty’s true meaning and the beliefs of other countries. Moreover, like the Manual, the treaty should include factor tests whenever answers will not be clear. These factors will allow countries to apply the facts of an attack to numerous factors as opposed to the strict reading of rules. Unlike the Manual, however, one of these factors should involve intent because the intent of an attacking nation should be taken into account when determining whether a country has illegally used force or an armed attack. Lastly, like the UN Charter, the treaty should include some rule or article that provides that members of the treaty shall ensure that non-\n See e.g., id. at 55 (giving an example of an attack on a civilian target).\n See e.g., id. at 49-52 (noting that this treaty should not be over-dependent on such factor tests).\n See id. at 53-59 (noting that the Manual does not consider intent).\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nmembers still act in accordance with the treaty but only to the extent that is necessary to maintain international peace. This provision would allow the treaty to have a worldwide affect, beyond the countries that signed. The treaty, effectively, will use the Manual’s application of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but bind of all member-nations to the treaty, much like the UN Charter did with United Nations members.\nIn short, some sort of binding action must occur to regulate cyber-warfare, and the United States should be at the forefront of this movement. In regulating cyber-warfare, the ideals and the binding effect of the UN Charter should be applied to cyber-warfare in a similar fashion as the Tallinn Manual. By taking action in this questionable area of law, the United States can ensure its safety now and into the future.\n## VII. Conclusion\nThe lack of regulations involving cyber-warfare is a growing and real threat. Cyber-warfare might be a confusing and seemingly futuristic concept, but countries from around the world need to address this lack of regulation sooner than\n See e.g., U.N. Charter art. 2(6) (“The Organization shall ensure that states which are not Members of the United Nations act in accordance with these Principles so far as may be necessary for the maintenance of international peace and security.”).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nlater. While countries can attempt to apply the UN Charter to cyber-warfare situations, the UN Charter lacks the flexibility and modernization to properly handle the intricacies of cyber-attacks. The UN Charter is undoubtedly effective in handling kinetic warfare; however, it seems obsolete in the cyber-warfare context. Experts in the field recognized this issue and, in response, created the Tallinn Manual, which was effective in applying the UN Charter to cyber-warfare. Nevertheless, the Manual functions simply as a suggestion booklet and provides zero binding rules or regulations. Therefore, the United States needs to take the lead in regulating cyber-warfare. The United States needs to hold an international conference that will produce a binding treaty involving the regulations of cyber-warfare. This treaty should use the Manual’s concepts of applying the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but needs to go further in an attempt to leave as few questions unanswered as possible. While such a task will be difficult, the difficulties in creating a cyber-warfare treaty are minimal compared to the damage that will occur without such regulations.\nVolume XVIII 2014\n304",

Introduction: The Growing Concerns of Cyber-Warfare\nThe threat of cyber-warfare is a current and continuing issue that our nation must address. President Obama, the Department of Defense (DoD), and even the private sector comprehend this issue and have been attempting to update our defense strategies to better protect this nation. The following quotations explain how concerned authorities from all levels of the nation are with the threat of cyber-warfare:\nIt’s the great irony of our Information Age -- the very technologies that empower us to create and to build also empower those who would disrupt and destroy. And this paradox -- seen and unseen -- is something that we experience every day... cyber threat is one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation.\nOur daily life, economic vitality, and national security depend on a stable, safe, and resilient cyberspace. . . .

It is important to note, not all these warfare systems are created solely to attack—some are created for defense purposes. Nevertheless, cyber-warfare is a real and dangerous threat that has already affected many countries around the world. Given the tangible and mounting threat of cyber-warfare, the United States must continue to build on the already existing policies and strategies that currently exist. Moreover, the United States must be prepared to classify and possibly respond to a cyber-attack on either a governmental or\n Kim Zetter, Google to Stop Censoring Search Results in China After Hack Attack, WIRED (Jan. 12, 2010), http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/01/google-censorship-china/.\n Natasha Solce, The Battlefield of Cyberspace: The Inevitable New Militray Branch—The Cyber Force, 18 ALB.

What is Cyber-Warfare: Definitions and Conflicts\n### Therein\nBefore moving into an in-depth discussion regarding cyber-warfare, the possibility of a cyber-attack on a government or civilian target, and a cyber-attack’s relation to the international rules of war, a definition of cyber-warfare must be established. The definition’s importance is exemplified in the international law of war setting because an attack must be analyzed using the “use of force” and/or “armed attack” tests, which are further discussed later in this paper.\n See generally TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Cambridge University Press 2013) (explaining the use of force in terms of cyber-warfare); U.N. Charter art. 51 (explaining the amount force needed to respond to an armed attack).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n## A. Basic Definition of Cyber-Warfare\nThe most basic definition of cyber-warfare can be established by combining the terms “cyber” and “war.” Cyber is defined in an English dictionary as “of, relating to, or involving computers or computer networks.” War, as defined in a legal dictionary, is “[h]ostile conflict by means of armed forces, carried on between nations, states, or rulers, or sometimes between parties within the same nation or state.” Thus, cyber-warfare would be a hostile conflict via armed forces that involves computers or computer networks. The problem with this definition is that it requires “armed forces,” whereas cyber-warfare usually does not include actual armed forces invading or defending a country. To the contrary, cyber-warfare usually involves a conflict within computer systems, which were programmed by humans, but does not involve forces equipped with actual kinetic weapons.\n## B. Definition Based on the Object Being Attacked\nBeyond this basic attempt to define cyber-warfare,\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\ntwo other mainstream ideologies have defined cyber-warfare: object-based vs. medium-based. The object based definition concentrates on whether the object being attacked is “cyber” in nature. The U.S. National Research Council created such a definition in 2009 in an attempt to clarify cyber-warfare and cyber-attacks. The definition described a cyber-attack as “the use of deliberate actions—perhaps over an extended period of time—to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy adversary computer systems or networks or the information and/or programs resident in or transiting these systems or networks.” Other commentators have offered similar definitions, such as defining cyber-warfare as “actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation’s computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption.” The main problem with any object-based definition is that it is overly broad; that is, such definitions would include attacks on computers via kinetic weapons. For example, these definitions would define a\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nbombing of a server farm as a cyber-attack that could lead to cyber-warfare; however, the act of using a physical bomb seems far beyond the purview of a cyber-attack. Therefore, such object-based definitions of cyber-warfare, and in turn cyber-attacks, are too broad in nature.\nAlternatively, object-based definitions of cyber-warfare are equally too narrow. Because object-based definitions require the object being attacked to be cyber in nature, these definitions would exclude attacks from a computer network that affect non-computers. For example, the Stuxnet attacks involved a malicious worm that used computer networks to attack, but and actually affected Iran’s nuclear centrifuges. Thus, under the object-based definition of cyber-warfare, the Stuxnet attack would not have qualified as a cyber-attack or an act of cyber-warfare. In short, the object-based definition of cyber-warfare fails in numerous ways, being both overly broad and narrow.\n## C. Definition Based on the Medium Being Used to Attack\nThe medium-based definition concentrates on whether the object *used* in the attack is “cyber” in nature. Essentially, a medium-based definition of cyber-warfare focuses on the\nkinetic attacks have already been readily defined in a number of international treaties and laws of war).\n See Dennis Fisher &amp; Paul Roberts, *Spotlight Series: Stuxnet*, THREATPOST: THE KASPERSKY LAB SECURITY NEWS SERVICE.\nVolume XVIII 2014 254\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nmethod used in the attack rather than the target being attacked—much in the same way an aerial attack involves planes. The DoD seems to imply this type of understanding through its definition of cyberspace operations: “[t]he employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace.” Importantly, this definition highlights the medium used in the operation, which parallels the way a medium-based definition of cyber-warfare focuses on whether cyberspace is used during an attack. An example of a medium-based definition for cyber-warfare can be seen in the Cambridge Dictionary as “the activity of using the internet to attack a country’s computers in order to damage things such as communication and transport systems or water and electricity supplies.” Moreover, a medium-based definition works best with the international laws of war because these laws rely on concepts that revolve around the force exerted on a target as opposed to the type of target being\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nattacked. For the forgoing reasons, a medium-based definition should be used to define cyber-warfare. Thus, the definition of cyber-warfare should look similar, but not necessarily exactly like, the definition provided in the Cambridge Dictionary.\nFor example, a proper definition of cyber-warfare could be: hostile acts via cyberspace that damage or disturb a country’s infrastructure or related networks for a governmental or national security purpose.\n## III. Potential Types of Cyber-Attacks that Could Occur During Cyber-Warfare\nNow that a logical and adequate definition of cyber-warfare has been established, understanding the types of attacks a nation could experience becomes imperative to understanding how and if an attack could constitute an act of cyber-warfare. There are three main categories of cyber-attacks: syntactic, semantic, and hybrid attacks.\n### A. Syntactic Attacks\nSyntactic attacks are aimed at a computer’s operating\n See e.g., TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 48-49 (Cambridge University Press 2013) (explaining the use of force factors—severity, directness, measurability of effects, etc.); U.N. Charter art. 51 (implying the use of self-defense must be proportionate).\n See supra note 21.\n Susan W. Brenner &amp; Marc D. Goodman, In Defense of Cyberterrorism: An Argument for Anticipating Cyberattacks, 2022 U. ILL. J. L. TECH &amp; POL’Y 1, 27-42 (2002).\nVolume XVIII 2014 256\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nsystem and “modify the logic of the system in order to introduce delays or to make the system unpredictable.” There are two main types of syntactic attacks: penetration and denial of service (DoS) attacks.\n## 1. PENETRATION ATTACKS\nPenetration attacks, as the name indicates, penetrate a computer system or computer network and transport whatever the programmer wants to “drop” into the system/network. Examples of penetration attacks include the implantation of malware, viruses, Trojan horses, and worms. All these types of penetration attacks cause actual damage to the system/network in different ways. For example, worms replicate within the system but do not infect the host computer; nevertheless, the worm spreads throughout the entire system and eventually can cause the system to completely shut down. Viruses effect computer systems is a different way, creating codes that become active once a user opens the file, and subsequently, the\n\nvirus corrupts, destroys, or steals files. Any of these types of penetration attacks can lead to the destruction or alterations of a computer system, and in turn, can lead to physical or economic damage.\n## 2. DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS\nDenial of service (DoS) attacks disrupt a computer system or network by overloading the system/network, and thus, reduce its functionality. Essentially, a DoS attack can completely shut down a system/network by flooding the target with false requests for service, therefore causing the system to overload. When this happens, legitimate requests for service are blocked, and the actual purpose of the system is devastated. Importantly, for anonymity reasons, attackers will often use distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks. A DDoS attack has the same purpose as a DoS attack; however, the attacker uses other people’s computers in addition to their own, which makes tracing the source of the attack much more difficult.

Semantic Attacks\nSemantic attacks do not attempt to shut down, steal information, or destroy a computer network/system; rather, they affect the accuracy of the network’s information. Essentially, “[a] system under semantic attack operates and will be perceived as operating correctly (otherwise the semantic attack is failure), but it will generate answers at variance with reality.” While such an attack seems petty, computer users tend to accept the information given to them, especially if such information derives from a government website. For example, if a semantic attack occurred to an important government website, such information could cause people ignore a legitimate threat or falsely perceive an innocent act as a legitimate attack. Such a semantic attack could cause people to unnecessarily bunker down or, alternatively, riot out of fear. Thus, such a semantic attack could have severe consequences\n See e.g., John Markoff, *Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks*, New York Times (Aug. 12, 2008), http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html?_r=0 (explaining that the Russian cyber-attack on Georgia consisted of a DoS attack).\n Brenner &amp; Goodman, *supra* note 24, at 31-32.\n See Antolin-Jenkins, *supra* note 28, at 140 (noting how gullible or ignorant many computer users are when reading information off the internet).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\non the population. As demonstrated above, semantic attacks can be as detrimental to a nation as syntactic attacks.\n## C. Hybrid Attacks\nHybrid attacks are exactly what the term seems to imply: a hybrid of syntactic and semantic cyber-attacks. Such attacks have the greatest likelihood of causing the most destruction because the attacker could actually destroy a certain computer system (and, in turn, whatever other infrastructure was affected) and then tell the people that something completely different happened—only furthering the confusion, distrust, and destruction.\n See id. at 140-41 (noting that such attacks could cause great civil unrest); Brenner &amp; Goodman, supra note 24 at 31-39.\n See Antolin-Jenkins, supra note 28, at 140.\n See id. For example,\nTerrorists can mount complex attacks by combining syntactic and semantic attacks. Imagine that terrorists target Boston, Atlanta, Miami, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles for an attack which begins with a syntactic assault on computer systems that stops the delivery of state public assistance. General public awareness of the attack will emerge gradually, as successive waves of frustrated welfare recipients file complaints with the appropriate agencies. Eventually, the realization will spread that the distribution of benefits had been deliberately shut down. Once it becomes clear that the funds are not coming, the terrorists can follow up with a semantic attack assigning responsibility for their efforts to carefully-selected right-wing groups whose views are known to carry at least the taint of racial bias. If the terrorists manage to sustain the welfare gridlock, the freezing of the resources upon which thousands depend for their survival will produce civil disobedience and localized chaos. National Guardsmen might have to be sent into these cities to maintain\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nWith an understanding of the definition of cyber-warfare and the types of cyber-attacks that could occur during cyber-warfare, we must move forward to the international laws of war that apply to any sort of attack, whether kinetic or cyber.\n## IV. International Laws of War: An Application to Cyber-Warfare\nIn this section, I will explain the major components of the international laws of war in the cyber-warfare context. First, I will briefly explain the United Nations Charter (UN Charter) and how it applies to cyber-warfare. Subsequently, I will discuss the creation and purpose of the Tallinn Manual (the Manual). And lastly, I will explain the United States’ approach and strategies to handing the possibility of cyber-warfare. Each of these components is essential in understanding how to properly respond to an act of warfare, specifically cyber-\norder. To make things even more interesting, the terrorists can then direct a syntactic attack at ATM and banking system computers in these cities. Such a shutdown will add to the problem by causing outrage among citizens who do not depend on welfare funds. The cumulative effects of all these efforts will be riots, targeted violence and a National Guard stretched to its limit (which will create an excellent opportunity for the terrorists to stage a CBERN attack in other areas of the country).\nBrenner &amp; Goodman, supra note 24, at 39-40.\n\nwarfare.\n## A. The United Nations Charter\nThe UN Charter functions as the backbone to the current international laws of war. It sets forth many rules and guidelines that apply to war; including starting a conflict, responding to an attack, and how the UN should respond to an attack on a member nation. Understanding the UN Charter is crucial to understanding the later developments that deal specifically with cyber-warfare.\n## 1. GENERAL BACKGROUND\nThe UN Charter was created to “save succeeding generations from the scourge of war . . . to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights . . . to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other resources of international law . . . and to promote social progress.” Moreover, the overarching goals of the UN Charter were to allow countries to live tolerantly and in peace, to strengthen international peace and security, to ensure that armed forces are a last resort, and to promote\n See History of the United Nations, http://www.un.org/en/aboutun/history/charter_history.shtml (last visited Oct. 30, 2013).\n See generally U.N. Charter arts. 2, 4, 42, 51 (explaining the rules regarding starting a conflict, responding to an attack, and assisting an ally who has been attacked).\n Id. pmbl.\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nsocial and economic advancement for all people. Notably, the United States is a member of United Nations along with many other world powers, including Russia, China, and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, the UN Charter is binding upon the United States under Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution. As discussed below, the UN Charter successfully created rules that allow for a far more humane world, even in the face of war, but unfortunately, these rules may be obsolete in terms of cyber-warfare.\n## 2. ARTICLE 2(4): PROHIBITING THE THREAT OR USE OF FORCE\nArticle 2, paragraph 4 of the UN Charter provides a quintessential rule: “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.” Essentially, this rule prohibits a country from threatening or using “force” on another country, provided\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nthe exception of self-defense discussed later in this section. Unfortunately, however, the term “threat or use of force” is never defined in the UN Charter, causing unrest and numerous debates. Nevertheless, academics over the years have determined that this term involves only the uses or threat of *military* forces or attacks affecting the victim nation’s *military*, precluding economic and political coercion. Notably, the UN Charter also specifically precludes espionage.\nThis rule is important in the cyber-warfare context because article 4(2) would prevent a victim country from attacking the aggressor country that committed the cyber-attack. Thus, a country who falls victim to an act of cyber-warfare may not retaliate unless such an attack falls within the self-defense exception of article 51 via qualifying as an armed attack. The vagueness concerning the meaning of “use of force” presents an issue in the cyber-warfare context because at what point does a cyber-attack qualify as a use of *military* force?\n *Id.* art. 51.\n See generally *id.* arts. 2, 4, 41, 42, 51 (noting that there is no definition section or individual definition for “threat or use of force”).\n See e.g., MATTHEW C. WAXMAN, *Cyber Attacks as “Force” under UN Charter Article 2(4)*, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE CHANGING CHARACTER OF WAR 43 (Raul A. “Pete” Pedorzo et al. eds. 2011).\n See *id.*\n See U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4; WAXMAN, *supra* note 54, at 44-45.\n See U.N.

ARTICLES 41 AND 42\nArticles 41 and 42 of the UN Charter provide directions for how the UN can support a country that is being attacked. Article 41 focuses on a way to counter an attack that does not mount to a “use of force,” whereas article 42 provides the UN the power to use force to counter such an attack, but only if it is determined that the attack qualified as a “use of force” and article 41 remedies would be inadequate. Article 41’s non-forceful remedies would include economic blockades and political pressure. While these two articles do not analyze whether a country can defend itself, they do provide structure and direction for how UN members should respond to an attack on their own country or on an ally. Primarily, articles 41 and 42 allow the UN to analyze the extent of the attack—whether there was a use of force—and, subsequently, allow the UN to\n See U.N. Charter arts. 41, 42.\n See id. Article 41 states “The Security Council may decide what measures not involving the use of armed force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and it may call upon the Members of the United Nations to apply such measures. These may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations. Id. art 41. If the UN decides that article 41 relief would be insufficient, it may “take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security. Such action may include demonstrations, blockade, and other operations by air, sea, or land forces of Members of the United Nations.” Id. art. 42.\n See id. art. 41.\n See id. arts. 41, 42.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\ndecide to either use non-forceful or forceful remedies. While the substance of articles 41 and 42 are important, the most essential aspect of these articles is their purpose—to prevent forceful responses to an attack unless absolutely necessary to maintain international security and peace.\nIn discussing cyber-warfare, the most important aspect of articles 41 and 42 is their purpose as discussed directly above. Thus, unless there is a clear use of force during a cyber-attack, it seems the United States or any other member of the UN could only respond via a non-forceful response—i.e., an economic blockade or political pressures.\n## 4. ARTICLE 51\nArticle 51 of the UN Charter provides the exception to general rule of article 2(4), which prohibits the use of force against other nations. Article 51 states:\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately\n See id.\n See id.\n See id. pmbl, arts. 41, 42.\n See id. arts. 41, 42.\nVolume XVIII 2014 266\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nreported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.\nWhile Article 51 expressly creates an exception for the use of force in self-defense, some issues arise in the cyber-warfare context, especially when looking at the specific wording. Much like the issue with our basic definition of cyber-warfare, article 51 allows a nation to defend itself only if the attack amounts to an “armed attack,” which a cyber-attack would never seem to qualify as. Nevertheless, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) adjusted the definition of an armed attack by defining it more broadly and explaining that armed attacks “do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.” Thus, the term armed attack actually functions more as an expansion to “use of force” as opposed to an attack with actual kinetic weapons.\nMoreover, the ICJ decided in *Nicaragua v. United States* that\n *Id.* art. 51. (emphasis added).\n *See id.*\n *See supra* Part II.A.; U.N. Charter art. 51.\n International Court of Justice, *The legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* (Jul. 8, 1996), http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?sum=498&amp;code=unan&amp;p1=3&amp;p2=4&amp;case=95&amp;k=e1&amp;p3=5.\n *See id.*\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nthe “scale and effects” of an attack are the determining factors of whether such action constitutes an armed attack, not the inclusion of kinetic weapons. Therefore, a cyber-attack could qualify as an armed attack if its scale and effects reached a level equivalent to that of an attack with kinetic weapons. Given the working definition of armed attack, article 51 will play a role in the way and extent the United States responds to a cyber-attack.\nThe UN Charter’s importance is unparalleled in determining whether or not a nation has been the victim of force, whether such country can legally retaliate via self-defense, and what actions the UN can take in support of the victim country. While the UN Charter is of great help in determining all of the aforementioned questions, many issues still arise when trying to apply the UN Charter to cyber-warfare.\n## B.

Before delving into the background and specifics of the Manual, one must understand that the Manual is not binding on any nation.\n## 1. GENERAL BACKGROUND\nThe Manual, which was published in 2013, was put together by an international group of approximately twenty-five experts from 2009 to 2012. These experts met in Tallinn, Estonia, which in turn, helped produce the name of the Manual. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), specifically NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, invited these experts to put together the rules of cyber-warfare into a single document. The Manual was put together in response to the growing fear of cyber-warfare and, more specifically, the lack of well-defined rules regulating cyber-warfare. Notably, the Manual only discusses the laws\n See id.\n Id. (explaining the Manual is a “non-binding document applying existing law to cyber-warfare”).\n Id. at 16-17, 22 (noting these experts included legal practitioners, technical experts, and academics).\n Id. at 22.\n Id.\n Id. at 17-18 (explaining the Manual was created “in hope of bringing some degree of clarity to the complex legal issues surrounding cyber operations, with particular attention paid to those involving the jus ad bellum and the jus\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nof cyber-warfare, thus excluding cyber-espionage (to the extent espionage does not involve “use of force”) and cyber-crimes. To reiterate, “it is essential to understand that the Tallinn Manual is not an official document” and, thus, is not binding on any nation.\n## 2. RULES 11 AND 12: DEFINITIONS OF FORCE AND THREAT OF FORCE\nImportantly, and unlike the UN Charter, the Manual actually defines both the crucial terms “use of force” and “threat of force.” Starting with these definitions will allow for a better understanding of the Manual, even though these definitions come after some important rules within the Manual.\n### a. Rule 11: Definition of Use of Force\nThe Manual directly refers back to Nicaragua v. United States when determining what actions constitute a use of in bello”).\n *Id.* at 18.\n *Id.* at 23. Nevertheless, the Manual could function in a similar way to the Lieber Code—an aspirational attempt to regulate warfare during the civil war—in that the Lieber Code eventually “became a core text in the modern laws of war recognized worldwide, and many elements of his code continue to inform our public debate how best to respond to a new form of warfare in both an effective and a moral manner.” Nick Beard, *The Liber Codes*, *THE NEW YORK TIMES: THE OPINION PAGES* (Apr. 24, 2013, 12:59 PM), http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/the-lieber-codes/?_r=0.\n *TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE* 47-53.\n *Id.* at 45, 47-53 (noting that the Prohibition of Threat or Use of Force, Rule 10, comes before the definitions of “use of force” and “threat of force”).\nVolume XVIII 2014 270\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nforce—applying the “scale and effects” test. While the scale and effects test is not black and white, it provides a nation with a decent idea of what constitutes a use of force. The Manual, however, does create some black and white rules. For example, the Manual unequivocally states that “[a]cts that injure or kill persons or damage or destroy objects are unambiguously uses of force.” Notably, like the UN Charter, the Manual excludes economic and political coercion from qualifying as use of force. The Manual, moreover, explicitly rejects the notion that a non-destructive cyber-attack that is intended solely to undermine the confidence in a government would qualify as a use of force. As the Manual progresses through the definition of use of force, it designates eight factors that are supposed to help a nation determine whether a non-obvious act qualifies as a use of force—essentially adding factors to the scale and effects test. The list of factors includes the following: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects,\n See id. at 47; Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. United States), 1986 I.C.J. 14, 103-04 (June 27).\n Id.\n See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 49.\n Id.\n See id. at 48.\n Id. (stating that “merely funding a hacktivist group conducting cyber operations as part of an insurgency would not be a use of force”).\n Id. at 49-52.\n\nmilitary character, state involvement, and presumptive legality. This definition of use of force, while not black and white, should greatly help nations determine what constitutes a use of force in the cyber-warfare setting.\n## b. Rule 12: Definition of Threat of Force\nRule 12 of the Manual breaks down the functional meaning of “threat of force” in the cyber-warfare context. Importantly, the rule explains that a threat could occur in two situations: (1) “a cyber operation that is used to communicate a threat to use force” and (2) “a threat carried out by any means . . . to carry out cyber operations qualifying as use of force.” The rule further notes that a demand need not accompany the threat to qualify as such under this rule; however, actions alone that seem threatening do not qualify as a threat because a threat must be “communicative in nature.” The rule also states that a threat of force could technically derive form a nation that seems unequipped to follow through will such a threat; nonetheless, it’s the threat that matters. Interestingly, the rule explains that\n *Id.* (explaining out that the list of factors is not exhaustive and functions only as a starting point).\n *Id.* at 52-53.\n *Id.* at 52.\n *Id.* at 53 (explaining that developing technology that could be used in an act that qualifies as a use of force *does not* qualify as a threat of force).\n *Id.* (noting the experts were split with this portion of the rule).\nVolume XVIII 2014 272\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\na nation will not be considered to have actually made a threat of force, even if that nation makes such a threat and has the capability of following through with such threat, as long as that nation does not truly intend on attacking—essentially requiring actual intent. Much like the definition of use of force, this definition lacks perfect clarity and contains many intricacies, but should be of great help in determining what actually constitutes a threat of force.\n## 3. RULE 10: PROHIBITION OF THREAT OR USE OF FORCE\nRule 10 of the Manual parallels article 2(4) of the UN Charter by making “[a] cyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force . . . unlawful.” The commentary following Rule 10 clarifies that the “use of force” does not need to be committed by a country’s armed forces; rather, the force could derive from an intelligence agency or any private contractor of the nation. Rule 10 also discusses a nation “intervening” in another nation’s affairs—political, economic, social, cultural, or otherwise. The rule explains that it is unlawful for another nation to intervene but goes on to explain that the term\n *Id.* (noting, once again, that the experts were split with this portion of the rule).\n *See id.* at 45 (Cambridge University Press 2013); U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4 (noting that both prohibit the threat or use of force).\n *TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE* 46.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n\"intervene\" does have the same meaning as in a layman context; instead, intervention in the cyber-war context, as well as for the UN Charter, must involve coercion. The rule further explains that an unlawful act of intervention does not per se qualify as a use of force; the intervention still must breach the threshold for use of force independently. Thus, when determining whether an intervention is unlawful, a nation must ascertain if coercion is involved, and moreover, must decide if the intervention reached the level of use of force. Fundamentally, Rule 10 applies article 2(4) of the UN Charter to the cyber-warfare setting.\n## 4. RULES 13, 14, 15 AND 16: THE RIGHT AND REGULATIONS FOR SELF-DEFENSE AND COLLECTIVE SELF-DEFENSE\nRules 13, 14, 15, and 16 of the Manual all explain the ability of a victim nation to launch a defensive response—in a parallel manner to article 51 of the UN Charter. Rule 13 discusses an individual nation’s right to protect itself; rule 14 examines how an act of self-defense must be necessary and proportionate to the original attack; rule 15 delves into\n *Id.* at 47 (“intervention pure and simple is not intervention [in the UN Charter or Tallinn Manual context]”).\n *Id.* at 46.\n *Id.* at 46-47; see UN Charter art. 51.\n See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 53-64.\nVolume XVIII 2014 274\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nthe ability of a nation to preemptively strike in an act of self-defense; and rule 16 examines the possibility of collective self-defense, that is a third party nation(s) coming to the aid of a victim nation. These rules are essential to the completeness of the Manual, especially in the Manual’s attempt to mimic article 51 of the UN Charter.\n## a. Rule 13: Self-Defense Against Armed Attack\nRule 13 of the Manual allows a nation to exercise the right of self-defense, given that such nation faced an attack—cyber or kinetic—that qualified as an armed attack. The term “armed attack” is quantified by the scale and effects of the attack, much like the use of force threshold in rule 11, but has an even heightened threshold beyond use of force. Plainly, an armed attack is the “gravest” form of a use of force. Unfortunately, however, the Manual never defines what the exact threshold is for the scale and effects test—only causing confusion. The scale and effects of an attack, though, must\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nbe reasonably foreseeable. Therefore, an attack that causes grave damage far beyond any reasonable foresight would not constitute an armed attack. Notably, an armed attack must have a trans-border component; thus, a purely domestic attack can never qualify as an armed attack within the Manual’s framework. The rule further explains that an armed attack can originate from a state or a non-state actor who is directed by the state to take such actions. Additionally, the rule states that individual attacks that alone do not qualify as armed attacks can be classified as armed attacks if that single attack is just one in a series of attacks. Accordingly, aggregated non-armed attacks can elevate and cross the threshold of an armed attack. The comments for rule 13 continue in detail about the irrelevance of intentions, the ability of a third party nation to defend itself if the scale and effects of the attack bleed over borders, and the ability of a victim nation to retaliate against persons who are located in an innocent third party nation—so as long the victim nation has permission to do so or the innocent third party nation\napplied on a case-by-case basis).\n *Id.* at 56.\n *Id.* at 54.\n *Id.* at 54-58 (detailing the intricacies and problems with attributing a non-state actor’s actions to a state).\n *Id.* at 55 (explaining that there must be convincing evidence that the multiple attacks are related).\nVolume XVIII 2014 276\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nis unable to take action. In short, a nation has the right to defend itself if attacked by another nation via an armed attack as determined by the scale and effects test.\n## b. Rule 14: Necessity and Proportionality\nEven if it is determined that a nation has the right to defend itself—either via kinetic or cyber action—that nation’s defensive response must be necessary and proportionate. Simply put, if any non-use of force action could be taken to solve the problem, such action must be taken. Notably, this “necessity” is judged from the victim nation’s perspective. The rule also discusses proportionality. Proportionality addresses how much force a victim nation may use in the defensive action. Factors such as scale, scope, duration, and intensity play a role in this determination. Importantly, this proportionality test does not require a victim nation to mirror the scale, scope, duration, and intensity of the offensive attack; but rather, the defensive action must be proportionate to the\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nforce needed to successfully defend against the offensive attack. Moreover, the rule indicates that kinetic attacks may be used in defense of certain cyber-attacks, given that the kinetic attack is necessary and proportionate. The rule concerning necessity and proportionality is of great importance when deciding how to properly respond to an offensive armed attack.\n## c. Rule 15: Imminence and Immediacy\nThe Manual takes a step beyond the UN Charter by detailing when a nation can preemptively defend itself and the general time frame allowed for a defensive attack. Rule 15 specifically allows for preemptive defense actions if an armed attack from an enemy nation is imminent. To be considered imminent, the need to defend must be “instant, overwhelming, [and] leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.” Interestingly, the experts involved in writing\n *Id.* (indicating that the defensive attack is judged on “the level of force needed to successfully mount a defense . . . more force may be necessary, or less force may be sufficient [ ] to repel the attack or defeat one that is imminent”).\n *Id.*\n *See id.* at 59-60.\n *See id.* at 60-63.\n *Id.* at 60. (noting the Manual uses the term “anticipatory self-defence”).\n *Id.* (quoting Letter from Daniel Webster to Lord Ashburton (Aug. 6, 1842), reprinted in 2 *INTERNATIONAL LAW DIGEST* 412 (John Bassett Moore ed. 1906)).\nVolume XVIII 2014 278\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nthe Manual chose to use this standard because of its flexibility and applicability for case-by-case analyses. Regarding the immediacy of the defensive response, factors such as the period necessary to identify the attacker, the temporal proximity between the attack and response, and the time required to prepare a response are considered. Additionally, the rule discusses the length of time allowed for continuous defensive responses, stating that the victim nation “must reasonably conclude that that further cyber operations are likely to follow,” or else such nation could be liable for the continuing defensive responses. Therefore, a nation must be cautious in preemptively attacking an enemy nation, attacking the enemy nation at a too attenuated period of time, or attacking the enemy nation for too long a period of time.\n## d. Rule 16: Collective Self-Defense\nThe Manual allows a third party nation to assist a victim nation, but only if the victim nation requests such assistance. More than one third of a party nation can help a victim nation, but in any situation involving collective self-defense, both the\n See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 61 (noting that this standard was not universally agreed to).\n Id. at 62.\n Id. at 63.\n See id. at 60-64.\n Id. at 63.\n\nassisting and victim nations must determine that the offensive act qualifies as an armed attack or imminent armed attack. Moreover, the assisting nation must still follow the rules of necessity, proportionality, imminence, and immediacy. Notably, an assisting nation can only aid to the extent that the victim nation condones. For example, if the victim state only wants to respond via a cyber action, the assisting nation cannot use kinetic weapons—even if the use of such weapons would be allowed under the rules of the Manual. The Manual also recognizes certain *ad hoc* agreements as constituting consent of the victim state, i.e. NATO agreements. Essentially, collective self-defense follows the same rules discussed above yet also contains additional rules to protect the victim state from losing control over the defensive response.\n## 5. SUMMARY OF THE TALLINN MANUAL\nAs valuable and progressive as the Manual might be, it still suffers from not being binding on any nation, therefore, functioning only as “a product of a group of independent experts acting solely in their personal capacity.” Nevertheless,\n *Id.*\n *Id.* at 64.\n *Id.* at 63.\n *See id.* at 59-64.\n *Id.* at 23.\nVolume XVIII 2014 280\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nthe Manual provides a solid basis for possible future codifications regarding the international laws of cyber-warfare. By formulating an authority that applies the UN Charter and many other recognized international principles of law to a cyber-warfare setting, the Manual has greatly advanced the understanding of how the international laws of war will apply to cyber-warfare.\n## C. United States’ Strategies and Approaches\nWhile the United States has not created an official policy in the same light or depth as the Tallinn Manual, President Obama has signed several executive orders and presidential policy directives that discuss how the United States needs to better protect itself, specifically its critical infrastructure, from the possibility of cyber-attacks. These orders and directives, however, solely discuss how the United States can better protect itself via improved communications and updated cyber-security tactics.

HAROLD KOH’S SPEECH AT THE UNITED STATES CYBER COMMAND CONFERENCE\nThe timing of Koh’s speech was impeccable and purposeful as it was given a mere three weeks after the non-official release of the Tallinn Manual—providing a strong indication that the speech was a direct response to the ideas and policies within the Manual. Much like the Manual, Koh acknowledged that international principles of law should apply to cyber-warfare and emphasized that the cyber world is anything but law-free. Moreover, Koh applied the “use of force” test of the UN Charter article 2(4) and gave a number of factors (like the Manual) including, “the context of the event, the actor perpetrating the action (recognizing challenging issues of attribution in cyberspace), the target and location, [and the]\n Harold Honhgu Koh, Legal Advisor of the Dep’t of State, International Law in Cyberspace, Address to the USCYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference (Sept. 18, 2012), available at http://www.state.gov/s/l/releases/remarks/197924.htm [hereinafter Koh’s Speech] (noting that Koh has been an international lawyer for over thirty years, with the State Department for three and one half years, and is known as a premier legal-mind in the field).\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\neffects and intent,” to help determine if a cyber-attack crosses the threshold of use of force. Koh also recognized that the United States may defend itself if the offensive attack reaches the extent of an armed attack under article 51 of the UN Charter, but in the same fashion as the Manual and UN Charter, the defense action must be proportionate, necessary, and distinct. Notably, Koh emphasized that the United States, and any other nation for that matter, should ensure its cyber weapons are not “inherently indiscriminate,” preventing unnecessary and unpredictable damage. Koh further recognized that cyber-warfare could bleed over borders into innocent third party countries, and most importantly, explained that any nation should be held responsible for the actions of a non-state actor that conducted a cyber-attack at the direction of such nation.\nAfter essentially reiterating the rules and policies of the UN Charter and Manual, Koh moved forward to the issues that arise when applying such rules and policies to cyber-warfare. First, Koh addressed the issue of how to determine the scope and effect of a cyber-attack that does not cause the same type\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nof damage as a kinetic attack. Koh, however, left the question open and merely stated that the United States holds the right to defensively act against any attack that could be viewed as an armed attack under the UN Charter. Koh next discussed the innate difficulties in analyzing an attack on a civilian target but, unfortunately, gave no solution—only raising the issue. Lastly, Koh spoke to the issue of attribution, but like the previous two issues, he only mentioned the problem of attribution and never truly analyzed it. Koh simply stated, “[n]ot all of the issues I’ve mentioned are susceptible to clear legal answers derived from existing precedents.” Essentially, Koh recognized these issues but gave no defined answers, simply leaving the issues to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.\nIn closing his speech, Koh explained that international humanitarian laws, i.e. the UN Charter, are not the only laws applying to cyber-warfare, recognizing that the cyber world is so interconnected that laws applying to human rights, criminal activity, and many others should also be applied to\n See id. (noting that the United States would still have to follow the laws regarding a defensive response); U.N. Charter art. 51.\n See Koh’s Speech.\n Id.\n Id.\n See id.\nVolume XVIII 2014 284\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\ncyber-warfare. Lastly, Koh emphasized the importance of understanding international laws in the cyber-warfare context and, equally, the ability to openly discuss the problems of applying such laws to cyber-warfare. Koh’s speech, while lacking some definite answers, was still educational on how the United States government views cyber-warfare in the same manner as the Manual and anticipates on applying the laws of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare in a similar fashion to the Manual.\n## V. Issues in Applying the International Laws of War to Cyber-Warfare\nEven as the legal field attempts to define cyber-warfare and apply internationally recognized laws of war to cyber-warfare, many issues still arise in the application of these laws. In this section, I will discuss several issues, including the differences in applying the terms “use of force” and “armed attack,” problems with the scale and effects test, the always troublesome issue of attribution, and the accumulation of such issues during an attack on a civilian target.\n See id.\n See id.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n## A. The Different Applications of Use of Force and Armed Attack\nThe problem of figuring out if a cyber-attack reached the level of a “use of force” and/or an “armed attack” is a genuine and difficult issue. While these thresholds create a basis for evaluating an attack, they are both vague and indecisive. For example, the UN Charter does not even attempt to solve the issue of what “use of force” entails and applies the scale and effects test to only armed attacks, while the Manual—which Koh seems to side with—applies the scales and effects test to both. The disparities in opinion continue beyond the differences in the application of the tests; the UN charter seems to imply a use of force or armed attack must occur through armed forces and/or cause physical damage to a nation’s military, while the Tallinn Manual and Koh would disagree. Moreover, the scale and effects test has many of its own flaws\n---\n See e.g., Waxman, *supra* note 54, at 44-46 (explaining the vagueness of use of force in the UN Charter); see TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-49 (Cambridge University Press 2013) (noting that the Manual had to use examples and factors to try and explain the usage of the definition for use of force and still admitted the definition is anything but foolproof).\n See U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4, art. 51; TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-59; Koh’s Speech.\n Waxman, *supra* note 53, at 44-46; TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 55.\nVolume XVIII 2014 286\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nas discussed in the next section. The dissimilarities between the Manual, Koh’s speech, and the UN Charter alone cause a great amount of confusion and uncertainty. Significantly, and to reiterate, of the (potential) rules discussed, only the UN Charter is binding; thus, its interpretation has the most significance and, seemingly, the only relevance at the current time. In short, the lack of cohesiveness and uniformity between the UN Charter and Manual only creates greater confusion in an already perplexed field.\n## B. Issues with the Scale and Effects Test\nThe scale and effects test used in the UN Charter, Tallinn Manual, and Koh’s speech faces some major challenges in the cyber-warfare context, including unpredictability, reversible effects, and differentiating effects. Regarding unpredictability, programmers can fall victim to coding error, or cyber-security defenses that cause the programmer to adjust the attack on the fly, thus triggering unknown effects. Consequently, the attack could either collapse or reach new levels of destruction. This unpredictability could have effects on intent, especially if the attack was never meant to reach the threshold of “use of force”\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nand/or an “armed attack.” Notably, the UN Charter takes intent in account when determining whether an attack breached the thresholds for either use of force or an armed attack, whereas the Manual *does not* base its analysis on intention whatsoever—solely analyzing the scale and effects of the attack. Thus, the unpredictability of cyber-attacks affects the scale and effects test differently depending on whether the UN Charter or Manual is being applied. From another perspective, a nation’s cyber-security defenses could interact with an attack in unforeseen ways, causing a chain reaction that overwhelms or shuts down a network. In this scenario, is the attacker blamed for scale and effects of the shutdown, or is the victim nation’s faulty defenses to blame? The unpredictability of cyber-attacks will continuously cause problems in applying the scale and effects test.\nThe ability of cyber-attacks to cause reversible damages as well as delayed or prolonged damages also raises concerns. Presumably, if the effects were reversible, the scale and effects of an attack would be greatly diminished—even if such an\n *See id.* at 1103-04.\n *See supra* Part.IV.B.4.a.\n *See* Martin Libiki, *Pulling Punches in Cyberspace*, *PROCEEDINGS OF A WORKSHOP ON DETERRING CYBERATTACKS: INFORMING STRATEGIES AND DEVELOPING OPTIONS FOR U.S. POLICY* 123, 124-129 (2010).\nVolume XVIII 2014 288\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nattack had immense effects in the short term. Nevertheless, the essential factor would be the immediate scale and effects, and thus, if the immediate scale and effects constituted a use of force or armed attack, then a victim nation could take the prescribed measures under the applicable laws of war. Alternatively, how can the laws of war apply to a cyber-attack that affects two countries differently? For example, what if a cyber-attack caused minimal damage to a more advanced country and significant damage to a less advanced country? Could only the less advanced country respond to the attack? The answer to this question, is likely that only the less advanced country could respond. While this answer adheres to the international laws of war, it seems rather illogical that the exact same attack could lead to such different defensive responses. Even though the scales and effects test has been widely acknowledge in the UN Charter, Manual, and Koh’s speech, the test is anything but flawless.\n## C. Issues of Attribution\nThe issue of attribution may be the most troublesome of the many issues that arise in applying the international laws\n See id.\n See Nguyen, supra note 14, at 1124.\n See id. at 1124-25.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nof war to cyber-warfare. Unlike traditional warfare when it is relatively simple to discover who launched an attack against a nation, a cyber-attack can be nearly impossible to attribute to a particular nation, especially if a non-state actor is working at the direction of a nation. Such is true because the cyber world offers so many options for anonymity and hiding attacks behind other networks. People experienced within the cyber world can easily forge or conceal their identity, especially if motivated to hide an illegal attack. Moreover, even if a nation is identified, such nation can easily deny that the attack derived from their networks—instead claiming that they were hacked. Even more troublesome, if a non-state actor is identified as the originator of an attack, an accused nation could deny any nexus with the attacking non-state actor. The numerous loopholes involved with attributing an attack to a particular nation presents some serious problems in applying the international laws of war to cyber-warfare.\n---\n *See e.g.,* Broad, Markoff &amp; Sanger, *supra* note 6 (explaining that no one is still one hundred percent certain where Stuxnet derived from)\n *See* Nguyen, *supra* note 14, at 1104-05.\n *See id.* at 1104-06.\n *See id.*\n*Volume XVIII 2014*                                                                 290\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\n## D. Applying the UN Charter and Tallinn Manual to an Attack on a Civilian Target\nIn this section, I will pose a couple of hypothetical situations to explain how a nation, specifically the United States, should respond to a cyber-attack that may or may not qualify as an act of cyber-warfare according to the UN Charter and the Manual—given Koh essentially adheres to the Manual. The two hypothetical situations involve (1) an attack on a civilian target that has some military aspects and (2) an attack on a purely civilian target. Notably, I will assume these attacks can be accurately attributed to the originator of the attack—a non-state actor directed by such state.\nSignificantly, this assumption would require the attack to affect the United States’ military to be considered having military characteristics. The issue of attribution is of such concern that the following examples could not be analyzed without making this assumption.\n### 1. ATTACK ON A CIVILIAN TARGET WITH MILITARY ASPECTS\nThe following fact pattern will present an opportunity to analyze an attack on a civilian target with military aspects: A foreign country attacks Boeing—a civilian aerospace company that, among many other things, helps the United States Military\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nresearch, test, and maintain aerospace technologies—via a cyber invasion that both steals and destroys both civilian and military related information.\nBefore moving forward and analyzing this attack under both the UN Charter and Manual, it is important to distinguish the espionage portion of the attack (the stealing) from the attacking portion of the attack (the destruction) because neither the UN Charter nor the Manual were created to analyze mere acts of espionage; but rather, they were created to analyze actual attacks. And to reiterate, we are assuming this attack can be accurately attributed to a non-sate actor working for such foreign country.\nUnder the UN Charter, this “attack” might constitute a use of force but unlikely would be classified as an armed attack. Importantly, only the military information that was destroyed could be considered in this analysis because the UN Charter requires the attack to have some sort of military aspect, and in this hypothetical, the civilian information lacks any sort of military character. The destruction of the military information from Boeing could result in a use of force or armed attack depending on what exactly was destroyed and, more\n See supra Parts IVA.1, IV.B.1.\n See supra Part IV.A.2.\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nimportantly, the consequence of destroying such information. If the destroyed military information involved details regarding national security that generated the scale and effects equivalent of military force, then the United States could likely classify the attack as a use of force. Classifying the attack as an armed attack, however, would be far more difficult because there was no physical damage in the sense of the UN Charter. The United States could argue the destruction of computer files constitutes physical damage because such damage equates that of a kinetic attack, but this argument would be weak in these circumstances because the attack had no effect on Boeing’s operations like a kinetic attack would. Notably, this same type of analysis would be used regardless of where the information was destroyed, even if from the Pentagon. Essentially, the scale and effects of the attack determine what actions are or are not allowed under the UN Charter. In short, this example epitomizes the rigorousness of the UN Charter’s requirement of military force and physical damage, especially in terms of cyber-warfare.\nUnder the Manual, a country potentially could have\n See supra Part IV.A.4.\n See supra Part IV (noting that the location being the Pentagon would likely cause of the information destroyed to have military character).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nan easier time defining this attack as a use of force and/or an armed attack. Unlike the UN Charter’s requirement of military character, the Manual strictly analyses the scale and effects of an attack; therefore, both the civilian and military information that was destroyed must be analyzed. In doing so, the United State must use the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, state involvement, military character, and presumptive legality. When applying these factors to this hypothetical, it seems the attack would constitute a use force because of the attack’s mild severity, high invasiveness, partial military character, attributable state involvement, and presumptive illegality. While the attack seems to be a use of force, the attack will not likely be considered an armed attack, especially given the high standard provided by the Manual—an armed attack is the *gravest* form of use of force. Here, the attack seems significant but not in the same category of the *gravest* uses of force. Thus, the attack will likely constitute a use of force but not an armed attack.\nGiven that under both the UN Charter and Manual this attack is merely a use of force but not an armed attack, the\n See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 51-52. (Cambridge University Press 2013).\n See id. at 48.\nVolume XVIII 2014 294\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nUnited States would not be able to defensively respond via article 51 or rule 13. Thus, the United States would have to respond by finding out why the foreign nation wanted to destroy such information and, moreover, the United States might have to destroy the information that was stolen. Moreover, the United States could put political and economic pressure on the foreign country committing this illegal use of force. The UN Charter also would provide the United States with the ability to request the UN’s assistance in properly responding to the attack. Alternatively, under the Manual, the United States could choose to take preemptive action via rule 15 in fear of the scale and effects of the destroyed information. Notably, the United States would have to show the immediacy and imminence of the foreign nation’s possible armed attack. Showing this immediacy and imminence would require more facts, but the more liberal attitude of the Manual can be seen in both the analyses of the attack as well as the United States’ ability to respond to this kind of attack\nEssentially, the Manual provides a more liberal outlook\n See supra Part IV (noting that if it determined an attack constitutes a use of force, the defensive response must be necessary and proportionate).\n See id.\n See id.\n See supra Part IV.A.3.\n See supra Part.IV.B.4.c.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\non attacks that do not directly and physically damage something or someone, even if there are certain military aspects involved in the attack. While both the UN Charter and the Manual could allow the United States to classify this attack as a use of force—especially given the partial military characteristic of the attack—the Manual more easily provides such a classification and could allow the United States to take more action regarding this attack. In short, this hypothetical provides an example of how the Manual is more adaptive and on-point with attacks that could lead to cyber-warfare.\n## 2. ATTACK ON A PURELY CIVILIAN TARGET\nThe following fact pattern will present an opportunity to analyze an attack on a purely civilian target: A foreign country attacks the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) that results in the market crashing and/or freezing for a period of time.\nUnder the UN Charter, this attack would not constitute a use of force or armed attack. Attacking a country’s economy, while devastating, lacks any sort of military characteristic; thus, the UN Charter’s requirement of military force would not be met. The United States could attempt to argue that even though the attack lacked any military character, the attack\n See supra Part IV.A.1.\nVolume XVIII 2014 296\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\naffected the military somehow. This argument, however, would not be nearly as persuasive in this hypothetical as compared the previous hypothetical because the effect would be quite attenuated. In short, the complete lack of any military force and, seemingly, military effects would prevent the United States from classifying this attack as a use of force or an armed attack under the UN Charter.\nOnce again, the Manual provides a more liberal analysis of the attack than the UN Charter. To reiterate, the Manual does not require an attack to be of military character to qualify as a use of force or an armed attack.[184] Thus, only the scale and effects of the attack on the NYSE need to be analyzed—using the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, military character, state involvement, and presumptive legality.[185] The attack would likely be determined as a use of force because of its extended and severe detrimental effects, presumptive illegality, attributable state involvement, and intense invasiveness; however, classifying the attack as an armed attack would be more difficult—given an armed attack is the gravest form of use of force.[186] Nevertheless, the\n\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nUnited States could point out the importance of the NYSE and the collapse’s grave effect beyond the economy. While this hypothetical presents a controversial and difficult question, I believe the United States would be able to classify this attack as a use of force and an armed attack given the extremely detrimental and lasting effects of crashing the NYSE. The United States would have to deeply analyze each of the factors explained in the Manual to ensure certain prerequisites are met, but the United States would be able to defensively respond via rule 13 to such an attack. Subsequently, the United States would have to properly respond with a proportionate and necessary attack. In sum, under the Manual, such an attack that completely crashes the NYSE would constitute a use of force, and more importantly, an armed attack resulting in the United States’s ability to act in self-defense.\n## 3. SUMMARY OF HYPOTHETICAL SITUATIONS\nWhile both hypothetical situations seem relatively open for interpretation, there is a major lesson to be learned from the application of the UN Charter, Manual, and in turn, Koh’s speech: cyber-warfare presents an unprecedented\nsuch an attack could constitute an armed attack).\n See id. at 53-59.\n See id. at 59-60.\n\namount of uncertainty and vagueness in the context of the international laws of war. As seen, when the attack has certain military characteristics, the attack is much easier to define. Unfortunately, cyber-attacks need not and most likely will not be of strict military character, causing the UN Charter to seem obsolete in many situations. Thus, the liberal approach of the Manual functions more efficiently and accurately than that of the UN Charter in the cyber-warfare context. Effectively, each cyber-attack must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis, concentrating on how the scale and effects of the attack affect the government, military, and civilian population.\n## VI. Recommendation: A Possible Solution to the Issues in Applying the International Laws of War to Cyber-Warfare\nBecause cyber-warfare is a new and evolving medium for warfare, an international convention must occur, and in turn, create an internationally recognized cyber-warfare treaty. While the UN Charter provides a legitimate basis for such a treaty, the UN Charter seems obsolete to handle the intricacies involved in cyber-warfare. The Manual, for the most part, is successful in applying the rules of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but fails at the most critical point: functioning as a binding\n See supra Part.V.\nVolume XVIII 2014 299\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nauthority. Instead, it is merely functioning as “suggestions.” Koh, who essentially agrees with the Manual, simply discussed the problems surrounding cyber-warfare, but no solutions whatsoever. Therefore, nations from around the world must come together and create binding rules for cyber-warfare before it is too late. In my opinion, the United States should address this problem now and be a leader in creating this treaty.\n## A. The Need for an International Convention, and in turn, an Internationally Recognized Cyber-Warfare Treaty\nWith the UN Charter and the Manual presenting valuable rules, exceptions to such rules, and recommendations involving all types of warfare—including cyber-warfare—the next step for regulating cyber-warfare is to create a binding international treaty focusing solely on cyber-warfare. For the effective creation of such a treaty, nations from around the world—not just experts in the field—will have to work together during an international convention, in a similar fashion as the creation of the UN Charter. During this convention, I believe the United States should take a progressive stance on this issue and become the world leader in regulating cyber-warfare.\n See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 16.\n See supra Part.IV.C.1.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nRegarding the details of this treaty, different aspects of both the UN Charter and Manual should be used, yet the treaty should also include further provisions. Overall, the treaty should follow the substance of the Manual as it does a remarkable job at applying the UN charter to a cyber-warfare setting. Nevertheless, certain decisions have to be made where the UN Charter and Manual disagree. For example, I believe the treaty should follow the Manual’s usage of the scale and effects test for both use of force and armed attack. However, there needs to be a definition or a sort of sliding scale to quantify the scale and effects of an attack—beyond listing an open set of factors. Moreover, in accordance with the Manual, there should be no need for military character or death to constitute use of force or an armed attack. While this standard might seem too liberal, the rules regarding self-defense will combat this liberalness by requiring the response to be proportionate and necessary—as both the Manual and UN Charter explain. Notably, the use of examples within the Manual help clarify its rules, with each example explaining certain aspects of the\n See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-59.\n See id. at 49-52.\n See supra Parts IVA.1, IV.B.1.\n See e.g., TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 59-60.\nVolume XVIII 2014 301\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nrule; therefore, given the positive affect of these examples, such examples should also be used in this cyber-warfare treaty.\nThese examples will allow readers to truly understand the rules and, more importantly, their applicability in the real world.\nFurthermore, each nation should be forced to present their case to the other members of the treaty before taking action, unless the defensive response is an absolute and immediate necessity.\nThis “meeting” will prevent a nation from applying the treaty in any way it sees fit, regardless of the treaty’s true meaning and the beliefs of other countries. Moreover, like the Manual, the treaty should include factor tests whenever answers will not be clear. These factors will allow countries to apply the facts of an attack to numerous factors as opposed to the strict reading of rules. Unlike the Manual, however, one of these factors should involve intent because the intent of an attacking nation should be taken into account when determining whether a country has illegally used force or an armed attack. Lastly, like the UN Charter, the treaty should include some rule or article that provides that members of the treaty shall ensure that non-\n See e.g., id. at 55 (giving an example of an attack on a civilian target).\n See e.g., id. at 49-52 (noting that this treaty should not be over-dependent on such factor tests).\n See id. at 53-59 (noting that the Manual does not consider intent).\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nmembers still act in accordance with the treaty but only to the extent that is necessary to maintain international peace. This provision would allow the treaty to have a worldwide affect, beyond the countries that signed. The treaty, effectively, will use the Manual’s application of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but bind of all member-nations to the treaty, much like the UN Charter did with United Nations members.\nIn short, some sort of binding action must occur to regulate cyber-warfare, and the United States should be at the forefront of this movement. In regulating cyber-warfare, the ideals and the binding effect of the UN Charter should be applied to cyber-warfare in a similar fashion as the Tallinn Manual. By taking action in this questionable area of law, the United States can ensure its safety now and into the future.\n## VII. Conclusion\nThe lack of regulations involving cyber-warfare is a growing and real threat. Cyber-warfare might be a confusing and seemingly futuristic concept, but countries from around the world need to address this lack of regulation sooner than\n See e.g., U.N. Charter art. 2(6) (“The Organization shall ensure that states which are not Members of the United Nations act in accordance with these Principles so far as may be necessary for the maintenance of international peace and security.”).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nlater. While countries can attempt to apply the UN Charter to cyber-warfare situations, the UN Charter lacks the flexibility and modernization to properly handle the intricacies of cyber-attacks. The UN Charter is undoubtedly effective in handling kinetic warfare; however, it seems obsolete in the cyber-warfare context. Experts in the field recognized this issue and, in response, created the Tallinn Manual, which was effective in applying the UN Charter to cyber-warfare. Nevertheless, the Manual functions simply as a suggestion booklet and provides zero binding rules or regulations. Therefore, the United States needs to take the lead in regulating cyber-warfare. The United States needs to hold an international conference that will produce a binding treaty involving the regulations of cyber-warfare. This treaty should use the Manual’s concepts of applying the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but needs to go further in an attempt to leave as few questions unanswered as possible. While such a task will be difficult, the difficulties in creating a cyber-warfare treaty are minimal compared to the damage that will occur without such regulations.\nVolume XVIII 2014\n304"

Introduction: The Growing Concerns of Cyber-Warfare\nThe threat of cyber-warfare is a current and continuing issue that our nation must address. President Obama, the Department of Defense (DoD), and even the private sector comprehend this issue and have been attempting to update our defense strategies to better protect this nation. The following quotations explain how concerned authorities from all levels of the nation are with the threat of cyber-warfare:\nIt’s the great irony of our Information Age -- the very technologies that empower us to create and to build also empower those who would disrupt and destroy. And this paradox -- seen and unseen -- is something that we experience every day... cyber threat is one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation.¹\nOur daily life, economic vitality, and national security depend on a stable, safe, and resilient cyberspace. . . .

What is Cyber-Warfare: Definitions and Conflicts\n### Therein\nBefore moving into an in-depth discussion regarding cyber-warfare, the possibility of a cyber-attack on a government or civilian target, and a cyber-attack’s relation to the international rules of war, a definition of cyber-warfare must be established. The definition’s importance is exemplified in the international law of war setting because an attack must be analyzed using the “use of force” and/or “armed attack” tests, which are further discussed later in this paper.⁸\n⁸ See generally TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Cambridge University Press 2013) (explaining the use of force in terms of cyber-warfare); U.N. Charter art. 51 (explaining the amount force needed to respond to an armed attack).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n## A. Basic Definition of Cyber-Warfare\nThe most basic definition of cyber-warfare can be established by combining the terms “cyber” and “war.” Cyber is defined in an English dictionary as “of, relating to, or involving computers or computer networks.”⁹ War, as defined in a legal dictionary, is “[h]ostile conflict by means of armed forces, carried on between nations, states, or rulers, or sometimes between parties within the same nation or state.”¹⁰ Thus, cyber-warfare would be a hostile conflict via armed forces that involves computers or computer networks.¹¹ The problem with this definition is that it requires “armed forces,” whereas cyber-warfare usually does not include actual armed forces invading or defending a country.¹² To the contrary, cyber-warfare usually involves a conflict within computer systems, which were programmed by humans, but does not involve forces equipped with actual kinetic weapons.¹³\n## B. Definition Based on the Object Being Attacked\nBeyond this basic attempt to define cyber-warfare,\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\ntwo other mainstream ideologies have defined cyber-warfare: object-based vs. medium-based.¹⁴ The object based definition concentrates on whether the object being attacked is “cyber” in nature. The U.S. National Research Council created such a definition in 2009 in an attempt to clarify cyber-warfare and cyber-attacks.¹⁵ The definition described a cyber-attack as “the use of deliberate actions—perhaps over an extended period of time—to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy adversary computer systems or networks or the information and/or programs resident in or transiting these systems or networks.”¹⁶ Other commentators have offered similar definitions, such as defining cyber-warfare as “actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation’s computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption.”¹⁷ The main problem with any object-based definition is that it is overly broad; that is, such definitions would include attacks on computers via kinetic weapons.¹⁸ For example, these definitions would define a\n14 See Reese Nguyen, *Navigating Jus Ad Bellum in the Age of Cyber Warfare*, 101 CAL. L. REV. 1079, 1078-91(2013).\n15 COMM. ON OFFENSIVE INFO. WARFARE, NAT’L RES. COUNCIL, TECHNOLOGY, POLICY, LAW, AND ETHICS REGARDING U.S. ACQUISITION AND USE OF CYBERATTACK CAPABILITIES 80 (William A. Owens et al. eds., 2009).\n16 Id.\n17 RICHARD A. CLARKE &amp; ROBERT K. KNAKE, CYBER WAR: THE NEXT THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT 6 (2010).\n18 See Nguyen, supra note 14, at 1087 (explaining that attacks via kinetic weapons should not be included in the discussion of cyber-warfare because such\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nbombing of a server farm as a cyber-attack that could lead to cyber-warfare; however, the act of using a physical bomb seems far beyond the purview of a cyber-attack. Therefore, such object-based definitions of cyber-warfare, and in turn cyber-attacks, are too broad in nature.\nAlternatively, object-based definitions of cyber-warfare are equally too narrow. Because object-based definitions require the object being attacked to be cyber in nature, these definitions would exclude attacks from a computer network that affect non-computers. For example, the Stuxnet attacks involved a malicious worm that used computer networks to attack, but and actually affected Iran’s nuclear centrifuges.¹⁹ Thus, under the object-based definition of cyber-warfare, the Stuxnet attack would not have qualified as a cyber-attack or an act of cyber-warfare. In short, the object-based definition of cyber-warfare fails in numerous ways, being both overly broad and narrow.\n## C. Definition Based on the Medium Being Used to Attack\nThe medium-based definition concentrates on whether the object *used* in the attack is “cyber” in nature. Essentially, a medium-based definition of cyber-warfare focuses on the\nkinetic attacks have already been readily defined in a number of international treaties and laws of war).\n¹⁹ See Dennis Fisher &amp; Paul Roberts, *Spotlight Series: Stuxnet*, THREATPOST: THE KASPERSKY LAB SECURITY NEWS SERVICE.\nVolume XVIII 2014 254\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nmethod used in the attack rather than the target being attacked—much in the same way an aerial attack involves planes. The DoD seems to imply this type of understanding through its definition of cyberspace operations: “[t]he employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace.”²⁰ Importantly, this definition highlights the medium used in the operation, which parallels the way a medium-based definition of cyber-warfare focuses on whether cyberspace is used during an attack. An example of a medium-based definition for cyber-warfare can be seen in the Cambridge Dictionary as “the activity of using the internet to attack a country’s computers in order to damage things such as communication and transport systems or water and electricity supplies.”²¹ Moreover, a medium-based definition works best with the international laws of war because these laws rely on concepts that revolve around the force exerted on a target as opposed to the type of target being\n20 Joint Publication 1-02, DOD DICTIONARY OF MILITARY AND ASSOCIATED TERMS (Sept. 15, 2013), http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/ (emphasis added) (noting the DoD does not have a definition for cyber-warfare, cyber-war, or cyber-attack).\n21 CAMBRIDGE DICTIONARIES, http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/british/cyberwarfare?q=+cyberwarfare (last visited Oct. 29, 2013) (emphasis added) (noting that many other mainstream dictionaries did not include a definition of cyber-warfare, cyber-war, or cyber-attack).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nattacked.²² For the forgoing reasons, a medium-based definition should be used to define cyber-warfare. Thus, the definition of cyber-warfare should look similar, but not necessarily exactly like, the definition provided in the Cambridge Dictionary.²³\nFor example, a proper definition of cyber-warfare could be: hostile acts via cyberspace that damage or disturb a country’s infrastructure or related networks for a governmental or national security purpose.\n## III. Potential Types of Cyber-Attacks that Could Occur During Cyber-Warfare\nNow that a logical and adequate definition of cyber-warfare has been established, understanding the types of attacks a nation could experience becomes imperative to understanding how and if an attack could constitute an act of cyber-warfare. There are three main categories of cyber-attacks: syntactic, semantic, and hybrid attacks.²⁴\n### A. Syntactic Attacks\nSyntactic attacks are aimed at a computer’s operating\n²² See e.g., TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 48-49 (Cambridge University Press 2013) (explaining the use of force factors—severity, directness, measurability of effects, etc.); U.N. Charter art. 51 (implying the use of self-defense must be proportionate).\n²³ See supra note 21.\n²⁴ Susan W. Brenner &amp; Marc D. Goodman, In Defense of Cyberterrorism: An Argument for Anticipating Cyberattacks, 2022 U. ILL. J. L. TECH &amp; POL’Y 1, 27-42 (2002).\nVolume XVIII 2014 256\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nsystem and “modify the logic of the system in order to introduce delays or to make the system unpredictable.”²⁵ There are two main types of syntactic attacks: penetration and denial of service (DoS) attacks.²⁶\n## 1. PENETRATION ATTACKS\nPenetration attacks, as the name indicates, penetrate a computer system or computer network and transport whatever the programmer wants to “drop” into the system/network.²⁷ Examples of penetration attacks include the implantation of malware, viruses, Trojan horses, and worms.²⁸ All these types of penetration attacks cause actual damage to the system/network in different ways.²⁹ For example, worms replicate within the system but do not infect the host computer; nevertheless, the worm spreads throughout the entire system and eventually can cause the system to completely shut down.³⁰ Viruses effect computer systems is a different way, creating codes that become active once a user opens the file, and subsequently, the\n25  Id. at 27.\n26  See Nguyen, supra note 14, at 1092-93.\n27  Id.\n28  CDR Vida M.

DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS\nDenial of service (DoS) attacks disrupt a computer system or network by overloading the system/network, and thus, reduce its functionality.³³ Essentially, a DoS attack can completely shut down a system/network by flooding the target with false requests for service, therefore causing the system to overload.³⁴ When this happens, legitimate requests for service are blocked, and the actual purpose of the system is devastated.³⁵ Importantly, for anonymity reasons, attackers will often use distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks. A DDoS attack has the same purpose as a DoS attack; however, the attacker uses other people’s computers in addition to their own, which makes tracing the source of the attack much more difficult. Both DoS\n³¹ *Id.*\n³² See e.g., *Fisher &amp; Roberts*, *supra* note 19 (explaining how the Stuxnet worm caused actual damage to Iranian nuclear program).\n³³ JOSEPH MIGGA KIZZA, *COMPUTER NETWORK SECURITY AND CYBER ETHICS* 76 (2002).\n³⁴ Mindi McDowell, *Understanding Denial-of-Service Attacks*, UNITED STATES COMPUTER EMERGENCY READINESS TEAM (Feb. 6, 2013), http://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-015.\n³⁵ *Id.*\nVolume XVIII 2014 258\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nand DDoS attacks can harm a nation via physical or economic damages.³⁶\n## B. Semantic Attacks\nSemantic attacks do not attempt to shut down, steal information, or destroy a computer network/system; rather, they affect the accuracy of the network’s information. Essentially, “[a] system under semantic attack operates and will be perceived as operating correctly (otherwise the semantic attack is failure), but it will generate answers at variance with reality.”³⁷ While such an attack seems petty, computer users tend to accept the information given to them, especially if such information derives from a government website.³⁸ For example, if a semantic attack occurred to an important government website, such information could cause people ignore a legitimate threat or falsely perceive an innocent act as a legitimate attack. Such a semantic attack could cause people to unnecessarily bunker down or, alternatively, riot out of fear. Thus, such a semantic attack could have severe consequences\n³⁶ See e.g., John Markoff, *Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks*, New York Times (Aug. 12, 2008), http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html?_r=0 (explaining that the Russian cyber-attack on Georgia consisted of a DoS attack).\n³⁷ Brenner &amp; Goodman, *supra* note 24, at 31-32.\n³⁸ See Antolin-Jenkins, *supra* note 28, at 140 (noting how gullible or ignorant many computer users are when reading information off the internet).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\non the population.³⁹ As demonstrated above, semantic attacks can be as detrimental to a nation as syntactic attacks.\n## C. Hybrid Attacks\nHybrid attacks are exactly what the term seems to imply: a hybrid of syntactic and semantic cyber-attacks.⁴⁰ Such attacks have the greatest likelihood of causing the most destruction because the attacker could actually destroy a certain computer system (and, in turn, whatever other infrastructure was affected) and then tell the people that something completely different happened—only furthering the confusion, distrust, and destruction.⁴¹\n³⁹ See id. at 140-41 (noting that such attacks could cause great civil unrest); Brenner &amp; Goodman, supra note 24 at 31-39.\n⁴⁰ See Antolin-Jenkins, supra note 28, at 140.\n⁴¹ See id. For example,\nTerrorists can mount complex attacks by combining syntactic and semantic attacks. Imagine that terrorists target Boston, Atlanta, Miami, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles for an attack which begins with a syntactic assault on computer systems that stops the delivery of state public assistance. General public awareness of the attack will emerge gradually, as successive waves of frustrated welfare recipients file complaints with the appropriate agencies. Eventually, the realization will spread that the distribution of benefits had been deliberately shut down. Once it becomes clear that the funds are not coming, the terrorists can follow up with a semantic attack assigning responsibility for their efforts to carefully-selected right-wing groups whose views are known to carry at least the taint of racial bias. If the terrorists manage to sustain the welfare gridlock, the freezing of the resources upon which thousands depend for their survival will produce civil disobedience and localized chaos. National Guardsmen might have to be sent into these cities to maintain\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nWith an understanding of the definition of cyber-warfare and the types of cyber-attacks that could occur during cyber-warfare, we must move forward to the international laws of war that apply to any sort of attack, whether kinetic or cyber.\n## IV. International Laws of War: An Application to Cyber-Warfare\nIn this section, I will explain the major components of the international laws of war in the cyber-warfare context. First, I will briefly explain the United Nations Charter (UN Charter) and how it applies to cyber-warfare.⁴² Subsequently, I will discuss the creation and purpose of the Tallinn Manual (the Manual).⁴³ And lastly, I will explain the United States’ approach and strategies to handing the possibility of cyber-warfare.⁴⁴ Each of these components is essential in understanding how to properly respond to an act of warfare, specifically cyber-\norder. To make things even more interesting, the terrorists can then direct a syntactic attack at ATM and banking system computers in these cities. Such a shutdown will add to the problem by causing outrage among citizens who do not depend on welfare funds. The cumulative effects of all these efforts will be riots, targeted violence and a National Guard stretched to its limit (which will create an excellent opportunity for the terrorists to stage a CBERN attack in other areas of the country).\nBrenner &amp; Goodman, supra note 24, at 39-40.\n42 See infra Part IV.A.\n43 See infra Part IV.B.\n44 See infra Part IV.C.\n261\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nwarfare.\n## A. The United Nations Charter\nThe UN Charter functions as the backbone to the current international laws of war.⁴⁵ It sets forth many rules and guidelines that apply to war; including starting a conflict, responding to an attack, and how the UN should respond to an attack on a member nation.⁴⁶ Understanding the UN Charter is crucial to understanding the later developments that deal specifically with cyber-warfare.\n## 1. GENERAL BACKGROUND\nThe UN Charter was created to “save succeeding generations from the scourge of war . . . to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights . . . to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other resources of international law . . . and to promote social progress.”⁴⁷ Moreover, the overarching goals of the UN Charter were to allow countries to live tolerantly and in peace, to strengthen international peace and security, to ensure that armed forces are a last resort, and to promote\n⁴⁵ See History of the United Nations, http://www.un.org/en/aboutun/history/charter_history.shtml (last visited Oct. 30, 2013).\n⁴⁶ See generally U.N. Charter arts. 2, 4, 42, 51 (explaining the rules regarding starting a conflict, responding to an attack, and assisting an ally who has been attacked).\n⁴⁷ Id. pmbl.\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nsocial and economic advancement for all people.⁴⁸ Notably, the United States is a member of United Nations along with many other world powers, including Russia, China, and the United Kingdom.⁴⁹ Furthermore, the UN Charter is binding upon the United States under Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution.⁵⁰ As discussed below, the UN Charter successfully created rules that allow for a far more humane world, even in the face of war, but unfortunately, these rules may be obsolete in terms of cyber-warfare.\n## 2. ARTICLE 2(4): PROHIBITING THE THREAT OR USE OF FORCE\nArticle 2, paragraph 4 of the UN Charter provides a quintessential rule: “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.”⁵¹ Essentially, this rule prohibits a country from threatening or using “force” on another country, provided\n48  Id.\n49  Member States of the United Nations, http://www.un.org/en/members/ (last visited Oct. 30, 2013) (noting there are 193 member nation with only Vatican City, Kosovo, The Republic of Taiwan, and Palestine not being members).\n50  U.S. CONST. art. II, § 2, cl. 1 (noting this is known as the Treaty Clause).\n51  Id. art. 2, para. 4.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nthe exception of self-defense discussed later in this section.⁵² Unfortunately, however, the term “threat or use of force” is never defined in the UN Charter, causing unrest and numerous debates.⁵³ Nevertheless, academics over the years have determined that this term involves only the uses or threat of *military* forces or attacks affecting the victim nation’s *military*, precluding economic and political coercion.⁵⁴ Notably, the UN Charter also specifically precludes espionage.⁵⁵\nThis rule is important in the cyber-warfare context because article 4(2) would prevent a victim country from attacking the aggressor country that committed the cyber-attack.⁵⁶ Thus, a country who falls victim to an act of cyber-warfare may not retaliate unless such an attack falls within the self-defense exception of article 51 via qualifying as an armed attack. The vagueness concerning the meaning of “use of force” presents an issue in the cyber-warfare context because at what point does a cyber-attack qualify as a use of *military* force?⁵⁷\n⁵² *Id.* art. 51.\n⁵³ See generally *id.* arts. 2, 4, 41, 42, 51 (noting that there is no definition section or individual definition for “threat or use of force”).\n⁵⁴ See e.g., MATTHEW C.

ARTICLES 41 AND 42\nArticles 41 and 42 of the UN Charter provide directions for how the UN can support a country that is being attacked.⁵⁸ Article 41 focuses on a way to counter an attack that does not mount to a “use of force,” whereas article 42 provides the UN the power to use force to counter such an attack, but only if it is determined that the attack qualified as a “use of force” and article 41 remedies would be inadequate.⁵⁹ Article 41’s non-forceful remedies would include economic blockades and political pressure.⁶⁰ While these two articles do not analyze whether a country can defend itself, they do provide structure and direction for how UN members should respond to an attack on their own country or on an ally.⁶¹ Primarily, articles 41 and 42 allow the UN to analyze the extent of the attack—whether there was a use of force—and, subsequently, allow the UN to\n⁵⁸ See U.N. Charter arts. 41, 42.\n⁵⁹ See id. Article 41 states “The Security Council may decide what measures not involving the use of armed force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and it may call upon the Members of the United Nations to apply such measures. These may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations. Id. art 41. If the UN decides that article 41 relief would be insufficient, it may “take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security. Such action may include demonstrations, blockade, and other operations by air, sea, or land forces of Members of the United Nations.” Id. art. 42.\n⁶⁰ See id. art. 41.\n⁶¹ See id. arts. 41, 42.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\ndecide to either use non-forceful or forceful remedies.⁶² While the substance of articles 41 and 42 are important, the most essential aspect of these articles is their purpose—to prevent forceful responses to an attack unless absolutely necessary to maintain international security and peace.⁶³\nIn discussing cyber-warfare, the most important aspect of articles 41 and 42 is their purpose as discussed directly above.⁶⁴ Thus, unless there is a clear use of force during a cyber-attack, it seems the United States or any other member of the UN could only respond via a non-forceful response—i.e., an economic blockade or political pressures.⁶⁵\n## 4. ARTICLE 51\nArticle 51 of the UN Charter provides the exception to general rule of article 2(4), which prohibits the use of force against other nations. Article 51 states:\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately\n⁶² See id.\n⁶³ See id.\n⁶⁴ See id. pmbl, arts. 41, 42.\n⁶⁵ See id. arts. 41, 42.\nVolume XVIII 2014 266\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nreported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.⁶⁶\nWhile Article 51 expressly creates an exception for the use of force in self-defense, some issues arise in the cyber-warfare context, especially when looking at the specific wording.⁶⁷ Much like the issue with our basic definition of cyber-warfare, article 51 allows a nation to defend itself only if the attack amounts to an “armed attack,” which a cyber-attack would never seem to qualify as.⁶⁸ Nevertheless, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) adjusted the definition of an armed attack by defining it more broadly and explaining that armed attacks “do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”⁶⁹ Thus, the term armed attack actually functions more as an expansion to “use of force” as opposed to an attack with actual kinetic weapons.⁷⁰\nMoreover, the ICJ decided in *Nicaragua v. United States* that\n⁶⁶ *Id.* art. 51. (emphasis added).\n⁶⁷ *See id.*\n⁶⁸ *See supra* Part II.A.; U.N.

(explaining the Manual is a “non-binding document applying existing law to cyber-warfare”).\n⁷⁸ Id. at 16-17, 22 (noting these experts included legal practitioners, technical experts, and academics).\n⁷⁹ Id. at 22.\n⁸⁰ Id.\n⁸¹ Id. at 17-18 (explaining the Manual was created “in hope of bringing some degree of clarity to the complex legal issues surrounding cyber operations, with particular attention paid to those involving the jus ad bellum and the jus\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nof cyber-warfare, thus excluding cyber-espionage (to the extent espionage does not involve “use of force”) and cyber-crimes.⁸² To reiterate, “it is essential to understand that the Tallinn Manual is not an official document” and, thus, is not binding on any nation.⁸³\n## 2. RULES 11 AND 12: DEFINITIONS OF FORCE AND THREAT OF FORCE\nImportantly, and unlike the UN Charter, the Manual actually defines both the crucial terms “use of force” and “threat of force.”⁸⁴ Starting with these definitions will allow for a better understanding of the Manual, even though these definitions come after some important rules within the Manual.⁸⁵\n### a. Rule 11: Definition of Use of Force\nThe Manual directly refers back to Nicaragua v. United States when determining what actions constitute a use of in bello”).\n⁸² *Id.* at 18.\n⁸³ *Id.* at 23. Nevertheless, the Manual could function in a similar way to the Lieber Code—an aspirational attempt to regulate warfare during the civil war—in that the Lieber Code eventually “became a core text in the modern laws of war recognized worldwide, and many elements of his code continue to inform our public debate how best to respond to a new form of warfare in both an effective and a moral manner.” Nick Beard, *The Liber Codes*, *THE NEW YORK TIMES: THE OPINION PAGES* (Apr. 24, 2013, 12:59 PM), http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/the-lieber-codes/?_r=0.\n⁸⁴ *TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE* 47-53.\n⁸⁵ *Id.* at 45, 47-53 (noting that the Prohibition of Threat or Use of Force, Rule 10, comes before the definitions of “use of force” and “threat of force”).\nVolume XVIII 2014 270\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nforce—applying the “scale and effects” test.⁸⁶ While the scale and effects test is not black and white, it provides a nation with a decent idea of what constitutes a use of force.⁸⁷ The Manual, however, does create some black and white rules.⁸⁸ For example, the Manual unequivocally states that “[a]cts that injure or kill persons or damage or destroy objects are unambiguously uses of force.”⁸⁹ Notably, like the UN Charter, the Manual excludes economic and political coercion from qualifying as use of force.⁹⁰ The Manual, moreover, explicitly rejects the notion that a non-destructive cyber-attack that is intended solely to undermine the confidence in a government would qualify as a use of force.⁹¹ As the Manual progresses through the definition of use of force, it designates eight factors that are supposed to help a nation determine whether a non-obvious act qualifies as a use of force—essentially adding factors to the scale and effects test.⁹² The list of factors includes the following: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects,\n⁸⁶ See id. at 47; Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. United States), 1986 I.C.J. 14, 103-04 (June 27).\n⁸⁷ Id.\n⁸⁸ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 49.\n⁸⁹ Id.\n⁹⁰ See id. at 48.\n⁹¹ Id.

Rule 12: Definition of Threat of Force\nRule 12 of the Manual breaks down the functional meaning of “threat of force” in the cyber-warfare context.⁹⁴ Importantly, the rule explains that a threat could occur in two situations: (1) “a cyber operation that is used to communicate a threat to use force” and (2) “a threat carried out by any means . . . to carry out cyber operations qualifying as use of force.”⁹⁵ The rule further notes that a demand need not accompany the threat to qualify as such under this rule; however, actions alone that seem threatening do not qualify as a threat because a threat must be “communicative in nature.”⁹⁶ The rule also states that a threat of force could technically derive form a nation that seems unequipped to follow through will such a threat; nonetheless, it’s the threat that matters.⁹⁷ Interestingly, the rule explains that\n⁹³ *Id.* (explaining out that the list of factors is not exhaustive and functions only as a starting point).\n⁹⁴ *Id.* at 52-53.\n⁹⁵ *Id.* at 52.\n⁹⁶ *Id.* at 53 (explaining that developing technology that could be used in an act that qualifies as a use of force *does not* qualify as a threat of force).\n⁹⁷ *Id.* (noting the experts were split with this portion of the rule).\nVolume XVIII 2014 272\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\na nation will not be considered to have actually made a threat of force, even if that nation makes such a threat and has the capability of following through with such threat, as long as that nation does not truly intend on attacking—essentially requiring actual intent.⁹⁸ Much like the definition of use of force, this definition lacks perfect clarity and contains many intricacies, but should be of great help in determining what actually constitutes a threat of force.\n## 3. RULE 10: PROHIBITION OF THREAT OR USE OF FORCE\nRule 10 of the Manual parallels article 2(4) of the UN Charter by making “[a] cyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force . . . unlawful.”⁹⁹ The commentary following Rule 10 clarifies that the “use of force” does not need to be committed by a country’s armed forces; rather, the force could derive from an intelligence agency or any private contractor of the nation. Rule 10 also discusses a nation “intervening” in another nation’s affairs—political, economic, social, cultural, or otherwise.¹⁰⁰ The rule explains that it is unlawful for another nation to intervene but goes on to explain that the term\n⁹⁸ *Id.* (noting, once again, that the experts were split with this portion of the rule).\n⁹⁹ *See id.* at 45 (Cambridge University Press 2013); U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4 (noting that both prohibit the threat or use of force).\n¹⁰⁰ *TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE* 46.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n\"intervene\" does have the same meaning as in a layman context; instead, intervention in the cyber-war context, as well as for the UN Charter, must involve coercion.¹⁰¹ The rule further explains that an unlawful act of intervention does not per se qualify as a use of force; the intervention still must breach the threshold for use of force independently.¹⁰² Thus, when determining whether an intervention is unlawful, a nation must ascertain if coercion is involved, and moreover, must decide if the intervention reached the level of use of force.¹⁰³ Fundamentally, Rule 10 applies article 2(4) of the UN Charter to the cyber-warfare setting.\n## 4. RULES 13, 14, 15 AND 16: THE RIGHT AND REGULATIONS FOR SELF-DEFENSE AND COLLECTIVE SELF-DEFENSE\nRules 13, 14, 15, and 16 of the Manual all explain the ability of a victim nation to launch a defensive response—in a parallel manner to article 51 of the UN Charter.¹⁰⁴ Rule 13 discusses an individual nation’s right to protect itself; rule 14 examines how an act of self-defense must be necessary and proportionate to the original attack; rule 15 delves into\n¹⁰¹ *Id.* at 47 (“intervention pure and simple is not intervention [in the UN Charter or Tallinn Manual context]”).\n¹⁰² *Id.* at 46.\n¹⁰³ *Id.* at 46-47; see UN Charter art. 51.\n¹⁰⁴ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 53-64.\nVolume XVIII 2014 274\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nthe ability of a nation to preemptively strike in an act of self-defense; and rule 16 examines the possibility of collective self-defense, that is a third party nation(s) coming to the aid of a victim nation.¹⁰⁵ These rules are essential to the completeness of the Manual, especially in the Manual’s attempt to mimic article 51 of the UN Charter.¹⁰⁶\n## a. Rule 13: Self-Defense Against Armed Attack\nRule 13 of the Manual allows a nation to exercise the right of self-defense, given that such nation faced an attack—cyber or kinetic—that qualified as an armed attack.¹⁰⁷ The term “armed attack” is quantified by the scale and effects of the attack, much like the use of force threshold in rule 11, but has an even heightened threshold beyond use of force.¹⁰⁸ Plainly, an armed attack is the “gravest” form of a use of force.¹⁰⁹ Unfortunately, however, the Manual never defines what the exact threshold is for the scale and effects test—only causing confusion.¹¹⁰ The scale and effects of an attack, though, must\n105 Id.\n106 See id.; UN Charter art. 51.\n107 See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 53-59 (explaining that “some cyber-attacks may be sufficiently grave to warrant classifying them as an ‘armed attack’”).\n108 See id. at 48-49, 54-55 (noting that while the two thresholds—armed attack and use of force—use the same threshold test, an armed attack holds a higher threshold).\n109 Id. at 48.\n110 See id. at 55-56 (indicating that the scale and effects test must be\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nbe reasonably foreseeable. Therefore, an attack that causes grave damage far beyond any reasonable foresight would not constitute an armed attack.¹¹¹ Notably, an armed attack must have a trans-border component; thus, a purely domestic attack can never qualify as an armed attack within the Manual’s framework.¹¹² The rule further explains that an armed attack can originate from a state or a non-state actor who is directed by the state to take such actions.¹¹³ Additionally, the rule states that individual attacks that alone do not qualify as armed attacks can be classified as armed attacks if that single attack is just one in a series of attacks. Accordingly, aggregated non-armed attacks can elevate and cross the threshold of an armed attack.¹¹⁴ The comments for rule 13 continue in detail about the irrelevance of intentions, the ability of a third party nation to defend itself if the scale and effects of the attack bleed over borders, and the ability of a victim nation to retaliate against persons who are located in an innocent third party nation—so as long the victim nation has permission to do so or the innocent third party nation\napplied on a case-by-case basis).\n¹¹¹ *Id.* at 56.\n¹¹² *Id.* at 54.\n¹¹³ *Id.* at 54-58 (detailing the intricacies and problems with attributing a non-state actor’s actions to a state).\n¹¹⁴ *Id.* at 55 (explaining that there must be convincing evidence that the multiple attacks are related).\nVolume XVIII 2014 276\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nis unable to take action.¹¹⁵ In short, a nation has the right to defend itself if attacked by another nation via an armed attack as determined by the scale and effects test.¹¹⁶\n## b. Rule 14: Necessity and Proportionality\nEven if it is determined that a nation has the right to defend itself—either via kinetic or cyber action—that nation’s defensive response must be necessary and proportionate.¹¹⁷ Simply put, if any non-use of force action could be taken to solve the problem, such action must be taken.¹¹⁸ Notably, this “necessity” is judged from the victim nation’s perspective.¹¹⁹ The rule also discusses proportionality.¹²⁰ Proportionality addresses how much force a victim nation may use in the defensive action. Factors such as scale, scope, duration, and intensity play a role in this determination.¹²¹ Importantly, this proportionality test does not require a victim nation to mirror the scale, scope, duration, and intensity of the offensive attack; but rather, the defensive action must be proportionate to the\n115 *Id.* at 58-59.\n116 *See id.* at 53-59.\n117 *Id.* at 59.\n118 *Id.* (“[This rule] merely requires that non-forceful measures be insufficient to address the situation.”).\n119 *Id.* at 60.\n120 *Id.*\n121 *Id.* (explaining that a kinetic attack could be used to respond to a cyber-attack and vice-versa).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nforce needed to successfully defend against the offensive attack.¹²² Moreover, the rule indicates that kinetic attacks may be used in defense of certain cyber-attacks, given that the kinetic attack is necessary and proportionate.¹²³ The rule concerning necessity and proportionality is of great importance when deciding how to properly respond to an offensive armed attack.¹²⁴\n## c. Rule 15: Imminence and Immediacy\nThe Manual takes a step beyond the UN Charter by detailing when a nation can preemptively defend itself and the general time frame allowed for a defensive attack.¹²⁵ Rule 15 specifically allows for preemptive defense actions if an armed attack from an enemy nation is imminent.¹²⁶ To be considered imminent, the need to defend must be “instant, overwhelming, [and] leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.”¹²⁷ Interestingly, the experts involved in writing\n¹²² *Id.* (indicating that the defensive attack is judged on “the level of force needed to successfully mount a defense . . . more force may be necessary, or less force may be sufficient [ ] to repel the attack or defeat one that is imminent”).\n¹²³ *Id.*\n¹²⁴ *See id.* at 59-60.\n¹²⁵ *See id.* at 60-63.\n¹²⁶ *Id.* at 60. (noting the Manual uses the term “anticipatory self-defence”).\n¹²⁷ *Id.* (quoting Letter from Daniel Webster to Lord Ashburton (Aug. 6, 1842), reprinted in 2 *INTERNATIONAL LAW DIGEST* 412 (John Bassett Moore ed. 1906)).\nVolume XVIII 2014 278\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nthe Manual chose to use this standard because of its flexibility and applicability for case-by-case analyses.¹²⁸ Regarding the immediacy of the defensive response, factors such as the period necessary to identify the attacker, the temporal proximity between the attack and response, and the time required to prepare a response are considered.¹²⁹ Additionally, the rule discusses the length of time allowed for continuous defensive responses, stating that the victim nation “must reasonably conclude that that further cyber operations are likely to follow,” or else such nation could be liable for the continuing defensive responses.¹³⁰ Therefore, a nation must be cautious in preemptively attacking an enemy nation, attacking the enemy nation at a too attenuated period of time, or attacking the enemy nation for too long a period of time.¹³¹\n## d. Rule 16: Collective Self-Defense\nThe Manual allows a third party nation to assist a victim nation, but only if the victim nation requests such assistance.¹³² More than one third of a party nation can help a victim nation, but in any situation involving collective self-defense, both the\n¹²⁸ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 61 (noting that this standard was not universally agreed to).\n¹²⁹ Id. at 62.\n¹³⁰ Id. at 63.\n¹³¹ See id. at 60-64.\n¹³² Id. at 63.\n279\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nassisting and victim nations must determine that the offensive act qualifies as an armed attack or imminent armed attack.¹³³ Moreover, the assisting nation must still follow the rules of necessity, proportionality, imminence, and immediacy.¹³⁴ Notably, an assisting nation can only aid to the extent that the victim nation condones. For example, if the victim state only wants to respond via a cyber action, the assisting nation cannot use kinetic weapons—even if the use of such weapons would be allowed under the rules of the Manual.¹³⁵ The Manual also recognizes certain *ad hoc* agreements as constituting consent of the victim state, i.e. NATO agreements. Essentially, collective self-defense follows the same rules discussed above yet also contains additional rules to protect the victim state from losing control over the defensive response.¹³⁶\n## 5. SUMMARY OF THE TALLINN MANUAL\nAs valuable and progressive as the Manual might be, it still suffers from not being binding on any nation, therefore, functioning only as “a product of a group of independent experts acting solely in their personal capacity.”¹³⁷ Nevertheless,\n¹³³ *Id.*\n¹³⁴ *Id.* at 64.\n¹³⁵ *Id.* at 63.\n¹³⁶ *See id.* at 59-64.\n¹³⁷ *Id.* at 23.\nVolume XVIII 2014 280\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nthe Manual provides a solid basis for possible future codifications regarding the international laws of cyber-warfare. By formulating an authority that applies the UN Charter and many other recognized international principles of law to a cyber-warfare setting, the Manual has greatly advanced the understanding of how the international laws of war will apply to cyber-warfare.\n## C. United States’ Strategies and Approaches\nWhile the United States has not created an official policy in the same light or depth as the Tallinn Manual, President Obama has signed several executive orders and presidential policy directives that discuss how the United States needs to better protect itself, specifically its critical infrastructure, from the possibility of cyber-attacks.¹³⁸ These orders and directives, however, solely discuss how the United States can better protect itself via improved communications and updated cyber-security tactics. They gloss over how the United States would and could respond to a cyber-attack—specifically an attack that could lead to cyber-warfare.¹³⁹ The most relevant and\n¹³⁸ See e.g., Exec.

HAROLD KOH’S SPEECH AT THE UNITED STATES CYBER COMMAND CONFERENCE\nThe timing of Koh’s speech was impeccable and purposeful as it was given a mere three weeks after the non-official release of the Tallinn Manual—providing a strong indication that the speech was a direct response to the ideas and policies within the Manual.¹⁴¹ Much like the Manual, Koh acknowledged that international principles of law should apply to cyber-warfare and emphasized that the cyber world is anything but law-free.¹⁴² Moreover, Koh applied the “use of force” test of the UN Charter article 2(4) and gave a number of factors (like the Manual) including, “the context of the event, the actor perpetrating the action (recognizing challenging issues of attribution in cyberspace), the target and location, [and the]\n¹⁴⁰ Harold Honhgu Koh, Legal Advisor of the Dep’t of State, International Law in Cyberspace, Address to the USCYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference (Sept. 18, 2012), available at http://www.state.gov/s/l/releases/remarks/197924.htm [hereinafter Koh’s Speech] (noting that Koh has been an international lawyer for over thirty years, with the State Department for three and one half years, and is known as a premier legal-mind in the field).\n¹⁴¹ *Id.*\n¹⁴² *Id.*\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\neffects and intent,” to help determine if a cyber-attack crosses the threshold of use of force.¹⁴³ Koh also recognized that the United States may defend itself if the offensive attack reaches the extent of an armed attack under article 51 of the UN Charter, but in the same fashion as the Manual and UN Charter, the defense action must be proportionate, necessary, and distinct.¹⁴⁴ Notably, Koh emphasized that the United States, and any other nation for that matter, should ensure its cyber weapons are not “inherently indiscriminate,” preventing unnecessary and unpredictable damage.¹⁴⁵ Koh further recognized that cyber-warfare could bleed over borders into innocent third party countries, and most importantly, explained that any nation should be held responsible for the actions of a non-state actor that conducted a cyber-attack at the direction of such nation.¹⁴⁶\nAfter essentially reiterating the rules and policies of the UN Charter and Manual, Koh moved forward to the issues that arise when applying such rules and policies to cyber-warfare.¹⁴⁷ First, Koh addressed the issue of how to determine the scope and effect of a cyber-attack that does not cause the same type\n143 *Id.*; see U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4.\n144 Koh’s Speech; see U.N. Charter art. 51.\n145 Koh’s Speech.\n146 *Id.*\n147 *Id.*\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nof damage as a kinetic attack. Koh, however, left the question open and merely stated that the United States holds the right to defensively act against any attack that could be viewed as an armed attack under the UN Charter.¹⁴⁸ Koh next discussed the innate difficulties in analyzing an attack on a civilian target but, unfortunately, gave no solution—only raising the issue.¹⁴⁹ Lastly, Koh spoke to the issue of attribution, but like the previous two issues, he only mentioned the problem of attribution and never truly analyzed it.¹⁵⁰ Koh simply stated, “[n]ot all of the issues I’ve mentioned are susceptible to clear legal answers derived from existing precedents.”¹⁵¹ Essentially, Koh recognized these issues but gave no defined answers, simply leaving the issues to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.¹⁵²\nIn closing his speech, Koh explained that international humanitarian laws, i.e. the UN Charter, are not the only laws applying to cyber-warfare, recognizing that the cyber world is so interconnected that laws applying to human rights, criminal activity, and many others should also be applied to\n¹⁴⁸ See id. (noting that the United States would still have to follow the laws regarding a defensive response); U.N. Charter art. 51.\n¹⁴⁹ See Koh’s Speech.\n¹⁵⁰ Id.\n¹⁵¹ Id.\n¹⁵² See id.\nVolume XVIII 2014 284\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\ncyber-warfare.¹⁵³ Lastly, Koh emphasized the importance of understanding international laws in the cyber-warfare context and, equally, the ability to openly discuss the problems of applying such laws to cyber-warfare. Koh’s speech, while lacking some definite answers, was still educational on how the United States government views cyber-warfare in the same manner as the Manual and anticipates on applying the laws of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare in a similar fashion to the Manual.¹⁵⁴\n## V. Issues in Applying the International Laws of War to Cyber-Warfare\nEven as the legal field attempts to define cyber-warfare and apply internationally recognized laws of war to cyber-warfare, many issues still arise in the application of these laws. In this section, I will discuss several issues, including the differences in applying the terms “use of force” and “armed attack,” problems with the scale and effects test, the always troublesome issue of attribution, and the accumulation of such issues during an attack on a civilian target.\n¹⁵³ See id.\n¹⁵⁴ See id.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n## A. The Different Applications of Use of Force and Armed Attack\nThe problem of figuring out if a cyber-attack reached the level of a “use of force” and/or an “armed attack” is a genuine and difficult issue. While these thresholds create a basis for evaluating an attack, they are both vague and indecisive.¹⁵⁵ For example, the UN Charter does not even attempt to solve the issue of what “use of force” entails and applies the scale and effects test to only armed attacks, while the Manual—which Koh seems to side with—applies the scales and effects test to both.¹⁵⁶ The disparities in opinion continue beyond the differences in the application of the tests; the UN charter seems to imply a use of force or armed attack must occur through armed forces and/or cause physical damage to a nation’s military, while the Tallinn Manual and Koh would disagree.¹⁵⁷ Moreover, the scale and effects test has many of its own flaws\n---\n¹⁵⁵ See e.g., Waxman, *supra* note 54, at 44-46 (explaining the vagueness of use of force in the UN Charter); see TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-49 (Cambridge University Press 2013) (noting that the Manual had to use examples and factors to try and explain the usage of the definition for use of force and still admitted the definition is anything but foolproof).\n¹⁵⁶ See U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4, art. 51; TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-59; Koh’s Speech.\n¹⁵⁷ Waxman, *supra* note 53, at 44-46; TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 55.\nVolume XVIII 2014 286\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nas discussed in the next section.¹⁵⁸ The dissimilarities between the Manual, Koh’s speech, and the UN Charter alone cause a great amount of confusion and uncertainty. Significantly, and to reiterate, of the (potential) rules discussed, only the UN Charter is binding; thus, its interpretation has the most significance and, seemingly, the only relevance at the current time. In short, the lack of cohesiveness and uniformity between the UN Charter and Manual only creates greater confusion in an already perplexed field.\n## B. Issues with the Scale and Effects Test\nThe scale and effects test used in the UN Charter, Tallinn Manual, and Koh’s speech faces some major challenges in the cyber-warfare context, including unpredictability, reversible effects, and differentiating effects.¹⁵⁹ Regarding unpredictability, programmers can fall victim to coding error, or cyber-security defenses that cause the programmer to adjust the attack on the fly, thus triggering unknown effects.¹⁶⁰ Consequently, the attack could either collapse or reach new levels of destruction.¹⁶¹ This unpredictability could have effects on intent, especially if the attack was never meant to reach the threshold of “use of force”\n158 See supra Part.V.B.\n159 See Nguyen, supra note 14, at 1100-1124.\n160 See id. at 1100.\n161 See id.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nand/or an “armed attack.”¹⁶² Notably, the UN Charter takes intent in account when determining whether an attack breached the thresholds for either use of force or an armed attack, whereas the Manual *does not* base its analysis on intention whatsoever—solely analyzing the scale and effects of the attack.¹⁶³ Thus, the unpredictability of cyber-attacks affects the scale and effects test differently depending on whether the UN Charter or Manual is being applied. From another perspective, a nation’s cyber-security defenses could interact with an attack in unforeseen ways, causing a chain reaction that overwhelms or shuts down a network. In this scenario, is the attacker blamed for scale and effects of the shutdown, or is the victim nation’s faulty defenses to blame? The unpredictability of cyber-attacks will continuously cause problems in applying the scale and effects test.\nThe ability of cyber-attacks to cause reversible damages as well as delayed or prolonged damages also raises concerns.¹⁶⁴ Presumably, if the effects were reversible, the scale and effects of an attack would be greatly diminished—even if such an\n¹⁶² *See id.* at 1103-04.\n¹⁶³ *See supra* Part.IV.B.4.a.\n¹⁶⁴ *See* Martin Libiki, *Pulling Punches in Cyberspace*, *PROCEEDINGS OF A WORKSHOP ON DETERRING CYBERATTACKS: INFORMING STRATEGIES AND DEVELOPING OPTIONS FOR U.S. POLICY* 123, 124-129 (2010).\nVolume XVIII 2014 288\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nattack had immense effects in the short term.¹⁶⁵ Nevertheless, the essential factor would be the immediate scale and effects, and thus, if the immediate scale and effects constituted a use of force or armed attack, then a victim nation could take the prescribed measures under the applicable laws of war. Alternatively, how can the laws of war apply to a cyber-attack that affects two countries differently?¹⁶⁶ For example, what if a cyber-attack caused minimal damage to a more advanced country and significant damage to a less advanced country? Could only the less advanced country respond to the attack? The answer to this question, is likely that only the less advanced country could respond. While this answer adheres to the international laws of war, it seems rather illogical that the exact same attack could lead to such different defensive responses.¹⁶⁷ Even though the scales and effects test has been widely acknowledge in the UN Charter, Manual, and Koh’s speech, the test is anything but flawless.\n## C. Issues of Attribution\nThe issue of attribution may be the most troublesome of the many issues that arise in applying the international laws\n¹⁶⁵ See id.\n¹⁶⁶ See Nguyen, supra note 14, at 1124.\n¹⁶⁷ See id. at 1124-25.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nof war to cyber-warfare. Unlike traditional warfare when it is relatively simple to discover who launched an attack against a nation, a cyber-attack can be nearly impossible to attribute to a particular nation, especially if a non-state actor is working at the direction of a nation.¹⁶⁸ Such is true because the cyber world offers so many options for anonymity and hiding attacks behind other networks.¹⁶⁹ People experienced within the cyber world can easily forge or conceal their identity, especially if motivated to hide an illegal attack.¹⁷⁰ Moreover, even if a nation is identified, such nation can easily deny that the attack derived from their networks—instead claiming that they were hacked.¹⁷¹ Even more troublesome, if a non-state actor is identified as the originator of an attack, an accused nation could deny any nexus with the attacking non-state actor. The numerous loopholes involved with attributing an attack to a particular nation presents some serious problems in applying the international laws of war to cyber-warfare.\n---\n¹⁶⁸ *See e.g.,* Broad, Markoff &amp; Sanger, *supra* note 6 (explaining that no one is still one hundred percent certain where Stuxnet derived from)\n¹⁶⁹ *See* Nguyen, *supra* note 14, at 1104-05.\n¹⁷⁰ *See id.* at 1104-06.\n¹⁷¹ *See id.*\n*Volume XVIII 2014*                                                                 290\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\n## D. Applying the UN Charter and Tallinn Manual to an Attack on a Civilian Target\nIn this section, I will pose a couple of hypothetical situations to explain how a nation, specifically the United States, should respond to a cyber-attack that may or may not qualify as an act of cyber-warfare according to the UN Charter and the Manual—given Koh essentially adheres to the Manual. The two hypothetical situations involve (1) an attack on a civilian target that has some military aspects and (2) an attack on a purely civilian target. Notably, I will assume these attacks can be accurately attributed to the originator of the attack—a non-state actor directed by such state.\nSignificantly, this assumption would require the attack to affect the United States’ military to be considered having military characteristics. The issue of attribution is of such concern that the following examples could not be analyzed without making this assumption.\n### 1. ATTACK ON A CIVILIAN TARGET WITH MILITARY ASPECTS\nThe following fact pattern will present an opportunity to analyze an attack on a civilian target with military aspects: A foreign country attacks Boeing—a civilian aerospace company that, among many other things, helps the United States Military\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nresearch, test, and maintain aerospace technologies—via a cyber invasion that both steals and destroys both civilian and military related information.\nBefore moving forward and analyzing this attack under both the UN Charter and Manual, it is important to distinguish the espionage portion of the attack (the stealing) from the attacking portion of the attack (the destruction) because neither the UN Charter nor the Manual were created to analyze mere acts of espionage; but rather, they were created to analyze actual attacks.¹⁷² And to reiterate, we are assuming this attack can be accurately attributed to a non-sate actor working for such foreign country.\nUnder the UN Charter, this “attack” might constitute a use of force but unlikely would be classified as an armed attack. Importantly, only the military information that was destroyed could be considered in this analysis because the UN Charter requires the attack to have some sort of military aspect, and in this hypothetical, the civilian information lacks any sort of military character.¹⁷³ The destruction of the military information from Boeing could result in a use of force or armed attack depending on what exactly was destroyed and, more\n¹⁷² See supra Parts IVA.1, IV.B.1.\n¹⁷³ See supra Part IV.A.2.\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nimportantly, the consequence of destroying such information. If the destroyed military information involved details regarding national security that generated the scale and effects equivalent of military force, then the United States could likely classify the attack as a use of force. Classifying the attack as an armed attack, however, would be far more difficult because there was no physical damage in the sense of the UN Charter.¹⁷⁴ The United States could argue the destruction of computer files constitutes physical damage because such damage equates that of a kinetic attack, but this argument would be weak in these circumstances because the attack had no effect on Boeing’s operations like a kinetic attack would. Notably, this same type of analysis would be used regardless of where the information was destroyed, even if from the Pentagon.¹⁷⁵ Essentially, the scale and effects of the attack determine what actions are or are not allowed under the UN Charter. In short, this example epitomizes the rigorousness of the UN Charter’s requirement of military force and physical damage, especially in terms of cyber-warfare.\nUnder the Manual, a country potentially could have\n¹⁷⁴ See supra Part IV.A.4.\n¹⁷⁵ See supra Part IV (noting that the location being the Pentagon would likely cause of the information destroyed to have military character).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nan easier time defining this attack as a use of force and/or an armed attack. Unlike the UN Charter’s requirement of military character, the Manual strictly analyses the scale and effects of an attack; therefore, both the civilian and military information that was destroyed must be analyzed. In doing so, the United State must use the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, state involvement, military character, and presumptive legality.¹⁷⁶ When applying these factors to this hypothetical, it seems the attack would constitute a use force because of the attack’s mild severity, high invasiveness, partial military character, attributable state involvement, and presumptive illegality. While the attack seems to be a use of force, the attack will not likely be considered an armed attack, especially given the high standard provided by the Manual—an armed attack is the *gravest* form of use of force.¹⁷⁷ Here, the attack seems significant but not in the same category of the *gravest* uses of force. Thus, the attack will likely constitute a use of force but not an armed attack.\nGiven that under both the UN Charter and Manual this attack is merely a use of force but not an armed attack, the\n¹⁷⁶ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 51-52. (Cambridge University Press 2013).\n¹⁷⁷ See id. at 48.\nVolume XVIII 2014 294\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nUnited States would not be able to defensively respond via article 51 or rule 13.¹⁷⁸ Thus, the United States would have to respond by finding out why the foreign nation wanted to destroy such information and, moreover, the United States might have to destroy the information that was stolen.¹⁷⁹ Moreover, the United States could put political and economic pressure on the foreign country committing this illegal use of force.¹⁸⁰ The UN Charter also would provide the United States with the ability to request the UN’s assistance in properly responding to the attack.¹⁸¹ Alternatively, under the Manual, the United States could choose to take preemptive action via rule 15 in fear of the scale and effects of the destroyed information. Notably, the United States would have to show the immediacy and imminence of the foreign nation’s possible armed attack.¹⁸² Showing this immediacy and imminence would require more facts, but the more liberal attitude of the Manual can be seen in both the analyses of the attack as well as the United States’ ability to respond to this kind of attack\nEssentially, the Manual provides a more liberal outlook\n¹⁷⁸ See supra Part IV (noting that if it determined an attack constitutes a use of force, the defensive response must be necessary and proportionate).\n¹⁷⁹ See id.\n¹⁸⁰ See id.\n¹⁸¹ See supra Part IV.A.3.\n¹⁸² See supra Part.IV.B.4.c.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\non attacks that do not directly and physically damage something or someone, even if there are certain military aspects involved in the attack. While both the UN Charter and the Manual could allow the United States to classify this attack as a use of force—especially given the partial military characteristic of the attack—the Manual more easily provides such a classification and could allow the United States to take more action regarding this attack. In short, this hypothetical provides an example of how the Manual is more adaptive and on-point with attacks that could lead to cyber-warfare.\n## 2. ATTACK ON A PURELY CIVILIAN TARGET\nThe following fact pattern will present an opportunity to analyze an attack on a purely civilian target: A foreign country attacks the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) that results in the market crashing and/or freezing for a period of time.\nUnder the UN Charter, this attack would not constitute a use of force or armed attack. Attacking a country’s economy, while devastating, lacks any sort of military characteristic; thus, the UN Charter’s requirement of military force would not be met.¹⁸³ The United States could attempt to argue that even though the attack lacked any military character, the attack\n¹⁸³ See supra Part IV.A.1.\nVolume XVIII 2014 296\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\naffected the military somehow. This argument, however, would not be nearly as persuasive in this hypothetical as compared the previous hypothetical because the effect would be quite attenuated. In short, the complete lack of any military force and, seemingly, military effects would prevent the United States from classifying this attack as a use of force or an armed attack under the UN Charter.\nOnce again, the Manual provides a more liberal analysis of the attack than the UN Charter. To reiterate, the Manual does not require an attack to be of military character to qualify as a use of force or an armed attack. Thus, only the scale and effects of the attack on the NYSE need to be analyzed—using the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, military character, state involvement, and presumptive legality. The attack would likely be determined as a use of force because of its extended and severe detrimental effects, presumptive illegality, attributable state involvement, and intense invasiveness; however, classifying the attack as an armed attack would be more difficult—given an armed attack is the gravest form of use of force. Nevertheless, the\n184 See supra Part. IV.B.1.\n185 See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 49-52 (Cambridge University Press 2013).\n186 See id. (noting that the experts of the Manual were split as to whether\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nUnited States could point out the importance of the NYSE and the collapse’s grave effect beyond the economy. While this hypothetical presents a controversial and difficult question, I believe the United States would be able to classify this attack as a use of force and an armed attack given the extremely detrimental and lasting effects of crashing the NYSE. The United States would have to deeply analyze each of the factors explained in the Manual to ensure certain prerequisites are met, but the United States would be able to defensively respond via rule 13 to such an attack.¹⁸⁷ Subsequently, the United States would have to properly respond with a proportionate and necessary attack.¹⁸⁸ In sum, under the Manual, such an attack that completely crashes the NYSE would constitute a use of force, and more importantly, an armed attack resulting in the United States’s ability to act in self-defense.\n## 3. SUMMARY OF HYPOTHETICAL SITUATIONS\nWhile both hypothetical situations seem relatively open for interpretation, there is a major lesson to be learned from the application of the UN Charter, Manual, and in turn, Koh’s speech: cyber-warfare presents an unprecedented\nsuch an attack could constitute an armed attack).\n¹⁸⁷ See id. at 53-59.\n¹⁸⁸ See id. at 59-60.\n298\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\namount of uncertainty and vagueness in the context of the international laws of war. As seen, when the attack has certain military characteristics, the attack is much easier to define. Unfortunately, cyber-attacks need not and most likely will not be of strict military character, causing the UN Charter to seem obsolete in many situations. Thus, the liberal approach of the Manual functions more efficiently and accurately than that of the UN Charter in the cyber-warfare context. Effectively, each cyber-attack must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis, concentrating on how the scale and effects of the attack affect the government, military, and civilian population.\n## VI. Recommendation: A Possible Solution to the Issues in Applying the International Laws of War to Cyber-Warfare\nBecause cyber-warfare is a new and evolving medium for warfare, an international convention must occur, and in turn, create an internationally recognized cyber-warfare treaty. While the UN Charter provides a legitimate basis for such a treaty, the UN Charter seems obsolete to handle the intricacies involved in cyber-warfare.¹⁸⁹ The Manual, for the most part, is successful in applying the rules of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but fails at the most critical point: functioning as a binding\n¹⁸⁹ See supra Part.V.\nVolume XVIII 2014 299\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nauthority. Instead, it is merely functioning as “suggestions.”¹⁹⁰ Koh, who essentially agrees with the Manual, simply discussed the problems surrounding cyber-warfare, but no solutions whatsoever.¹⁹¹ Therefore, nations from around the world must come together and create binding rules for cyber-warfare before it is too late. In my opinion, the United States should address this problem now and be a leader in creating this treaty.\n## A. The Need for an International Convention, and in turn, an Internationally Recognized Cyber-Warfare Treaty\nWith the UN Charter and the Manual presenting valuable rules, exceptions to such rules, and recommendations involving all types of warfare—including cyber-warfare—the next step for regulating cyber-warfare is to create a binding international treaty focusing solely on cyber-warfare. For the effective creation of such a treaty, nations from around the world—not just experts in the field—will have to work together during an international convention, in a similar fashion as the creation of the UN Charter. During this convention, I believe the United States should take a progressive stance on this issue and become the world leader in regulating cyber-warfare.\n¹⁹⁰ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 16.\n¹⁹¹ See supra Part.IV.C.1.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nRegarding the details of this treaty, different aspects of both the UN Charter and Manual should be used, yet the treaty should also include further provisions. Overall, the treaty should follow the substance of the Manual as it does a remarkable job at applying the UN charter to a cyber-warfare setting. Nevertheless, certain decisions have to be made where the UN Charter and Manual disagree. For example, I believe the treaty should follow the Manual’s usage of the scale and effects test for both use of force and armed attack.¹⁹² However, there needs to be a definition or a sort of sliding scale to quantify the scale and effects of an attack—beyond listing an open set of factors.¹⁹³ Moreover, in accordance with the Manual, there should be no need for military character or death to constitute use of force or an armed attack.¹⁹⁴ While this standard might seem too liberal, the rules regarding self-defense will combat this liberalness by requiring the response to be proportionate and necessary—as both the Manual and UN Charter explain.¹⁹⁵ Notably, the use of examples within the Manual help clarify its rules, with each example explaining certain aspects of the\n¹⁹² See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-59.\n¹⁹³ See id. at 49-52.\n¹⁹⁴ See supra Parts IVA.1, IV.B.1.\n¹⁹⁵ See e.g., TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 59-60.\nVolume XVIII 2014 301\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nrule; therefore, given the positive affect of these examples, such examples should also be used in this cyber-warfare treaty.¹⁹⁶\nThese examples will allow readers to truly understand the rules and, more importantly, their applicability in the real world.\nFurthermore, each nation should be forced to present their case to the other members of the treaty before taking action, unless the defensive response is an absolute and immediate necessity.\nThis “meeting” will prevent a nation from applying the treaty in any way it sees fit, regardless of the treaty’s true meaning and the beliefs of other countries. Moreover, like the Manual, the treaty should include factor tests whenever answers will not be clear.¹⁹⁷ These factors will allow countries to apply the facts of an attack to numerous factors as opposed to the strict reading of rules. Unlike the Manual, however, one of these factors should involve intent because the intent of an attacking nation should be taken into account when determining whether a country has illegally used force or an armed attack.¹⁹⁸ Lastly, like the UN Charter, the treaty should include some rule or article that provides that members of the treaty shall ensure that non-\n¹⁹⁶ See e.g., id. at 55 (giving an example of an attack on a civilian target).\n¹⁹⁷ See e.g., id. at 49-52 (noting that this treaty should not be over-dependent on such factor tests).\n¹⁹⁸ See id. at 53-59 (noting that the Manual does not consider intent).\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nmembers still act in accordance with the treaty but only to the extent that is necessary to maintain international peace.¹⁹⁹ This provision would allow the treaty to have a worldwide affect, beyond the countries that signed. The treaty, effectively, will use the Manual’s application of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but bind of all member-nations to the treaty, much like the UN Charter did with United Nations members.\nIn short, some sort of binding action must occur to regulate cyber-warfare, and the United States should be at the forefront of this movement. In regulating cyber-warfare, the ideals and the binding effect of the UN Charter should be applied to cyber-warfare in a similar fashion as the Tallinn Manual. By taking action in this questionable area of law, the United States can ensure its safety now and into the future.\n## VII. Conclusion\nThe lack of regulations involving cyber-warfare is a growing and real threat. Cyber-warfare might be a confusing and seemingly futuristic concept, but countries from around the world need to address this lack of regulation sooner than\n¹⁹⁹ See e.g., U.N. Charter art. 2(6) (“The Organization shall ensure that states which are not Members of the United Nations act in accordance with these Principles so far as may be necessary for the maintenance of international peace and security.”).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nlater. While countries can attempt to apply the UN Charter to cyber-warfare situations, the UN Charter lacks the flexibility and modernization to properly handle the intricacies of cyber-attacks. The UN Charter is undoubtedly effective in handling kinetic warfare; however, it seems obsolete in the cyber-warfare context. Experts in the field recognized this issue and, in response, created the Tallinn Manual, which was effective in applying the UN Charter to cyber-warfare. Nevertheless, the Manual functions simply as a suggestion booklet and provides zero binding rules or regulations. Therefore, the United States needs to take the lead in regulating cyber-warfare. The United States needs to hold an international conference that will produce a binding treaty involving the regulations of cyber-warfare. This treaty should use the Manual’s concepts of applying the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but needs to go further in an attempt to leave as few questions unanswered as possible. While such a task will be difficult, the difficulties in creating a cyber-warfare treaty are minimal compared to the damage that will occur without such regulations.\nVolume XVIII 2014\n304"

Introduction: The Growing Concerns of Cyber-Warfare The threat of cyber-warfare is a current and continuing issue that our nation must address. President Obama, the Department of Defense (DoD), and even the private sector comprehend this issue and have been attempting to update our defense strategies to better protect this nation. The following quotations explain how concerned authorities from all levels of the nation are with the threat of cyber-warfare: It’s the great irony of our Information Age -- the very technologies that empower us to create and to build also empower those who would disrupt and destroy. And this paradox -- seen and unseen -- is something that we experience every day... cyber threat is one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation.¹ Our daily life, economic vitality, and national security depend on a stable, safe, and resilient cyberspace.... Yet cyber intrusions and attacks have increased dramatically over the last decade....² [Google is] under attack all the time, primarily via unsophisticated channels... I can’t go into detail to demonstrate the level of sophistication, but [the company] doesn’t use that term lightly, and it is quite deliberate.... This is truly, truly beyond the pale...

What is Cyber-Warfare: Definitions and Conflicts ### Therein Before moving into an in-depth discussion regarding cyber-warfare, the possibility of a cyber-attack on a government or civilian target, and a cyber-attack’s relation to the international rules of war, a definition of cyber-warfare must be established. The definition’s importance is exemplified in the international law of war setting because an attack must be analyzed using the “use of force” and/or “armed attack” tests, which are further discussed later in this paper.⁸ ⁸ See generally TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Cambridge University Press 2013) (explaining the use of force in terms of cyber-warfare); U.N. Charter art. 51 (explaining the amount force needed to respond to an armed attack).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY ## A. Basic Definition of Cyber-Warfare The most basic definition of cyber-warfare can be established by combining the terms “cyber” and “war.” Cyber is defined in an English dictionary as “of, relating to, or involving computers or computer networks.”⁹ War, as defined in a legal dictionary, is “[h]ostile conflict by means of armed forces, carried on between nations, states, or rulers, or sometimes between parties within the same nation or state.”¹⁰ Thus, cyber-warfare would be a hostile conflict via armed forces that involves computers or computer networks.¹¹ The problem with this definition is that it requires “armed forces,” whereas cyber-warfare usually does not include actual armed forces invading or defending a country.¹² To the contrary, cyber-warfare usually involves a conflict within computer systems, which were programmed by humans, but does not involve forces equipped with actual kinetic weapons.¹³ ## B. Definition Based on the Object Being Attacked Beyond this basic attempt to define cyber-warfare, Volume XVIII 2014 Volume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE two other mainstream ideologies have defined cyber-warfare: object-based vs. medium-based.¹⁴ The object based definition concentrates on whether the object being attacked is “cyber” in nature. The U.S. National Research Council created such a definition in 2009 in an attempt to clarify cyber-warfare and cyber-attacks.¹⁵ The definition described a cyber-attack as “the use of deliberate actions—perhaps over an extended period of time—to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy adversary computer systems or networks or the information and/or programs resident in or transiting these systems or networks.”¹⁶ Other commentators have offered similar definitions, such as defining cyber-warfare as “actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation’s computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption.”¹⁷ The main problem with any object-based definition is that it is overly broad; that is, such definitions would include attacks on computers via kinetic weapons.¹⁸ For example, these definitions would define a\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nbombing of a server farm as a cyber-attack that could lead to cyber-warfare; however, the act of using a physical bomb seems far beyond the purview of a cyber-attack. Therefore, such object-based definitions of cyber-warfare, and in turn cyber-attacks, are too broad in nature.\nAlternatively, object-based definitions of cyber-warfare are equally too narrow. Because object-based definitions require the object being attacked to be cyber in nature, these definitions would exclude attacks from a computer network that affect non-computers. For example, the Stuxnet attacks involved a malicious worm that used computer networks to attack, but and actually affected Iran’s nuclear centrifuges.¹⁹ Thus, under the object-based definition of cyber-warfare, the Stuxnet attack would not have qualified as a cyber-attack or an act of cyber-warfare. In short, the object-based definition of cyber-warfare fails in numerous ways, being both overly broad and narrow.\n## C. Definition Based on the Medium Being Used to Attack\nThe medium-based definition concentrates on whether the object *used* in the attack is “cyber” in nature. Essentially, a medium-based definition of cyber-warfare focuses on the\nkinetic attacks have already been readily defined in a number of international treaties and laws of war).\n¹⁹ See Dennis Fisher &amp; Paul Roberts, *Spotlight Series: Stuxnet*, THREATPOST: THE KASPERSKY LAB SECURITY NEWS SERVICE.\nVolume XVIII 2014 254\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nmethod used in the attack rather than the target being attacked—much in the same way an aerial attack involves planes. The DoD seems to imply this type of understanding through its definition of cyberspace operations: “[t]he employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace.”²⁰ Importantly, this definition highlights the medium used in the operation, which parallels the way a medium-based definition of cyber-warfare focuses on whether cyberspace is used during an attack. An example of a medium-based definition for cyber-warfare can be seen in the Cambridge Dictionary as “the activity of using the internet to attack a country’s computers in order to damage things such as communication and transport systems or water and electricity supplies.”²¹ Moreover, a medium-based definition works best with the international laws of war because these laws rely on concepts that revolve around the force exerted on a target as opposed to the type of target being\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nattacked.²² For the forgoing reasons, a medium-based definition should be used to define cyber-warfare. Thus, the definition of cyber-warfare should look similar, but not necessarily exactly like, the definition provided in the Cambridge Dictionary.²³\nFor example, a proper definition of cyber-warfare could be: hostile acts via cyberspace that damage or disturb a country’s infrastructure or related networks for a governmental or national security purpose.\n## III. Potential Types of Cyber-Attacks that Could Occur During Cyber-Warfare\nNow that a logical and adequate definition of cyber-warfare has been established, understanding the types of attacks a nation could experience becomes imperative to understanding how and if an attack could constitute an act of cyber-warfare. There are three main categories of cyber-attacks: syntactic, semantic, and hybrid attacks.²⁴\n### A. Syntactic Attacks\nSyntactic attacks are aimed at a computer’s operating\n²² See e.g., TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 48-49 (Cambridge University Press 2013) (explaining the use of force factors—severity, directness, measurability of effects, etc.); U.N. Charter art. 51 (implying the use of self-defense must be proportionate).\n²³ See supra note 21.\n²⁴ Susan W. Brenner &amp; Marc D.

PENETRATION ATTACKS\nPenetration attacks, as the name indicates, penetrate a computer system or computer network and transport whatever the programmer wants to “drop” into the system/network.²⁷ Examples of penetration attacks include the implantation of malware, viruses, Trojan horses, and worms.²⁸ All these types of penetration attacks cause actual damage to the system/network in different ways.²⁹ For example, worms replicate within the system but do not infect the host computer; nevertheless, the worm spreads throughout the entire system and eventually can cause the system to completely shut down.³⁰ Viruses effect computer systems is a different way, creating codes that become active once a user opens the file, and subsequently, the\n\nvirus corrupts, destroys, or steals files.³¹ Any of these types of penetration attacks can lead to the destruction or alterations of a computer system, and in turn, can lead to physical or economic damage.³² ## 2. DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS Denial of service (DoS) attacks disrupt a computer system or network by overloading the system/network, and thus, reduce its functionality.³³ Essentially, a DoS attack can completely shut down a system/network by flooding the target with false requests for service, therefore causing the system to overload.³⁴ When this happens, legitimate requests for service are blocked, and the actual purpose of the system is devastated.³⁵ Importantly, for anonymity reasons, attackers will often use distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks. A DDoS attack has the same purpose as a DoS attack; however, the attacker uses other people’s computers in addition to their own, which makes tracing the source of the attack much more difficult. Both DoS ³¹ *Id.* ³² See e.g., *Fisher &amp; Roberts*, *supra* note 19 (explaining how the Stuxnet worm caused actual damage to Iranian nuclear program).\n³³ JOSEPH MIGGA KIZZA, *COMPUTER NETWORK SECURITY AND CYBER ETHICS* 76 (2002).\n³⁴ Mindi McDowell, *Understanding Denial-of-Service Attacks*, UNITED STATES COMPUTER EMERGENCY READINESS TEAM (Feb. 6, 2013), http://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-015.\n³⁵ *Id.* Volume XVIII 2014 258 Volume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE and DDoS attacks can harm a nation via physical or economic damages.³⁶ ## B. Semantic Attacks Semantic attacks do not attempt to shut down, steal information, or destroy a computer network/system; rather, they affect the accuracy of the network’s information. Essentially, “[a] system under semantic attack operates and will be perceived as operating correctly (otherwise the semantic attack is failure), but it will generate answers at variance with reality.”³⁷ While such an attack seems petty, computer users tend to accept the information given to them, especially if such information derives from a government website.³⁸ For example, if a semantic attack occurred to an important government website, such information could cause people ignore a legitimate threat or falsely perceive an innocent act as a legitimate attack. Such a semantic attack could cause people to unnecessarily bunker down or, alternatively, riot out of fear. Thus, such a semantic attack could have severe consequences ³⁶ See e.g., John Markoff, *Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks*, New York Times (Aug. 12, 2008), http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html?_r=0 (explaining that the Russian cyber-attack on Georgia consisted of a DoS attack).\n³⁷ Brenner &amp; Goodman, *supra* note 24, at 31-32.\n³⁸ See Antolin-Jenkins, *supra* note 28, at 140 (noting how gullible or ignorant many computer users are when reading information off the internet).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY on the population.³⁹ As demonstrated above, semantic attacks can be as detrimental to a nation as syntactic attacks.\n## C. Hybrid Attacks Hybrid attacks are exactly what the term seems to imply: a hybrid of syntactic and semantic cyber-attacks.⁴⁰ Such attacks have the greatest likelihood of causing the most destruction because the attacker could actually destroy a certain computer system (and, in turn, whatever other infrastructure was affected) and then tell the people that something completely different happened—only furthering the confusion, distrust, and destruction.⁴¹ ³⁹ See id. at 140-41 (noting that such attacks could cause great civil unrest); Brenner &amp; Goodman, supra note 24 at 31-39.\n⁴⁰ See Antolin-Jenkins, supra note 28, at 140.\n⁴¹ See id. For example, Terrorists can mount complex attacks by combining syntactic and semantic attacks. Imagine that terrorists target Boston, Atlanta, Miami, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles for an attack which begins with a syntactic assault on computer systems that stops the delivery of state public assistance. General public awareness of the attack will emerge gradually, as successive waves of frustrated welfare recipients file complaints with the appropriate agencies. Eventually, the realization will spread that the distribution of benefits had been deliberately shut down. Once it becomes clear that the funds are not coming, the terrorists can follow up with a semantic attack assigning responsibility for their efforts to carefully-selected right-wing groups whose views are known to carry at least the taint of racial bias. If the terrorists manage to sustain the welfare gridlock, the freezing of the resources upon which thousands depend for their survival will produce civil disobedience and localized chaos. National Guardsmen might have to be sent into these cities to maintain Volume XVIII 2014 Volume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE With an understanding of the definition of cyber-warfare and the types of cyber-attacks that could occur during cyber-warfare, we must move forward to the international laws of war that apply to any sort of attack, whether kinetic or cyber.\n## IV. International Laws of War: An Application to Cyber-Warfare In this section, I will explain the major components of the international laws of war in the cyber-warfare context. First, I will briefly explain the United Nations Charter (UN Charter) and how it applies to cyber-warfare.⁴² Subsequently, I will discuss the creation and purpose of the Tallinn Manual (the Manual).⁴³ And lastly, I will explain the United States’ approach and strategies to handing the possibility of cyber-warfare.⁴⁴ Each of these components is essential in understanding how to properly respond to an act of warfare, specifically cyberorder. To make things even more interesting, the terrorists can then direct a syntactic attack at ATM and banking system computers in these cities. Such a shutdown will add to the problem by causing outrage among citizens who do not depend on welfare funds. The cumulative effects of all these efforts will be riots, targeted violence and a National Guard stretched to its limit (which will create an excellent opportunity for the terrorists to stage a CBERN attack in other areas of the country).\nBrenner &amp; Goodman, supra note 24, at 39-40.\n\nwarfare.\n## A. The United Nations Charter The UN Charter functions as the backbone to the current international laws of war.⁴⁵ It sets forth many rules and guidelines that apply to war; including starting a conflict, responding to an attack, and how the UN should respond to an attack on a member nation.⁴⁶ Understanding the UN Charter is crucial to understanding the later developments that deal specifically with cyber-warfare.\n## 1. GENERAL BACKGROUND The UN Charter was created to “save succeeding generations from the scourge of war... to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights... to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other resources of international law... and to promote social progress.”⁴⁷ Moreover, the overarching goals of the UN Charter were to allow countries to live tolerantly and in peace, to strengthen international peace and security, to ensure that armed forces are a last resort, and to promote ⁴⁵ See History of the United Nations, http://www.un.org/en/aboutun/history/charter_history.shtml (last visited Oct. 30, 2013).\n⁴⁶ See generally U.N. Charter arts. 2, 4, 42, 51 (explaining the rules regarding starting a conflict, responding to an attack, and assisting an ally who has been attacked).\n⁴⁷ Id. pmbl.\nVolume XVIII 2014 Volume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE social and economic advancement for all people.⁴⁸ Notably, the United States is a member of United Nations along with many other world powers, including Russia, China, and the United Kingdom.⁴⁹ Furthermore, the UN Charter is binding upon the United States under Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution.⁵⁰ As discussed below, the UN Charter successfully created rules that allow for a far more humane world, even in the face of war, but unfortunately, these rules may be obsolete in terms of cyber-warfare.\n## 2. ARTICLE 2(4): PROHIBITING THE THREAT OR USE OF FORCE Article 2, paragraph 4 of the UN Charter provides a quintessential rule: “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.”⁵¹ Essentially, this rule prohibits a country from threatening or using “force” on another country, provided\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nthe exception of self-defense discussed later in this section.⁵² Unfortunately, however, the term “threat or use of force” is never defined in the UN Charter, causing unrest and numerous debates.⁵³ Nevertheless, academics over the years have determined that this term involves only the uses or threat of *military* forces or attacks affecting the victim nation’s *military*, precluding economic and political coercion.⁵⁴ Notably, the UN Charter also specifically precludes espionage.⁵⁵\nThis rule is important in the cyber-warfare context because article 4(2) would prevent a victim country from attacking the aggressor country that committed the cyber-attack.⁵⁶ Thus, a country who falls victim to an act of cyber-warfare may not retaliate unless such an attack falls within the self-defense exception of article 51 via qualifying as an armed attack. The vagueness concerning the meaning of “use of force” presents an issue in the cyber-warfare context because at what point does a cyber-attack qualify as a use of *military* force?⁵⁷\n⁵² *Id.* art. 51.\n⁵³ See generally *id.* arts. 2, 4, 41, 42, 51 (noting that there is no definition section or individual definition for “threat or use of force”).\n⁵⁴ See e.g., MATTHEW C.

ARTICLES 41 AND 42\nArticles 41 and 42 of the UN Charter provide directions for how the UN can support a country that is being attacked.⁵⁸ Article 41 focuses on a way to counter an attack that does not mount to a “use of force,” whereas article 42 provides the UN the power to use force to counter such an attack, but only if it is determined that the attack qualified as a “use of force” and article 41 remedies would be inadequate.⁵⁹ Article 41’s non-forceful remedies would include economic blockades and political pressure.⁶⁰ While these two articles do not analyze whether a country can defend itself, they do provide structure and direction for how UN members should respond to an attack on their own country or on an ally.⁶¹ Primarily, articles 41 and 42 allow the UN to analyze the extent of the attack—whether there was a use of force—and, subsequently, allow the UN to\n⁵⁸ See U.N. Charter arts. 41, 42.\n⁵⁹ See id. Article 41 states “The Security Council may decide what measures not involving the use of armed force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and it may call upon the Members of the United Nations to apply such measures. These may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations. Id. art 41. If the UN decides that article 41 relief would be insufficient, it may “take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security. Such action may include demonstrations, blockade, and other operations by air, sea, or land forces of Members of the United Nations.” Id. art. 42.\n⁶⁰ See id. art. 41.\n⁶¹ See id. arts. 41, 42.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\ndecide to either use non-forceful or forceful remedies.⁶² While the substance of articles 41 and 42 are important, the most essential aspect of these articles is their purpose—to prevent forceful responses to an attack unless absolutely necessary to maintain international security and peace.⁶³\nIn discussing cyber-warfare, the most important aspect of articles 41 and 42 is their purpose as discussed directly above.⁶⁴ Thus, unless there is a clear use of force during a cyber-attack, it seems the United States or any other member of the UN could only respond via a non-forceful response—i.e., an economic blockade or political pressures.⁶⁵\n## 4. ARTICLE 51\nArticle 51 of the UN Charter provides the exception to general rule of article 2(4), which prohibits the use of force against other nations. Article 51 states:\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately\n⁶² See id.\n⁶³ See id.\n⁶⁴ See id. pmbl, arts. 41, 42.\n⁶⁵ See id. arts. 41, 42.\nVolume XVIII 2014 266\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nreported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.⁶⁶\nWhile Article 51 expressly creates an exception for the use of force in self-defense, some issues arise in the cyber-warfare context, especially when looking at the specific wording.⁶⁷ Much like the issue with our basic definition of cyber-warfare, article 51 allows a nation to defend itself only if the attack amounts to an “armed attack,” which a cyber-attack would never seem to qualify as.⁶⁸ Nevertheless, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) adjusted the definition of an armed attack by defining it more broadly and explaining that armed attacks “do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”⁶⁹ Thus, the term armed attack actually functions more as an expansion to “use of force” as opposed to an attack with actual kinetic weapons.⁷⁰\nMoreover, the ICJ decided in *Nicaragua v. United States* that\n⁶⁶ *Id.* art. 51. (emphasis added).\n⁶⁷ *See id.*\n⁶⁸ *See supra* Part II.A.; U.N.

GENERAL BACKGROUND\nThe Manual, which was published in 2013, was put together by an international group of approximately twenty-five experts from 2009 to 2012.⁷⁸ These experts met in Tallinn, Estonia, which in turn, helped produce the name of the Manual.⁷⁹ The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), specifically NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, invited these experts to put together the rules of cyber-warfare into a single document.⁸⁰ The Manual was put together in response to the growing fear of cyber-warfare and, more specifically, the lack of well-defined rules regulating cyber-warfare.⁸¹ Notably, the Manual only discusses the laws\n⁷⁶ See id.\n⁷⁷ Id. (explaining the Manual is a “non-binding document applying existing law to cyber-warfare”).\n⁷⁸ Id. at 16-17, 22 (noting these experts included legal practitioners, technical experts, and academics).\n⁷⁹ Id. at 22.\n⁸⁰ Id.\n⁸¹ Id. at 17-18 (explaining the Manual was created “in hope of bringing some degree of clarity to the complex legal issues surrounding cyber operations, with particular attention paid to those involving the jus ad bellum and the jus\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nof cyber-warfare, thus excluding cyber-espionage (to the extent espionage does not involve “use of force”) and cyber-crimes.⁸² To reiterate, “it is essential to understand that the Tallinn Manual is not an official document” and, thus, is not binding on any nation.⁸³\n## 2. RULES 11 AND 12: DEFINITIONS OF FORCE AND THREAT OF FORCE\nImportantly, and unlike the UN Charter, the Manual actually defines both the crucial terms “use of force” and “threat of force.”⁸⁴ Starting with these definitions will allow for a better understanding of the Manual, even though these definitions come after some important rules within the Manual.⁸⁵\n### a. Rule 11: Definition of Use of Force\nThe Manual directly refers back to Nicaragua v. United States when determining what actions constitute a use of in bello”).\n⁸² *Id.* at 18.\n⁸³ *Id.* at 23. Nevertheless, the Manual could function in a similar way to the Lieber Code—an aspirational attempt to regulate warfare during the civil war—in that the Lieber Code eventually “became a core text in the modern laws of war recognized worldwide, and many elements of his code continue to inform our public debate how best to respond to a new form of warfare in both an effective and a moral manner.” Nick Beard, *The Liber Codes*, *THE NEW YORK TIMES: THE OPINION PAGES* (Apr. 24, 2013, 12:59 PM), http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/the-lieber-codes/?_r=0.\n⁸⁴ *TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE* 47-53.\n⁸⁵ *Id.* at 45, 47-53 (noting that the Prohibition of Threat or Use of Force, Rule 10, comes before the definitions of “use of force” and “threat of force”).\nVolume XVIII 2014 270\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nforce—applying the “scale and effects” test.⁸⁶ While the scale and effects test is not black and white, it provides a nation with a decent idea of what constitutes a use of force.⁸⁷ The Manual, however, does create some black and white rules.⁸⁸ For example, the Manual unequivocally states that “[a]cts that injure or kill persons or damage or destroy objects are unambiguously uses of force.”⁸⁹ Notably, like the UN Charter, the Manual excludes economic and political coercion from qualifying as use of force.⁹⁰ The Manual, moreover, explicitly rejects the notion that a non-destructive cyber-attack that is intended solely to undermine the confidence in a government would qualify as a use of force.⁹¹ As the Manual progresses through the definition of use of force, it designates eight factors that are supposed to help a nation determine whether a non-obvious act qualifies as a use of force—essentially adding factors to the scale and effects test.⁹² The list of factors includes the following: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects,\n⁸⁶ See id. at 47; Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. United States), 1986 I.C.J. 14, 103-04 (June 27).\n⁸⁷ Id.\n⁸⁸ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 49.\n⁸⁹ Id.\n⁹⁰ See id. at 48.\n⁹¹ Id.

Rule 12: Definition of Threat of Force Rule 12 of the Manual breaks down the functional meaning of “threat of force” in the cyber-warfare context.⁹⁴ Importantly, the rule explains that a threat could occur in two situations: (1) “a cyber operation that is used to communicate a threat to use force” and (2) “a threat carried out by any means... to carry out cyber operations qualifying as use of force.”⁹⁵ The rule further notes that a demand need not accompany the threat to qualify as such under this rule; however, actions alone that seem threatening do not qualify as a threat because a threat must be “communicative in nature.”⁹⁶ The rule also states that a threat of force could technically derive form a nation that seems unequipped to follow through will such a threat; nonetheless, it’s the threat that matters.⁹⁷ Interestingly, the rule explains that ⁹³ *Id.* (explaining out that the list of factors is not exhaustive and functions only as a starting point).\n⁹⁴ *Id.* at 52-53.\n⁹⁵ *Id.* at 52.\n⁹⁶ *Id.* at 53 (explaining that developing technology that could be used in an act that qualifies as a use of force *does not* qualify as a threat of force).\n⁹⁷ *Id.* (noting the experts were split with this portion of the rule).\nVolume XVIII 2014 272 Volume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE a nation will not be considered to have actually made a threat of force, even if that nation makes such a threat and has the capability of following through with such threat, as long as that nation does not truly intend on attacking—essentially requiring actual intent.⁹⁸ Much like the definition of use of force, this definition lacks perfect clarity and contains many intricacies, but should be of great help in determining what actually constitutes a threat of force.\n## 3. RULE 10: PROHIBITION OF THREAT OR USE OF FORCE Rule 10 of the Manual parallels article 2(4) of the UN Charter by making “[a] cyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force... unlawful.”⁹⁹ The commentary following Rule 10 clarifies that the “use of force” does not need to be committed by a country’s armed forces; rather, the force could derive from an intelligence agency or any private contractor of the nation. Rule 10 also discusses a nation “intervening” in another nation’s affairs—political, economic, social, cultural, or otherwise.¹⁰⁰ The rule explains that it is unlawful for another nation to intervene but goes on to explain that the term ⁹⁸ *Id.* (noting, once again, that the experts were split with this portion of the rule).\n⁹⁹ *See id.* at 45 (Cambridge University Press 2013); U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4 (noting that both prohibit the threat or use of force).\n¹⁰⁰ *TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE* 46.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\"intervene\"does have the same meaning as in a layman context; instead, intervention in the cyber-war context, as well as for the UN Charter, must involve coercion.¹⁰¹ The rule further explains that an unlawful act of intervention does not per se qualify as a use of force; the intervention still must breach the threshold for use of force independently.¹⁰² Thus, when determining whether an intervention is unlawful, a nation must ascertain if coercion is involved, and moreover, must decide if the intervention reached the level of use of force.¹⁰³ Fundamentally, Rule 10 applies article 2(4) of the UN Charter to the cyber-warfare setting.\n## 4. RULES 13, 14, 15 AND 16: THE RIGHT AND REGULATIONS FOR SELF-DEFENSE AND COLLECTIVE SELF-DEFENSE Rules 13, 14, 15, and 16 of the Manual all explain the ability of a victim nation to launch a defensive response—in a parallel manner to article 51 of the UN Charter.¹⁰⁴ Rule 13 discusses an individual nation’s right to protect itself; rule 14 examines how an act of self-defense must be necessary and proportionate to the original attack; rule 15 delves into ¹⁰¹ *Id.* at 47 (“intervention pure and simple is not intervention [in the UN Charter or Tallinn Manual context]”).\n¹⁰² *Id.* at 46.\n¹⁰³ *Id.* at 46-47; see UN Charter art. 51.\n¹⁰⁴ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 53-64.\nVolume XVIII 2014 274 Volume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE the ability of a nation to preemptively strike in an act of self-defense; and rule 16 examines the possibility of collective self-defense, that is a third party nation(s) coming to the aid of a victim nation.¹⁰⁵ These rules are essential to the completeness of the Manual, especially in the Manual’s attempt to mimic article 51 of the UN Charter.¹⁰⁶ ## a. Rule 13: Self-Defense Against Armed Attack Rule 13 of the Manual allows a nation to exercise the right of self-defense, given that such nation faced an attack—cyber or kinetic—that qualified as an armed attack.¹⁰⁷ The term “armed attack” is quantified by the scale and effects of the attack, much like the use of force threshold in rule 11, but has an even heightened threshold beyond use of force.¹⁰⁸ Plainly, an armed attack is the “gravest” form of a use of force.¹⁰⁹ Unfortunately, however, the Manual never defines what the exact threshold is for the scale and effects test—only causing confusion.¹¹⁰ The scale and effects of an attack, though, must\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nbe reasonably foreseeable. Therefore, an attack that causes grave damage far beyond any reasonable foresight would not constitute an armed attack.¹¹¹ Notably, an armed attack must have a trans-border component; thus, a purely domestic attack can never qualify as an armed attack within the Manual’s framework.¹¹² The rule further explains that an armed attack can originate from a state or a non-state actor who is directed by the state to take such actions.¹¹³ Additionally, the rule states that individual attacks that alone do not qualify as armed attacks can be classified as armed attacks if that single attack is just one in a series of attacks. Accordingly, aggregated non-armed attacks can elevate and cross the threshold of an armed attack.¹¹⁴ The comments for rule 13 continue in detail about the irrelevance of intentions, the ability of a third party nation to defend itself if the scale and effects of the attack bleed over borders, and the ability of a victim nation to retaliate against persons who are located in an innocent third party nation—so as long the victim nation has permission to do so or the innocent third party nation\napplied on a case-by-case basis).\n¹¹¹ *Id.* at 56.\n¹¹² *Id.* at 54.\n¹¹³ *Id.* at 54-58 (detailing the intricacies and problems with attributing a non-state actor’s actions to a state).\n¹¹⁴ *Id.* at 55 (explaining that there must be convincing evidence that the multiple attacks are related).\nVolume XVIII 2014 276\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nis unable to take action.¹¹⁵ In short, a nation has the right to defend itself if attacked by another nation via an armed attack as determined by the scale and effects test.¹¹⁶\n## b. Rule 14: Necessity and Proportionality\nEven if it is determined that a nation has the right to defend itself—either via kinetic or cyber action—that nation’s defensive response must be necessary and proportionate.¹¹⁷ Simply put, if any non-use of force action could be taken to solve the problem, such action must be taken.¹¹⁸ Notably, this “necessity” is judged from the victim nation’s perspective.¹¹⁹ The rule also discusses proportionality.¹²⁰ Proportionality addresses how much force a victim nation may use in the defensive action. Factors such as scale, scope, duration, and intensity play a role in this determination.¹²¹ Importantly, this proportionality test does not require a victim nation to mirror the scale, scope, duration, and intensity of the offensive attack; but rather, the defensive action must be proportionate to the\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nforce needed to successfully defend against the offensive attack.¹²² Moreover, the rule indicates that kinetic attacks may be used in defense of certain cyber-attacks, given that the kinetic attack is necessary and proportionate.¹²³ The rule concerning necessity and proportionality is of great importance when deciding how to properly respond to an offensive armed attack.¹²⁴\n## c. Rule 15: Imminence and Immediacy\nThe Manual takes a step beyond the UN Charter by detailing when a nation can preemptively defend itself and the general time frame allowed for a defensive attack.¹²⁵ Rule 15 specifically allows for preemptive defense actions if an armed attack from an enemy nation is imminent.¹²⁶ To be considered imminent, the need to defend must be “instant, overwhelming, [and] leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.”¹²⁷ Interestingly, the experts involved in writing\n¹²² *Id.* (indicating that the defensive attack is judged on “the level of force needed to successfully mount a defense . . . more force may be necessary, or less force may be sufficient [ ] to repel the attack or defeat one that is imminent”).\n¹²³ *Id.*\n¹²⁴ *See id.* at 59-60.\n¹²⁵ *See id.* at 60-63.\n¹²⁶ *Id.* at 60.

Rule 16: Collective Self-Defense\nThe Manual allows a third party nation to assist a victim nation, but only if the victim nation requests such assistance.¹³² More than one third of a party nation can help a victim nation, but in any situation involving collective self-defense, both the\n¹²⁸ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 61 (noting that this standard was not universally agreed to).\n¹²⁹ Id. at 62.\n¹³⁰ Id. at 63.\n¹³¹ See id. at 60-64.\n¹³² Id. at 63.\n\nassisting and victim nations must determine that the offensive act qualifies as an armed attack or imminent armed attack.¹³³ Moreover, the assisting nation must still follow the rules of necessity, proportionality, imminence, and immediacy.¹³⁴ Notably, an assisting nation can only aid to the extent that the victim nation condones. For example, if the victim state only wants to respond via a cyber action, the assisting nation cannot use kinetic weapons—even if the use of such weapons would be allowed under the rules of the Manual.¹³⁵ The Manual also recognizes certain *ad hoc* agreements as constituting consent of the victim state, i.e. NATO agreements. Essentially, collective self-defense follows the same rules discussed above yet also contains additional rules to protect the victim state from losing control over the defensive response.¹³⁶ ## 5. SUMMARY OF THE TALLINN MANUAL As valuable and progressive as the Manual might be, it still suffers from not being binding on any nation, therefore, functioning only as “a product of a group of independent experts acting solely in their personal capacity.”¹³⁷ Nevertheless, ¹³³ *Id.* ¹³⁴ *Id.* at 64.\n¹³⁵ *Id.* at 63.\n¹³⁶ *See id.* at 59-64.\n¹³⁷ *Id.* at 23.\nVolume XVIII 2014 280 Volume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE the Manual provides a solid basis for possible future codifications regarding the international laws of cyber-warfare.

United States’ Strategies and Approaches While the United States has not created an official policy in the same light or depth as the Tallinn Manual, President Obama has signed several executive orders and presidential policy directives that discuss how the United States needs to better protect itself, specifically its critical infrastructure, from the possibility of cyber-attacks.¹³⁸ These orders and directives, however, solely discuss how the United States can better protect itself via improved communications and updated cyber-security tactics. They gloss over how the United States would and could respond to a cyber-attack—specifically an attack that could lead to cyber-warfare.¹³⁹ The most relevant and ¹³⁸ See e.g., Exec.

HAROLD KOH’S SPEECH AT THE UNITED STATES CYBER COMMAND CONFERENCE The timing of Koh’s speech was impeccable and purposeful as it was given a mere three weeks after the non-official release of the Tallinn Manual—providing a strong indication that the speech was a direct response to the ideas and policies within the Manual.¹⁴¹ Much like the Manual, Koh acknowledged that international principles of law should apply to cyber-warfare and emphasized that the cyber world is anything but law-free.¹⁴² Moreover, Koh applied the “use of force” test of the UN Charter article 2(4) and gave a number of factors (like the Manual) including, “the context of the event, the actor perpetrating the action (recognizing challenging issues of attribution in cyberspace), the target and location, [and the] ¹⁴⁰ Harold Honhgu Koh, Legal Advisor of the Dep’t of State, International Law in Cyberspace, Address to the USCYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference (Sept. 18, 2012), available at http://www.state.gov/s/l/releases/remarks/197924.htm [hereinafter Koh’s Speech] (noting that Koh has been an international lawyer for over thirty years, with the State Department for three and one half years, and is known as a premier legal-mind in the field).\n¹⁴¹ *Id.* ¹⁴² *Id.* Volume XVIII 2014 Volume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE effects and intent,” to help determine if a cyber-attack crosses the threshold of use of force.¹⁴³ Koh also recognized that the United States may defend itself if the offensive attack reaches the extent of an armed attack under article 51 of the UN Charter, but in the same fashion as the Manual and UN Charter, the defense action must be proportionate, necessary, and distinct.¹⁴⁴ Notably, Koh emphasized that the United States, and any other nation for that matter, should ensure its cyber weapons are not “inherently indiscriminate,” preventing unnecessary and unpredictable damage.¹⁴⁵ Koh further recognized that cyber-warfare could bleed over borders into innocent third party countries, and most importantly, explained that any nation should be held responsible for the actions of a non-state actor that conducted a cyber-attack at the direction of such nation.¹⁴⁶ After essentially reiterating the rules and policies of the UN Charter and Manual, Koh moved forward to the issues that arise when applying such rules and policies to cyber-warfare.¹⁴⁷ First, Koh addressed the issue of how to determine the scope and effect of a cyber-attack that does not cause the same type\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nof damage as a kinetic attack. Koh, however, left the question open and merely stated that the United States holds the right to defensively act against any attack that could be viewed as an armed attack under the UN Charter.¹⁴⁸ Koh next discussed the innate difficulties in analyzing an attack on a civilian target but, unfortunately, gave no solution—only raising the issue.¹⁴⁹ Lastly, Koh spoke to the issue of attribution, but like the previous two issues, he only mentioned the problem of attribution and never truly analyzed it.¹⁵⁰ Koh simply stated, “[n]ot all of the issues I’ve mentioned are susceptible to clear legal answers derived from existing precedents.”¹⁵¹ Essentially, Koh recognized these issues but gave no defined answers, simply leaving the issues to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.¹⁵²\nIn closing his speech, Koh explained that international humanitarian laws, i.e. the UN Charter, are not the only laws applying to cyber-warfare, recognizing that the cyber world is so interconnected that laws applying to human rights, criminal activity, and many others should also be applied to\n¹⁴⁸ See id.

Koh’s speech, while lacking some definite answers, was still educational on how the United States government views cyber-warfare in the same manner as the Manual and anticipates on applying the laws of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare in a similar fashion to the Manual.¹⁵⁴\n## V. Issues in Applying the International Laws of War to Cyber-Warfare\nEven as the legal field attempts to define cyber-warfare and apply internationally recognized laws of war to cyber-warfare, many issues still arise in the application of these laws. In this section, I will discuss several issues, including the differences in applying the terms “use of force” and “armed attack,” problems with the scale and effects test, the always troublesome issue of attribution, and the accumulation of such issues during an attack on a civilian target.\n¹⁵³ See id.\n¹⁵⁴ See id.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n## A. The Different Applications of Use of Force and Armed Attack\nThe problem of figuring out if a cyber-attack reached the level of a “use of force” and/or an “armed attack” is a genuine and difficult issue. While these thresholds create a basis for evaluating an attack, they are both vague and indecisive.¹⁵⁵ For example, the UN Charter does not even attempt to solve the issue of what “use of force” entails and applies the scale and effects test to only armed attacks, while the Manual—which Koh seems to side with—applies the scales and effects test to both.¹⁵⁶ The disparities in opinion continue beyond the differences in the application of the tests; the UN charter seems to imply a use of force or armed attack must occur through armed forces and/or cause physical damage to a nation’s military, while the Tallinn Manual and Koh would disagree.¹⁵⁷ Moreover, the scale and effects test has many of its own flaws\n---\n¹⁵⁵ See e.g., Waxman, *supra* note 54, at 44-46 (explaining the vagueness of use of force in the UN Charter); see TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-49 (Cambridge University Press 2013) (noting that the Manual had to use examples and factors to try and explain the usage of the definition for use of force and still admitted the definition is anything but foolproof).\n¹⁵⁶ See U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4, art. 51; TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-59; Koh’s Speech.\n¹⁵⁷ Waxman, *supra* note 53, at 44-46; TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 55.\nVolume XVIII 2014 286\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nas discussed in the next section.¹⁵⁸ The dissimilarities between the Manual, Koh’s speech, and the UN Charter alone cause a great amount of confusion and uncertainty. Significantly, and to reiterate, of the (potential) rules discussed, only the UN Charter is binding; thus, its interpretation has the most significance and, seemingly, the only relevance at the current time. In short, the lack of cohesiveness and uniformity between the UN Charter and Manual only creates greater confusion in an already perplexed field.\n## B. Issues with the Scale and Effects Test\nThe scale and effects test used in the UN Charter, Tallinn Manual, and Koh’s speech faces some major challenges in the cyber-warfare context, including unpredictability, reversible effects, and differentiating effects.¹⁵⁹ Regarding unpredictability, programmers can fall victim to coding error, or cyber-security defenses that cause the programmer to adjust the attack on the fly, thus triggering unknown effects.¹⁶⁰ Consequently, the attack could either collapse or reach new levels of destruction.¹⁶¹ This unpredictability could have effects on intent, especially if the attack was never meant to reach the threshold of “use of force”\n\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nand/or an “armed attack.”¹⁶² Notably, the UN Charter takes intent in account when determining whether an attack breached the thresholds for either use of force or an armed attack, whereas the Manual *does not* base its analysis on intention whatsoever—solely analyzing the scale and effects of the attack.¹⁶³ Thus, the unpredictability of cyber-attacks affects the scale and effects test differently depending on whether the UN Charter or Manual is being applied. From another perspective, a nation’s cyber-security defenses could interact with an attack in unforeseen ways, causing a chain reaction that overwhelms or shuts down a network. In this scenario, is the attacker blamed for scale and effects of the shutdown, or is the victim nation’s faulty defenses to blame? The unpredictability of cyber-attacks will continuously cause problems in applying the scale and effects test.\nThe ability of cyber-attacks to cause reversible damages as well as delayed or prolonged damages also raises concerns.¹⁶⁴ Presumably, if the effects were reversible, the scale and effects of an attack would be greatly diminished—even if such an\n¹⁶² *See id.* at 1103-04.\n¹⁶³ *See supra* Part.IV.B.4.a.\n¹⁶⁴ *See* Martin Libiki, *Pulling Punches in Cyberspace*, *PROCEEDINGS OF A WORKSHOP ON DETERRING CYBERATTACKS: INFORMING STRATEGIES AND DEVELOPING OPTIONS FOR U.S. POLICY* 123, 124-129 (2010).\nVolume XVIII 2014 288\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nattack had immense effects in the short term.¹⁶⁵ Nevertheless, the essential factor would be the immediate scale and effects, and thus, if the immediate scale and effects constituted a use of force or armed attack, then a victim nation could take the prescribed measures under the applicable laws of war. Alternatively, how can the laws of war apply to a cyber-attack that affects two countries differently?¹⁶⁶ For example, what if a cyber-attack caused minimal damage to a more advanced country and significant damage to a less advanced country? Could only the less advanced country respond to the attack? The answer to this question, is likely that only the less advanced country could respond. While this answer adheres to the international laws of war, it seems rather illogical that the exact same attack could lead to such different defensive responses.¹⁶⁷ Even though the scales and effects test has been widely acknowledge in the UN Charter, Manual, and Koh’s speech, the test is anything but flawless.\n## C. Issues of Attribution\nThe issue of attribution may be the most troublesome of the many issues that arise in applying the international laws\n¹⁶⁵ See id.\n¹⁶⁶ See Nguyen, supra note 14, at 1124.\n¹⁶⁷ See id. at 1124-25.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nof war to cyber-warfare. Unlike traditional warfare when it is relatively simple to discover who launched an attack against a nation, a cyber-attack can be nearly impossible to attribute to a particular nation, especially if a non-state actor is working at the direction of a nation.¹⁶⁸ Such is true because the cyber world offers so many options for anonymity and hiding attacks behind other networks.¹⁶⁹ People experienced within the cyber world can easily forge or conceal their identity, especially if motivated to hide an illegal attack.¹⁷⁰ Moreover, even if a nation is identified, such nation can easily deny that the attack derived from their networks—instead claiming that they were hacked.¹⁷¹ Even more troublesome, if a non-state actor is identified as the originator of an attack, an accused nation could deny any nexus with the attacking non-state actor. The numerous loopholes involved with attributing an attack to a particular nation presents some serious problems in applying the international laws of war to cyber-warfare.\n---\n¹⁶⁸ *See e.g.,* Broad, Markoff &amp; Sanger, *supra* note 6 (explaining that no one is still one hundred percent certain where Stuxnet derived from)\n¹⁶⁹ *See* Nguyen, *supra* note 14, at 1104-05.\n¹⁷⁰ *See id.* at 1104-06.\n¹⁷¹ *See id.*\n*Volume XVIII 2014*                                                                 290\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\n## D. Applying the UN Charter and Tallinn Manual to an Attack on a Civilian Target\nIn this section, I will pose a couple of hypothetical situations to explain how a nation, specifically the United States, should respond to a cyber-attack that may or may not qualify as an act of cyber-warfare according to the UN Charter and the Manual—given Koh essentially adheres to the Manual. The two hypothetical situations involve (1) an attack on a civilian target that has some military aspects and (2) an attack on a purely civilian target. Notably, I will assume these attacks can be accurately attributed to the originator of the attack—a non-state actor directed by such state.\nSignificantly, this assumption would require the attack to affect the United States’ military to be considered having military characteristics. The issue of attribution is of such concern that the following examples could not be analyzed without making this assumption.\n### 1. ATTACK ON A CIVILIAN TARGET WITH MILITARY ASPECTS\nThe following fact pattern will present an opportunity to analyze an attack on a civilian target with military aspects: A foreign country attacks Boeing—a civilian aerospace company that, among many other things, helps the United States Military\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nresearch, test, and maintain aerospace technologies—via a cyber invasion that both steals and destroys both civilian and military related information.\nBefore moving forward and analyzing this attack under both the UN Charter and Manual, it is important to distinguish the espionage portion of the attack (the stealing) from the attacking portion of the attack (the destruction) because neither the UN Charter nor the Manual were created to analyze mere acts of espionage; but rather, they were created to analyze actual attacks.¹⁷² And to reiterate, we are assuming this attack can be accurately attributed to a non-sate actor working for such foreign country.\nUnder the UN Charter, this “attack” might constitute a use of force but unlikely would be classified as an armed attack. Importantly, only the military information that was destroyed could be considered in this analysis because the UN Charter requires the attack to have some sort of military aspect, and in this hypothetical, the civilian information lacks any sort of military character.¹⁷³ The destruction of the military information from Boeing could result in a use of force or armed attack depending on what exactly was destroyed and, more\n¹⁷² See supra Parts IVA.1, IV.B.1.\n¹⁷³ See supra Part IV.A.2.\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nimportantly, the consequence of destroying such information. If the destroyed military information involved details regarding national security that generated the scale and effects equivalent of military force, then the United States could likely classify the attack as a use of force. Classifying the attack as an armed attack, however, would be far more difficult because there was no physical damage in the sense of the UN Charter.¹⁷⁴ The United States could argue the destruction of computer files constitutes physical damage because such damage equates that of a kinetic attack, but this argument would be weak in these circumstances because the attack had no effect on Boeing’s operations like a kinetic attack would. Notably, this same type of analysis would be used regardless of where the information was destroyed, even if from the Pentagon.¹⁷⁵ Essentially, the scale and effects of the attack determine what actions are or are not allowed under the UN Charter. In short, this example epitomizes the rigorousness of the UN Charter’s requirement of military force and physical damage, especially in terms of cyber-warfare.\nUnder the Manual, a country potentially could have\n¹⁷⁴ See supra Part IV.A.4.\n¹⁷⁵ See supra Part IV (noting that the location being the Pentagon would likely cause of the information destroyed to have military character).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nan easier time defining this attack as a use of force and/or an armed attack. Unlike the UN Charter’s requirement of military character, the Manual strictly analyses the scale and effects of an attack; therefore, both the civilian and military information that was destroyed must be analyzed. In doing so, the United State must use the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, state involvement, military character, and presumptive legality.¹⁷⁶ When applying these factors to this hypothetical, it seems the attack would constitute a use force because of the attack’s mild severity, high invasiveness, partial military character, attributable state involvement, and presumptive illegality. While the attack seems to be a use of force, the attack will not likely be considered an armed attack, especially given the high standard provided by the Manual—an armed attack is the *gravest* form of use of force.¹⁷⁷ Here, the attack seems significant but not in the same category of the *gravest* uses of force. Thus, the attack will likely constitute a use of force but not an armed attack.\nGiven that under both the UN Charter and Manual this attack is merely a use of force but not an armed attack, the\n¹⁷⁶ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 51-52. (Cambridge University Press 2013).\n¹⁷⁷ See id. at 48.\nVolume XVIII 2014 294\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nUnited States would not be able to defensively respond via article 51 or rule 13.¹⁷⁸ Thus, the United States would have to respond by finding out why the foreign nation wanted to destroy such information and, moreover, the United States might have to destroy the information that was stolen.¹⁷⁹ Moreover, the United States could put political and economic pressure on the foreign country committing this illegal use of force.¹⁸⁰ The UN Charter also would provide the United States with the ability to request the UN’s assistance in properly responding to the attack.¹⁸¹ Alternatively, under the Manual, the United States could choose to take preemptive action via rule 15 in fear of the scale and effects of the destroyed information. Notably, the United States would have to show the immediacy and imminence of the foreign nation’s possible armed attack.¹⁸² Showing this immediacy and imminence would require more facts, but the more liberal attitude of the Manual can be seen in both the analyses of the attack as well as the United States’ ability to respond to this kind of attack\nEssentially, the Manual provides a more liberal outlook\n¹⁷⁸ See supra Part IV (noting that if it determined an attack constitutes a use of force, the defensive response must be necessary and proportionate).\n¹⁷⁹ See id.\n¹⁸⁰ See id.\n¹⁸¹ See supra Part IV.A.3.\n¹⁸² See supra Part.IV.B.4.c.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\non attacks that do not directly and physically damage something or someone, even if there are certain military aspects involved in the attack. While both the UN Charter and the Manual could allow the United States to classify this attack as a use of force—especially given the partial military characteristic of the attack—the Manual more easily provides such a classification and could allow the United States to take more action regarding this attack. In short, this hypothetical provides an example of how the Manual is more adaptive and on-point with attacks that could lead to cyber-warfare.\n## 2. ATTACK ON A PURELY CIVILIAN TARGET\nThe following fact pattern will present an opportunity to analyze an attack on a purely civilian target: A foreign country attacks the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) that results in the market crashing and/or freezing for a period of time.\nUnder the UN Charter, this attack would not constitute a use of force or armed attack. Attacking a country’s economy, while devastating, lacks any sort of military characteristic; thus, the UN Charter’s requirement of military force would not be met.¹⁸³ The United States could attempt to argue that even though the attack lacked any military character, the attack\n¹⁸³ See supra Part IV.A.1.\nVolume XVIII 2014 296\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\naffected the military somehow. This argument, however, would not be nearly as persuasive in this hypothetical as compared the previous hypothetical because the effect would be quite attenuated. In short, the complete lack of any military force and, seemingly, military effects would prevent the United States from classifying this attack as a use of force or an armed attack under the UN Charter.\nOnce again, the Manual provides a more liberal analysis of the attack than the UN Charter. To reiterate, the Manual does not require an attack to be of military character to qualify as a use of force or an armed attack.[184] Thus, only the scale and effects of the attack on the NYSE need to be analyzed—using the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, military character, state involvement, and presumptive legality.[185] The attack would likely be determined as a use of force because of its extended and severe detrimental effects, presumptive illegality, attributable state involvement, and intense invasiveness; however, classifying the attack as an armed attack would be more difficult—given an armed attack is the gravest form of use of force.[186] Nevertheless, the\n\nVolume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE United States could point out the importance of the NYSE and the collapse’s grave effect beyond the economy. While this hypothetical presents a controversial and difficult question, I believe the United States would be able to classify this attack as a use of force and an armed attack given the extremely detrimental and lasting effects of crashing the NYSE. The United States would have to deeply analyze each of the factors explained in the Manual to ensure certain prerequisites are met, but the United States would be able to defensively respond via rule 13 to such an attack.¹⁸⁷ Subsequently, the United States would have to properly respond with a proportionate and necessary attack.¹⁸⁸ In sum, under the Manual, such an attack that completely crashes the NYSE would constitute a use of force, and more importantly, an armed attack resulting in the United States’s ability to act in self-defense.\n## 3. SUMMARY OF HYPOTHETICAL SITUATIONS While both hypothetical situations seem relatively open for interpretation, there is a major lesson to be learned from the application of the UN Charter, Manual, and in turn, Koh’s speech: cyber-warfare presents an unprecedented such an attack could constitute an armed attack).\n¹⁸⁷ See id. at 53-59.\n¹⁸⁸ See id. at 59-60.\n\namount of uncertainty and vagueness in the context of the international laws of war. As seen, when the attack has certain military characteristics, the attack is much easier to define. Unfortunately, cyber-attacks need not and most likely will not be of strict military character, causing the UN Charter to seem obsolete in many situations. Thus, the liberal approach of the Manual functions more efficiently and accurately than that of the UN Charter in the cyber-warfare context. Effectively, each cyber-attack must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis, concentrating on how the scale and effects of the attack affect the government, military, and civilian population.\n## VI. Recommendation: A Possible Solution to the Issues in Applying the International Laws of War to Cyber-Warfare Because cyber-warfare is a new and evolving medium for warfare, an international convention must occur, and in turn, create an internationally recognized cyber-warfare treaty. While the UN Charter provides a legitimate basis for such a treaty, the UN Charter seems obsolete to handle the intricacies involved in cyber-warfare.¹⁸⁹ The Manual, for the most part, is successful in applying the rules of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but fails at the most critical point: functioning as a binding ¹⁸⁹ See supra Part.V.\nVolume XVIII 2014 299 Volume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE authority. Instead, it is merely functioning as “suggestions.”¹⁹⁰ Koh, who essentially agrees with the Manual, simply discussed the problems surrounding cyber-warfare, but no solutions whatsoever.¹⁹¹ Therefore, nations from around the world must come together and create binding rules for cyber-warfare before it is too late. In my opinion, the United States should address this problem now and be a leader in creating this treaty.\n## A. The Need for an International Convention, and in turn, an Internationally Recognized Cyber-Warfare Treaty With the UN Charter and the Manual presenting valuable rules, exceptions to such rules, and recommendations involving all types of warfare—including cyber-warfare—the next step for regulating cyber-warfare is to create a binding international treaty focusing solely on cyber-warfare. For the effective creation of such a treaty, nations from around the world—not just experts in the field—will have to work together during an international convention, in a similar fashion as the creation of the UN Charter. During this convention, I believe the United States should take a progressive stance on this issue and become the world leader in regulating cyber-warfare.\n¹⁹⁰ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 16.\n¹⁹¹ See supra Part.IV.C.1.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY Regarding the details of this treaty, different aspects of both the UN Charter and Manual should be used, yet the treaty should also include further provisions. Overall, the treaty should follow the substance of the Manual as it does a remarkable job at applying the UN charter to a cyber-warfare setting. Nevertheless, certain decisions have to be made where the UN Charter and Manual disagree. For example, I believe the treaty should follow the Manual’s usage of the scale and effects test for both use of force and armed attack.¹⁹² However, there needs to be a definition or a sort of sliding scale to quantify the scale and effects of an attack—beyond listing an open set of factors.¹⁹³ Moreover, in accordance with the Manual, there should be no need for military character or death to constitute use of force or an armed attack.¹⁹⁴ While this standard might seem too liberal, the rules regarding self-defense will combat this liberalness by requiring the response to be proportionate and necessary—as both the Manual and UN Charter explain.¹⁹⁵ Notably, the use of examples within the Manual help clarify its rules, with each example explaining certain aspects of the ¹⁹² See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-59.\n¹⁹³ See id. at 49-52.\n¹⁹⁴ See supra Parts IVA.1, IV.B.1.\n¹⁹⁵ See e.g., TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 59-60.\nVolume XVIII 2014 301 Volume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE rule; therefore, given the positive affect of these examples, such examples should also be used in this cyber-warfare treaty.¹⁹⁶ These examples will allow readers to truly understand the rules and, more importantly, their applicability in the real world.\nFurthermore, each nation should be forced to present their case to the other members of the treaty before taking action, unless the defensive response is an absolute and immediate necessity.\nThis “meeting” will prevent a nation from applying the treaty in any way it sees fit, regardless of the treaty’s true meaning and the beliefs of other countries. Moreover, like the Manual, the treaty should include factor tests whenever answers will not be clear.¹⁹⁷ These factors will allow countries to apply the facts of an attack to numerous factors as opposed to the strict reading of rules. Unlike the Manual, however, one of these factors should involve intent because the intent of an attacking nation should be taken into account when determining whether a country has illegally used force or an armed attack.¹⁹⁸ Lastly, like the UN Charter, the treaty should include some rule or article that provides that members of the treaty shall ensure that non- ¹⁹⁶ See e.g., id. at 55 (giving an example of an attack on a civilian target).\n¹⁹⁷ See e.g., id. at 49-52 (noting that this treaty should not be over-dependent on such factor tests).\n¹⁹⁸ See id. at 53-59 (noting that the Manual does not consider intent).\nVolume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE members still act in accordance with the treaty but only to the extent that is necessary to maintain international peace.¹⁹⁹ This provision would allow the treaty to have a worldwide affect, beyond the countries that signed. The treaty, effectively, will use the Manual’s application of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but bind of all member-nations to the treaty, much like the UN Charter did with United Nations members.\nIn short, some sort of binding action must occur to regulate cyber-warfare, and the United States should be at the forefront of this movement. In regulating cyber-warfare, the ideals and the binding effect of the UN Charter should be applied to cyber-warfare in a similar fashion as the Tallinn Manual. By taking action in this questionable area of law, the United States can ensure its safety now and into the future.\n## VII. Conclusion The lack of regulations involving cyber-warfare is a growing and real threat. Cyber-warfare might be a confusing and seemingly futuristic concept, but countries from around the world need to address this lack of regulation sooner than ¹⁹⁹ See e.g., U.N. Charter art. 2(6) (“The Organization shall ensure that states which are not Members of the United Nations act in accordance with these Principles so far as may be necessary for the maintenance of international peace and security.”).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY later. While countries can attempt to apply the UN Charter to cyber-warfare situations, the UN Charter lacks the flexibility and modernization to properly handle the intricacies of cyber-attacks. The UN Charter is undoubtedly effective in handling kinetic warfare; however, it seems obsolete in the cyber-warfare context. Experts in the field recognized this issue and, in response, created the Tallinn Manual, which was effective in applying the UN Charter to cyber-warfare. Nevertheless, the Manual functions simply as a suggestion booklet and provides zero binding rules or regulations. Therefore, the United States needs to take the lead in regulating cyber-warfare. The United States needs to hold an international conference that will produce a binding treaty involving the regulations of cyber-warfare. This treaty should use the Manual’s concepts of applying the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but needs to go further in an attempt to leave as few questions unanswered as possible. While such a task will be difficult, the difficulties in creating a cyber-warfare treaty are minimal compared to the damage that will occur without such regulations.\nVolume XVIII 2014 304"

PENETRATION ATTACKS\n\nPenetration attacks, as the name indicates, penetrate a computer system or computer network and transport whatever the programmer wants to “drop” into the system/network.²⁷ Examples of penetration attacks include the implantation of malware, viruses, Trojan horses, and worms.²⁸ All these types of penetration attacks cause actual damage to the system/network in different ways.²⁹ For example, worms replicate within the system but do not infect the host computer; nevertheless, the worm spreads throughout the entire system and eventually can cause the system to completely shut down.³⁰ Viruses effect computer systems is a different way, creating codes that become active once a user opens the file, and subsequently, the\nvirus corrupts, destroys, or steals files.³¹ Any of these types of penetration attacks can lead to the destruction or alterations of a computer system, and in turn, can lead to physical or economic damage.³² ## 2. DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS Denial of service (DoS) attacks disrupt a computer system or network by overloading the system/network, and thus, reduce its functionality.³³ Essentially, a DoS attack can completely shut down a system/network by flooding the target with false requests for service, therefore causing the system to overload.³⁴ When this happens, legitimate requests for service are blocked, and the actual purpose of the system is devastated.³⁵ Importantly, for anonymity reasons, attackers will often use distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks. A DDoS attack has the same purpose as a DoS attack; however, the attacker uses other people’s computers in addition to their own, which makes tracing the source of the attack much more difficult. Both DoS ³¹ *Id.* ³² See e.g., *Fisher &amp; Roberts*, *supra* note 19 (explaining how the Stuxnet worm caused actual damage to Iranian nuclear program).\n³³ JOSEPH MIGGA KIZZA, *COMPUTER NETWORK SECURITY AND CYBER ETHICS* 76 (2002).\n³⁴ Mindi McDowell, *Understanding Denial-of-Service Attacks*, UNITED STATES COMPUTER EMERGENCY READINESS TEAM (Feb. 6, 2013), http://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-015.\n³⁵ *Id.* Volume XVIII 2014 258 Volume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE and DDoS attacks can harm a nation via physical or economic damages.³⁶ ## B. Semantic Attacks Semantic attacks do not attempt to shut down, steal information, or destroy a computer network/system; rather, they affect the accuracy of the network’s information. Essentially, “[a] system under semantic attack operates and will be perceived as operating correctly (otherwise the semantic attack is failure), but it will generate answers at variance with reality.”³⁷ While such an attack seems petty, computer users tend to accept the information given to them, especially if such information derives from a government website.³⁸ For example, if a semantic attack occurred to an important government website, such information could cause people ignore a legitimate threat or falsely perceive an innocent act as a legitimate attack. Such a semantic attack could cause people to unnecessarily bunker down or, alternatively, riot out of fear. Thus, such a semantic attack could have severe consequences ³⁶ See e.g., John Markoff, *Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks*, New York Times (Aug. 12, 2008), http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html?_r=0 (explaining that the Russian cyber-attack on Georgia consisted of a DoS attack).\n³⁷ Brenner &amp; Goodman, *supra* note 24, at 31-32.\n³⁸ See Antolin-Jenkins, *supra* note 28, at 140 (noting how gullible or ignorant many computer users are when reading information off the internet).\n## C. Hybrid Attacks Hybrid attacks are exactly what the term seems to imply: a hybrid of syntactic and semantic cyber-attacks.⁴⁰ Such attacks have the greatest likelihood of causing the most destruction because the attacker could actually destroy a certain computer system (and, in turn, whatever other infrastructure was affected) and then tell the people that something completely different happened—only furthering the confusion, distrust, and destruction.⁴¹ ³⁹ See id. at 140-41 (noting that such attacks could cause great civil unrest); Brenner &amp; Goodman, supra note 24 at 31-39.\n⁴⁰ See Antolin-Jenkins, supra note 28, at 140.\n⁴¹ See id. For example, Terrorists can mount complex attacks by combining syntactic and semantic attacks. Imagine that terrorists target Boston, Atlanta, Miami, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles for an attack which begins with a syntactic assault on computer systems that stops the delivery of state public assistance. General public awareness of the attack will emerge gradually, as successive waves of frustrated welfare recipients file complaints with the appropriate agencies. Eventually, the realization will spread that the distribution of benefits had been deliberately shut down. Once it becomes clear that the funds are not coming, the terrorists can follow up with a semantic attack assigning responsibility for their efforts to carefully-selected right-wing groups whose views are known to carry at least the taint of racial bias. If the terrorists manage to sustain the welfare gridlock, the freezing of the resources upon which thousands depend for their survival will produce civil disobedience and localized chaos. National Guardsmen might have to be sent into these cities to maintain Volume XVIII 2014 Volume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE With an understanding of the definition of cyber-warfare and the types of cyber-attacks that could occur during cyber-warfare, we must move forward to the international laws of war that apply to any sort of attack, whether kinetic or cyber.\n## IV. International Laws of War: An Application to Cyber-Warfare In this section, I will explain the major components of the international laws of war in the cyber-warfare context. First, I will briefly explain the United Nations Charter (UN Charter) and how it applies to cyber-warfare.⁴² Subsequently, I will discuss the creation and purpose of the Tallinn Manual (the Manual).⁴³ And lastly, I will explain the United States’ approach and strategies to handing the possibility of cyber-warfare.⁴⁴ Each of these components is essential in understanding how to properly respond to an act of warfare, specifically cyberorder. To make things even more interesting, the terrorists can then direct a syntactic attack at ATM and banking system computers in these cities. Such a shutdown will add to the problem by causing outrage among citizens who do not depend on welfare funds. The cumulative effects of all these efforts will be riots, targeted violence and a National Guard stretched to its limit (which will create an excellent opportunity for the terrorists to stage a CBERN attack in other areas of the country).\nBrenner &amp; Goodman, supra note 24, at 39-40.\nwarfare.\n## A. The United Nations Charter The UN Charter functions as the backbone to the current international laws of war.⁴⁵ It sets forth many rules and guidelines that apply to war; including starting a conflict, responding to an attack, and how the UN should respond to an attack on a member nation.⁴⁶ Understanding the UN Charter is crucial to understanding the later developments that deal specifically with cyber-warfare.\n## 1. GENERAL BACKGROUND The UN Charter was created to “save succeeding generations from the scourge of war... to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights... to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other resources of international law... and to promote social progress.”⁴⁷ Moreover, the overarching goals of the UN Charter were to allow countries to live tolerantly and in peace, to strengthen international peace and security, to ensure that armed forces are a last resort, and to promote ⁴⁵ See History of the United Nations, http://www.un.org/en/aboutun/history/charter_history.shtml (last visited Oct. 30, 2013).\n⁴⁶ See generally U.N.

ARTICLE 51\n\nArticle 51 of the UN Charter provides the exception to general rule of article 2(4), which prohibits the use of force against other nations. Article 51 states:\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately\n⁶² See id.\n⁶³ See id.\n⁶⁴ See id. pmbl, arts. 41, 42.\n⁶⁵ See id. arts. 41, 42.\nVolume XVIII 2014 266\nVolume XVIII 2014\nreported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.⁶⁶\nWhile Article 51 expressly creates an exception for the use of force in self-defense, some issues arise in the cyber-warfare context, especially when looking at the specific wording.⁶⁷ Much like the issue with our basic definition of cyber-warfare, article 51 allows a nation to defend itself only if the attack amounts to an “armed attack,” which a cyber-attack would never seem to qualify as.⁶⁸ Nevertheless, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) adjusted the definition of an armed attack by defining it more broadly and explaining that armed attacks “do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”⁶⁹ Thus, the term armed attack actually functions more as an expansion to “use of force” as opposed to an attack with actual kinetic weapons.⁷⁰\nMoreover, the ICJ decided in *Nicaragua v. United States* that\n⁶⁶ *Id.* art. 51. (emphasis added).\n⁶⁷ *See id.*\n⁶⁸ *See supra* Part II.A.; U.N.

GENERAL BACKGROUND\nThe Manual, which was published in 2013, was put together by an international group of approximately twenty-five experts from 2009 to 2012.⁷⁸ These experts met in Tallinn, Estonia, which in turn, helped produce the name of the Manual.⁷⁹ The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), specifically NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, invited these experts to put together the rules of cyber-warfare into a single document.⁸⁰ The Manual was put together in response to the growing fear of cyber-warfare and, more specifically, the lack of well-defined rules regulating cyber-warfare.⁸¹ Notably, the Manual only discusses the laws\n⁷⁶ See id.\n⁷⁷ Id.

RULES 11 AND 12: DEFINITIONS OF FORCE AND THREAT OF FORCE\nImportantly, and unlike the UN Charter, the Manual actually defines both the crucial terms “use of force” and “threat of force.”⁸⁴ Starting with these definitions will allow for a better understanding of the Manual, even though these definitions come after some important rules within the Manual.⁸⁵\n### a. Rule 11: Definition of Use of Force\nThe Manual directly refers back to Nicaragua v. United States when determining what actions constitute a use of in bello”).\n⁸² *Id.* at 18.\n⁸³ *Id.* at 23. Nevertheless, the Manual could function in a similar way to the Lieber Code—an aspirational attempt to regulate warfare during the civil war—in that the Lieber Code eventually “became a core text in the modern laws of war recognized worldwide, and many elements of his code continue to inform our public debate how best to respond to a new form of warfare in both an effective and a moral manner.” Nick Beard, *The Liber Codes*, *THE NEW YORK TIMES: THE OPINION PAGES* (Apr. 24, 2013, 12:59 PM), http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/the-lieber-codes/?_r=0.\n⁸⁴ *TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE* 47-53.\n⁸⁵ *Id.* at 45, 47-53 (noting that the Prohibition of Threat or Use of Force, Rule 10, comes before the definitions of “use of force” and “threat of force”).\nVolume XVIII 2014 270\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nforce—applying the “scale and effects” test.⁸⁶ While the scale and effects test is not black and white, it provides a nation with a decent idea of what constitutes a use of force.⁸⁷ The Manual, however, does create some black and white rules.⁸⁸ For example, the Manual unequivocally states that “[a]cts that injure or kill persons or damage or destroy objects are unambiguously uses of force.”⁸⁹ Notably, like the UN Charter, the Manual excludes economic and political coercion from qualifying as use of force.⁹⁰ The Manual, moreover, explicitly rejects the notion that a non-destructive cyber-attack that is intended solely to undermine the confidence in a government would qualify as a use of force.⁹¹ As the Manual progresses through the definition of use of force, it designates eight factors that are supposed to help a nation determine whether a non-obvious act qualifies as a use of force—essentially adding factors to the scale and effects test.⁹² The list of factors includes the following: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects,\n⁸⁶ See id. at 47; Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. United States), 1986 I.C.J. 14, 103-04 (June 27).\n⁸⁷ Id.\n⁸⁸ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 49.\n⁸⁹ Id.\n⁹⁰ See id. at 48.\n⁹¹ Id. (stating that “merely funding a hacktivist group conducting cyber operations as part of an insurgency would not be a use of force”).\n⁹² Id. at 49-52.\nmilitary character, state involvement, and presumptive legality.⁹³ This definition of use of force, while not black and white, should greatly help nations determine what constitutes a use of force in the cyber-warfare setting.\n## b. Rule 12: Definition of Threat of Force Rule 12 of the Manual breaks down the functional meaning of “threat of force” in the cyber-warfare context.⁹⁴ Importantly, the rule explains that a threat could occur in two situations: (1) “a cyber operation that is used to communicate a threat to use force” and (2) “a threat carried out by any means... to carry out cyber operations qualifying as use of force.”⁹⁵ The rule further notes that a demand need not accompany the threat to qualify as such under this rule; however, actions alone that seem threatening do not qualify as a threat because a threat must be “communicative in nature.”⁹⁶ The rule also states that a threat of force could technically derive form a nation that seems unequipped to follow through will such a threat; nonetheless, it’s the threat that matters.⁹⁷ Interestingly, the rule explains that ⁹³ *Id.* (explaining out that the list of factors is not exhaustive and functions only as a starting point).\n⁹⁴ *Id.* at 52-53.\n⁹⁵ *Id.* at 52.\n⁹⁶ *Id.* at 53 (explaining that developing technology that could be used in an act that qualifies as a use of force *does not* qualify as a threat of force).\n⁹⁷ *Id.* (noting the experts were split with this portion of the rule).\nVolume XVIII 2014 272 Volume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE a nation will not be considered to have actually made a threat of force, even if that nation makes such a threat and has the capability of following through with such threat, as long as that nation does not truly intend on attacking—essentially requiring actual intent.⁹⁸ Much like the definition of use of force, this definition lacks perfect clarity and contains many intricacies, but should be of great help in determining what actually constitutes a threat of force.\n## 3. RULE 10: PROHIBITION OF THREAT OR USE OF FORCE Rule 10 of the Manual parallels article 2(4) of the UN Charter by making “[a] cyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force... unlawful.”⁹⁹ The commentary following Rule 10 clarifies that the “use of force” does not need to be committed by a country’s armed forces; rather, the force could derive from an intelligence agency or any private contractor of the nation. Rule 10 also discusses a nation “intervening” in another nation’s affairs—political, economic, social, cultural, or otherwise.¹⁰⁰ The rule explains that it is unlawful for another nation to intervene but goes on to explain that the term ⁹⁸ *Id.* (noting, once again, that the experts were split with this portion of the rule).\n⁹⁹ *See id.* at 45 (Cambridge University Press 2013); U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4 (noting that both prohibit the threat or use of force).\n¹⁰⁰ *TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE* 46.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\"intervene\"does have the same meaning as in a layman context; instead, intervention in the cyber-war context, as well as for the UN Charter, must involve coercion.¹⁰¹ The rule further explains that an unlawful act of intervention does not per se qualify as a use of force; the intervention still must breach the threshold for use of force independently.¹⁰² Thus, when determining whether an intervention is unlawful, a nation must ascertain if coercion is involved, and moreover, must decide if the intervention reached the level of use of force.¹⁰³ Fundamentally, Rule 10 applies article 2(4) of the UN Charter to the cyber-warfare setting.\n## 4. RULES 13, 14, 15 AND 16: THE RIGHT AND REGULATIONS FOR SELF-DEFENSE AND COLLECTIVE SELF-DEFENSE Rules 13, 14, 15, and 16 of the Manual all explain the ability of a victim nation to launch a defensive response—in a parallel manner to article 51 of the UN Charter.¹⁰⁴ Rule 13 discusses an individual nation’s right to protect itself; rule 14 examines how an act of self-defense must be necessary and proportionate to the original attack; rule 15 delves into ¹⁰¹ *Id.* at 47 (“intervention pure and simple is not intervention [in the UN Charter or Tallinn Manual context]”).\n¹⁰² *Id.* at 46.\n¹⁰³ *Id.* at 46-47; see UN Charter art. 51.\n¹⁰⁴ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 53-64.\nVolume XVIII 2014 274 Volume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE the ability of a nation to preemptively strike in an act of self-defense; and rule 16 examines the possibility of collective self-defense, that is a third party nation(s) coming to the aid of a victim nation.¹⁰⁵ These rules are essential to the completeness of the Manual, especially in the Manual’s attempt to mimic article 51 of the UN Charter.¹⁰⁶ ## a. Rule 13: Self-Defense Against Armed Attack Rule 13 of the Manual allows a nation to exercise the right of self-defense, given that such nation faced an attack—cyber or kinetic—that qualified as an armed attack.¹⁰⁷ The term “armed attack” is quantified by the scale and effects of the attack, much like the use of force threshold in rule 11, but has an even heightened threshold beyond use of force.¹⁰⁸ Plainly, an armed attack is the “gravest” form of a use of force.¹⁰⁹ Unfortunately, however, the Manual never defines what the exact threshold is for the scale and effects test—only causing confusion.¹¹⁰ The scale and effects of an attack, though, must\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nbe reasonably foreseeable. Therefore, an attack that causes grave damage far beyond any reasonable foresight would not constitute an armed attack.¹¹¹ Notably, an armed attack must have a trans-border component; thus, a purely domestic attack can never qualify as an armed attack within the Manual’s framework.¹¹² The rule further explains that an armed attack can originate from a state or a non-state actor who is directed by the state to take such actions.¹¹³ Additionally, the rule states that individual attacks that alone do not qualify as armed attacks can be classified as armed attacks if that single attack is just one in a series of attacks. Accordingly, aggregated non-armed attacks can elevate and cross the threshold of an armed attack.¹¹⁴ The comments for rule 13 continue in detail about the irrelevance of intentions, the ability of a third party nation to defend itself if the scale and effects of the attack bleed over borders, and the ability of a victim nation to retaliate against persons who are located in an innocent third party nation—so as long the victim nation has permission to do so or the innocent third party nation\napplied on a case-by-case basis).\n¹¹¹ *Id.* at 56.\n¹¹² *Id.* at 54.\n¹¹³ *Id.* at 54-58 (detailing the intricacies and problems with attributing a non-state actor’s actions to a state).\n¹¹⁴ *Id.* at 55 (explaining that there must be convincing evidence that the multiple attacks are related).\nVolume XVIII 2014 276\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nis unable to take action.¹¹⁵ In short, a nation has the right to defend itself if attacked by another nation via an armed attack as determined by the scale and effects test.¹¹⁶\n## b. Rule 14: Necessity and Proportionality\nEven if it is determined that a nation has the right to defend itself—either via kinetic or cyber action—that nation’s defensive response must be necessary and proportionate.¹¹⁷ Simply put, if any non-use of force action could be taken to solve the problem, such action must be taken.¹¹⁸ Notably, this “necessity” is judged from the victim nation’s perspective.¹¹⁹ The rule also discusses proportionality.¹²⁰ Proportionality addresses how much force a victim nation may use in the defensive action. Factors such as scale, scope, duration, and intensity play a role in this determination.¹²¹ Importantly, this proportionality test does not require a victim nation to mirror the scale, scope, duration, and intensity of the offensive attack; but rather, the defensive action must be proportionate to the\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nforce needed to successfully defend against the offensive attack.¹²² Moreover, the rule indicates that kinetic attacks may be used in defense of certain cyber-attacks, given that the kinetic attack is necessary and proportionate.¹²³ The rule concerning necessity and proportionality is of great importance when deciding how to properly respond to an offensive armed attack.¹²⁴\n## c. Rule 15: Imminence and Immediacy\nThe Manual takes a step beyond the UN Charter by detailing when a nation can preemptively defend itself and the general time frame allowed for a defensive attack.¹²⁵ Rule 15 specifically allows for preemptive defense actions if an armed attack from an enemy nation is imminent.¹²⁶ To be considered imminent, the need to defend must be “instant, overwhelming, [and] leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.”¹²⁷ Interestingly, the experts involved in writing\n¹²² *Id.* (indicating that the defensive attack is judged on “the level of force needed to successfully mount a defense . . . more force may be necessary, or less force may be sufficient [ ] to repel the attack or defeat one that is imminent”).\n¹²³ *Id.*\n¹²⁴ *See id.* at 59-60.\n¹²⁵ *See id.* at 60-63.\n¹²⁶ *Id.* at 60. (noting the Manual uses the term “anticipatory self-defence”).\n¹²⁷ *Id.* (quoting Letter from Daniel Webster to Lord Ashburton (Aug. 6, 1842), reprinted in 2 *INTERNATIONAL LAW DIGEST* 412 (John Bassett Moore ed. 1906)).\nVolume XVIII 2014 278\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nthe Manual chose to use this standard because of its flexibility and applicability for case-by-case analyses.¹²⁸ Regarding the immediacy of the defensive response, factors such as the period necessary to identify the attacker, the temporal proximity between the attack and response, and the time required to prepare a response are considered.¹²⁹ Additionally, the rule discusses the length of time allowed for continuous defensive responses, stating that the victim nation “must reasonably conclude that that further cyber operations are likely to follow,” or else such nation could be liable for the continuing defensive responses.¹³⁰ Therefore, a nation must be cautious in preemptively attacking an enemy nation, attacking the enemy nation at a too attenuated period of time, or attacking the enemy nation for too long a period of time.¹³¹\n## d. Rule 16: Collective Self-Defense\nThe Manual allows a third party nation to assist a victim nation, but only if the victim nation requests such assistance.¹³² More than one third of a party nation can help a victim nation, but in any situation involving collective self-defense, both the\n¹²⁸ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 61 (noting that this standard was not universally agreed to).\n¹²⁹ Id. at 62.\n¹³⁰ Id. at 63.\n¹³¹ See id. at 60-64.\n¹³² Id. at 63.\nassisting and victim nations must determine that the offensive act qualifies as an armed attack or imminent armed attack.¹³³ Moreover, the assisting nation must still follow the rules of necessity, proportionality, imminence, and immediacy.¹³⁴ Notably, an assisting nation can only aid to the extent that the victim nation condones. For example, if the victim state only wants to respond via a cyber action, the assisting nation cannot use kinetic weapons—even if the use of such weapons would be allowed under the rules of the Manual.¹³⁵ The Manual also recognizes certain *ad hoc* agreements as constituting consent of the victim state, i.e. NATO agreements. Essentially, collective self-defense follows the same rules discussed above yet also contains additional rules to protect the victim state from losing control over the defensive response.¹³⁶ ## 5. SUMMARY OF THE TALLINN MANUAL As valuable and progressive as the Manual might be, it still suffers from not being binding on any nation, therefore, functioning only as “a product of a group of independent experts acting solely in their personal capacity.”¹³⁷ Nevertheless, ¹³³ *Id.* ¹³⁴ *Id.* at 64.\n¹³⁵ *Id.* at 63.\n¹³⁶ *See id.* at 59-64.\n¹³⁷ *Id.* at 23.\nVolume XVIII 2014 280 Volume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE the Manual provides a solid basis for possible future codifications regarding the international laws of cyber-warfare. By formulating an authority that applies the UN Charter and many other recognized international principles of law to a cyber-warfare setting, the Manual has greatly advanced the understanding of how the international laws of war will apply to cyber-warfare.\n## C. United States’ Strategies and Approaches While the United States has not created an official policy in the same light or depth as the Tallinn Manual, President Obama has signed several executive orders and presidential policy directives that discuss how the United States needs to better protect itself, specifically its critical infrastructure, from the possibility of cyber-attacks.¹³⁸ These orders and directives, however, solely discuss how the United States can better protect itself via improved communications and updated cyber-security tactics. They gloss over how the United States would and could respond to a cyber-attack—specifically an attack that could lead to cyber-warfare.¹³⁹ The most relevant and ¹³⁸ See e.g., Exec.

HAROLD KOH’S SPEECH AT THE UNITED STATES CYBER COMMAND CONFERENCE The timing of Koh’s speech was impeccable and purposeful as it was given a mere three weeks after the non-official release of the Tallinn Manual—providing a strong indication that the speech was a direct response to the ideas and policies within the Manual.¹⁴¹ Much like the Manual, Koh acknowledged that international principles of law should apply to cyber-warfare and emphasized that the cyber world is anything but law-free.¹⁴² Moreover, Koh applied the “use of force” test of the UN Charter article 2(4) and gave a number of factors (like the Manual) including, “the context of the event, the actor perpetrating the action (recognizing challenging issues of attribution in cyberspace), the target and location, [and the] ¹⁴⁰ Harold Honhgu Koh, Legal Advisor of the Dep’t of State, International Law in Cyberspace, Address to the USCYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference (Sept. 18, 2012), available at http://www.state.gov/s/l/releases/remarks/197924.htm [hereinafter Koh’s Speech] (noting that Koh has been an international lawyer for over thirty years, with the State Department for three and one half years, and is known as a premier legal-mind in the field).\n¹⁴¹ *Id.* ¹⁴² *Id.* Volume XVIII 2014 Volume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE effects and intent,” to help determine if a cyber-attack crosses the threshold of use of force.¹⁴³ Koh also recognized that the United States may defend itself if the offensive attack reaches the extent of an armed attack under article 51 of the UN Charter, but in the same fashion as the Manual and UN Charter, the defense action must be proportionate, necessary, and distinct.¹⁴⁴ Notably, Koh emphasized that the United States, and any other nation for that matter, should ensure its cyber weapons are not “inherently indiscriminate,” preventing unnecessary and unpredictable damage.¹⁴⁵ Koh further recognized that cyber-warfare could bleed over borders into innocent third party countries, and most importantly, explained that any nation should be held responsible for the actions of a non-state actor that conducted a cyber-attack at the direction of such nation.¹⁴⁶ After essentially reiterating the rules and policies of the UN Charter and Manual, Koh moved forward to the issues that arise when applying such rules and policies to cyber-warfare.¹⁴⁷ First, Koh addressed the issue of how to determine the scope and effect of a cyber-attack that does not cause the same type\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nof damage as a kinetic attack. Koh, however, left the question open and merely stated that the United States holds the right to defensively act against any attack that could be viewed as an armed attack under the UN Charter.¹⁴⁸ Koh next discussed the innate difficulties in analyzing an attack on a civilian target but, unfortunately, gave no solution—only raising the issue.¹⁴⁹ Lastly, Koh spoke to the issue of attribution, but like the previous two issues, he only mentioned the problem of attribution and never truly analyzed it.¹⁵⁰ Koh simply stated, “[n]ot all of the issues I’ve mentioned are susceptible to clear legal answers derived from existing precedents.”¹⁵¹ Essentially, Koh recognized these issues but gave no defined answers, simply leaving the issues to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.¹⁵²\nIn closing his speech, Koh explained that international humanitarian laws, i.e. the UN Charter, are not the only laws applying to cyber-warfare, recognizing that the cyber world is so interconnected that laws applying to human rights, criminal activity, and many others should also be applied to\n¹⁴⁸ See id.

Charter art. 51.\n¹⁴⁹ See Koh’s Speech.\n¹⁵⁰ Id.\n¹⁵¹ Id.\n¹⁵² See id.\nVolume XVIII 2014 284\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\ncyber-warfare.¹⁵³ Lastly, Koh emphasized the importance of understanding international laws in the cyber-warfare context and, equally, the ability to openly discuss the problems of applying such laws to cyber-warfare. Koh’s speech, while lacking some definite answers, was still educational on how the United States government views cyber-warfare in the same manner as the Manual and anticipates on applying the laws of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare in a similar fashion to the Manual.¹⁵⁴\n## V. Issues in Applying the International Laws of War to Cyber-Warfare\nEven as the legal field attempts to define cyber-warfare and apply internationally recognized laws of war to cyber-warfare, many issues still arise in the application of these laws. In this section, I will discuss several issues, including the differences in applying the terms “use of force” and “armed attack,” problems with the scale and effects test, the always troublesome issue of attribution, and the accumulation of such issues during an attack on a civilian target.\n¹⁵³ See id.\n¹⁵⁴ See id.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n## A. The Different Applications of Use of Force and Armed Attack\nThe problem of figuring out if a cyber-attack reached the level of a “use of force” and/or an “armed attack” is a genuine and difficult issue. While these thresholds create a basis for evaluating an attack, they are both vague and indecisive.¹⁵⁵ For example, the UN Charter does not even attempt to solve the issue of what “use of force” entails and applies the scale and effects test to only armed attacks, while the Manual—which Koh seems to side with—applies the scales and effects test to both.¹⁵⁶ The disparities in opinion continue beyond the differences in the application of the tests; the UN charter seems to imply a use of force or armed attack must occur through armed forces and/or cause physical damage to a nation’s military, while the Tallinn Manual and Koh would disagree.¹⁵⁷ Moreover, the scale and effects test has many of its own flaws\n---\n¹⁵⁵ See e.g., Waxman, *supra* note 54, at 44-46 (explaining the vagueness of use of force in the UN Charter); see TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-49 (Cambridge University Press 2013) (noting that the Manual had to use examples and factors to try and explain the usage of the definition for use of force and still admitted the definition is anything but foolproof).\n¹⁵⁶ See U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4, art. 51; TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-59; Koh’s Speech.\n¹⁵⁷ Waxman, *supra* note 53, at 44-46; TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 55.\nVolume XVIII 2014 286\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nas discussed in the next section.¹⁵⁸ The dissimilarities between the Manual, Koh’s speech, and the UN Charter alone cause a great amount of confusion and uncertainty. Significantly, and to reiterate, of the (potential) rules discussed, only the UN Charter is binding; thus, its interpretation has the most significance and, seemingly, the only relevance at the current time. In short, the lack of cohesiveness and uniformity between the UN Charter and Manual only creates greater confusion in an already perplexed field.\n## B. Issues with the Scale and Effects Test\nThe scale and effects test used in the UN Charter, Tallinn Manual, and Koh’s speech faces some major challenges in the cyber-warfare context, including unpredictability, reversible effects, and differentiating effects.¹⁵⁹ Regarding unpredictability, programmers can fall victim to coding error, or cyber-security defenses that cause the programmer to adjust the attack on the fly, thus triggering unknown effects.¹⁶⁰ Consequently, the attack could either collapse or reach new levels of destruction.¹⁶¹ This unpredictability could have effects on intent, especially if the attack was never meant to reach the threshold of “use of force”\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nand/or an “armed attack.”¹⁶² Notably, the UN Charter takes intent in account when determining whether an attack breached the thresholds for either use of force or an armed attack, whereas the Manual *does not* base its analysis on intention whatsoever—solely analyzing the scale and effects of the attack.¹⁶³ Thus, the unpredictability of cyber-attacks affects the scale and effects test differently depending on whether the UN Charter or Manual is being applied. From another perspective, a nation’s cyber-security defenses could interact with an attack in unforeseen ways, causing a chain reaction that overwhelms or shuts down a network. In this scenario, is the attacker blamed for scale and effects of the shutdown, or is the victim nation’s faulty defenses to blame? The unpredictability of cyber-attacks will continuously cause problems in applying the scale and effects test.\nThe ability of cyber-attacks to cause reversible damages as well as delayed or prolonged damages also raises concerns.¹⁶⁴ Presumably, if the effects were reversible, the scale and effects of an attack would be greatly diminished—even if such an\n¹⁶² *See id.* at 1103-04.\n¹⁶³ *See supra* Part.IV.B.4.a.\n¹⁶⁴ *See* Martin Libiki, *Pulling Punches in Cyberspace*, *PROCEEDINGS OF A WORKSHOP ON DETERRING CYBERATTACKS: INFORMING STRATEGIES AND DEVELOPING OPTIONS FOR U.S. POLICY* 123, 124-129 (2010).\nVolume XVIII 2014 288\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nattack had immense effects in the short term.¹⁶⁵ Nevertheless, the essential factor would be the immediate scale and effects, and thus, if the immediate scale and effects constituted a use of force or armed attack, then a victim nation could take the prescribed measures under the applicable laws of war. Alternatively, how can the laws of war apply to a cyber-attack that affects two countries differently?¹⁶⁶ For example, what if a cyber-attack caused minimal damage to a more advanced country and significant damage to a less advanced country? Could only the less advanced country respond to the attack? The answer to this question, is likely that only the less advanced country could respond. While this answer adheres to the international laws of war, it seems rather illogical that the exact same attack could lead to such different defensive responses.¹⁶⁷ Even though the scales and effects test has been widely acknowledge in the UN Charter, Manual, and Koh’s speech, the test is anything but flawless.\n## C. Issues of Attribution\nThe issue of attribution may be the most troublesome of the many issues that arise in applying the international laws\n¹⁶⁵ See id.\n¹⁶⁶ See Nguyen, supra note 14, at 1124.\n¹⁶⁷ See id. at 1124-25.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nof war to cyber-warfare. Unlike traditional warfare when it is relatively simple to discover who launched an attack against a nation, a cyber-attack can be nearly impossible to attribute to a particular nation, especially if a non-state actor is working at the direction of a nation.¹⁶⁸ Such is true because the cyber world offers so many options for anonymity and hiding attacks behind other networks.¹⁶⁹ People experienced within the cyber world can easily forge or conceal their identity, especially if motivated to hide an illegal attack.¹⁷⁰ Moreover, even if a nation is identified, such nation can easily deny that the attack derived from their networks—instead claiming that they were hacked.¹⁷¹ Even more troublesome, if a non-state actor is identified as the originator of an attack, an accused nation could deny any nexus with the attacking non-state actor. The numerous loopholes involved with attributing an attack to a particular nation presents some serious problems in applying the international laws of war to cyber-warfare.\n---\n¹⁶⁸ *See e.g.,* Broad, Markoff &amp; Sanger, *supra* note 6 (explaining that no one is still one hundred percent certain where Stuxnet derived from)\n¹⁶⁹ *See* Nguyen, *supra* note 14, at 1104-05.\n¹⁷⁰ *See id.* at 1104-06.\n¹⁷¹ *See id.*\n*Volume XVIII 2014*                                                                 290\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\n## D. Applying the UN Charter and Tallinn Manual to an Attack on a Civilian Target\nIn this section, I will pose a couple of hypothetical situations to explain how a nation, specifically the United States, should respond to a cyber-attack that may or may not qualify as an act of cyber-warfare according to the UN Charter and the Manual—given Koh essentially adheres to the Manual. The two hypothetical situations involve (1) an attack on a civilian target that has some military aspects and (2) an attack on a purely civilian target. Notably, I will assume these attacks can be accurately attributed to the originator of the attack—a non-state actor directed by such state.\nSignificantly, this assumption would require the attack to affect the United States’ military to be considered having military characteristics. The issue of attribution is of such concern that the following examples could not be analyzed without making this assumption.\n### 1. ATTACK ON A CIVILIAN TARGET WITH MILITARY ASPECTS\nThe following fact pattern will present an opportunity to analyze an attack on a civilian target with military aspects: A foreign country attacks Boeing—a civilian aerospace company that, among many other things, helps the United States Military\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nresearch, test, and maintain aerospace technologies—via a cyber invasion that both steals and destroys both civilian and military related information.\nBefore moving forward and analyzing this attack under both the UN Charter and Manual, it is important to distinguish the espionage portion of the attack (the stealing) from the attacking portion of the attack (the destruction) because neither the UN Charter nor the Manual were created to analyze mere acts of espionage; but rather, they were created to analyze actual attacks.¹⁷² And to reiterate, we are assuming this attack can be accurately attributed to a non-sate actor working for such foreign country.\nUnder the UN Charter, this “attack” might constitute a use of force but unlikely would be classified as an armed attack. Importantly, only the military information that was destroyed could be considered in this analysis because the UN Charter requires the attack to have some sort of military aspect, and in this hypothetical, the civilian information lacks any sort of military character.¹⁷³ The destruction of the military information from Boeing could result in a use of force or armed attack depending on what exactly was destroyed and, more\n¹⁷² See supra Parts IVA.1, IV.B.1.\n¹⁷³ See supra Part IV.A.2.\nVolume XVIII 2014\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nimportantly, the consequence of destroying such information. If the destroyed military information involved details regarding national security that generated the scale and effects equivalent of military force, then the United States could likely classify the attack as a use of force. Classifying the attack as an armed attack, however, would be far more difficult because there was no physical damage in the sense of the UN Charter.¹⁷⁴ The United States could argue the destruction of computer files constitutes physical damage because such damage equates that of a kinetic attack, but this argument would be weak in these circumstances because the attack had no effect on Boeing’s operations like a kinetic attack would. Notably, this same type of analysis would be used regardless of where the information was destroyed, even if from the Pentagon.¹⁷⁵ Essentially, the scale and effects of the attack determine what actions are or are not allowed under the UN Charter. In short, this example epitomizes the rigorousness of the UN Charter’s requirement of military force and physical damage, especially in terms of cyber-warfare.\nUnder the Manual, a country potentially could have\n¹⁷⁴ See supra Part IV.A.4.\n¹⁷⁵ See supra Part IV (noting that the location being the Pentagon would likely cause of the information destroyed to have military character).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\nan easier time defining this attack as a use of force and/or an armed attack. Unlike the UN Charter’s requirement of military character, the Manual strictly analyses the scale and effects of an attack; therefore, both the civilian and military information that was destroyed must be analyzed. In doing so, the United State must use the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, state involvement, military character, and presumptive legality.¹⁷⁶ When applying these factors to this hypothetical, it seems the attack would constitute a use force because of the attack’s mild severity, high invasiveness, partial military character, attributable state involvement, and presumptive illegality. While the attack seems to be a use of force, the attack will not likely be considered an armed attack, especially given the high standard provided by the Manual—an armed attack is the *gravest* form of use of force.¹⁷⁷ Here, the attack seems significant but not in the same category of the *gravest* uses of force. Thus, the attack will likely constitute a use of force but not an armed attack.\nGiven that under both the UN Charter and Manual this attack is merely a use of force but not an armed attack, the\n¹⁷⁶ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 51-52. (Cambridge University Press 2013).\n¹⁷⁷ See id. at 48.\nVolume XVIII 2014 294\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\nUnited States would not be able to defensively respond via article 51 or rule 13.¹⁷⁸ Thus, the United States would have to respond by finding out why the foreign nation wanted to destroy such information and, moreover, the United States might have to destroy the information that was stolen.¹⁷⁹ Moreover, the United States could put political and economic pressure on the foreign country committing this illegal use of force.¹⁸⁰ The UN Charter also would provide the United States with the ability to request the UN’s assistance in properly responding to the attack.¹⁸¹ Alternatively, under the Manual, the United States could choose to take preemptive action via rule 15 in fear of the scale and effects of the destroyed information. Notably, the United States would have to show the immediacy and imminence of the foreign nation’s possible armed attack.¹⁸² Showing this immediacy and imminence would require more facts, but the more liberal attitude of the Manual can be seen in both the analyses of the attack as well as the United States’ ability to respond to this kind of attack\nEssentially, the Manual provides a more liberal outlook\n¹⁷⁸ See supra Part IV (noting that if it determined an attack constitutes a use of force, the defensive response must be necessary and proportionate).\n¹⁷⁹ See id.\n¹⁸⁰ See id.\n¹⁸¹ See supra Part IV.A.3.\n¹⁸² See supra Part.IV.B.4.c.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\non attacks that do not directly and physically damage something or someone, even if there are certain military aspects involved in the attack. While both the UN Charter and the Manual could allow the United States to classify this attack as a use of force—especially given the partial military characteristic of the attack—the Manual more easily provides such a classification and could allow the United States to take more action regarding this attack. In short, this hypothetical provides an example of how the Manual is more adaptive and on-point with attacks that could lead to cyber-warfare.\n## 2. ATTACK ON A PURELY CIVILIAN TARGET\nThe following fact pattern will present an opportunity to analyze an attack on a purely civilian target: A foreign country attacks the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) that results in the market crashing and/or freezing for a period of time.\nUnder the UN Charter, this attack would not constitute a use of force or armed attack. Attacking a country’s economy, while devastating, lacks any sort of military characteristic; thus, the UN Charter’s requirement of military force would not be met.¹⁸³ The United States could attempt to argue that even though the attack lacked any military character, the attack\n¹⁸³ See supra Part IV.A.1.\nVolume XVIII 2014 296\nVolume XVIII 2014\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\naffected the military somehow. This argument, however, would not be nearly as persuasive in this hypothetical as compared the previous hypothetical because the effect would be quite attenuated. In short, the complete lack of any military force and, seemingly, military effects would prevent the United States from classifying this attack as a use of force or an armed attack under the UN Charter.\nOnce again, the Manual provides a more liberal analysis of the attack than the UN Charter. To reiterate, the Manual does not require an attack to be of military character to qualify as a use of force or an armed attack.[184] Thus, only the scale and effects of the attack on the NYSE need to be analyzed—using the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, military character, state involvement, and presumptive legality.[185] The attack would likely be determined as a use of force because of its extended and severe detrimental effects, presumptive illegality, attributable state involvement, and intense invasiveness; however, classifying the attack as an armed attack would be more difficult—given an armed attack is the gravest form of use of force.[186] Nevertheless, the\nVolume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE United States could point out the importance of the NYSE and the collapse’s grave effect beyond the economy. While this hypothetical presents a controversial and difficult question, I believe the United States would be able to classify this attack as a use of force and an armed attack given the extremely detrimental and lasting effects of crashing the NYSE. The United States would have to deeply analyze each of the factors explained in the Manual to ensure certain prerequisites are met, but the United States would be able to defensively respond via rule 13 to such an attack.¹⁸⁷ Subsequently, the United States would have to properly respond with a proportionate and necessary attack.¹⁸⁸ In sum, under the Manual, such an attack that completely crashes the NYSE would constitute a use of force, and more importantly, an armed attack resulting in the United States’s ability to act in self-defense.\n## 3. SUMMARY OF HYPOTHETICAL SITUATIONS While both hypothetical situations seem relatively open for interpretation, there is a major lesson to be learned from the application of the UN Charter, Manual, and in turn, Koh’s speech: cyber-warfare presents an unprecedented such an attack could constitute an armed attack).\n¹⁸⁷ See id. at 53-59.\n¹⁸⁸ See id. at 59-60.\namount of uncertainty and vagueness in the context of the international laws of war. As seen, when the attack has certain military characteristics, the attack is much easier to define. Unfortunately, cyber-attacks need not and most likely will not be of strict military character, causing the UN Charter to seem obsolete in many situations. Thus, the liberal approach of the Manual functions more efficiently and accurately than that of the UN Charter in the cyber-warfare context. Effectively, each cyber-attack must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis, concentrating on how the scale and effects of the attack affect the government, military, and civilian population.\n## VI. Recommendation: A Possible Solution to the Issues in Applying the International Laws of War to Cyber-Warfare Because cyber-warfare is a new and evolving medium for warfare, an international convention must occur, and in turn, create an internationally recognized cyber-warfare treaty. While the UN Charter provides a legitimate basis for such a treaty, the UN Charter seems obsolete to handle the intricacies involved in cyber-warfare.¹⁸⁹ The Manual, for the most part, is successful in applying the rules of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but fails at the most critical point: functioning as a binding ¹⁸⁹ See supra Part.V.\nVolume XVIII 2014 299 Volume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE authority. Instead, it is merely functioning as “suggestions.”¹⁹⁰ Koh, who essentially agrees with the Manual, simply discussed the problems surrounding cyber-warfare, but no solutions whatsoever.¹⁹¹ Therefore, nations from around the world must come together and create binding rules for cyber-warfare before it is too late. In my opinion, the United States should address this problem now and be a leader in creating this treaty.\n## A. The Need for an International Convention, and in turn, an Internationally Recognized Cyber-Warfare Treaty With the UN Charter and the Manual presenting valuable rules, exceptions to such rules, and recommendations involving all types of warfare—including cyber-warfare—the next step for regulating cyber-warfare is to create a binding international treaty focusing solely on cyber-warfare. For the effective creation of such a treaty, nations from around the world—not just experts in the field—will have to work together during an international convention, in a similar fashion as the creation of the UN Charter. During this convention, I believe the United States should take a progressive stance on this issue and become the world leader in regulating cyber-warfare.\n¹⁹⁰ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 16.\n¹⁹¹ See supra Part.IV.C.1.\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY Regarding the details of this treaty, different aspects of both the UN Charter and Manual should be used, yet the treaty should also include further provisions. Overall, the treaty should follow the substance of the Manual as it does a remarkable job at applying the UN charter to a cyber-warfare setting. Nevertheless, certain decisions have to be made where the UN Charter and Manual disagree. For example, I believe the treaty should follow the Manual’s usage of the scale and effects test for both use of force and armed attack.¹⁹² However, there needs to be a definition or a sort of sliding scale to quantify the scale and effects of an attack—beyond listing an open set of factors.¹⁹³ Moreover, in accordance with the Manual, there should be no need for military character or death to constitute use of force or an armed attack.¹⁹⁴ While this standard might seem too liberal, the rules regarding self-defense will combat this liberalness by requiring the response to be proportionate and necessary—as both the Manual and UN Charter explain.¹⁹⁵ Notably, the use of examples within the Manual help clarify its rules, with each example explaining certain aspects of the ¹⁹² See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-59.\n¹⁹³ See id. at 49-52.\n¹⁹⁴ See supra Parts IVA.1, IV.B.1.\n¹⁹⁵ See e.g., TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 59-60.\nVolume XVIII 2014 301 Volume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE rule; therefore, given the positive affect of these examples, such examples should also be used in this cyber-warfare treaty.¹⁹⁶ These examples will allow readers to truly understand the rules and, more importantly, their applicability in the real world.\nFurthermore, each nation should be forced to present their case to the other members of the treaty before taking action, unless the defensive response is an absolute and immediate necessity.\nThis “meeting” will prevent a nation from applying the treaty in any way it sees fit, regardless of the treaty’s true meaning and the beliefs of other countries. Moreover, like the Manual, the treaty should include factor tests whenever answers will not be clear.¹⁹⁷ These factors will allow countries to apply the facts of an attack to numerous factors as opposed to the strict reading of rules. Unlike the Manual, however, one of these factors should involve intent because the intent of an attacking nation should be taken into account when determining whether a country has illegally used force or an armed attack.¹⁹⁸ Lastly, like the UN Charter, the treaty should include some rule or article that provides that members of the treaty shall ensure that non- ¹⁹⁶ See e.g., id. at 55 (giving an example of an attack on a civilian target).\n¹⁹⁷ See e.g., id. at 49-52 (noting that this treaty should not be over-dependent on such factor tests).\n¹⁹⁸ See id. at 53-59 (noting that the Manual does not consider intent).\nVolume XVIII 2014 # THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE members still act in accordance with the treaty but only to the extent that is necessary to maintain international peace.¹⁹⁹ This provision would allow the treaty to have a worldwide affect, beyond the countries that signed. The treaty, effectively, will use the Manual’s application of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but bind of all member-nations to the treaty, much like the UN Charter did with United Nations members.\nIn short, some sort of binding action must occur to regulate cyber-warfare, and the United States should be at the forefront of this movement. In regulating cyber-warfare, the ideals and the binding effect of the UN Charter should be applied to cyber-warfare in a similar fashion as the Tallinn Manual. By taking action in this questionable area of law, the United States can ensure its safety now and into the future.\n## VII. Conclusion The lack of regulations involving cyber-warfare is a growing and real threat. Cyber-warfare might be a confusing and seemingly futuristic concept, but countries from around the world need to address this lack of regulation sooner than ¹⁹⁹ See e.g., U.N. Charter art. 2(6) (“The Organization shall ensure that states which are not Members of the United Nations act in accordance with these Principles so far as may be necessary for the maintenance of international peace and security.”).\n# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY later. While countries can attempt to apply the UN Charter to cyber-warfare situations, the UN Charter lacks the flexibility and modernization to properly handle the intricacies of cyber-attacks. The UN Charter is undoubtedly effective in handling kinetic warfare; however, it seems obsolete in the cyber-warfare context. Experts in the field recognized this issue and, in response, created the Tallinn Manual, which was effective in applying the UN Charter to cyber-warfare. Nevertheless, the Manual functions simply as a suggestion booklet and provides zero binding rules or regulations. Therefore, the United States needs to take the lead in regulating cyber-warfare. The United States needs to hold an international conference that will produce a binding treaty involving the regulations of cyber-warfare. This treaty should use the Manual’s concepts of applying the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but needs to go further in an attempt to leave as few questions unanswered as possible. While such a task will be difficult, the difficulties in creating a cyber-warfare treaty are minimal compared to the damage that will occur without such regulations.\nVolume XVIII 2014 304",

Introduction: The Growing Concerns of Cyber-Warfare\n\nThe threat of cyber-warfare is a current and continuing issue that our nation must address. President Obama, the Department of Defense (DoD), and even the private sector comprehend this issue and have been attempting to update our defense strategies to better protect this nation. The following quotations explain how concerned authorities from all levels of the nation are with the threat of cyber-warfare:\n\nIt’s the great irony of our Information Age -- the very technologies that empower us to create and to build also empower those who would disrupt and destroy. And this paradox -- seen and unseen -- is something that we experience every day... cyber threat is one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation.¹\n\nOur daily life, economic vitality, and national security depend on a stable, safe, and resilient cyberspace. . . .

What is Cyber-Warfare: Definitions and Conflicts\n\n### Therein\n\nBefore moving into an in-depth discussion regarding cyber-warfare, the possibility of a cyber-attack on a government or civilian target, and a cyber-attack’s relation to the international rules of war, a definition of cyber-warfare must be established. The definition’s importance is exemplified in the international law of war setting because an attack must be analyzed using the “use of force” and/or “armed attack” tests, which are further discussed later in this paper.⁸\n\n⁸ See generally TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Cambridge University Press 2013) (explaining the use of force in terms of cyber-warfare); U.N. Charter art. 51 (explaining the amount force needed to respond to an armed attack).",
    "# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n\n## A. Basic Definition of Cyber-Warfare\n\nThe most basic definition of cyber-warfare can be established by combining the terms “cyber” and “war.” Cyber is defined in an English dictionary as “of, relating to, or involving computers or computer networks.”⁹ War, as defined in a legal dictionary, is “[h]ostile conflict by means of armed forces, carried on between nations, states, or rulers, or sometimes between parties within the same nation or state.”¹⁰ Thus, cyber-warfare would be a hostile conflict via armed forces that involves computers or computer networks.¹¹ The problem with this definition is that it requires “armed forces,” whereas cyber-warfare usually does not include actual armed forces invading or defending a country.¹² To the contrary, cyber-warfare usually involves a conflict within computer systems, which were programmed by humans, but does not involve forces equipped with actual kinetic weapons.¹³\n\n## B. Definition Based on the Object Being Attacked\n\nBeyond this basic attempt to define cyber-warfare,\n\nVolume XVIII 2014",
    "Volume XVIII 2014\n\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\n\ntwo other mainstream ideologies have defined cyber-warfare: object-based vs. medium-based.¹⁴ The object based definition concentrates on whether the object being attacked is “cyber” in nature. The U.S. National Research Council created such a definition in 2009 in an attempt to clarify cyber-warfare and cyber-attacks.¹⁵ The definition described a cyber-attack as “the use of deliberate actions—perhaps over an extended period of time—to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy adversary computer systems or networks or the information and/or programs resident in or transiting these systems or networks.”¹⁶ Other commentators have offered similar definitions, such as defining cyber-warfare as “actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation’s computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption.”¹⁷ The main problem with any object-based definition is that it is overly broad; that is, such definitions would include attacks on computers via kinetic weapons.¹⁸ For example, these definitions would define a\n\n14 See Reese Nguyen, *Navigating Jus Ad Bellum in the Age of Cyber Warfare*, 101 CAL.

KNAKE, CYBER WAR: THE NEXT THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT 6 (2010).\n18 See Nguyen, supra note 14, at 1087 (explaining that attacks via kinetic weapons should not be included in the discussion of cyber-warfare because such",
    "# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n\nbombing of a server farm as a cyber-attack that could lead to cyber-warfare; however, the act of using a physical bomb seems far beyond the purview of a cyber-attack. Therefore, such object-based definitions of cyber-warfare, and in turn cyber-attacks, are too broad in nature.\n\nAlternatively, object-based definitions of cyber-warfare are equally too narrow. Because object-based definitions require the object being attacked to be cyber in nature, these definitions would exclude attacks from a computer network that affect non-computers. For example, the Stuxnet attacks involved a malicious worm that used computer networks to attack, but and actually affected Iran’s nuclear centrifuges.¹⁹ Thus, under the object-based definition of cyber-warfare, the Stuxnet attack would not have qualified as a cyber-attack or an act of cyber-warfare. In short, the object-based definition of cyber-warfare fails in numerous ways, being both overly broad and narrow.\n\n## C. Definition Based on the Medium Being Used to Attack\n\nThe medium-based definition concentrates on whether the object *used* in the attack is “cyber” in nature. Essentially, a medium-based definition of cyber-warfare focuses on the\n\nkinetic attacks have already been readily defined in a number of international treaties and laws of war).\n\n¹⁹ See Dennis Fisher &amp; Paul Roberts, *Spotlight Series: Stuxnet*, THREATPOST: THE KASPERSKY LAB SECURITY NEWS SERVICE.\n\nVolume XVIII 2014 254",

The DoD seems to imply this type of understanding through its definition of cyberspace operations: “[t]he employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace.”²⁰ Importantly, this definition highlights the medium used in the operation, which parallels the way a medium-based definition of cyber-warfare focuses on whether cyberspace is used during an attack. An example of a medium-based definition for cyber-warfare can be seen in the Cambridge Dictionary as “the activity of using the internet to attack a country’s computers in order to damage things such as communication and transport systems or water and electricity supplies.”²¹ Moreover, a medium-based definition works best with the international laws of war because these laws rely on concepts that revolve around the force exerted on a target as opposed to the type of target being\n\n20 Joint Publication 1-02, DOD DICTIONARY OF MILITARY AND ASSOCIATED TERMS (Sept. 15, 2013), http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/ (emphasis added) (noting the DoD does not have a definition for cyber-warfare, cyber-war, or cyber-attack).\n\n21 CAMBRIDGE DICTIONARIES, http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/british/cyberwarfare?q=+cyberwarfare (last visited Oct. 29, 2013) (emphasis added) (noting that many other mainstream dictionaries did not include a definition of cyber-warfare, cyber-war, or cyber-attack).",
    "# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n\nattacked.²² For the forgoing reasons, a medium-based definition should be used to define cyber-warfare. Thus, the definition of cyber-warfare should look similar, but not necessarily exactly like, the definition provided in the Cambridge Dictionary.²³\n\nFor example, a proper definition of cyber-warfare could be: hostile acts via cyberspace that damage or disturb a country’s infrastructure or related networks for a governmental or national security purpose.\n\n## III. Potential Types of Cyber-Attacks that Could Occur During Cyber-Warfare\n\nNow that a logical and adequate definition of cyber-warfare has been established, understanding the types of attacks a nation could experience becomes imperative to understanding how and if an attack could constitute an act of cyber-warfare. There are three main categories of cyber-attacks: syntactic, semantic, and hybrid attacks.²⁴\n\n### A. Syntactic Attacks\n\nSyntactic attacks are aimed at a computer’s operating\n\n²² See e.g., TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 48-49 (Cambridge University Press 2013) (explaining the use of force factors—severity, directness, measurability of effects, etc.); U.N.

PENETRATION ATTACKS\n\nPenetration attacks, as the name indicates, penetrate a computer system or computer network and transport whatever the programmer wants to “drop” into the system/network.²⁷ Examples of penetration attacks include the implantation of malware, viruses, Trojan horses, and worms.²⁸ All these types of penetration attacks cause actual damage to the system/network in different ways.²⁹ For example, worms replicate within the system but do not infect the host computer; nevertheless, the worm spreads throughout the entire system and eventually can cause the system to completely shut down.³⁰ Viruses effect computer systems is a different way, creating codes that become active once a user opens the file, and subsequently, the\n\n25  Id. at 27.\n26  See Nguyen, supra note 14, at 1092-93.\n27  Id.\n28  CDR Vida M.

DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS\n\nDenial of service (DoS) attacks disrupt a computer system or network by overloading the system/network, and thus, reduce its functionality.³³ Essentially, a DoS attack can completely shut down a system/network by flooding the target with false requests for service, therefore causing the system to overload.³⁴ When this happens, legitimate requests for service are blocked, and the actual purpose of the system is devastated.³⁵ Importantly, for anonymity reasons, attackers will often use distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks. A DDoS attack has the same purpose as a DoS attack; however, the attacker uses other people’s computers in addition to their own, which makes tracing the source of the attack much more difficult. Both DoS\n\n³¹ *Id.*\n\n³² See e.g., *Fisher &amp; Roberts*, *supra* note 19 (explaining how the Stuxnet worm caused actual damage to Iranian nuclear program).\n\n³³ JOSEPH MIGGA KIZZA, *COMPUTER NETWORK SECURITY AND CYBER ETHICS* 76 (2002).\n\n³⁴ Mindi McDowell, *Understanding Denial-of-Service Attacks*, UNITED STATES COMPUTER EMERGENCY READINESS TEAM (Feb. 6, 2013), http://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-015.\n\n³⁵ *Id.*\n\nVolume XVIII 2014 258",
    "Volume XVIII 2014\n\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\n\nand DDoS attacks can harm a nation via physical or economic damages.³⁶\n\n## B. Semantic Attacks\n\nSemantic attacks do not attempt to shut down, steal information, or destroy a computer network/system; rather, they affect the accuracy of the network’s information. Essentially, “[a] system under semantic attack operates and will be perceived as operating correctly (otherwise the semantic attack is failure), but it will generate answers at variance with reality.”³⁷ While such an attack seems petty, computer users tend to accept the information given to them, especially if such information derives from a government website.³⁸ For example, if a semantic attack occurred to an important government website, such information could cause people ignore a legitimate threat or falsely perceive an innocent act as a legitimate attack. Such a semantic attack could cause people to unnecessarily bunker down or, alternatively, riot out of fear. Thus, such a semantic attack could have severe consequences\n\n³⁶ See e.g., John Markoff, *Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks*, New York Times (Aug. 12, 2008), http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html?_r=0 (explaining that the Russian cyber-attack on Georgia consisted of a DoS attack).\n\n³⁷ Brenner &amp; Goodman, *supra* note 24, at 31-32.\n\n³⁸ See Antolin-Jenkins, *supra* note 28, at 140 (noting how gullible or ignorant many computer users are when reading information off the internet).",
    "# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n\non the population.³⁹ As demonstrated above, semantic attacks can be as detrimental to a nation as syntactic attacks.\n\n## C. Hybrid Attacks\n\nHybrid attacks are exactly what the term seems to imply: a hybrid of syntactic and semantic cyber-attacks.⁴⁰ Such attacks have the greatest likelihood of causing the most destruction because the attacker could actually destroy a certain computer system (and, in turn, whatever other infrastructure was affected) and then tell the people that something completely different happened—only furthering the confusion, distrust, and destruction.⁴¹\n\n³⁹ See id. at 140-41 (noting that such attacks could cause great civil unrest); Brenner &amp; Goodman, supra note 24 at 31-39.\n⁴⁰ See Antolin-Jenkins, supra note 28, at 140.\n⁴¹ See id. For example,\n\nTerrorists can mount complex attacks by combining syntactic and semantic attacks. Imagine that terrorists target Boston, Atlanta, Miami, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles for an attack which begins with a syntactic assault on computer systems that stops the delivery of state public assistance. General public awareness of the attack will emerge gradually, as successive waves of frustrated welfare recipients file complaints with the appropriate agencies. Eventually, the realization will spread that the distribution of benefits had been deliberately shut down. Once it becomes clear that the funds are not coming, the terrorists can follow up with a semantic attack assigning responsibility for their efforts to carefully-selected right-wing groups whose views are known to carry at least the taint of racial bias. If the terrorists manage to sustain the welfare gridlock, the freezing of the resources upon which thousands depend for their survival will produce civil disobedience and localized chaos. National Guardsmen might have to be sent into these cities to maintain\n\nVolume XVIII 2014",

International Laws of War: An Application to Cyber-Warfare\n\nIn this section, I will explain the major components of the international laws of war in the cyber-warfare context. First, I will briefly explain the United Nations Charter (UN Charter) and how it applies to cyber-warfare.⁴² Subsequently, I will discuss the creation and purpose of the Tallinn Manual (the Manual).⁴³ And lastly, I will explain the United States’ approach and strategies to handing the possibility of cyber-warfare.⁴⁴ Each of these components is essential in understanding how to properly respond to an act of warfare, specifically cyber-\n\norder. To make things even more interesting, the terrorists can then direct a syntactic attack at ATM and banking system computers in these cities. Such a shutdown will add to the problem by causing outrage among citizens who do not depend on welfare funds. The cumulative effects of all these efforts will be riots, targeted violence and a National Guard stretched to its limit (which will create an excellent opportunity for the terrorists to stage a CBERN attack in other areas of the country).\n\nBrenner &amp; Goodman, supra note 24, at 39-40.\n\n42 See infra Part IV.A.\n43 See infra Part IV.B.\n44 See infra Part IV.C.\n\n261",

The United Nations Charter\n\nThe UN Charter functions as the backbone to the current international laws of war.⁴⁵ It sets forth many rules and guidelines that apply to war; including starting a conflict, responding to an attack, and how the UN should respond to an attack on a member nation.⁴⁶ Understanding the UN Charter is crucial to understanding the later developments that deal specifically with cyber-warfare.\n\n## 1. GENERAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe UN Charter was created to “save succeeding generations from the scourge of war . . . to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights . . . to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other resources of international law . . . and to promote social progress.”⁴⁷ Moreover, the overarching goals of the UN Charter were to allow countries to live tolerantly and in peace, to strengthen international peace and security, to ensure that armed forces are a last resort, and to promote\n\n⁴⁵ See History of the United Nations, http://www.un.org/en/aboutun/history/charter_history.shtml (last visited Oct. 30, 2013).\n\n⁴⁶ See generally U.N.

ARTICLE 2(4): PROHIBITING THE THREAT OR USE OF FORCE\n\nArticle 2, paragraph 4 of the UN Charter provides a quintessential rule: “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.”⁵¹ Essentially, this rule prohibits a country from threatening or using “force” on another country, provided\n\n48  Id.\n49  Member States of the United Nations, http://www.un.org/en/members/ (last visited Oct. 30, 2013) (noting there are 193 member nation with only Vatican City, Kosovo, The Republic of Taiwan, and Palestine not being members).\n50  U.S. CONST. art.

They apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”⁶⁹ Thus, the term armed attack actually functions more as an expansion to “use of force” as opposed to an attack with actual kinetic weapons.⁷⁰\n\nMoreover, the ICJ decided in *Nicaragua v.

GENERAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Manual, which was published in 2013, was put together by an international group of approximately twenty-five experts from 2009 to 2012.⁷⁸ These experts met in Tallinn, Estonia, which in turn, helped produce the name of the Manual.⁷⁹ The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), specifically NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, invited these experts to put together the rules of cyber-warfare into a single document.⁸⁰ The Manual was put together in response to the growing fear of cyber-warfare and, more specifically, the lack of well-defined rules regulating cyber-warfare.⁸¹ Notably, the Manual only discusses the laws\n\n⁷⁶ See id.\n\n⁷⁷ Id.

RULES 11 AND 12: DEFINITIONS OF FORCE AND THREAT OF FORCE\n\nImportantly, and unlike the UN Charter, the Manual actually defines both the crucial terms “use of force” and “threat of force.”⁸⁴ Starting with these definitions will allow for a better understanding of the Manual, even though these definitions come after some important rules within the Manual.⁸⁵\n\n### a.

Nevertheless, the Manual could function in a similar way to the Lieber Code—an aspirational attempt to regulate warfare during the civil war—in that the Lieber Code eventually “became a core text in the modern laws of war recognized worldwide, and many elements of his code continue to inform our public debate how best to respond to a new form of warfare in both an effective and a moral manner.” Nick Beard, *The Liber Codes*, *THE NEW YORK TIMES: THE OPINION PAGES* (Apr. 24, 2013, 12:59 PM), http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/the-lieber-codes/?_r=0.\n\n⁸⁴ *TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE* 47-53.\n\n⁸⁵ *Id.* at 45, 47-53 (noting that the Prohibition of Threat or Use of Force, Rule 10, comes before the definitions of “use of force” and “threat of force”).\n\nVolume XVIII 2014 270",

Rule 12: Definition of Threat of Force\n\nRule 12 of the Manual breaks down the functional meaning of “threat of force” in the cyber-warfare context.⁹⁴ Importantly, the rule explains that a threat could occur in two situations: (1) “a cyber operation that is used to communicate a threat to use force” and (2) “a threat carried out by any means . . . to carry out cyber operations qualifying as use of force.”⁹⁵ The rule further notes that a demand need not accompany the threat to qualify as such under this rule; however, actions alone that seem threatening do not qualify as a threat because a threat must be “communicative in nature.”⁹⁶ The rule also states that a threat of force could technically derive form a nation that seems unequipped to follow through will such a threat; nonetheless, it’s the threat that matters.⁹⁷ Interestingly, the rule explains that\n\n⁹³ *Id.* (explaining out that the list of factors is not exhaustive and functions only as a starting point).\n\n⁹⁴ *Id.* at 52-53.\n\n⁹⁵ *Id.* at 52.\n\n⁹⁶ *Id.* at 53 (explaining that developing technology that could be used in an act that qualifies as a use of force *does not* qualify as a threat of force).\n\n⁹⁷ *Id.* (noting the experts were split with this portion of the rule).\n\nVolume XVIII 2014 272",

RULE 10: PROHIBITION OF THREAT OR USE OF FORCE\n\nRule 10 of the Manual parallels article 2(4) of the UN Charter by making “[a] cyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force . . . unlawful.”⁹⁹ The commentary following Rule 10 clarifies that the “use of force” does not need to be committed by a country’s armed forces; rather, the force could derive from an intelligence agency or any private contractor of the nation. Rule 10 also discusses a nation “intervening” in another nation’s affairs—political, economic, social, cultural, or otherwise.¹⁰⁰ The rule explains that it is unlawful for another nation to intervene but goes on to explain that the term\n\n⁹⁸ *Id.* (noting, once again, that the experts were split with this portion of the rule).\n\n⁹⁹ *See id.* at 45 (Cambridge University Press 2013); U.N.

    "# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n\n\"intervene\" does have the same meaning as in a layman context; instead, intervention in the cyber-war context, as well as for the UN Charter, must involve coercion.¹⁰¹ The rule further explains that an unlawful act of intervention does not per se qualify as a use of force; the intervention still must breach the threshold for use of force independently.¹⁰² Thus, when determining whether an intervention is unlawful, a nation must ascertain if coercion is involved, and moreover, must decide if the intervention reached the level of use of force.¹⁰³ Fundamentally, Rule 10 applies article 2(4) of the UN Charter to the cyber-warfare setting.\n\n## 4. RULES 13, 14, 15 AND 16: THE RIGHT AND REGULATIONS FOR SELF-DEFENSE AND COLLECTIVE SELF-DEFENSE\n\nRules 13, 14, 15, and 16 of the Manual all explain the ability of a victim nation to launch a defensive response—in a parallel manner to article 51 of the UN Charter.¹⁰⁴ Rule 13 discusses an individual nation’s right to protect itself; rule 14 examines how an act of self-defense must be necessary and proportionate to the original attack; rule 15 delves into\n\n¹⁰¹ *Id.* at 47 (“intervention pure and simple is not intervention [in the UN Charter or Tallinn Manual context]”).\n\n¹⁰² *Id.* at 46.\n\n¹⁰³ *Id.* at 46-47; see UN Charter art. 51.\n\n¹⁰⁴ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 53-64.\n\nVolume XVIII 2014 274",

Rule 13: Self-Defense Against Armed Attack\n\nRule 13 of the Manual allows a nation to exercise the right of self-defense, given that such nation faced an attack—cyber or kinetic—that qualified as an armed attack.¹⁰⁷ The term “armed attack” is quantified by the scale and effects of the attack, much like the use of force threshold in rule 11, but has an even heightened threshold beyond use of force.¹⁰⁸ Plainly, an armed attack is the “gravest” form of a use of force.¹⁰⁹ Unfortunately, however, the Manual never defines what the exact threshold is for the scale and effects test—only causing confusion.¹¹⁰ The scale and effects of an attack, though, must\n\n105 Id.\n106 See id.; UN Charter art. 51.\n107 See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 53-59 (explaining that “some cyber-attacks may be sufficiently grave to warrant classifying them as an ‘armed attack’”).\n108 See id. at 48-49, 54-55 (noting that while the two thresholds—armed attack and use of force—use the same threshold test, an armed attack holds a higher threshold).\n109 Id. at 48.\n110 See id. at 55-56 (indicating that the scale and effects test must be",

Therefore, an attack that causes grave damage far beyond any reasonable foresight would not constitute an armed attack.¹¹¹ Notably, an armed attack must have a trans-border component; thus, a purely domestic attack can never qualify as an armed attack within the Manual’s framework.¹¹² The rule further explains that an armed attack can originate from a state or a non-state actor who is directed by the state to take such actions.¹¹³ Additionally, the rule states that individual attacks that alone do not qualify as armed attacks can be classified as armed attacks if that single attack is just one in a series of attacks. Accordingly, aggregated non-armed attacks can elevate and cross the threshold of an armed attack.¹¹⁴ The comments for rule 13 continue in detail about the irrelevance of intentions, the ability of a third party nation to defend itself if the scale and effects of the attack bleed over borders, and the ability of a victim nation to retaliate against persons who are located in an innocent third party nation—so as long the victim nation has permission to do so or the innocent third party nation\n\napplied on a case-by-case basis).\n\n¹¹¹ *Id.* at 56.\n\n¹¹² *Id.* at 54.\n\n¹¹³ *Id.* at 54-58 (detailing the intricacies and problems with attributing a non-state actor’s actions to a state).\n\n¹¹⁴ *Id.* at 55 (explaining that there must be convincing evidence that the multiple attacks are related).\n\nVolume XVIII 2014 276",

Rule 14: Necessity and Proportionality\n\nEven if it is determined that a nation has the right to defend itself—either via kinetic or cyber action—that nation’s defensive response must be necessary and proportionate.¹¹⁷ Simply put, if any non-use of force action could be taken to solve the problem, such action must be taken.¹¹⁸ Notably, this “necessity” is judged from the victim nation’s perspective.¹¹⁹ The rule also discusses proportionality.¹²⁰ Proportionality addresses how much force a victim nation may use in the defensive action. Factors such as scale, scope, duration, and intensity play a role in this determination.¹²¹ Importantly, this proportionality test does not require a victim nation to mirror the scale, scope, duration, and intensity of the offensive attack; but rather, the defensive action must be proportionate to the\n\n115 *Id.* at 58-59.\n116 *See id.* at 53-59.\n117 *Id.* at 59.\n118 *Id.* (“[This rule] merely requires that non-forceful measures be insufficient to address the situation.”).\n119 *Id.* at 60.\n120 *Id.*\n121 *Id.* (explaining that a kinetic attack could be used to respond to a cyber-attack and vice-versa).",

Rule 15: Imminence and Immediacy\n\nThe Manual takes a step beyond the UN Charter by detailing when a nation can preemptively defend itself and the general time frame allowed for a defensive attack.¹²⁵ Rule 15 specifically allows for preemptive defense actions if an armed attack from an enemy nation is imminent.¹²⁶ To be considered imminent, the need to defend must be “instant, overwhelming, [and] leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.”¹²⁷ Interestingly, the experts involved in writing\n\n¹²² *Id.* (indicating that the defensive attack is judged on “the level of force needed to successfully mount a defense . . . more force may be necessary, or less force may be sufficient [ ] to repel the attack or defeat one that is imminent”).\n\n¹²³ *Id.*\n\n¹²⁴ *See id.* at 59-60.\n\n¹²⁵ *See id.* at 60-63.\n\n¹²⁶ *Id.* at 60.

For example, if the victim state only wants to respond via a cyber action, the assisting nation cannot use kinetic weapons—even if the use of such weapons would be allowed under the rules of the Manual.¹³⁵ The Manual also recognizes certain *ad hoc* agreements as constituting consent of the victim state, i.e. NATO agreements.

While these thresholds create a basis for evaluating an attack, they are both vague and indecisive.¹⁵⁵ For example, the UN Charter does not even attempt to solve the issue of what “use of force” entails and applies the scale and effects test to only armed attacks, while the Manual—which Koh seems to side with—applies the scales and effects test to both.¹⁵⁶ The disparities in opinion continue beyond the differences in the application of the tests; the UN charter seems to imply a use of force or armed attack must occur through armed forces and/or cause physical damage to a nation’s military, while the Tallinn Manual and Koh would disagree.¹⁵⁷ Moreover, the scale and effects test has many of its own flaws\n\n---\n\n¹⁵⁵ See e.g., Waxman, *supra* note 54, at 44-46 (explaining the vagueness of use of force in the UN Charter); see TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-49 (Cambridge University Press 2013) (noting that the Manual had to use examples and factors to try and explain the usage of the definition for use of force and still admitted the definition is anything but foolproof).\n\n¹⁵⁶ See U.N. Charter art. 2, para. 4, art. 51; TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-59; Koh’s Speech.\n\n¹⁵⁷ Waxman, *supra* note 53, at 44-46; TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 55.\n\nVolume XVIII 2014 286",
    "Volume XVIII 2014\n\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\n\nas discussed in the next section.¹⁵⁸ The dissimilarities between the Manual, Koh’s speech, and the UN Charter alone cause a great amount of confusion and uncertainty. Significantly, and to reiterate, of the (potential) rules discussed, only the UN Charter is binding; thus, its interpretation has the most significance and, seemingly, the only relevance at the current time. In short, the lack of cohesiveness and uniformity between the UN Charter and Manual only creates greater confusion in an already perplexed field.\n\n## B. Issues with the Scale and Effects Test\n\nThe scale and effects test used in the UN Charter, Tallinn Manual, and Koh’s speech faces some major challenges in the cyber-warfare context, including unpredictability, reversible effects, and differentiating effects.¹⁵⁹ Regarding unpredictability, programmers can fall victim to coding error, or cyber-security defenses that cause the programmer to adjust the attack on the fly, thus triggering unknown effects.¹⁶⁰ Consequently, the attack could either collapse or reach new levels of destruction.¹⁶¹ This unpredictability could have effects on intent, especially if the attack was never meant to reach the threshold of “use of force”\n\n158 See supra Part.V.B.\n159 See Nguyen, supra note 14, at 1100-1124.\n160 See id. at 1100.\n161 See id.",
    "# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n\nand/or an “armed attack.”¹⁶² Notably, the UN Charter takes intent in account when determining whether an attack breached the thresholds for either use of force or an armed attack, whereas the Manual *does not* base its analysis on intention whatsoever—solely analyzing the scale and effects of the attack.¹⁶³ Thus, the unpredictability of cyber-attacks affects the scale and effects test differently depending on whether the UN Charter or Manual is being applied. From another perspective, a nation’s cyber-security defenses could interact with an attack in unforeseen ways, causing a chain reaction that overwhelms or shuts down a network. In this scenario, is the attacker blamed for scale and effects of the shutdown, or is the victim nation’s faulty defenses to blame? The unpredictability of cyber-attacks will continuously cause problems in applying the scale and effects test.\n\nThe ability of cyber-attacks to cause reversible damages as well as delayed or prolonged damages also raises concerns.¹⁶⁴ Presumably, if the effects were reversible, the scale and effects of an attack would be greatly diminished—even if such an\n\n¹⁶² *See id.* at 1103-04.\n¹⁶³ *See supra* Part.IV.B.4.a.\n¹⁶⁴ *See* Martin Libiki, *Pulling Punches in Cyberspace*, *PROCEEDINGS OF A WORKSHOP ON DETERRING CYBERATTACKS: INFORMING STRATEGIES AND DEVELOPING OPTIONS FOR U.S. POLICY* 123, 124-129 (2010).\n\nVolume XVIII 2014 288",
    "Volume XVIII 2014\n\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\n\nattack had immense effects in the short term.¹⁶⁵ Nevertheless, the essential factor would be the immediate scale and effects, and thus, if the immediate scale and effects constituted a use of force or armed attack, then a victim nation could take the prescribed measures under the applicable laws of war. Alternatively, how can the laws of war apply to a cyber-attack that affects two countries differently?¹⁶⁶ For example, what if a cyber-attack caused minimal damage to a more advanced country and significant damage to a less advanced country? Could only the less advanced country respond to the attack? The answer to this question, is likely that only the less advanced country could respond. While this answer adheres to the international laws of war, it seems rather illogical that the exact same attack could lead to such different defensive responses.¹⁶⁷ Even though the scales and effects test has been widely acknowledge in the UN Charter, Manual, and Koh’s speech, the test is anything but flawless.\n\n## C. Issues of Attribution\n\nThe issue of attribution may be the most troublesome of the many issues that arise in applying the international laws\n\n¹⁶⁵ See id.\n\n¹⁶⁶ See Nguyen, supra note 14, at 1124.\n\n¹⁶⁷ See id. at 1124-25.",
    "# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n\nof war to cyber-warfare. Unlike traditional warfare when it is relatively simple to discover who launched an attack against a nation, a cyber-attack can be nearly impossible to attribute to a particular nation, especially if a non-state actor is working at the direction of a nation.¹⁶⁸ Such is true because the cyber world offers so many options for anonymity and hiding attacks behind other networks.¹⁶⁹ People experienced within the cyber world can easily forge or conceal their identity, especially if motivated to hide an illegal attack.¹⁷⁰ Moreover, even if a nation is identified, such nation can easily deny that the attack derived from their networks—instead claiming that they were hacked.¹⁷¹ Even more troublesome, if a non-state actor is identified as the originator of an attack, an accused nation could deny any nexus with the attacking non-state actor. The numerous loopholes involved with attributing an attack to a particular nation presents some serious problems in applying the international laws of war to cyber-warfare.\n\n---\n\n¹⁶⁸ *See e.g.,* Broad, Markoff &amp; Sanger, *supra* note 6 (explaining that no one is still one hundred percent certain where Stuxnet derived from)\n\n¹⁶⁹ *See* Nguyen, *supra* note 14, at 1104-05.\n\n¹⁷⁰ *See id.* at 1104-06.\n\n¹⁷¹ *See id.*\n\n*Volume XVIII 2014*                                                                 290",
    "Volume XVIII 2014\n\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\n\n## D. Applying the UN Charter and Tallinn Manual to an Attack on a Civilian Target\n\nIn this section, I will pose a couple of hypothetical situations to explain how a nation, specifically the United States, should respond to a cyber-attack that may or may not qualify as an act of cyber-warfare according to the UN Charter and the Manual—given Koh essentially adheres to the Manual. The two hypothetical situations involve (1) an attack on a civilian target that has some military aspects and (2) an attack on a purely civilian target. Notably, I will assume these attacks can be accurately attributed to the originator of the attack—a non-state actor directed by such state.\n\nSignificantly, this assumption would require the attack to affect the United States’ military to be considered having military characteristics. The issue of attribution is of such concern that the following examples could not be analyzed without making this assumption.\n\n### 1. ATTACK ON A CIVILIAN TARGET WITH MILITARY ASPECTS\n\nThe following fact pattern will present an opportunity to analyze an attack on a civilian target with military aspects: A foreign country attacks Boeing—a civilian aerospace company that, among many other things, helps the United States Military",
    "# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n\nresearch, test, and maintain aerospace technologies—via a cyber invasion that both steals and destroys both civilian and military related information.\n\nBefore moving forward and analyzing this attack under both the UN Charter and Manual, it is important to distinguish the espionage portion of the attack (the stealing) from the attacking portion of the attack (the destruction) because neither the UN Charter nor the Manual were created to analyze mere acts of espionage; but rather, they were created to analyze actual attacks.¹⁷² And to reiterate, we are assuming this attack can be accurately attributed to a non-sate actor working for such foreign country.\n\nUnder the UN Charter, this “attack” might constitute a use of force but unlikely would be classified as an armed attack. Importantly, only the military information that was destroyed could be considered in this analysis because the UN Charter requires the attack to have some sort of military aspect, and in this hypothetical, the civilian information lacks any sort of military character.¹⁷³ The destruction of the military information from Boeing could result in a use of force or armed attack depending on what exactly was destroyed and, more\n\n¹⁷² See supra Parts IVA.1, IV.B.1.\n¹⁷³ See supra Part IV.A.2.\n\nVolume XVIII 2014",
    "Volume XVIII 2014\n\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\n\nimportantly, the consequence of destroying such information. If the destroyed military information involved details regarding national security that generated the scale and effects equivalent of military force, then the United States could likely classify the attack as a use of force. Classifying the attack as an armed attack, however, would be far more difficult because there was no physical damage in the sense of the UN Charter.¹⁷⁴ The United States could argue the destruction of computer files constitutes physical damage because such damage equates that of a kinetic attack, but this argument would be weak in these circumstances because the attack had no effect on Boeing’s operations like a kinetic attack would. Notably, this same type of analysis would be used regardless of where the information was destroyed, even if from the Pentagon.¹⁷⁵ Essentially, the scale and effects of the attack determine what actions are or are not allowed under the UN Charter. In short, this example epitomizes the rigorousness of the UN Charter’s requirement of military force and physical damage, especially in terms of cyber-warfare.\n\nUnder the Manual, a country potentially could have\n\n¹⁷⁴ See supra Part IV.A.4.\n¹⁷⁵ See supra Part IV (noting that the location being the Pentagon would likely cause of the information destroyed to have military character).",
    "# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n\nan easier time defining this attack as a use of force and/or an armed attack. Unlike the UN Charter’s requirement of military character, the Manual strictly analyses the scale and effects of an attack; therefore, both the civilian and military information that was destroyed must be analyzed. In doing so, the United State must use the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, state involvement, military character, and presumptive legality.¹⁷⁶ When applying these factors to this hypothetical, it seems the attack would constitute a use force because of the attack’s mild severity, high invasiveness, partial military character, attributable state involvement, and presumptive illegality. While the attack seems to be a use of force, the attack will not likely be considered an armed attack, especially given the high standard provided by the Manual—an armed attack is the *gravest* form of use of force.¹⁷⁷ Here, the attack seems significant but not in the same category of the *gravest* uses of force. Thus, the attack will likely constitute a use of force but not an armed attack.\n\nGiven that under both the UN Charter and Manual this attack is merely a use of force but not an armed attack, the\n\n¹⁷⁶ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 51-52.

    "Volume XVIII 2014\n\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\n\nUnited States would not be able to defensively respond via article 51 or rule 13.¹⁷⁸ Thus, the United States would have to respond by finding out why the foreign nation wanted to destroy such information and, moreover, the United States might have to destroy the information that was stolen.¹⁷⁹ Moreover, the United States could put political and economic pressure on the foreign country committing this illegal use of force.¹⁸⁰ The UN Charter also would provide the United States with the ability to request the UN’s assistance in properly responding to the attack.¹⁸¹ Alternatively, under the Manual, the United States could choose to take preemptive action via rule 15 in fear of the scale and effects of the destroyed information. Notably, the United States would have to show the immediacy and imminence of the foreign nation’s possible armed attack.¹⁸² Showing this immediacy and imminence would require more facts, but the more liberal attitude of the Manual can be seen in both the analyses of the attack as well as the United States’ ability to respond to this kind of attack\n\nEssentially, the Manual provides a more liberal outlook\n\n¹⁷⁸ See supra Part IV (noting that if it determined an attack constitutes a use of force, the defensive response must be necessary and proportionate).\n\n¹⁷⁹ See id.\n\n¹⁸⁰ See id.\n\n¹⁸¹ See supra Part IV.A.3.\n\n¹⁸² See supra Part.IV.B.4.c.",
    "# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n\non attacks that do not directly and physically damage something or someone, even if there are certain military aspects involved in the attack. While both the UN Charter and the Manual could allow the United States to classify this attack as a use of force—especially given the partial military characteristic of the attack—the Manual more easily provides such a classification and could allow the United States to take more action regarding this attack. In short, this hypothetical provides an example of how the Manual is more adaptive and on-point with attacks that could lead to cyber-warfare.\n\n## 2. ATTACK ON A PURELY CIVILIAN TARGET\n\nThe following fact pattern will present an opportunity to analyze an attack on a purely civilian target: A foreign country attacks the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) that results in the market crashing and/or freezing for a period of time.\n\nUnder the UN Charter, this attack would not constitute a use of force or armed attack. Attacking a country’s economy, while devastating, lacks any sort of military characteristic; thus, the UN Charter’s requirement of military force would not be met.¹⁸³ The United States could attempt to argue that even though the attack lacked any military character, the attack\n\n¹⁸³ See supra Part IV.A.1.\n\nVolume XVIII 2014 296",
    "Volume XVIII 2014\n\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\n\naffected the military somehow. This argument, however, would not be nearly as persuasive in this hypothetical as compared the previous hypothetical because the effect would be quite attenuated. In short, the complete lack of any military force and, seemingly, military effects would prevent the United States from classifying this attack as a use of force or an armed attack under the UN Charter.\n\nOnce again, the Manual provides a more liberal analysis of the attack than the UN Charter. To reiterate, the Manual does not require an attack to be of military character to qualify as a use of force or an armed attack.[184] Thus, only the scale and effects of the attack on the NYSE need to be analyzed—using the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, military character, state involvement, and presumptive legality.[185] The attack would likely be determined as a use of force because of its extended and severe detrimental effects, presumptive illegality, attributable state involvement, and intense invasiveness; however, classifying the attack as an armed attack would be more difficult—given an armed attack is the gravest form of use of force.[186] Nevertheless, the\n\n184 See supra Part. IV.B.1.\n185 See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 49-52 (Cambridge University Press 2013).\n186 See id. (noting that the experts of the Manual were split as to whether",
    "Volume XVIII 2014\n\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\n\nUnited States could point out the importance of the NYSE and the collapse’s grave effect beyond the economy. While this hypothetical presents a controversial and difficult question, I believe the United States would be able to classify this attack as a use of force and an armed attack given the extremely detrimental and lasting effects of crashing the NYSE. The United States would have to deeply analyze each of the factors explained in the Manual to ensure certain prerequisites are met, but the United States would be able to defensively respond via rule 13 to such an attack.¹⁸⁷ Subsequently, the United States would have to properly respond with a proportionate and necessary attack.¹⁸⁸ In sum, under the Manual, such an attack that completely crashes the NYSE would constitute a use of force, and more importantly, an armed attack resulting in the United States’s ability to act in self-defense.\n\n## 3. SUMMARY OF HYPOTHETICAL SITUATIONS\n\nWhile both hypothetical situations seem relatively open for interpretation, there is a major lesson to be learned from the application of the UN Charter, Manual, and in turn, Koh’s speech: cyber-warfare presents an unprecedented\n\nsuch an attack could constitute an armed attack).\n\n¹⁸⁷ See id. at 53-59.\n\n¹⁸⁸ See id. at 59-60.\n\n298",
    "# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n\namount of uncertainty and vagueness in the context of the international laws of war. As seen, when the attack has certain military characteristics, the attack is much easier to define. Unfortunately, cyber-attacks need not and most likely will not be of strict military character, causing the UN Charter to seem obsolete in many situations. Thus, the liberal approach of the Manual functions more efficiently and accurately than that of the UN Charter in the cyber-warfare context. Effectively, each cyber-attack must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis, concentrating on how the scale and effects of the attack affect the government, military, and civilian population.\n\n## VI. Recommendation: A Possible Solution to the Issues in Applying the International Laws of War to Cyber-Warfare\n\nBecause cyber-warfare is a new and evolving medium for warfare, an international convention must occur, and in turn, create an internationally recognized cyber-warfare treaty. While the UN Charter provides a legitimate basis for such a treaty, the UN Charter seems obsolete to handle the intricacies involved in cyber-warfare.¹⁸⁹ The Manual, for the most part, is successful in applying the rules of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but fails at the most critical point: functioning as a binding\n\n¹⁸⁹ See supra Part.V.\n\nVolume XVIII 2014 299",
    "Volume XVIII 2014\n\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\n\nauthority. Instead, it is merely functioning as “suggestions.”¹⁹⁰ Koh, who essentially agrees with the Manual, simply discussed the problems surrounding cyber-warfare, but no solutions whatsoever.¹⁹¹ Therefore, nations from around the world must come together and create binding rules for cyber-warfare before it is too late. In my opinion, the United States should address this problem now and be a leader in creating this treaty.\n\n## A. The Need for an International Convention, and in turn, an Internationally Recognized Cyber-Warfare Treaty\n\nWith the UN Charter and the Manual presenting valuable rules, exceptions to such rules, and recommendations involving all types of warfare—including cyber-warfare—the next step for regulating cyber-warfare is to create a binding international treaty focusing solely on cyber-warfare. For the effective creation of such a treaty, nations from around the world—not just experts in the field—will have to work together during an international convention, in a similar fashion as the creation of the UN Charter. During this convention, I believe the United States should take a progressive stance on this issue and become the world leader in regulating cyber-warfare.\n\n¹⁹⁰ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 16.\n\n¹⁹¹ See supra Part.IV.C.1.",
    "# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n\nRegarding the details of this treaty, different aspects of both the UN Charter and Manual should be used, yet the treaty should also include further provisions. Overall, the treaty should follow the substance of the Manual as it does a remarkable job at applying the UN charter to a cyber-warfare setting. Nevertheless, certain decisions have to be made where the UN Charter and Manual disagree. For example, I believe the treaty should follow the Manual’s usage of the scale and effects test for both use of force and armed attack.¹⁹² However, there needs to be a definition or a sort of sliding scale to quantify the scale and effects of an attack—beyond listing an open set of factors.¹⁹³ Moreover, in accordance with the Manual, there should be no need for military character or death to constitute use of force or an armed attack.¹⁹⁴ While this standard might seem too liberal, the rules regarding self-defense will combat this liberalness by requiring the response to be proportionate and necessary—as both the Manual and UN Charter explain.¹⁹⁵ Notably, the use of examples within the Manual help clarify its rules, with each example explaining certain aspects of the\n\n¹⁹² See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 47-59.\n\n¹⁹³ See id. at 49-52.\n\n¹⁹⁴ See supra Parts IVA.1, IV.B.1.\n\n¹⁹⁵ See e.g., TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 59-60.\n\nVolume XVIII 2014 301",
    "Volume XVIII 2014\n\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\n\nrule; therefore, given the positive affect of these examples, such examples should also be used in this cyber-warfare treaty.¹⁹⁶\n\nThese examples will allow readers to truly understand the rules and, more importantly, their applicability in the real world.\n\nFurthermore, each nation should be forced to present their case to the other members of the treaty before taking action, unless the defensive response is an absolute and immediate necessity.\n\nThis “meeting” will prevent a nation from applying the treaty in any way it sees fit, regardless of the treaty’s true meaning and the beliefs of other countries. Moreover, like the Manual, the treaty should include factor tests whenever answers will not be clear.¹⁹⁷ These factors will allow countries to apply the facts of an attack to numerous factors as opposed to the strict reading of rules. Unlike the Manual, however, one of these factors should involve intent because the intent of an attacking nation should be taken into account when determining whether a country has illegally used force or an armed attack.¹⁹⁸ Lastly, like the UN Charter, the treaty should include some rule or article that provides that members of the treaty shall ensure that non-\n\n¹⁹⁶ See e.g., id. at 55 (giving an example of an attack on a civilian target).\n\n¹⁹⁷ See e.g., id. at 49-52 (noting that this treaty should not be over-dependent on such factor tests).\n\n¹⁹⁸ See id. at 53-59 (noting that the Manual does not consider intent).",
    "Volume XVIII 2014\n\n# THE RULES OF CYBER-WARFARE\n\nmembers still act in accordance with the treaty but only to the extent that is necessary to maintain international peace.¹⁹⁹ This provision would allow the treaty to have a worldwide affect, beyond the countries that signed. The treaty, effectively, will use the Manual’s application of the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but bind of all member-nations to the treaty, much like the UN Charter did with United Nations members.\n\nIn short, some sort of binding action must occur to regulate cyber-warfare, and the United States should be at the forefront of this movement. In regulating cyber-warfare, the ideals and the binding effect of the UN Charter should be applied to cyber-warfare in a similar fashion as the Tallinn Manual. By taking action in this questionable area of law, the United States can ensure its safety now and into the future.\n\n## VII. Conclusion\n\nThe lack of regulations involving cyber-warfare is a growing and real threat. Cyber-warfare might be a confusing and seemingly futuristic concept, but countries from around the world need to address this lack of regulation sooner than\n\n¹⁹⁹ See e.g., U.N. Charter art. 2(6) (“The Organization shall ensure that states which are not Members of the United Nations act in accordance with these Principles so far as may be necessary for the maintenance of international peace and security.”).",
    "# HOLY CROSS JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY\n\nlater. While countries can attempt to apply the UN Charter to cyber-warfare situations, the UN Charter lacks the flexibility and modernization to properly handle the intricacies of cyber-attacks. The UN Charter is undoubtedly effective in handling kinetic warfare; however, it seems obsolete in the cyber-warfare context. Experts in the field recognized this issue and, in response, created the Tallinn Manual, which was effective in applying the UN Charter to cyber-warfare. Nevertheless, the Manual functions simply as a suggestion booklet and provides zero binding rules or regulations. Therefore, the United States needs to take the lead in regulating cyber-warfare. The United States needs to hold an international conference that will produce a binding treaty involving the regulations of cyber-warfare. This treaty should use the Manual’s concepts of applying the UN Charter to cyber-warfare but needs to go further in an attempt to leave as few questions unanswered as possible. While such a task will be difficult, the difficulties in creating a cyber-warfare treaty are minimal compared to the damage that will occur without such regulations.\n\nVolume XVIII 2014\n304"
