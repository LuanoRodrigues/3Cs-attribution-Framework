Looking back at Tallinn's activities over the past decade, there is much for the international community to admire and emulate.\n## Revisiting the Estonian Cyberattacks\nThe 1996 announcement of Project Tiger Leap foreshadowed Estonia's emergence as the most tech-savvy country in Europe through state investment in information and communication technology (ICT).1 By 2007, 60 percent of Estonians were daily Internet users, while 97 percent of banking took place online.2 Additionally, the Estonian national identification card made possible a digital signature for paying taxes, submitting social service requests, and even voting—all entirely over the Internet.3 Tallinn also relied on the Internet for its critical infrastructure, including the power grid and water supply. “E-Estonia” is thus a paradoxical case for understanding contemporary digital security, as beneficial technological advancements opened the door to pronounced strategic vulnerabilities.\nIt is no secret that Estonia-Russia relations are fraught with tension. A former imperial Russian governorate, Estonia won independence from the nascent Soviet Union in 1920, only to face twin occupations in 1940 and 1944, lasting until the USSR dissolved. Moscow ruled with an iron first and relocated hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians to Estonia to “Russify” the state's culture.4 After the Cold War, Tallinn deprived these transplants of opportunities for citizenship, while Russia issued them passports.5 Estonia then joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 2004 to gain protection against Russia and obtained formal Atlantic Alliance defense contingency planning in 2010.6 It even took until 2014 before the two countries adopted a treaty delineating their geopolitical borders.7\nThe intersection of Tallinn's ICT reliance and sour relations with Moscow set the stage for the Bronze Night protests. Following victory in the March 2007 parliamentary elections, the conservative government of Prime Minister Andrus Ansip prepared to relocate Bronze Soldier, a statue commemorating the Soviet liberation of Estonia from the Nazis, on April 30. The plan was to move the memorial—seen as a hallmark of oppression by many Estonians—from Tõnismägi Park in central Tallinn to the secluded Defense Forces Cemetery of Tallinn. Among Estonia's large Russian minority (26 percent of the national population at the time), the move smacked of further ethnic discrimination, prompting large-scale riots from April 27 to 29 and smaller demonstrations thereafter.8 When the dust settled, there were more than 1,300 arrests, one hundred injuries, and one fatality.9\nThis conflict was not simply ethnopolitics and Molotov cocktails—the accompanying cyberattacks were more frightening than the physical riots themselves. For three weeks, “hacktivists” targeted “the government, the president, the parliament, police, banks, Internet service providers (ISPs), online media, as well as many small businesses and local government sites.”10 The culprits took control of computers in Egypt, Russia, and the United States and used them against Estonian servers and routers with email spam and ping and user datagram protocol flooding attacks.11 In this distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, websites normally handling 1,000 hits a day crashed upon receiving 2,000 hits per second.12 Online banking, credit card, and ATM transactions ground to a halt, while government email servers and websites went offline or were defaced.13 Estonian news media websites lost the ability to upload articles, while false\nTEN YEARS AFTER THE ESTONIAN CYBERATTACKS\nRussian-language media reports streamed in describing the destruction of the Bronze Soldier and the graves of Russian veterans.¹⁴ The Estonian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) needed to collaborate with private-sector volunteers; the governments of Finland, Germany, Israel, and Slovenia; and NATO and European Union (EU) institutions to restore normal network operations.¹⁵ This process involved temporary disconnection from international data links, allowing Estonia to “keep communications running domestically” as the CERT repaired infected systems.¹⁶\n## Assessing the Events of April 2007\nDefinitive attribution was unsuccessful owing to the hackers’ ability to control remote networks and hide behind masked Internet protocol (IP) addresses. What is clear is that Russian-language Internet forums urged on the activities.¹⁷ While the Kremlin denied culpability, “Estonian officials like Foreign Minister Urmas Paet quickly accused Russia of perpetrating the attacks, but European Commission and NATO technical experts were unable to find credible evidence of Kremlin participation in the DDoS strikes.”¹⁸ This lack of evidence came despite many experts, including NATO officials, asserting that the attacks were beyond non-state actor capacities.¹⁹ However, Moscow refused to cooperate on attribution, accused Tallinn of human rights violations, and called on Ansip to resign.²⁰ As the DDoS raged on, Russian president Vladimir Putin condemned the Bronze Soldier’s relocation: “Those who desecrate monuments to the heroes of the war are insulting their own people and sowing discord and new distrust between states and people.”²¹ The Kremlin declined to intervene in violent protests outside the Estonian embassy in Moscow,\nwhich even saw an assault on Tallinn’s ambassador.²² In the end, Estonia made a few token arrests, with a single conviction carrying a minor fine.\nWere the cyberattacks successful? Initially, at the time of the attacks, White House cybersecurity official Howard Schmidt said, “Estonia has built their future on having a high-tech government and economy, and they’ve basically been brought to their knees because of these attacks.”²³ But was there any lasting damage? Assessments are hard to come by, but one bank reported estimated losses of $1 million.²⁴ The DDoS strikes did not target Estonian’s electricity, water supply, or military weapon systems; some analysts have thus labeled them as merely disruptive, or as a “cyber riot.”²⁵ While there is validity to this assessment, more extreme actions are not outside of the imagination, as “hacktivists” threatened nation-state sovereignty while coding in the comfort of their workspaces. The 2007 cyberattacks raised considerations about how NATO Article 5 mutual defense guarantees might apply in cyberspace.²⁶ Ultimately, “success” depends on the metric one uses. I visited the Bronze Soldier one cold afternoon in January 2015 at its home—the Defense Forces Cemetery of Tallinn. Although there were some wilting flowers and Russian flags laid at its base, one thing was apparent: If the hackers intended to digitally coerce Estonia, they had abjectly failed. Perhaps this is why we instead now see Russian disinformation campaigns against developed countries like Finland, France, Sweden, and the United States. On the other hand, Estonia was inevitably a training ground for future Russian cyberattacks in Kyrgyzstan and information\nIf the hackers intended to digitally coerce Estonia, they had abjectly failed.\nFALL 2017, VOLUME XVIII, NUMBER III 69\nwarfare—alongside conventional military operations—in Georgia and Ukraine.\n## Estonia's National Cyber Defense: Dense Centralization\nThe events of April 2007 transformed how Estonia approached cyber defense, as the attacks unveiled the specter of threats to the nation's digital society. Building up national defenses to protect against future attacks became a key element of foreign policy, and pursuant to the cabinet's July 2007 Action Plan to Fight Cyber-attacks, Estonia became one of the first countries to adopt a national Cyber Security Strategy.27 The country's first strategy was adopted in 2008 and covered the years 2009--2013, while the current strategy applies to 2014--2017.28 The latter improves on its predecessor and highlights five umbrella goals: Ensuring the protection of information systems underlying important servicesEnhancing the fight against cybercrimeDeveloping national cyber-defense capabilitiesManaging evolving cybersecurity threatsDeveloping develops cross-sectoral activities29\nThese overarching goals have been instrumental in shaping policies to define and combat threats in cyberspace, establishing new capabilities for protecting the Estonian government and society, and creating a broad platform for international collaboration.\nThe defense aspects of Estonian information security involve an array of agencies: the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, Information System Authority, and Police and Border Guard Board, to name a few. For this reason, in 2009, the government established a Cyber Security Council “to contribute to smooth cooperation between various institutions and conduct surveillance over the implementation of the goals of the Cyber Security Strategy.”30 Under council guidance, the revised 2010 Estonian National Security Concept approved by parliament was inclusive of the need to protect vital services from digital threats.31 Some consequent policies were the military's buildup of defensive cyberwarfare capabilities to assist Estonia's CERT and the Information System Authority's efforts to identify service vulnerabilities.32 Meanwhile, the 2009 Emergency Act applies to cyberattacks and calls for emergency preparedness exercises and development of regional and local authorities for incident response.33\nTallinn has not limited its cyberdefense centralization to traditional state capabilities. Its Cyber Security Strategy discusses the role of the Estonian Cyber Defense League (CDL) “to support civilian institutions and protect critical infrastructure in a crisis situation.”34 The CDL is part of the Estonian Defense League (EDL), a voluntary paramilitary organization dating back to 1918 that has been an official component of the Estonian Defense Forces since 1992. The EDL established two regional units of the CDL in Tallinn and Tartu in 2009, which generally consist of private-sector ICT specialists who want to help defend Estonian sovereignty in cyberspace.35 These units have since participated in a variety of exercises with the government and assisted in public outreach. They are ready for mobilization should it be necessary.\nIn addition to looking at malicious activities in cyberspace through a kinetic lens, the Cyber Security Strategy contains several innovative provisions. Among the most interesting is a statement that reads:\n“E-services, processes, and information systems (including digital records of evidential value) that are essential for the digital continuity of the state are constantly updated and mapped, and they have mirror and backup alternatives. Virtual embassies will ensure the functioning of the state, regardless of Estonia's territorial integrity.”36 Tallinn has accordingly initiated talks to essentially host a copy of its state with countries such as Luxembourg and the United Kingdom.37 Even if Estonia faces invasion or a crippling cyberattack, the government is taking steps to ensure its digital survival and sovereignty. Further, the Cyber Security Strategy mandates identification of alternatives for cross-border service provision to secure continuity if hackers sever international supply lines.38\nEven if Estonia faces invasion or a crippling cyberattack, the government is taking steps to ensure its digital survival and sovereignty.\n## Changing Legal Framework: Responsibility, Punishment, Protection\nDefending against cyberattacks is a difficult endeavor, but how does a state investigate and prosecute such criminal activities, especially if the perpetrators operate from within its own borders? Estonia faced obstacles in performing these activities after the 2007 attacks owing to its lack of proper legal authorities and structures for managing incidents in cyberspace. Free societies are not dictatorships that may simply create laws on the fly to meet evolving security challenges. One of the central problems was that Estonian laws prohibited certain surveillance and investigation procedures of suspected crimes if a conviction would result in fewer than three years' imprisonment; at the time, nearly all cybercrimes fell under this umbrella.39 With these limitations and attribution issues, Dmitri Galushkevich, a twenty-year-old ethnic Russian living in Tallinn, was the only perpetrator convicted for the DDoS strikes. Galushkevich received a fine of 17,500 kroons (roughly $1,650 at the time) for blocking the website of Prime Minister Ansip's political party.40 There thus arose a recognition that the country needed more than military hardening to protect itself from hackers. Estonia required a legal framework to deter cyberattacks, but also to identify and punish perpetrators in the event that deterrence failed.\nOne of the most significant changes in Estonian law was the modification of the country's penal code to punish criminal offenses involving computers “that did not clearly seek financial gain.”41 The revised penal code includes a number of sections dealing with cyberattacks and cybercrime. They are not limited to “interference with computer data,” “hindering of functions of computer systems,” “dissemination of spyware, malware or computer viruses,” “preparation of computer-related crime,” or “illegal obtaining of access to computer systems.”42 The code spells out new computer-related criminal offenses, offers stiff sentencing guidelines for digital crimes (including jail time), and paves the way for the Information System Authority to have enhanced powers of surveillance and investigation. Illegal cyberspace activities are also noted among the penal code's list of potential acts of terrorism.43\nWhile the penal code focuses on deterrence, responsibility, and punishment, other legal changes are directed at data protection. For instance, there were updates in information access procedures to the Public Information Act and revisions to the Electronic Communications Act that “establish common security standards” that ISPs must follow.44 Furthermore, the Personal Data\nProtection Act now includes procedures that entities processing Estonians' personal data must abide by when collecting, safeguarding, and using such data.45 The Information System Authority has taken on a regulatory role with respect to these acts, monitoring relevant actors, and imposing sanctions or ordering corrective changes. Altogether, Estonian legal structures developed in the wake of the Bronze Soldier events have influenced and shaped international cyberlaw studies.46\n## Societal Adaptation\nAs the discussion of national defense and legal changes in Estonia indicates, governments often take the lead in proactive and preventive cybersecurity policy. However, state activities alone are insufficient, as protecting against digital threats requires an overarching sense of societal awareness and vigilance. After all, even sensible Internet conduct by young schoolchildren may prevent the spread of Trojans and other malware that may compromise networks. The need for public awareness in a digital society raises the question: Are Estonians aware of threats to their banking system, government service provision, and critical infrastructure? If December 2016 survey data are any indication, the answer is a resounding yes. Respondents to a nationally representative survey ranked the most pressing threat facing Estonia as a cyberattack on the government or society.47 This is most likely due to the events of 2007 and resultant government public awareness campaigns. Today, it is not just the government and CDL volunteers who are concerned about the vitality of Estonia's digital infrastructure—it is society as a whole.\nIn 2014 the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications released its “Digital Agenda 2020 for Estonia.”48 This document recognizes that over 90 percent of Estonians have easy access to broadband Internet and other ICT, with the rate of Internet use at nearly 100 percent among young Estonians.49 The Digital Agenda further notes that more than 20 percent of Estonian exports now come from ICT sources and discusses a bevy of information security training programs at the national, regional, and local levels.50 These programs are designed for school pupils, their parents, teachers, the private sector, and even cybersecurity training instructors. Overall, the agenda showcases a national program to continually train, retrain, and educate the population through government initiatives, public-private partnerships, and societal verification of best practices.\nThe Cyber Security Strategy also points to the role of the Estonian Information Technology Foundation for Education.51 Previously named the Tiger Leap Foundation, this state-funded institute was instrumental in facilitating public awareness of digital technologies during Estonia's information revolution. Now the foundation provides cybersecurity training across all segments of society, whether by incorporating it into coding bootcamps for teenagers or offering courses to the elderly. In consultation with the foundation, the Tallinn University of Technology and Tartu University designed a new master's program in cybersecurity, which accepted its first cohort of students in 2009. Tallinn University of Technology built on this program in 2014, collaborating with Estonia's 2CENTRE Cybercrime Center of Excellence to stand up a postgraduate degree program in digital forensics.52 These educational opportunities help to ensure that the country and neighboring states have a cadre of well-equipped cybersecurity professionals.\n## International Collaboration and Outreach\nDigital interconnectivity means that computer issues do not stop at geopolitical borders, which is why international collaboration is a necessity.53 Much of Estonia's cooperation has taken place alongside its NATO partners, some of whom provided CERT assistance during the 2007 cyberattacks. In the aftermath of these events, there were conversations about extending Article 5 security guarantees to cyberattacks.54 Tallinn supported the Atlantic Alliance's decision to instead include—in its 2010 Strategic Concept—digital aggressions as actions that might warrant consultation under Article 4 of the Washington Treaty.55 Estonian experts have also taken on leadership roles in NATO's Brussels-based Cyber Defense Management Authority (CDMA), and Tallinn has hosted the organization's Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) since August 2008. The CCDCOE serves as NATO's focal point for cooperation, data exchange, and research on cybersecurity. The center has done everything from organizing conferences of practitioners and academics, to publishing the notable Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyberwarfare, to planning the annual Locked Shields exercises. The latest Locked Shields iteration in April 2017 involved 800 cybersecurity specialists from 25 countries participating in a real-time simulation of more than 2,500 cyberattacks.56\nSimilarly, Estonia has pushed for further attention to ICT security within the EU system. These initiatives have included increased funding for the EU Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA), which has provided capacity-building training, produced joint exercises for member states, and supported the development of the EU's 2013 Cybersecurity Strategy.57 This year, the EU will review ENISA's mandate and will likely draft a revised cybersecurity strategy. In 2012 the EU established its European Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security, and Justice (eu-LISA). The Estonian government was a strong advocate for creating the eu-LISA, which manages organizational databases on justice and homeland affairs (most notably the Schengen Information System). Tallinn hosts the eu-LISA headquarters.\nEstonia's collaborative cybersecurity efforts include outreach and partnerships beyond its traditional European and transatlantic partnerships. This is based on a statement in the state's Cyber Security Strategy: “Through cooperation, Estonia promotes global cybersecurity and enhances its own competence.”58 Activities embodying this commitment include working with the “Association of Southeast Asian Nations in promoting the harmonization of laws concerning cyber crime” and creating the e-Governance Academy (eGA) think tank and consultancy.59 The eGA has provided training on best practices in paperless government and information security to more than 3,500 experts from over sixty countries, ranging from Azerbaijan to Benin.60 Estonian universities have also chosen English as the language of instruction in postgraduate cybersecurity courses, thereby attracting international students.\n## Learning from Estonia\nThe April 2007 DDoS attacks forever changed Estonia's path in the digital age. A small Baltic state, Estonia is counting on ICT for its prosperity, and its government has made one of its core missions the pursuit of safe, secure, and profitable use of technol\nogies in cyberspace. This article has covered many, but not all, complementary Estonian initiatives to protect its government and people from repetition of the 2007 events. From cyber militia to virtual embassies, no country is quite like Estonia in the information security realm.\nHave these activities facilitated a safer digital environment for Estonians? That is a tough question. Lloyd's of London reported that cybercrimes resulted in over $400 billion of global economic losses in 2015, with Juniper Research predicting such losses will balloon to $2.1 trillion by 2019.61 These staggering figures do not even attempt to encompass damages from politically motivated cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism. To date, Estonia's impressive variety of programs has produced a culture of cyber best practices, hardened the country against attacks, and developed resources for incident response. Tallinn has also performed exceptionally well in EU and NATO cybersecurity simulations. Still, deterrence is an exercise in unobserved counterfactuals and assigning values to probabilistic events. We may not truly understand the efficacy of Estonia's cybersecurity programs until they are put to the test in real world crises. Routine disruptions of Georgian military communications and hacks on the Ukrainian power grid indicate that such field testing may not be such a distant pipedream.\nWe may not truly understand the efficacy of Estonia's cybersecurity programs until they are put to the test in real world crises.\nBy its nature, cyberwarfare carries complications somewhat unlike those of conventional and nuclear military operations. Academics, governments, and international organizations have struggled to develop theories of deterrence in a domain with attribution problems, largely unknowable capabilities, and the power of highly asymmetric forces to inflict pain and punishment. Regardless, a number of notable scholars have argued fairly convincingly that cyberwarfare is either unlikely to occur or is of lesser importance than traditional elements of grand strategy.62 Until new, unified theories of cybersecurity emerge, states will likely focus on classic considerations of deterrence and dissuasion: punishment, denial, entanglement/interdependence, and international norms.63 If these are the ideal criteria, Estonia has indeed made admirable strides on all fronts of cyberdeterrence and dissuasion.\nThe Estonian case demonstrates both the potential severity of digital threats, as well as responses that states may take to safeguard against future cyberattacks. Few countries have pursued the breadth and depth of steps in the direction of Internet security that Estonia has in the wake of the April 2007 DDoS strikes. NATO has yet to develop an organization-wide cybersecurity strategy, and the United States does not have a macro-level policy or strategy for cyberdeterrence. When countering digital threats, states must first have a concrete strategy. Then, such a strategy will guide tailored national defense efforts, legal modifications, societal adaptation, and international partnerships. In the future, businesses, militaries, and civilian governments will inevitably depend increasingly on cyberspace, drawing attention to the importance of securing critical infrastructure. Clearly, it would be a mistake to conceive of information security as an issue confined to Twitter botnets, the latest WikiLeaks document dump, or “fake news” websites.\nEstonia is a first mover among states in taking steps to minimize threats to its diverse array of digital infrastructure. Coun\nTEN YEARS AFTER THE ESTONIAN CYBERATTACKS\ntries spanning the globe would do well to study aspects of the Estonian template when forming cybersecurity policy and strategy.⁶⁴",

What is clear is that Russian-language Internet forums urged on the activities.¹⁷ While the Kremlin denied culpability, “Estonian officials like Foreign Minister Urmas Paet quickly accused Russia of perpetrating the attacks, but European Commission and NATO technical experts were unable to find credible evidence of Kremlin participation in the DDoS strikes.”¹⁸ This lack of evidence came despite many experts, including NATO officials, asserting that the attacks were beyond non-state actor capacities.¹⁹ However, Moscow refused to cooperate on attribution, accused Tallinn of human rights violations, and called on Ansip to resign.²⁰ As the DDoS raged on, Russian president Vladimir Putin condemned the Bronze Soldier’s relocation: “Those who desecrate monuments to the heroes of the war are insulting their own people and sowing discord and new distrust between states and people.”²¹ The Kremlin declined to intervene in violent protests outside the Estonian embassy in Moscow, which even saw an assault on Tallinn’s ambassador.²² In the end, Estonia made a few token arrests, with a single conviction carrying a minor fine.\nWere the cyberattacks successful? Initially, at the time of the attacks, White House cybersecurity official Howard Schmidt said, “Estonia has built their future on having a high-tech government and economy, and they’ve basically been brought to their knees because of these attacks.”²³ But was there any lasting damage? Assessments are hard to come by, but one bank reported estimated losses of $1 million.²⁴ The DDoS strikes did not target Estonian’s electricity, water supply, or military weapon systems; some analysts have thus labeled them as merely disruptive, or as a “cyber riot.”²⁵ While there is validity to this assessment, more extreme actions are not outside of the imagination, as “hacktivists” threatened nation-state sovereignty while coding in the comfort of their workspaces. The 2007 cyberattacks raised considerations about how NATO Article 5 mutual defense guarantees might apply in cyberspace.²⁶ Ultimately, “success” depends on the metric one uses. I visited the Bronze Soldier one cold afternoon in January 2015 at its home—the Defense Forces Cemetery of Tallinn. Although there were some wilting flowers and Russian flags laid at its base, one thing was apparent: If the hackers intended to digitally coerce Estonia, they had abjectly failed. Perhaps this is why we instead now see Russian disinformation campaigns against developed countries like Finland, France, Sweden, and the United States. On the other hand, Estonia was inevitably a training ground for future Russian cyberattacks in Kyrgyzstan and information If the hackers intended to digitally coerce Estonia, they had abjectly failed.\nFALL 2017, VOLUME XVIII, NUMBER III 69 warfare—alongside conventional military operations—in Georgia and Ukraine.\n## Estonia's National Cyber Defense: Dense Centralization The events of April 2007 transformed how Estonia approached cyber defense, as the attacks unveiled the specter of threats to the nation's digital society. Building up national defenses to protect against future attacks became a key element of foreign policy, and pursuant to the cabinet's July 2007 Action Plan to Fight Cyber-attacks, Estonia became one of the first countries to adopt a national Cyber Security Strategy.27 The country's first strategy was adopted in 2008 and covered the years 2009--2013, while the current strategy applies to 2014--2017.28 The latter improves on its predecessor and highlights five umbrella goals: Ensuring the protection of information systems underlying important servicesEnhancing the fight against cybercrimeDeveloping national cyber-defense capabilitiesManaging evolving cybersecurity threatsDeveloping develops cross-sectoral activities29 These overarching goals have been instrumental in shaping policies to define and combat threats in cyberspace, establishing new capabilities for protecting the Estonian government and society, and creating a broad platform for international collaboration.\nThe defense aspects of Estonian information security involve an array of agencies: the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, Information System Authority, and Police and Border Guard Board, to name a few. For this reason, in 2009, the government established a Cyber Security Council “to contribute to smooth cooperation between various institutions and conduct surveillance over the implementation of the goals of the Cyber Security Strategy.”30 Under council guidance, the revised 2010 Estonian National Security Concept approved by parliament was inclusive of the need to protect vital services from digital threats.31 Some consequent policies were the military's buildup of defensive cyberwarfare capabilities to assist Estonia's CERT and the Information System Authority's efforts to identify service vulnerabilities.32 Meanwhile, the 2009 Emergency Act applies to cyberattacks and calls for emergency preparedness exercises and development of regional and local authorities for incident response.33 Tallinn has not limited its cyberdefense centralization to traditional state capabilities. Its Cyber Security Strategy discusses the role of the Estonian Cyber Defense League (CDL) “to support civilian institutions and protect critical infrastructure in a crisis situation.”34 The CDL is part of the Estonian Defense League (EDL), a voluntary paramilitary organization dating back to 1918 that has been an official component of the Estonian Defense Forces since 1992. The EDL established two regional units of the CDL in Tallinn and Tartu in 2009, which generally consist of private-sector ICT specialists who want to help defend Estonian sovereignty in cyberspace.35 These units have since participated in a variety of exercises with the government and assisted in public outreach. They are ready for mobilization should it be necessary.\nIn addition to looking at malicious activities in cyberspace through a kinetic lens, the Cyber Security Strategy contains several innovative provisions. Among the most interesting is a statement that reads: “E-services, processes, and information systems (including digital records of evidential value) that are essential for the digital continuity of the state are constantly updated and mapped, and they have mirror and backup alternatives. Virtual embassies will ensure the functioning of the state, regardless of Estonia's territorial integrity.”36 Tallinn has accordingly initiated talks to essentially host a copy of its state with countries such as Luxembourg and the United Kingdom.37 Even if Estonia faces invasion or a crippling cyberattack, the government is taking steps to ensure its digital survival and sovereignty. Further, the Cyber Security Strategy mandates identification of alternatives for cross-border service provision to secure continuity if hackers sever international supply lines.38 Even if Estonia faces invasion or a crippling cyberattack, the government is taking steps to ensure its digital survival and sovereignty.\n## Changing Legal Framework: Responsibility, Punishment, Protection Defending against cyberattacks is a difficult endeavor, but how does a state investigate and prosecute such criminal activities, especially if the perpetrators operate from within its own borders? Estonia faced obstacles in performing these activities after the 2007 attacks owing to its lack of proper legal authorities and structures for managing incidents in cyberspace. Free societies are not dictatorships that may simply create laws on the fly to meet evolving security challenges. One of the central problems was that Estonian laws prohibited certain surveillance and investigation procedures of suspected crimes if a conviction would result in fewer than three years' imprisonment; at the time, nearly all cybercrimes fell under this umbrella.39 With these limitations and attribution issues, Dmitri Galushkevich, a twenty-year-old ethnic Russian living in Tallinn, was the only perpetrator convicted for the DDoS strikes. Galushkevich received a fine of 17,500 kroons (roughly $1,650 at the time) for blocking the website of Prime Minister Ansip's political party.40 There thus arose a recognition that the country needed more than military hardening to protect itself from hackers. Estonia required a legal framework to deter cyberattacks, but also to identify and punish perpetrators in the event that deterrence failed.\nOne of the most significant changes in Estonian law was the modification of the country's penal code to punish criminal offenses involving computers “that did not clearly seek financial gain.”41 The revised penal code includes a number of sections dealing with cyberattacks and cybercrime. They are not limited to “interference with computer data,” “hindering of functions of computer systems,” “dissemination of spyware, malware or computer viruses,” “preparation of computer-related crime,” or “illegal obtaining of access to computer systems.”42 The code spells out new computer-related criminal offenses, offers stiff sentencing guidelines for digital crimes (including jail time), and paves the way for the Information System Authority to have enhanced powers of surveillance and investigation. Illegal cyberspace activities are also noted among the penal code's list of potential acts of terrorism.43 While the penal code focuses on deterrence, responsibility, and punishment, other legal changes are directed at data protection. For instance, there were updates in information access procedures to the Public Information Act and revisions to the Electronic Communications Act that “establish common security standards” that ISPs must follow.44 Furthermore, the Personal Data Protection Act now includes procedures that entities processing Estonians' personal data must abide by when collecting, safeguarding, and using such data.45 The Information System Authority has taken on a regulatory role with respect to these acts, monitoring relevant actors, and imposing sanctions or ordering corrective changes. Altogether, Estonian legal structures developed in the wake of the Bronze Soldier events have influenced and shaped international cyberlaw studies.46 ## Societal Adaptation As the discussion of national defense and legal changes in Estonia indicates, governments often take the lead in proactive and preventive cybersecurity policy. However, state activities alone are insufficient, as protecting against digital threats requires an overarching sense of societal awareness and vigilance. After all, even sensible Internet conduct by young schoolchildren may prevent the spread of Trojans and other malware that may compromise networks. The need for public awareness in a digital society raises the question: Are Estonians aware of threats to their banking system, government service provision, and critical infrastructure? If December 2016 survey data are any indication, the answer is a resounding yes. Respondents to a nationally representative survey ranked the most pressing threat facing Estonia as a cyberattack on the government or society.47 This is most likely due to the events of 2007 and resultant government public awareness campaigns. Today, it is not just the government and CDL volunteers who are concerned about the vitality of Estonia's digital infrastructure—it is society as a whole.\nIn 2014 the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications released its “Digital Agenda 2020 for Estonia.”48 This document recognizes that over 90 percent of Estonians have easy access to broadband Internet and other ICT, with the rate of Internet use at nearly 100 percent among young Estonians.49 The Digital Agenda further notes that more than 20 percent of Estonian exports now come from ICT sources and discusses a bevy of information security training programs at the national, regional, and local levels.50 These programs are designed for school pupils, their parents, teachers, the private sector, and even cybersecurity training instructors. Overall, the agenda showcases a national program to continually train, retrain, and educate the population through government initiatives, public-private partnerships, and societal verification of best practices.\nThe Cyber Security Strategy also points to the role of the Estonian Information Technology Foundation for Education.51 Previously named the Tiger Leap Foundation, this state-funded institute was instrumental in facilitating public awareness of digital technologies during Estonia's information revolution. Now the foundation provides cybersecurity training across all segments of society, whether by incorporating it into coding bootcamps for teenagers or offering courses to the elderly. In consultation with the foundation, the Tallinn University of Technology and Tartu University designed a new master's program in cybersecurity, which accepted its first cohort of students in 2009. Tallinn University of Technology built on this program in 2014, collaborating with Estonia's 2CENTRE Cybercrime Center of Excellence to stand up a postgraduate degree program in digital forensics.52 These educational opportunities help to ensure that the country and neighboring states have a cadre of well-equipped cybersecurity professionals.\n## International Collaboration and Outreach Digital interconnectivity means that computer issues do not stop at geopolitical borders, which is why international collaboration is a necessity.53 Much of Estonia's cooperation has taken place alongside its NATO partners, some of whom provided CERT assistance during the 2007 cyberattacks. In the aftermath of these events, there were conversations about extending Article 5 security guarantees to cyberattacks.54 Tallinn supported the Atlantic Alliance's decision to instead include—in its 2010 Strategic Concept—digital aggressions as actions that might warrant consultation under Article 4 of the Washington Treaty.55 Estonian experts have also taken on leadership roles in NATO's Brussels-based Cyber Defense Management Authority (CDMA), and Tallinn has hosted the organization's Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) since August 2008. The CCDCOE serves as NATO's focal point for cooperation, data exchange, and research on cybersecurity. The center has done everything from organizing conferences of practitioners and academics, to publishing the notable Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyberwarfare, to planning the annual Locked Shields exercises. The latest Locked Shields iteration in April 2017 involved 800 cybersecurity specialists from 25 countries participating in a real-time simulation of more than 2,500 cyberattacks.56 Similarly, Estonia has pushed for further attention to ICT security within the EU system. These initiatives have included increased funding for the EU Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA), which has provided capacity-building training, produced joint exercises for member states, and supported the development of the EU's 2013 Cybersecurity Strategy.57 This year, the EU will review ENISA's mandate and will likely draft a revised cybersecurity strategy. In 2012 the EU established its European Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security, and Justice (eu-LISA). The Estonian government was a strong advocate for creating the eu-LISA, which manages organizational databases on justice and homeland affairs (most notably the Schengen Information System). Tallinn hosts the eu-LISA headquarters.\nEstonia's collaborative cybersecurity efforts include outreach and partnerships beyond its traditional European and transatlantic partnerships. This is based on a statement in the state's Cyber Security Strategy: “Through cooperation, Estonia promotes global cybersecurity and enhances its own competence.”58 Activities embodying this commitment include working with the “Association of Southeast Asian Nations in promoting the harmonization of laws concerning cyber crime” and creating the e-Governance Academy (eGA) think tank and consultancy.59 The eGA has provided training on best practices in paperless government and information security to more than 3,500 experts from over sixty countries, ranging from Azerbaijan to Benin.60 Estonian universities have also chosen English as the language of instruction in postgraduate cybersecurity courses, thereby attracting international students.\n## Learning from Estonia The April 2007 DDoS attacks forever changed Estonia's path in the digital age. A small Baltic state, Estonia is counting on ICT for its prosperity, and its government has made one of its core missions the pursuit of safe, secure, and profitable use of technol ogies in cyberspace. This article has covered many, but not all, complementary Estonian initiatives to protect its government and people from repetition of the 2007 events. From cyber militia to virtual embassies, no country is quite like Estonia in the information security realm.\nHave these activities facilitated a safer digital environment for Estonians? That is a tough question. Lloyd's of London reported that cybercrimes resulted in over $400 billion of global economic losses in 2015, with Juniper Research predicting such losses will balloon to $2.1 trillion by 2019.61 These staggering figures do not even attempt to encompass damages from politically motivated cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism. To date, Estonia's impressive variety of programs has produced a culture of cyber best practices, hardened the country against attacks, and developed resources for incident response. Tallinn has also performed exceptionally well in EU and NATO cybersecurity simulations. Still, deterrence is an exercise in unobserved counterfactuals and assigning values to probabilistic events. We may not truly understand the efficacy of Estonia's cybersecurity programs until they are put to the test in real world crises. Routine disruptions of Georgian military communications and hacks on the Ukrainian power grid indicate that such field testing may not be such a distant pipedream.\nWe may not truly understand the efficacy of Estonia's cybersecurity programs until they are put to the test in real world crises.\nBy its nature, cyberwarfare carries complications somewhat unlike those of conventional and nuclear military operations. Academics, governments, and international organizations have struggled to develop theories of deterrence in a domain with attribution problems, largely unknowable capabilities, and the power of highly asymmetric forces to inflict pain and punishment. Regardless, a number of notable scholars have argued fairly convincingly that cyberwarfare is either unlikely to occur or is of lesser importance than traditional elements of grand strategy.62 Until new, unified theories of cybersecurity emerge, states will likely focus on classic considerations of deterrence and dissuasion: punishment, denial, entanglement/interdependence, and international norms.63 If these are the ideal criteria, Estonia has indeed made admirable strides on all fronts of cyberdeterrence and dissuasion.\nThe Estonian case demonstrates both the potential severity of digital threats, as well as responses that states may take to safeguard against future cyberattacks. Few countries have pursued the breadth and depth of steps in the direction of Internet security that Estonia has in the wake of the April 2007 DDoS strikes. NATO has yet to develop an organization-wide cybersecurity strategy, and the United States does not have a macro-level policy or strategy for cyberdeterrence. When countering digital threats, states must first have a concrete strategy. Then, such a strategy will guide tailored national defense efforts, legal modifications, societal adaptation, and international partnerships. In the future, businesses, militaries, and civilian governments will inevitably depend increasingly on cyberspace, drawing attention to the importance of securing critical infrastructure. Clearly, it would be a mistake to conceive of information security as an issue confined to Twitter botnets, the latest WikiLeaks document dump, or “fake news” websites.\nEstonia is a first mover among states in taking steps to minimize threats to its diverse array of digital infrastructure. Coun TEN YEARS AFTER THE ESTONIAN CYBERATTACKS tries spanning the globe would do well to study aspects of the Estonian template when forming cybersecurity policy and strategy.⁶⁴",

Much has changed in terms of public awareness, political and corporate discourse, and the availability of policy and academic literature. From the Clinton and Macron hacks, to allegations of Russian-controlled Twitterbots spreading “fake news,” to the WannaCry ransomware attacks, threats emanating from the Internet have gone mainstream. But has the media attention given to political disinformation campaigns, digital vandalism, and industrial espionage come at a cost? Have we simply forgotten that anonymous and sophisticated hackers—often employed or supported by states—may have the ability to threaten power grids, online banking, and strategic weapon systems?\nTen years ago, the small Baltic state of Estonia fell victim to a state-sanctioned, or state-sponsored, cyberattack by Russian hackers. The 2007 strikes on Estonia were comparatively different than other incidents involving state actors. Titan Rain entailed coordinated cyberespionage of Chinese origin on US government information systems. The Stuxnet worm unleashed a precision attack on Iran’s centrifuges for uranium enrichment at the Natanz nuclear facility. And the North Korean hacks on Sony inflicted punitive damage on the Sony Corporation for its cinematic depiction of Kim Jong-un. In sharp contrast, what happened in Estonia was a gateway attack; by disabling services used by nearly all Estonians, the hackers gave the world a preview of the future extremes of cyberwarfare. While it is overblown to refer to what happened in Estonia as full-fledged cyberwar, the attacks raised the specter of digital targeting of a state’s critical infrastructure. It is this chilling possibility that prompted a multitude of complementary initiatives by Estonia to protect its population from a cyber redux.\n&gt; Ten years ago, the small Baltic state of Estonia fell victim to a state-sanctioned, or state-sponsored, cyberattack by Russian hackers.\nThis article explores the Estonian government’s efforts to safeguard their state from a future cyberattack of an equivalent or greater magnitude than the 2007 hacking. After reviewing the events of 2007, I discuss four different policy arenas: national cyber defense, legal modifications, societal adaptation, and international collaboration. I argue that the changing nature of Estonia’s national capabilities and readiness to counter disruptive Internet strikes sets the global FALL 2017, VOLUME XVIII, NUMBER III 67 standard.

A former imperial Russian governorate, Estonia won independence from the nascent Soviet Union in 1920, only to face twin occupations in 1940 and 1944, lasting until the USSR dissolved. Moscow ruled with an iron first and relocated hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians to Estonia to “Russify” the state's culture.4 After the Cold War, Tallinn deprived these transplants of opportunities for citizenship, while Russia issued them passports.5 Estonia then joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 2004 to gain protection against Russia and obtained formal Atlantic Alliance defense contingency planning in 2010.6 It even took until 2014 before the two countries adopted a treaty delineating their geopolitical borders.7 The intersection of Tallinn's ICT reliance and sour relations with Moscow set the stage for the Bronze Night protests. Following victory in the March 2007 parliamentary elections, the conservative government of Prime Minister Andrus Ansip prepared to relocate Bronze Soldier, a statue commemorating the Soviet liberation of Estonia from the Nazis, on April 30. The plan was to move the memorial—seen as a hallmark of oppression by many Estonians—from Tõnismägi Park in central Tallinn to the secluded Defense Forces Cemetery of Tallinn. Among Estonia's large Russian minority (26 percent of the national population at the time), the move smacked of further ethnic discrimination, prompting large-scale riots from April 27 to 29 and smaller demonstrations thereafter.8 When the dust settled, there were more than 1,300 arrests, one hundred injuries, and one fatality.9 This conflict was not simply ethnopolitics and Molotov cocktails—the accompanying cyberattacks were more frightening than the physical riots themselves.

What is clear is that Russian-language Internet forums urged on the activities.¹⁷ While the Kremlin denied culpability, “Estonian officials like Foreign Minister Urmas Paet quickly accused Russia of perpetrating the attacks, but European Commission and NATO technical experts were unable to find credible evidence of Kremlin participation in the DDoS strikes.”¹⁸ This lack of evidence came despite many experts, including NATO officials, asserting that the attacks were beyond non-state actor capacities.¹⁹ However, Moscow refused to cooperate on attribution, accused Tallinn of human rights violations, and called on Ansip to resign.²⁰ As the DDoS raged on, Russian president Vladimir Putin condemned the Bronze Soldier’s relocation: “Those who desecrate monuments to the heroes of the war are insulting their own people and sowing discord and new distrust between states and people.”²¹ The Kremlin declined to intervene in violent protests outside the Estonian embassy in Moscow, which even saw an assault on Tallinn’s ambassador.²² In the end, Estonia made a few token arrests, with a single conviction carrying a minor fine.\nWere the cyberattacks successful? Initially, at the time of the attacks, White House cybersecurity official Howard Schmidt said, “Estonia has built their future on having a high-tech government and economy, and they’ve basically been brought to their knees because of these attacks.”²³ But was there any lasting damage? Assessments are hard to come by, but one bank reported estimated losses of $1 million.²⁴ The DDoS strikes did not target Estonian’s electricity, water supply, or military weapon systems; some analysts have thus labeled them as merely disruptive, or as a “cyber riot.”²⁵ While there is validity to this assessment, more extreme actions are not outside of the imagination, as “hacktivists” threatened nation-state sovereignty while coding in the comfort of their workspaces. The 2007 cyberattacks raised considerations about how NATO Article 5 mutual defense guarantees might apply in cyberspace.²⁶ Ultimately, “success” depends on the metric one uses. I visited the Bronze Soldier one cold afternoon in January 2015 at its home—the Defense Forces Cemetery of Tallinn. Although there were some wilting flowers and Russian flags laid at its base, one thing was apparent: If the hackers intended to digitally coerce Estonia, they had abjectly failed. Perhaps this is why we instead now see Russian disinformation campaigns against developed countries like Finland, France, Sweden, and the United States. On the other hand, Estonia was inevitably a training ground for future Russian cyberattacks in Kyrgyzstan and information If the hackers intended to digitally coerce Estonia, they had abjectly failed.\nFALL 2017, VOLUME XVIII, NUMBER III 69 warfare—alongside conventional military operations—in Georgia and Ukraine.",
    "## Estonia's National Cyber Defense: Dense Centralization The events of April 2007 transformed how Estonia approached cyber defense, as the attacks unveiled the specter of threats to the nation's digital society. Building up national defenses to protect against future attacks became a key element of foreign policy, and pursuant to the cabinet's July 2007 Action Plan to Fight Cyber-attacks, Estonia became one of the first countries to adopt a national Cyber Security Strategy.27 The country's first strategy was adopted in 2008 and covered the years 2009--2013, while the current strategy applies to 2014--2017.28 The latter improves on its predecessor and highlights five umbrella goals: Ensuring the protection of information systems underlying important servicesEnhancing the fight against cybercrimeDeveloping national cyber-defense capabilitiesManaging evolving cybersecurity threatsDeveloping develops cross-sectoral activities29 These overarching goals have been instrumental in shaping policies to define and combat threats in cyberspace, establishing new capabilities for protecting the Estonian government and society, and creating a broad platform for international collaboration.": "The defense aspects of Estonian information security involve an array of agencies: the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, Information System Authority, and Police and Border Guard Board, to name a few. For this reason, in 2009, the government established a Cyber Security Council “to contribute to smooth cooperation between various institutions and conduct surveillance over the implementation of the goals of the Cyber Security Strategy.”30 Under council guidance, the revised 2010 Estonian National Security Concept approved by parliament was inclusive of the need to protect vital services from digital threats.31 Some consequent policies were the military's buildup of defensive cyberwarfare capabilities to assist Estonia's CERT and the Information System Authority's efforts to identify service vulnerabilities.32 Meanwhile, the 2009 Emergency Act applies to cyberattacks and calls for emergency preparedness exercises and development of regional and local authorities for incident response.33 Tallinn has not limited its cyberdefense centralization to traditional state capabilities. Its Cyber Security Strategy discusses the role of the Estonian Cyber Defense League (CDL) “to support civilian institutions and protect critical infrastructure in a crisis situation.”34 The CDL is part of the Estonian Defense League (EDL), a voluntary paramilitary organization dating back to 1918 that has been an official component of the Estonian Defense Forces since 1992. The EDL established two regional units of the CDL in Tallinn and Tartu in 2009, which generally consist of private-sector ICT specialists who want to help defend Estonian sovereignty in cyberspace.35 These units have since participated in a variety of exercises with the government and assisted in public outreach. They are ready for mobilization should it be necessary.\nIn addition to looking at malicious activities in cyberspace through a kinetic lens, the Cyber Security Strategy contains several innovative provisions. Among the most interesting is a statement that reads: “E-services, processes, and information systems (including digital records of evidential value) that are essential for the digital continuity of the state are constantly updated and mapped, and they have mirror and backup alternatives. Virtual embassies will ensure the functioning of the state, regardless of Estonia's territorial integrity.”36 Tallinn has accordingly initiated talks to essentially host a copy of its state with countries such as Luxembourg and the United Kingdom.37 Even if Estonia faces invasion or a crippling cyberattack, the government is taking steps to ensure its digital survival and sovereignty. Further, the Cyber Security Strategy mandates identification of alternatives for cross-border service provision to secure continuity if hackers sever international supply lines.38 Even if Estonia faces invasion or a crippling cyberattack, the government is taking steps to ensure its digital survival and sovereignty.",
    "## Changing Legal Framework: Responsibility, Punishment, Protection Defending against cyberattacks is a difficult endeavor, but how does a state investigate and prosecute such criminal activities, especially if the perpetrators operate from within its own borders? Estonia faced obstacles in performing these activities after the 2007 attacks owing to its lack of proper legal authorities and structures for managing incidents in cyberspace. Free societies are not dictatorships that may simply create laws on the fly to meet evolving security challenges. One of the central problems was that Estonian laws prohibited certain surveillance and investigation procedures of suspected crimes if a conviction would result in fewer than three years' imprisonment; at the time, nearly all cybercrimes fell under this umbrella.39 With these limitations and attribution issues, Dmitri Galushkevich, a twenty-year-old ethnic Russian living in Tallinn, was the only perpetrator convicted for the DDoS strikes. Galushkevich received a fine of 17,500 kroons (roughly $1,650 at the time) for blocking the website of Prime Minister Ansip's political party.40 There thus arose a recognition that the country needed more than military hardening to protect itself from hackers. Estonia required a legal framework to deter cyberattacks, but also to identify and punish perpetrators in the event that deterrence failed.": "One of the most significant changes in Estonian law was the modification of the country's penal code to punish criminal offenses involving computers “that did not clearly seek financial gain.”41 The revised penal code includes a number of sections dealing with cyberattacks and cybercrime. They are not limited to “interference with computer data,” “hindering of functions of computer systems,” “dissemination of spyware, malware or computer viruses,” “preparation of computer-related crime,” or “illegal obtaining of access to computer systems.”42 The code spells out new computer-related criminal offenses, offers stiff sentencing guidelines for digital crimes (including jail time), and paves the way for the Information System Authority to have enhanced powers of surveillance and investigation. Illegal cyberspace activities are also noted among the penal code's list of potential acts of terrorism.43 While the penal code focuses on deterrence, responsibility, and punishment, other legal changes are directed at data protection. For instance, there were updates in information access procedures to the Public Information Act and revisions to the Electronic Communications Act that “establish common security standards” that ISPs must follow.44 Furthermore, the Personal Data Protection Act now includes procedures that entities processing Estonians' personal data must abide by when collecting, safeguarding, and using such data.45 The Information System Authority has taken on a regulatory role with respect to these acts, monitoring relevant actors, and imposing sanctions or ordering corrective changes. Altogether, Estonian legal structures developed in the wake of the Bronze Soldier events have influenced and shaped international cyberlaw studies.46 ## Societal Adaptation As the discussion of national defense and legal changes in Estonia indicates, governments often take the lead in proactive and preventive cybersecurity policy. However, state activities alone are insufficient, as protecting against digital threats requires an overarching sense of societal awareness and vigilance. After all, even sensible Internet conduct by young schoolchildren may prevent the spread of Trojans and other malware that may compromise networks. The need for public awareness in a digital society raises the question: Are Estonians aware of threats to their banking system, government service provision, and critical infrastructure? If December 2016 survey data are any indication, the answer is a resounding yes. Respondents to a nationally representative survey ranked the most pressing threat facing Estonia as a cyberattack on the government or society.47 This is most likely due to the events of 2007 and resultant government public awareness campaigns. Today, it is not just the government and CDL volunteers who are concerned about the vitality of Estonia's digital infrastructure—it is society as a whole.\nIn 2014 the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications released its “Digital Agenda 2020 for Estonia.”48 This document recognizes that over 90 percent of Estonians have easy access to broadband Internet and other ICT, with the rate of Internet use at nearly 100 percent among young Estonians.49 The Digital Agenda further notes that more than 20 percent of Estonian exports now come from ICT sources and discusses a bevy of information security training programs at the national, regional, and local levels.50 These programs are designed for school pupils, their parents, teachers, the private sector, and even cybersecurity training instructors. Overall, the agenda showcases a national program to continually train, retrain, and educate the population through government initiatives, public-private partnerships, and societal verification of best practices.\nThe Cyber Security Strategy also points to the role of the Estonian Information Technology Foundation for Education.51 Previously named the Tiger Leap Foundation, this state-funded institute was instrumental in facilitating public awareness of digital technologies during Estonia's information revolution. Now the foundation provides cybersecurity training across all segments of society, whether by incorporating it into coding bootcamps for teenagers or offering courses to the elderly. In consultation with the foundation, the Tallinn University of Technology and Tartu University designed a new master's program in cybersecurity, which accepted its first cohort of students in 2009. Tallinn University of Technology built on this program in 2014, collaborating with Estonia's 2CENTRE Cybercrime Center of Excellence to stand up a postgraduate degree program in digital forensics.52 These educational opportunities help to ensure that the country and neighboring states have a cadre of well-equipped cybersecurity professionals.",
    "## International Collaboration and Outreach Digital interconnectivity means that computer issues do not stop at geopolitical borders, which is why international collaboration is a necessity.53 Much of Estonia's cooperation has taken place alongside its NATO partners, some of whom provided CERT assistance during the 2007 cyberattacks. In the aftermath of these events, there were conversations about extending Article 5 security guarantees to cyberattacks.54 Tallinn supported the Atlantic Alliance's decision to instead include—in its 2010 Strategic Concept—digital aggressions as actions that might warrant consultation under Article 4 of the Washington Treaty.55 Estonian experts have also taken on leadership roles in NATO's Brussels-based Cyber Defense Management Authority (CDMA), and Tallinn has hosted the organization's Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) since August 2008. The CCDCOE serves as NATO's focal point for cooperation, data exchange, and research on cybersecurity. The center has done everything from organizing conferences of practitioners and academics, to publishing the notable Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyberwarfare, to planning the annual Locked Shields exercises. The latest Locked Shields iteration in April 2017 involved 800 cybersecurity specialists from 25 countries participating in a real-time simulation of more than 2,500 cyberattacks.56 Similarly, Estonia has pushed for further attention to ICT security within the EU system. These initiatives have included increased funding for the EU Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA), which has provided capacity-building training, produced joint exercises for member states, and supported the development of the EU's 2013 Cybersecurity Strategy.57 This year, the EU will review ENISA's mandate and will likely draft a revised cybersecurity strategy. In 2012 the EU established its European Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security, and Justice (eu-LISA). The Estonian government was a strong advocate for creating the eu-LISA, which manages organizational databases on justice and homeland affairs (most notably the Schengen Information System). Tallinn hosts the eu-LISA headquarters.": "Estonia's collaborative cybersecurity efforts include outreach and partnerships beyond its traditional European and transatlantic partnerships. This is based on a statement in the state's Cyber Security Strategy: “Through cooperation, Estonia promotes global cybersecurity and enhances its own competence.”58 Activities embodying this commitment include working with the “Association of Southeast Asian Nations in promoting the harmonization of laws concerning cyber crime” and creating the e-Governance Academy (eGA) think tank and consultancy.59 The eGA has provided training on best practices in paperless government and information security to more than 3,500 experts from over sixty countries, ranging from Azerbaijan to Benin.60 Estonian universities have also chosen English as the language of instruction in postgraduate cybersecurity courses, thereby attracting international students.",
    "## Learning from Estonia The April 2007 DDoS attacks forever changed Estonia's path in the digital age. A small Baltic state, Estonia is counting on ICT for its prosperity, and its government has made one of its core missions the pursuit of safe, secure, and profitable use of technol ogies in cyberspace. This article has covered many, but not all, complementary Estonian initiatives to protect its government and people from repetition of the 2007 events. From cyber militia to virtual embassies, no country is quite like Estonia in the information security realm.": "Have these activities facilitated a safer digital environment for Estonians? That is a tough question. Lloyd's of London reported that cybercrimes resulted in over $400 billion of global economic losses in 2015, with Juniper Research predicting such losses will balloon to $2.1 trillion by 2019.61 These staggering figures do not even attempt to encompass damages from politically motivated cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism. To date, Estonia's impressive variety of programs has produced a culture of cyber best practices, hardened the country against attacks, and developed resources for incident response. Tallinn has also performed exceptionally well in EU and NATO cybersecurity simulations. Still, deterrence is an exercise in unobserved counterfactuals and assigning values to probabilistic events. We may not truly understand the efficacy of Estonia's cybersecurity programs until they are put to the test in real world crises. Routine disruptions of Georgian military communications and hacks on the Ukrainian power grid indicate that such field testing may not be such a distant pipedream.\nWe may not truly understand the efficacy of Estonia's cybersecurity programs until they are put to the test in real world crises.\nBy its nature, cyberwarfare carries complications somewhat unlike those of conventional and nuclear military operations. Academics, governments, and international organizations have struggled to develop theories of deterrence in a domain with attribution problems, largely unknowable capabilities, and the power of highly asymmetric forces to inflict pain and punishment. Regardless, a number of notable scholars have argued fairly convincingly that cyberwarfare is either unlikely to occur or is of lesser importance than traditional elements of grand strategy.62 Until new, unified theories of cybersecurity emerge, states will likely focus on classic considerations of deterrence and dissuasion: punishment, denial, entanglement/interdependence, and international norms.63 If these are the ideal criteria, Estonia has indeed made admirable strides on all fronts of cyberdeterrence and dissuasion.\nThe Estonian case demonstrates both the potential severity of digital threats, as well as responses that states may take to safeguard against future cyberattacks. Few countries have pursued the breadth and depth of steps in the direction of Internet security that Estonia has in the wake of the April 2007 DDoS strikes. NATO has yet to develop an organization-wide cybersecurity strategy, and the United States does not have a macro-level policy or strategy for cyberdeterrence. When countering digital threats, states must first have a concrete strategy. Then, such a strategy will guide tailored national defense efforts, legal modifications, societal adaptation, and international partnerships. In the future, businesses, militaries, and civilian governments will inevitably depend increasingly on cyberspace, drawing attention to the importance of securing critical infrastructure. Clearly, it would be a mistake to conceive of information security as an issue confined to Twitter botnets, the latest WikiLeaks document dump, or “fake news” websites.\nEstonia is a first mover among states in taking steps to minimize threats to its diverse array of digital infrastructure. Coun TEN YEARS AFTER THE ESTONIAN CYBERATTACKS tries spanning the globe would do well to study aspects of the Estonian template when forming cybersecurity policy and strategy.⁶⁴"

Estonian policies of this nature included conditioning citizenship on proficiency in the Estonian language. After years of objections from Russia and various human rights organizations in the forum of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Tallinn eventually reversed many of these policies.

Much has changed in terms of public awareness, political and corporate discourse, and the availability of policy and academic literature. From the Clinton and Macron hacks, to allegations of Russian-controlled Twitterbots spreading “fake news,” to the WannaCry ransomware attacks, threats emanating from the Internet have gone mainstream. But has the media attention given to political disinformation campaigns, digital vandalism, and industrial espionage come at a cost? Have we simply forgotten that anonymous and sophisticated hackers—often employed or supported by states—may have the ability to threaten power grids, online banking, and strategic weapon systems?\nTen years ago, the small Baltic state of Estonia fell victim to a state-sanctioned, or state-sponsored, cyberattack by Russian hackers. The 2007 strikes on Estonia were comparatively different than other incidents involving state actors. Titan Rain entailed coordinated cyberespionage of Chinese origin on US government information systems. The Stuxnet worm unleashed a precision attack on Iran’s centrifuges for uranium enrichment at the Natanz nuclear facility. And the North Korean hacks on Sony inflicted punitive damage on the Sony Corporation for its cinematic depiction of Kim Jong-un. In sharp contrast, what happened in Estonia was a gateway attack; by disabling services used by nearly all Estonians, the hackers gave the world a preview of the future extremes of cyberwarfare. While it is overblown to refer to what happened in Estonia as full-fledged cyberwar, the attacks raised the specter of digital targeting of a state’s critical infrastructure. It is this chilling possibility that prompted a multitude of complementary initiatives by Estonia to protect its population from a cyber redux.\n&gt; Ten years ago, the small Baltic state of Estonia fell victim to a state-sanctioned, or state-sponsored, cyberattack by Russian hackers.\nThis article explores the Estonian government’s efforts to safeguard their state from a future cyberattack of an equivalent or greater magnitude than the 2007 hacking. After reviewing the events of 2007, I discuss four different policy arenas: national cyber defense, legal modifications, societal adaptation, and international collaboration. I argue that the changing nature of Estonia’s national capabilities and readiness to counter disruptive Internet strikes sets the global FALL 2017, VOLUME XVIII, NUMBER III 67 standard. Looking back at Tallinn's activities over the past decade, there is much for the international community to admire and emulate.\n## Revisiting the Estonian Cyberattacks The 1996 announcement of Project Tiger Leap foreshadowed Estonia's emergence as the most tech-savvy country in Europe through state investment in information and communication technology (ICT).1 By 2007, 60 percent of Estonians were daily Internet users, while 97 percent of banking took place online.2 Additionally, the Estonian national identification card made possible a digital signature for paying taxes, submitting social service requests, and even voting—all entirely over the Internet.3 Tallinn also relied on the Internet for its critical infrastructure, including the power grid and water supply. “E-Estonia” is thus a paradoxical case for understanding contemporary digital security, as beneficial technological advancements opened the door to pronounced strategic vulnerabilities.\nIt is no secret that Estonia-Russia relations are fraught with tension. A former imperial Russian governorate, Estonia won independence from the nascent Soviet Union in 1920, only to face twin occupations in 1940 and 1944, lasting until the USSR dissolved. Moscow ruled with an iron first and relocated hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians to Estonia to “Russify” the state's culture.4 After the Cold War, Tallinn deprived these transplants of opportunities for citizenship, while Russia issued them passports.5 Estonia then joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 2004 to gain protection against Russia and obtained formal Atlantic Alliance defense contingency planning in 2010.6 It even took until 2014 before the two countries adopted a treaty delineating their geopolitical borders.7 The intersection of Tallinn's ICT reliance and sour relations with Moscow set the stage for the Bronze Night protests. Following victory in the March 2007 parliamentary elections, the conservative government of Prime Minister Andrus Ansip prepared to relocate Bronze Soldier, a statue commemorating the Soviet liberation of Estonia from the Nazis, on April 30. The plan was to move the memorial—seen as a hallmark of oppression by many Estonians—from Tõnismägi Park in central Tallinn to the secluded Defense Forces Cemetery of Tallinn. Among Estonia's large Russian minority (26 percent of the national population at the time), the move smacked of further ethnic discrimination, prompting large-scale riots from April 27 to 29 and smaller demonstrations thereafter.8 When the dust settled, there were more than 1,300 arrests, one hundred injuries, and one fatality.9 This conflict was not simply ethnopolitics and Molotov cocktails—the accompanying cyberattacks were more frightening than the physical riots themselves. For three weeks, “hacktivists” targeted “the government, the president, the parliament, police, banks, Internet service providers (ISPs), online media, as well as many small businesses and local government sites.”10 The culprits took control of computers in Egypt, Russia, and the United States and used them against Estonian servers and routers with email spam and ping and user datagram protocol flooding attacks.11 In this distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, websites normally handling 1,000 hits a day crashed upon receiving 2,000 hits per second.12 Online banking, credit card, and ATM transactions ground to a halt, while government email servers and websites went offline or were defaced.13 Estonian news media websites lost the ability to upload articles, while false TEN YEARS AFTER THE ESTONIAN CYBERATTACKS Russian-language media reports streamed in describing the destruction of the Bronze Soldier and the graves of Russian veterans.¹⁴ The Estonian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) needed to collaborate with private-sector volunteers; the governments of Finland, Germany, Israel, and Slovenia; and NATO and European Union (EU) institutions to restore normal network operations.¹⁵ This process involved temporary disconnection from international data links, allowing Estonia to “keep communications running domestically” as the CERT repaired infected systems.¹⁶ ## Assessing the Events of April 2007 Definitive attribution was unsuccessful owing to the hackers’ ability to control remote networks and hide behind masked Internet protocol (IP) addresses. What is clear is that Russian-language Internet forums urged on the activities.¹⁷ While the Kremlin denied culpability, “Estonian officials like Foreign Minister Urmas Paet quickly accused Russia of perpetrating the attacks, but European Commission and NATO technical experts were unable to find credible evidence of Kremlin participation in the DDoS strikes.”¹⁸ This lack of evidence came despite many experts, including NATO officials, asserting that the attacks were beyond non-state actor capacities.¹⁹ However, Moscow refused to cooperate on attribution, accused Tallinn of human rights violations, and called on Ansip to resign.²⁰ As the DDoS raged on, Russian president Vladimir Putin condemned the Bronze Soldier’s relocation: “Those who desecrate monuments to the heroes of the war are insulting their own people and sowing discord and new distrust between states and people.”²¹ The Kremlin declined to intervene in violent protests outside the Estonian embassy in Moscow, which even saw an assault on Tallinn’s ambassador.²² In the end, Estonia made a few token arrests, with a single conviction carrying a minor fine.\nWere the cyberattacks successful? Initially, at the time of the attacks, White House cybersecurity official Howard Schmidt said, “Estonia has built their future on having a high-tech government and economy, and they’ve basically been brought to their knees because of these attacks.”²³ But was there any lasting damage? Assessments are hard to come by, but one bank reported estimated losses of $1 million.²⁴ The DDoS strikes did not target Estonian’s electricity, water supply, or military weapon systems; some analysts have thus labeled them as merely disruptive, or as a “cyber riot.”²⁵ While there is validity to this assessment, more extreme actions are not outside of the imagination, as “hacktivists” threatened nation-state sovereignty while coding in the comfort of their workspaces. The 2007 cyberattacks raised considerations about how NATO Article 5 mutual defense guarantees might apply in cyberspace.²⁶ Ultimately, “success” depends on the metric one uses. I visited the Bronze Soldier one cold afternoon in January 2015 at its home—the Defense Forces Cemetery of Tallinn. Although there were some wilting flowers and Russian flags laid at its base, one thing was apparent: If the hackers intended to digitally coerce Estonia, they had abjectly failed. Perhaps this is why we instead now see Russian disinformation campaigns against developed countries like Finland, France, Sweden, and the United States. On the other hand, Estonia was inevitably a training ground for future Russian cyberattacks in Kyrgyzstan and information If the hackers intended to digitally coerce Estonia, they had abjectly failed.\nFALL 2017, VOLUME XVIII, NUMBER III 69 warfare—alongside conventional military operations—in Georgia and Ukraine.\n## Estonia's National Cyber Defense: Dense Centralization The events of April 2007 transformed how Estonia approached cyber defense, as the attacks unveiled the specter of threats to the nation's digital society. Building up national defenses to protect against future attacks became a key element of foreign policy, and pursuant to the cabinet's July 2007 Action Plan to Fight Cyber-attacks, Estonia became one of the first countries to adopt a national Cyber Security Strategy.27 The country's first strategy was adopted in 2008 and covered the years 2009--2013, while the current strategy applies to 2014--2017.28 The latter improves on its predecessor and highlights five umbrella goals: Ensuring the protection of information systems underlying important servicesEnhancing the fight against cybercrimeDeveloping national cyber-defense capabilitiesManaging evolving cybersecurity threatsDeveloping develops cross-sectoral activities29 These overarching goals have been instrumental in shaping policies to define and combat threats in cyberspace, establishing new capabilities for protecting the Estonian government and society, and creating a broad platform for international collaboration.\nThe defense aspects of Estonian information security involve an array of agencies: the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, Information System Authority, and Police and Border Guard Board, to name a few. For this reason, in 2009, the government established a Cyber Security Council “to contribute to smooth cooperation between various institutions and conduct surveillance over the implementation of the goals of the Cyber Security Strategy.”30 Under council guidance, the revised 2010 Estonian National Security Concept approved by parliament was inclusive of the need to protect vital services from digital threats.31 Some consequent policies were the military's buildup of defensive cyberwarfare capabilities to assist Estonia's CERT and the Information System Authority's efforts to identify service vulnerabilities.32 Meanwhile, the 2009 Emergency Act applies to cyberattacks and calls for emergency preparedness exercises and development of regional and local authorities for incident response.33 Tallinn has not limited its cyberdefense centralization to traditional state capabilities. Its Cyber Security Strategy discusses the role of the Estonian Cyber Defense League (CDL) “to support civilian institutions and protect critical infrastructure in a crisis situation.”34 The CDL is part of the Estonian Defense League (EDL), a voluntary paramilitary organization dating back to 1918 that has been an official component of the Estonian Defense Forces since 1992. The EDL established two regional units of the CDL in Tallinn and Tartu in 2009, which generally consist of private-sector ICT specialists who want to help defend Estonian sovereignty in cyberspace.35 These units have since participated in a variety of exercises with the government and assisted in public outreach. They are ready for mobilization should it be necessary.\nIn addition to looking at malicious activities in cyberspace through a kinetic lens, the Cyber Security Strategy contains several innovative provisions. Among the most interesting is a statement that reads: “E-services, processes, and information systems (including digital records of evidential value) that are essential for the digital continuity of the state are constantly updated and mapped, and they have mirror and backup alternatives. Virtual embassies will ensure the functioning of the state, regardless of Estonia's territorial integrity.”36 Tallinn has accordingly initiated talks to essentially host a copy of its state with countries such as Luxembourg and the United Kingdom.37 Even if Estonia faces invasion or a crippling cyberattack, the government is taking steps to ensure its digital survival and sovereignty. Further, the Cyber Security Strategy mandates identification of alternatives for cross-border service provision to secure continuity if hackers sever international supply lines.38 Even if Estonia faces invasion or a crippling cyberattack, the government is taking steps to ensure its digital survival and sovereignty.\n## Changing Legal Framework: Responsibility, Punishment, Protection Defending against cyberattacks is a difficult endeavor, but how does a state investigate and prosecute such criminal activities, especially if the perpetrators operate from within its own borders? Estonia faced obstacles in performing these activities after the 2007 attacks owing to its lack of proper legal authorities and structures for managing incidents in cyberspace. Free societies are not dictatorships that may simply create laws on the fly to meet evolving security challenges. One of the central problems was that Estonian laws prohibited certain surveillance and investigation procedures of suspected crimes if a conviction would result in fewer than three years' imprisonment; at the time, nearly all cybercrimes fell under this umbrella.39 With these limitations and attribution issues, Dmitri Galushkevich, a twenty-year-old ethnic Russian living in Tallinn, was the only perpetrator convicted for the DDoS strikes. Galushkevich received a fine of 17,500 kroons (roughly $1,650 at the time) for blocking the website of Prime Minister Ansip's political party.40 There thus arose a recognition that the country needed more than military hardening to protect itself from hackers. Estonia required a legal framework to deter cyberattacks, but also to identify and punish perpetrators in the event that deterrence failed.\nOne of the most significant changes in Estonian law was the modification of the country's penal code to punish criminal offenses involving computers “that did not clearly seek financial gain.”41 The revised penal code includes a number of sections dealing with cyberattacks and cybercrime. They are not limited to “interference with computer data,” “hindering of functions of computer systems,” “dissemination of spyware, malware or computer viruses,” “preparation of computer-related crime,” or “illegal obtaining of access to computer systems.”42 The code spells out new computer-related criminal offenses, offers stiff sentencing guidelines for digital crimes (including jail time), and paves the way for the Information System Authority to have enhanced powers of surveillance and investigation. Illegal cyberspace activities are also noted among the penal code's list of potential acts of terrorism.43 While the penal code focuses on deterrence, responsibility, and punishment, other legal changes are directed at data protection. For instance, there were updates in information access procedures to the Public Information Act and revisions to the Electronic Communications Act that “establish common security standards” that ISPs must follow.44 Furthermore, the Personal Data Protection Act now includes procedures that entities processing Estonians' personal data must abide by when collecting, safeguarding, and using such data.45 The Information System Authority has taken on a regulatory role with respect to these acts, monitoring relevant actors, and imposing sanctions or ordering corrective changes. Altogether, Estonian legal structures developed in the wake of the Bronze Soldier events have influenced and shaped international cyberlaw studies.46 ## Societal Adaptation As the discussion of national defense and legal changes in Estonia indicates, governments often take the lead in proactive and preventive cybersecurity policy. However, state activities alone are insufficient, as protecting against digital threats requires an overarching sense of societal awareness and vigilance. After all, even sensible Internet conduct by young schoolchildren may prevent the spread of Trojans and other malware that may compromise networks. The need for public awareness in a digital society raises the question: Are Estonians aware of threats to their banking system, government service provision, and critical infrastructure? If December 2016 survey data are any indication, the answer is a resounding yes. Respondents to a nationally representative survey ranked the most pressing threat facing Estonia as a cyberattack on the government or society.47 This is most likely due to the events of 2007 and resultant government public awareness campaigns. Today, it is not just the government and CDL volunteers who are concerned about the vitality of Estonia's digital infrastructure—it is society as a whole.\nIn 2014 the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications released its “Digital Agenda 2020 for Estonia.”48 This document recognizes that over 90 percent of Estonians have easy access to broadband Internet and other ICT, with the rate of Internet use at nearly 100 percent among young Estonians.49 The Digital Agenda further notes that more than 20 percent of Estonian exports now come from ICT sources and discusses a bevy of information security training programs at the national, regional, and local levels.50 These programs are designed for school pupils, their parents, teachers, the private sector, and even cybersecurity training instructors. Overall, the agenda showcases a national program to continually train, retrain, and educate the population through government initiatives, public-private partnerships, and societal verification of best practices.\nThe Cyber Security Strategy also points to the role of the Estonian Information Technology Foundation for Education.51 Previously named the Tiger Leap Foundation, this state-funded institute was instrumental in facilitating public awareness of digital technologies during Estonia's information revolution. Now the foundation provides cybersecurity training across all segments of society, whether by incorporating it into coding bootcamps for teenagers or offering courses to the elderly. In consultation with the foundation, the Tallinn University of Technology and Tartu University designed a new master's program in cybersecurity, which accepted its first cohort of students in 2009. Tallinn University of Technology built on this program in 2014, collaborating with Estonia's 2CENTRE Cybercrime Center of Excellence to stand up a postgraduate degree program in digital forensics.52 These educational opportunities help to ensure that the country and neighboring states have a cadre of well-equipped cybersecurity professionals.\n## International Collaboration and Outreach Digital interconnectivity means that computer issues do not stop at geopolitical borders, which is why international collaboration is a necessity.53 Much of Estonia's cooperation has taken place alongside its NATO partners, some of whom provided CERT assistance during the 2007 cyberattacks. In the aftermath of these events, there were conversations about extending Article 5 security guarantees to cyberattacks.54 Tallinn supported the Atlantic Alliance's decision to instead include—in its 2010 Strategic Concept—digital aggressions as actions that might warrant consultation under Article 4 of the Washington Treaty.55 Estonian experts have also taken on leadership roles in NATO's Brussels-based Cyber Defense Management Authority (CDMA), and Tallinn has hosted the organization's Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) since August 2008. The CCDCOE serves as NATO's focal point for cooperation, data exchange, and research on cybersecurity. The center has done everything from organizing conferences of practitioners and academics, to publishing the notable Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyberwarfare, to planning the annual Locked Shields exercises. The latest Locked Shields iteration in April 2017 involved 800 cybersecurity specialists from 25 countries participating in a real-time simulation of more than 2,500 cyberattacks.56 Similarly, Estonia has pushed for further attention to ICT security within the EU system. These initiatives have included increased funding for the EU Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA), which has provided capacity-building training, produced joint exercises for member states, and supported the development of the EU's 2013 Cybersecurity Strategy.57 This year, the EU will review ENISA's mandate and will likely draft a revised cybersecurity strategy. In 2012 the EU established its European Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security, and Justice (eu-LISA). The Estonian government was a strong advocate for creating the eu-LISA, which manages organizational databases on justice and homeland affairs (most notably the Schengen Information System). Tallinn hosts the eu-LISA headquarters.\nEstonia's collaborative cybersecurity efforts include outreach and partnerships beyond its traditional European and transatlantic partnerships. This is based on a statement in the state's Cyber Security Strategy: “Through cooperation, Estonia promotes global cybersecurity and enhances its own competence.”58 Activities embodying this commitment include working with the “Association of Southeast Asian Nations in promoting the harmonization of laws concerning cyber crime” and creating the e-Governance Academy (eGA) think tank and consultancy.59 The eGA has provided training on best practices in paperless government and information security to more than 3,500 experts from over sixty countries, ranging from Azerbaijan to Benin.60 Estonian universities have also chosen English as the language of instruction in postgraduate cybersecurity courses, thereby attracting international students.\n## Learning from Estonia The April 2007 DDoS attacks forever changed Estonia's path in the digital age. A small Baltic state, Estonia is counting on ICT for its prosperity, and its government has made one of its core missions the pursuit of safe, secure, and profitable use of technol ogies in cyberspace. This article has covered many, but not all, complementary Estonian initiatives to protect its government and people from repetition of the 2007 events. From cyber militia to virtual embassies, no country is quite like Estonia in the information security realm.\nHave these activities facilitated a safer digital environment for Estonians? That is a tough question. Lloyd's of London reported that cybercrimes resulted in over $400 billion of global economic losses in 2015, with Juniper Research predicting such losses will balloon to $2.1 trillion by 2019.61 These staggering figures do not even attempt to encompass damages from politically motivated cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism. To date, Estonia's impressive variety of programs has produced a culture of cyber best practices, hardened the country against attacks, and developed resources for incident response. Tallinn has also performed exceptionally well in EU and NATO cybersecurity simulations. Still, deterrence is an exercise in unobserved counterfactuals and assigning values to probabilistic events. We may not truly understand the efficacy of Estonia's cybersecurity programs until they are put to the test in real world crises. Routine disruptions of Georgian military communications and hacks on the Ukrainian power grid indicate that such field testing may not be such a distant pipedream.\nWe may not truly understand the efficacy of Estonia's cybersecurity programs until they are put to the test in real world crises.\nBy its nature, cyberwarfare carries complications somewhat unlike those of conventional and nuclear military operations. Academics, governments, and international organizations have struggled to develop theories of deterrence in a domain with attribution problems, largely unknowable capabilities, and the power of highly asymmetric forces to inflict pain and punishment. Regardless, a number of notable scholars have argued fairly convincingly that cyberwarfare is either unlikely to occur or is of lesser importance than traditional elements of grand strategy.62 Until new, unified theories of cybersecurity emerge, states will likely focus on classic considerations of deterrence and dissuasion: punishment, denial, entanglement/interdependence, and international norms.63 If these are the ideal criteria, Estonia has indeed made admirable strides on all fronts of cyberdeterrence and dissuasion.\nThe Estonian case demonstrates both the potential severity of digital threats, as well as responses that states may take to safeguard against future cyberattacks. Few countries have pursued the breadth and depth of steps in the direction of Internet security that Estonia has in the wake of the April 2007 DDoS strikes. NATO has yet to develop an organization-wide cybersecurity strategy, and the United States does not have a macro-level policy or strategy for cyberdeterrence. When countering digital threats, states must first have a concrete strategy. Then, such a strategy will guide tailored national defense efforts, legal modifications, societal adaptation, and international partnerships. In the future, businesses, militaries, and civilian governments will inevitably depend increasingly on cyberspace, drawing attention to the importance of securing critical infrastructure. Clearly, it would be a mistake to conceive of information security as an issue confined to Twitter botnets, the latest WikiLeaks document dump, or “fake news” websites.\nEstonia is a first mover among states in taking steps to minimize threats to its diverse array of digital infrastructure. Coun TEN YEARS AFTER THE ESTONIAN CYBERATTACKS tries spanning the globe would do well to study aspects of the Estonian template when forming cybersecurity policy and strategy.⁶⁴",

Looking back at Tallinn's activities over the past decade, there is much for the international community to admire and emulate.\n## Revisiting the Estonian Cyberattacks\nThe 1996 announcement of Project Tiger Leap foreshadowed Estonia's emergence as the most tech-savvy country in Europe through state investment in information and communication technology (ICT).1 By 2007, 60 percent of Estonians were daily Internet users, while 97 percent of banking took place online.2 Additionally, the Estonian national identification card made possible a digital signature for paying taxes, submitting social service requests, and even voting—all entirely over the Internet.3 Tallinn also relied on the Internet for its critical infrastructure, including the power grid and water supply. “E-Estonia” is thus a paradoxical case for understanding contemporary digital security, as beneficial technological advancements opened the door to pronounced strategic vulnerabilities.\nIt is no secret that Estonia-Russia relations are fraught with tension. A former imperial Russian governorate, Estonia won independence from the nascent Soviet Union in 1920, only to face twin occupations in 1940 and 1944, lasting until the USSR dissolved. Moscow ruled with an iron first and relocated hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians to Estonia to “Russify” the state's culture.4 After the Cold War, Tallinn deprived these transplants of opportunities for citizenship, while Russia issued them passports.5 Estonia then joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 2004 to gain protection against Russia and obtained formal Atlantic Alliance defense contingency planning in 2010.6 It even took until 2014 before the two countries adopted a treaty delineating their geopolitical borders.7\nThe intersection of Tallinn's ICT reliance and sour relations with Moscow set the stage for the Bronze Night protests. Following victory in the March 2007 parliamentary elections, the conservative government of Prime Minister Andrus Ansip prepared to relocate Bronze Soldier, a statue commemorating the Soviet liberation of Estonia from the Nazis, on April 30. The plan was to move the memorial—seen as a hallmark of oppression by many Estonians—from Tõnismägi Park in central Tallinn to the secluded Defense Forces Cemetery of Tallinn. Among Estonia's large Russian minority (26 percent of the national population at the time), the move smacked of further ethnic discrimination, prompting large-scale riots from April 27 to 29 and smaller demonstrations thereafter.8 When the dust settled, there were more than 1,300 arrests, one hundred injuries, and one fatality.9\nThis conflict was not simply ethnopolitics and Molotov cocktails—the accompanying cyberattacks were more frightening than the physical riots themselves. For three weeks, “hacktivists” targeted “the government, the president, the parliament, police, banks, Internet service providers (ISPs), online media, as well as many small businesses and local government sites.”10 The culprits took control of computers in Egypt, Russia, and the United States and used them against Estonian servers and routers with email spam and ping and user datagram protocol flooding attacks.11 In this distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, websites normally handling 1,000 hits a day crashed upon receiving 2,000 hits per second.12 Online banking, credit card, and ATM transactions ground to a halt, while government email servers and websites went offline or were defaced.13 Estonian news media websites lost the ability to upload articles, while false\nTEN YEARS AFTER THE ESTONIAN CYBERATTACKS\nRussian-language media reports streamed in describing the destruction of the Bronze Soldier and the graves of Russian veterans.¹⁴ The Estonian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) needed to collaborate with private-sector volunteers; the governments of Finland, Germany, Israel, and Slovenia; and NATO and European Union (EU) institutions to restore normal network operations.¹⁵ This process involved temporary disconnection from international data links, allowing Estonia to “keep communications running domestically” as the CERT repaired infected systems.¹⁶\n## Assessing the Events of April 2007\nDefinitive attribution was unsuccessful owing to the hackers’ ability to control remote networks and hide behind masked Internet protocol (IP) addresses. What is clear is that Russian-language Internet forums urged on the activities.¹⁷ While the Kremlin denied culpability, “Estonian officials like Foreign Minister Urmas Paet quickly accused Russia of perpetrating the attacks, but European Commission and NATO technical experts were unable to find credible evidence of Kremlin participation in the DDoS strikes.”¹⁸ This lack of evidence came despite many experts, including NATO officials, asserting that the attacks were beyond non-state actor capacities.¹⁹ However, Moscow refused to cooperate on attribution, accused Tallinn of human rights violations, and called on Ansip to resign.²⁰ As the DDoS raged on, Russian president Vladimir Putin condemned the Bronze Soldier’s relocation: “Those who desecrate monuments to the heroes of the war are insulting their own people and sowing discord and new distrust between states and people.”²¹ The Kremlin declined to intervene in violent protests outside the Estonian embassy in Moscow,\nwhich even saw an assault on Tallinn’s ambassador.²² In the end, Estonia made a few token arrests, with a single conviction carrying a minor fine.\nWere the cyberattacks successful? Initially, at the time of the attacks, White House cybersecurity official Howard Schmidt said, “Estonia has built their future on having a high-tech government and economy, and they’ve basically been brought to their knees because of these attacks.”²³ But was there any lasting damage? Assessments are hard to come by, but one bank reported estimated losses of $1 million.²⁴ The DDoS strikes did not target Estonian’s electricity, water supply, or military weapon systems; some analysts have thus labeled them as merely disruptive, or as a “cyber riot.”²⁵ While there is validity to this assessment, more extreme actions are not outside of the imagination, as “hacktivists” threatened nation-state sovereignty while coding in the comfort of their workspaces. The 2007 cyberattacks raised considerations about how NATO Article 5 mutual defense guarantees might apply in cyberspace.²⁶ Ultimately, “success” depends on the metric one uses. I visited the Bronze Soldier one cold afternoon in January 2015 at its home—the Defense Forces Cemetery of Tallinn. Although there were some wilting flowers and Russian flags laid at its base, one thing was apparent: If the hackers intended to digitally coerce Estonia, they had abjectly failed. Perhaps this is why we instead now see Russian disinformation campaigns against developed countries like Finland, France, Sweden, and the United States. On the other hand, Estonia was inevitably a training ground for future Russian cyberattacks in Kyrgyzstan and information\nIf the hackers intended to digitally coerce Estonia, they had abjectly failed.\nFALL 2017, VOLUME XVIII, NUMBER III 69\nwarfare—alongside conventional military operations—in Georgia and Ukraine.\n## Estonia's National Cyber Defense: Dense Centralization\nThe events of April 2007 transformed how Estonia approached cyber defense, as the attacks unveiled the specter of threats to the nation's digital society. Building up national defenses to protect against future attacks became a key element of foreign policy, and pursuant to the cabinet's July 2007 Action Plan to Fight Cyber-attacks, Estonia became one of the first countries to adopt a national Cyber Security Strategy.27 The country's first strategy was adopted in 2008 and covered the years 2009--2013, while the current strategy applies to 2014--2017.28 The latter improves on its predecessor and highlights five umbrella goals: Ensuring the protection of information systems underlying important servicesEnhancing the fight against cybercrimeDeveloping national cyber-defense capabilitiesManaging evolving cybersecurity threatsDeveloping develops cross-sectoral activities29\nThese overarching goals have been instrumental in shaping policies to define and combat threats in cyberspace, establishing new capabilities for protecting the Estonian government and society, and creating a broad platform for international collaboration.\nThe defense aspects of Estonian information security involve an array of agencies: the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, Information System Authority, and Police and Border Guard Board, to name a few. For this reason, in 2009, the government established a Cyber Security Council “to contribute to smooth cooperation between various institutions and conduct surveillance over the implementation of the goals of the Cyber Security Strategy.”30 Under council guidance, the revised 2010 Estonian National Security Concept approved by parliament was inclusive of the need to protect vital services from digital threats.31 Some consequent policies were the military's buildup of defensive cyberwarfare capabilities to assist Estonia's CERT and the Information System Authority's efforts to identify service vulnerabilities.32 Meanwhile, the 2009 Emergency Act applies to cyberattacks and calls for emergency preparedness exercises and development of regional and local authorities for incident response.33\nTallinn has not limited its cyberdefense centralization to traditional state capabilities. Its Cyber Security Strategy discusses the role of the Estonian Cyber Defense League (CDL) “to support civilian institutions and protect critical infrastructure in a crisis situation.”34 The CDL is part of the Estonian Defense League (EDL), a voluntary paramilitary organization dating back to 1918 that has been an official component of the Estonian Defense Forces since 1992. The EDL established two regional units of the CDL in Tallinn and Tartu in 2009, which generally consist of private-sector ICT specialists who want to help defend Estonian sovereignty in cyberspace.35 These units have since participated in a variety of exercises with the government and assisted in public outreach. They are ready for mobilization should it be necessary.\nIn addition to looking at malicious activities in cyberspace through a kinetic lens, the Cyber Security Strategy contains several innovative provisions. Among the most interesting is a statement that reads:\n“E-services, processes, and information systems (including digital records of evidential value) that are essential for the digital continuity of the state are constantly updated and mapped, and they have mirror and backup alternatives. Virtual embassies will ensure the functioning of the state, regardless of Estonia's territorial integrity.”36 Tallinn has accordingly initiated talks to essentially host a copy of its state with countries such as Luxembourg and the United Kingdom.37 Even if Estonia faces invasion or a crippling cyberattack, the government is taking steps to ensure its digital survival and sovereignty. Further, the Cyber Security Strategy mandates identification of alternatives for cross-border service provision to secure continuity if hackers sever international supply lines.38\nEven if Estonia faces invasion or a crippling cyberattack, the government is taking steps to ensure its digital survival and sovereignty.\n## Changing Legal Framework: Responsibility, Punishment, Protection\nDefending against cyberattacks is a difficult endeavor, but how does a state investigate and prosecute such criminal activities, especially if the perpetrators operate from within its own borders? Estonia faced obstacles in performing these activities after the 2007 attacks owing to its lack of proper legal authorities and structures for managing incidents in cyberspace. Free societies are not dictatorships that may simply create laws on the fly to meet evolving security challenges. One of the central problems was that Estonian laws prohibited certain surveillance and investigation procedures of suspected crimes if a conviction would result in fewer than three years' imprisonment; at the time, nearly all cybercrimes fell under this umbrella.39 With these limitations and attribution issues, Dmitri Galushkevich, a twenty-year-old ethnic Russian living in Tallinn, was the only perpetrator convicted for the DDoS strikes. Galushkevich received a fine of 17,500 kroons (roughly $1,650 at the time) for blocking the website of Prime Minister Ansip's political party.40 There thus arose a recognition that the country needed more than military hardening to protect itself from hackers. Estonia required a legal framework to deter cyberattacks, but also to identify and punish perpetrators in the event that deterrence failed.\nOne of the most significant changes in Estonian law was the modification of the country's penal code to punish criminal offenses involving computers “that did not clearly seek financial gain.”41 The revised penal code includes a number of sections dealing with cyberattacks and cybercrime. They are not limited to “interference with computer data,” “hindering of functions of computer systems,” “dissemination of spyware, malware or computer viruses,” “preparation of computer-related crime,” or “illegal obtaining of access to computer systems.”42 The code spells out new computer-related criminal offenses, offers stiff sentencing guidelines for digital crimes (including jail time), and paves the way for the Information System Authority to have enhanced powers of surveillance and investigation. Illegal cyberspace activities are also noted among the penal code's list of potential acts of terrorism.43\nWhile the penal code focuses on deterrence, responsibility, and punishment, other legal changes are directed at data protection. For instance, there were updates in information access procedures to the Public Information Act and revisions to the Electronic Communications Act that “establish common security standards” that ISPs must follow.44 Furthermore, the Personal Data\nProtection Act now includes procedures that entities processing Estonians' personal data must abide by when collecting, safeguarding, and using such data.45 The Information System Authority has taken on a regulatory role with respect to these acts, monitoring relevant actors, and imposing sanctions or ordering corrective changes. Altogether, Estonian legal structures developed in the wake of the Bronze Soldier events have influenced and shaped international cyberlaw studies.46\n## Societal Adaptation\nAs the discussion of national defense and legal changes in Estonia indicates, governments often take the lead in proactive and preventive cybersecurity policy. However, state activities alone are insufficient, as protecting against digital threats requires an overarching sense of societal awareness and vigilance. After all, even sensible Internet conduct by young schoolchildren may prevent the spread of Trojans and other malware that may compromise networks. The need for public awareness in a digital society raises the question: Are Estonians aware of threats to their banking system, government service provision, and critical infrastructure? If December 2016 survey data are any indication, the answer is a resounding yes. Respondents to a nationally representative survey ranked the most pressing threat facing Estonia as a cyberattack on the government or society.47 This is most likely due to the events of 2007 and resultant government public awareness campaigns. Today, it is not just the government and CDL volunteers who are concerned about the vitality of Estonia's digital infrastructure—it is society as a whole.\nIn 2014 the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications released its “Digital Agenda 2020 for Estonia.”48 This document recognizes that over 90 percent of Estonians have easy access to broadband Internet and other ICT, with the rate of Internet use at nearly 100 percent among young Estonians.49 The Digital Agenda further notes that more than 20 percent of Estonian exports now come from ICT sources and discusses a bevy of information security training programs at the national, regional, and local levels.50 These programs are designed for school pupils, their parents, teachers, the private sector, and even cybersecurity training instructors. Overall, the agenda showcases a national program to continually train, retrain, and educate the population through government initiatives, public-private partnerships, and societal verification of best practices.\nThe Cyber Security Strategy also points to the role of the Estonian Information Technology Foundation for Education.51 Previously named the Tiger Leap Foundation, this state-funded institute was instrumental in facilitating public awareness of digital technologies during Estonia's information revolution. Now the foundation provides cybersecurity training across all segments of society, whether by incorporating it into coding bootcamps for teenagers or offering courses to the elderly. In consultation with the foundation, the Tallinn University of Technology and Tartu University designed a new master's program in cybersecurity, which accepted its first cohort of students in 2009. Tallinn University of Technology built on this program in 2014, collaborating with Estonia's 2CENTRE Cybercrime Center of Excellence to stand up a postgraduate degree program in digital forensics.52 These educational opportunities help to ensure that the country and neighboring states have a cadre of well-equipped cybersecurity professionals.\n## International Collaboration and Outreach\nDigital interconnectivity means that computer issues do not stop at geopolitical borders, which is why international collaboration is a necessity.53 Much of Estonia's cooperation has taken place alongside its NATO partners, some of whom provided CERT assistance during the 2007 cyberattacks. In the aftermath of these events, there were conversations about extending Article 5 security guarantees to cyberattacks.54 Tallinn supported the Atlantic Alliance's decision to instead include—in its 2010 Strategic Concept—digital aggressions as actions that might warrant consultation under Article 4 of the Washington Treaty.55 Estonian experts have also taken on leadership roles in NATO's Brussels-based Cyber Defense Management Authority (CDMA), and Tallinn has hosted the organization's Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) since August 2008. The CCDCOE serves as NATO's focal point for cooperation, data exchange, and research on cybersecurity. The center has done everything from organizing conferences of practitioners and academics, to publishing the notable Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyberwarfare, to planning the annual Locked Shields exercises. The latest Locked Shields iteration in April 2017 involved 800 cybersecurity specialists from 25 countries participating in a real-time simulation of more than 2,500 cyberattacks.56\nSimilarly, Estonia has pushed for further attention to ICT security within the EU system. These initiatives have included increased funding for the EU Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA), which has provided capacity-building training, produced joint exercises for member states, and supported the development of the EU's 2013 Cybersecurity Strategy.57 This year, the EU will review ENISA's mandate and will likely draft a revised cybersecurity strategy. In 2012 the EU established its European Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security, and Justice (eu-LISA). The Estonian government was a strong advocate for creating the eu-LISA, which manages organizational databases on justice and homeland affairs (most notably the Schengen Information System). Tallinn hosts the eu-LISA headquarters.\nEstonia's collaborative cybersecurity efforts include outreach and partnerships beyond its traditional European and transatlantic partnerships. This is based on a statement in the state's Cyber Security Strategy: “Through cooperation, Estonia promotes global cybersecurity and enhances its own competence.”58 Activities embodying this commitment include working with the “Association of Southeast Asian Nations in promoting the harmonization of laws concerning cyber crime” and creating the e-Governance Academy (eGA) think tank and consultancy.59 The eGA has provided training on best practices in paperless government and information security to more than 3,500 experts from over sixty countries, ranging from Azerbaijan to Benin.60 Estonian universities have also chosen English as the language of instruction in postgraduate cybersecurity courses, thereby attracting international students.\n## Learning from Estonia\nThe April 2007 DDoS attacks forever changed Estonia's path in the digital age. A small Baltic state, Estonia is counting on ICT for its prosperity, and its government has made one of its core missions the pursuit of safe, secure, and profitable use of technol\nogies in cyberspace. This article has covered many, but not all, complementary Estonian initiatives to protect its government and people from repetition of the 2007 events. From cyber militia to virtual embassies, no country is quite like Estonia in the information security realm.\nHave these activities facilitated a safer digital environment for Estonians? That is a tough question. Lloyd's of London reported that cybercrimes resulted in over $400 billion of global economic losses in 2015, with Juniper Research predicting such losses will balloon to $2.1 trillion by 2019.61 These staggering figures do not even attempt to encompass damages from politically motivated cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism. To date, Estonia's impressive variety of programs has produced a culture of cyber best practices, hardened the country against attacks, and developed resources for incident response. Tallinn has also performed exceptionally well in EU and NATO cybersecurity simulations. Still, deterrence is an exercise in unobserved counterfactuals and assigning values to probabilistic events. We may not truly understand the efficacy of Estonia's cybersecurity programs until they are put to the test in real world crises. Routine disruptions of Georgian military communications and hacks on the Ukrainian power grid indicate that such field testing may not be such a distant pipedream.\nWe may not truly understand the efficacy of Estonia's cybersecurity programs until they are put to the test in real world crises.\nBy its nature, cyberwarfare carries complications somewhat unlike those of conventional and nuclear military operations. Academics, governments, and international organizations have struggled to develop theories of deterrence in a domain with attribution problems, largely unknowable capabilities, and the power of highly asymmetric forces to inflict pain and punishment. Regardless, a number of notable scholars have argued fairly convincingly that cyberwarfare is either unlikely to occur or is of lesser importance than traditional elements of grand strategy.62 Until new, unified theories of cybersecurity emerge, states will likely focus on classic considerations of deterrence and dissuasion: punishment, denial, entanglement/interdependence, and international norms.63 If these are the ideal criteria, Estonia has indeed made admirable strides on all fronts of cyberdeterrence and dissuasion.\nThe Estonian case demonstrates both the potential severity of digital threats, as well as responses that states may take to safeguard against future cyberattacks. Few countries have pursued the breadth and depth of steps in the direction of Internet security that Estonia has in the wake of the April 2007 DDoS strikes. NATO has yet to develop an organization-wide cybersecurity strategy, and the United States does not have a macro-level policy or strategy for cyberdeterrence. When countering digital threats, states must first have a concrete strategy. Then, such a strategy will guide tailored national defense efforts, legal modifications, societal adaptation, and international partnerships. In the future, businesses, militaries, and civilian governments will inevitably depend increasingly on cyberspace, drawing attention to the importance of securing critical infrastructure. Clearly, it would be a mistake to conceive of information security as an issue confined to Twitter botnets, the latest WikiLeaks document dump, or “fake news” websites.\nEstonia is a first mover among states in taking steps to minimize threats to its diverse array of digital infrastructure. Coun\nTEN YEARS AFTER THE ESTONIAN CYBERATTACKS\ntries spanning the globe would do well to study aspects of the Estonian template when forming cybersecurity policy and strategy.⁶⁴"

Building up national defenses to protect against future attacks became a key element of foreign policy, and pursuant to the cabinet's July 2007 Action Plan to Fight Cyber-attacks, Estonia became one of the first countries to adopt a national Cyber Security Strategy.27 The country's first strategy was adopted in 2008 and covered the years 2009--2013, while the current strategy applies to 2014--2017.28 The latter improves on its predecessor and highlights five umbrella goals: Ensuring the protection of information systems underlying important servicesEnhancing the fight against cybercrimeDeveloping national cyber-defense capabilitiesManaging evolving cybersecurity threatsDeveloping develops cross-sectoral activities29\nThese overarching goals have been instrumental in shaping policies to define and combat threats in cyberspace, establishing new capabilities for protecting the Estonian government and society, and creating a broad platform for international collaboration.\nThe defense aspects of Estonian information security involve an array of agencies: the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, Information System Authority, and Police and Border Guard Board, to name a few. For this reason, in 2009, the government established a Cyber Security Council “to contribute to smooth cooperation between various institutions and conduct surveillance over the implementation of the goals of the Cyber Security Strategy.”30 Under council guidance, the revised 2010 Estonian National Security Concept approved by parliament was inclusive of the need to protect vital services from digital threats.31 Some consequent policies were the military's buildup of defensive cyberwarfare capabilities to assist Estonia's CERT and the Information System Authority's efforts to identify service vulnerabilities.32 Meanwhile, the 2009 Emergency Act applies to cyberattacks and calls for emergency preparedness exercises and development of regional and local authorities for incident response.33\nTallinn has not limited its cyberdefense centralization to traditional state capabilities. Its Cyber Security Strategy discusses the role of the Estonian Cyber Defense League (CDL) “to support civilian institutions and protect critical infrastructure in a crisis situation.”34 The CDL is part of the Estonian Defense League (EDL), a voluntary paramilitary organization dating back to 1918 that has been an official component of the Estonian Defense Forces since 1992. The EDL established two regional units of the CDL in Tallinn and Tartu in 2009, which generally consist of private-sector ICT specialists who want to help defend Estonian sovereignty in cyberspace.35 These units have since participated in a variety of exercises with the government and assisted in public outreach. They are ready for mobilization should it be necessary.\nIn addition to looking at malicious activities in cyberspace through a kinetic lens, the Cyber Security Strategy contains several innovative provisions. Among the most interesting is a statement that reads:\n“E-services, processes, and information systems (including digital records of evidential value) that are essential for the digital continuity of the state are constantly updated and mapped, and they have mirror and backup alternatives. Virtual embassies will ensure the functioning of the state, regardless of Estonia's territorial integrity.”36 Tallinn has accordingly initiated talks to essentially host a copy of its state with countries such as Luxembourg and the United Kingdom.37 Even if Estonia faces invasion or a crippling cyberattack, the government is taking steps to ensure its digital survival and sovereignty. Further, the Cyber Security Strategy mandates identification of alternatives for cross-border service provision to secure continuity if hackers sever international supply lines.38\nEven if Estonia faces invasion or a crippling cyberattack, the government is taking steps to ensure its digital survival and sovereignty.\n## Changing Legal Framework: Responsibility, Punishment, Protection\nDefending against cyberattacks is a difficult endeavor, but how does a state investigate and prosecute such criminal activities, especially if the perpetrators operate from within its own borders? Estonia faced obstacles in performing these activities after the 2007 attacks owing to its lack of proper legal authorities and structures for managing incidents in cyberspace. Free societies are not dictatorships that may simply create laws on the fly to meet evolving security challenges. One of the central problems was that Estonian laws prohibited certain surveillance and investigation procedures of suspected crimes if a conviction would result in fewer than three years' imprisonment; at the time, nearly all cybercrimes fell under this umbrella.39 With these limitations and attribution issues, Dmitri Galushkevich, a twenty-year-old ethnic Russian living in Tallinn, was the only perpetrator convicted for the DDoS strikes. Galushkevich received a fine of 17,500 kroons (roughly $1,650 at the time) for blocking the website of Prime Minister Ansip's political party.40 There thus arose a recognition that the country needed more than military hardening to protect itself from hackers. Estonia required a legal framework to deter cyberattacks, but also to identify and punish perpetrators in the event that deterrence failed.\nOne of the most significant changes in Estonian law was the modification of the country's penal code to punish criminal offenses involving computers “that did not clearly seek financial gain.”41 The revised penal code includes a number of sections dealing with cyberattacks and cybercrime. They are not limited to “interference with computer data,” “hindering of functions of computer systems,” “dissemination of spyware, malware or computer viruses,” “preparation of computer-related crime,” or “illegal obtaining of access to computer systems.”42 The code spells out new computer-related criminal offenses, offers stiff sentencing guidelines for digital crimes (including jail time), and paves the way for the Information System Authority to have enhanced powers of surveillance and investigation. Illegal cyberspace activities are also noted among the penal code's list of potential acts of terrorism.43\nWhile the penal code focuses on deterrence, responsibility, and punishment, other legal changes are directed at data protection. For instance, there were updates in information access procedures to the Public Information Act and revisions to the Electronic Communications Act that “establish common security standards” that ISPs must follow.44 Furthermore, the Personal Data\nProtection Act now includes procedures that entities processing Estonians' personal data must abide by when collecting, safeguarding, and using such data.45 The Information System Authority has taken on a regulatory role with respect to these acts, monitoring relevant actors, and imposing sanctions or ordering corrective changes. Altogether, Estonian legal structures developed in the wake of the Bronze Soldier events have influenced and shaped international cyberlaw studies.46\n## Societal Adaptation\nAs the discussion of national defense and legal changes in Estonia indicates, governments often take the lead in proactive and preventive cybersecurity policy. However, state activities alone are insufficient, as protecting against digital threats requires an overarching sense of societal awareness and vigilance. After all, even sensible Internet conduct by young schoolchildren may prevent the spread of Trojans and other malware that may compromise networks. The need for public awareness in a digital society raises the question: Are Estonians aware of threats to their banking system, government service provision, and critical infrastructure? If December 2016 survey data are any indication, the answer is a resounding yes. Respondents to a nationally representative survey ranked the most pressing threat facing Estonia as a cyberattack on the government or society.47 This is most likely due to the events of 2007 and resultant government public awareness campaigns. Today, it is not just the government and CDL volunteers who are concerned about the vitality of Estonia's digital infrastructure—it is society as a whole.\nIn 2014 the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications released its “Digital Agenda 2020 for Estonia.”48 This document recognizes that over 90 percent of Estonians have easy access to broadband Internet and other ICT, with the rate of Internet use at nearly 100 percent among young Estonians.49 The Digital Agenda further notes that more than 20 percent of Estonian exports now come from ICT sources and discusses a bevy of information security training programs at the national, regional, and local levels.50 These programs are designed for school pupils, their parents, teachers, the private sector, and even cybersecurity training instructors. Overall, the agenda showcases a national program to continually train, retrain, and educate the population through government initiatives, public-private partnerships, and societal verification of best practices.\nThe Cyber Security Strategy also points to the role of the Estonian Information Technology Foundation for Education.51 Previously named the Tiger Leap Foundation, this state-funded institute was instrumental in facilitating public awareness of digital technologies during Estonia's information revolution. Now the foundation provides cybersecurity training across all segments of society, whether by incorporating it into coding bootcamps for teenagers or offering courses to the elderly. In consultation with the foundation, the Tallinn University of Technology and Tartu University designed a new master's program in cybersecurity, which accepted its first cohort of students in 2009. Tallinn University of Technology built on this program in 2014, collaborating with Estonia's 2CENTRE Cybercrime Center of Excellence to stand up a postgraduate degree program in digital forensics.52 These educational opportunities help to ensure that the country and neighboring states have a cadre of well-equipped cybersecurity professionals.\n## International Collaboration and Outreach\nDigital interconnectivity means that computer issues do not stop at geopolitical borders, which is why international collaboration is a necessity.53 Much of Estonia's cooperation has taken place alongside its NATO partners, some of whom provided CERT assistance during the 2007 cyberattacks. In the aftermath of these events, there were conversations about extending Article 5 security guarantees to cyberattacks.54 Tallinn supported the Atlantic Alliance's decision to instead include—in its 2010 Strategic Concept—digital aggressions as actions that might warrant consultation under Article 4 of the Washington Treaty.55 Estonian experts have also taken on leadership roles in NATO's Brussels-based Cyber Defense Management Authority (CDMA), and Tallinn has hosted the organization's Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) since August 2008. The CCDCOE serves as NATO's focal point for cooperation, data exchange, and research on cybersecurity. The center has done everything from organizing conferences of practitioners and academics, to publishing the notable Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyberwarfare, to planning the annual Locked Shields exercises. The latest Locked Shields iteration in April 2017 involved 800 cybersecurity specialists from 25 countries participating in a real-time simulation of more than 2,500 cyberattacks.56\nSimilarly, Estonia has pushed for further attention to ICT security within the EU system. These initiatives have included increased funding for the EU Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA), which has provided capacity-building training, produced joint exercises for member states, and supported the development of the EU's 2013 Cybersecurity Strategy.57 This year, the EU will review ENISA's mandate and will likely draft a revised cybersecurity strategy. In 2012 the EU established its European Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security, and Justice (eu-LISA). The Estonian government was a strong advocate for creating the eu-LISA, which manages organizational databases on justice and homeland affairs (most notably the Schengen Information System). Tallinn hosts the eu-LISA headquarters.\nEstonia's collaborative cybersecurity efforts include outreach and partnerships beyond its traditional European and transatlantic partnerships. This is based on a statement in the state's Cyber Security Strategy: “Through cooperation, Estonia promotes global cybersecurity and enhances its own competence.”58 Activities embodying this commitment include working with the “Association of Southeast Asian Nations in promoting the harmonization of laws concerning cyber crime” and creating the e-Governance Academy (eGA) think tank and consultancy.59 The eGA has provided training on best practices in paperless government and information security to more than 3,500 experts from over sixty countries, ranging from Azerbaijan to Benin.60 Estonian universities have also chosen English as the language of instruction in postgraduate cybersecurity courses, thereby attracting international students.\n## Learning from Estonia\nThe April 2007 DDoS attacks forever changed Estonia's path in the digital age. A small Baltic state, Estonia is counting on ICT for its prosperity, and its government has made one of its core missions the pursuit of safe, secure, and profitable use of technol\nogies in cyberspace. This article has covered many, but not all, complementary Estonian initiatives to protect its government and people from repetition of the 2007 events. From cyber militia to virtual embassies, no country is quite like Estonia in the information security realm.\nHave these activities facilitated a safer digital environment for Estonians? That is a tough question. Lloyd's of London reported that cybercrimes resulted in over $400 billion of global economic losses in 2015, with Juniper Research predicting such losses will balloon to $2.1 trillion by 2019.61 These staggering figures do not even attempt to encompass damages from politically motivated cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism. To date, Estonia's impressive variety of programs has produced a culture of cyber best practices, hardened the country against attacks, and developed resources for incident response. Tallinn has also performed exceptionally well in EU and NATO cybersecurity simulations. Still, deterrence is an exercise in unobserved counterfactuals and assigning values to probabilistic events. We may not truly understand the efficacy of Estonia's cybersecurity programs until they are put to the test in real world crises. Routine disruptions of Georgian military communications and hacks on the Ukrainian power grid indicate that such field testing may not be such a distant pipedream.\nWe may not truly understand the efficacy of Estonia's cybersecurity programs until they are put to the test in real world crises.\nBy its nature, cyberwarfare carries complications somewhat unlike those of conventional and nuclear military operations. Academics, governments, and international organizations have struggled to develop theories of deterrence in a domain with attribution problems, largely unknowable capabilities, and the power of highly asymmetric forces to inflict pain and punishment. Regardless, a number of notable scholars have argued fairly convincingly that cyberwarfare is either unlikely to occur or is of lesser importance than traditional elements of grand strategy.62 Until new, unified theories of cybersecurity emerge, states will likely focus on classic considerations of deterrence and dissuasion: punishment, denial, entanglement/interdependence, and international norms.63 If these are the ideal criteria, Estonia has indeed made admirable strides on all fronts of cyberdeterrence and dissuasion.\nThe Estonian case demonstrates both the potential severity of digital threats, as well as responses that states may take to safeguard against future cyberattacks. Few countries have pursued the breadth and depth of steps in the direction of Internet security that Estonia has in the wake of the April 2007 DDoS strikes. NATO has yet to develop an organization-wide cybersecurity strategy, and the United States does not have a macro-level policy or strategy for cyberdeterrence. When countering digital threats, states must first have a concrete strategy. Then, such a strategy will guide tailored national defense efforts, legal modifications, societal adaptation, and international partnerships. In the future, businesses, militaries, and civilian governments will inevitably depend increasingly on cyberspace, drawing attention to the importance of securing critical infrastructure. Clearly, it would be a mistake to conceive of information security as an issue confined to Twitter botnets, the latest WikiLeaks document dump, or “fake news” websites.\nEstonia is a first mover among states in taking steps to minimize threats to its diverse array of digital infrastructure.

Much has changed in terms of public awareness, political and corporate discourse, and the availability of policy and academic literature. From the Clinton and Macron hacks, to allegations of Russian-controlled Twitterbots spreading “fake news,” to the WannaCry ransomware attacks, threats emanating from the Internet have gone mainstream. But has the media attention given to political disinformation campaigns, digital vandalism, and industrial espionage come at a cost? Have we simply forgotten that anonymous and sophisticated hackers—often employed or supported by states—may have the ability to threaten power grids, online banking, and strategic weapon systems?\nTen years ago, the small Baltic state of Estonia fell victim to a state-sanctioned, or state-sponsored, cyberattack by Russian hackers. The 2007 strikes on Estonia were comparatively different than other incidents involving state actors. Titan Rain entailed coordinated cyberespionage of Chinese origin on US government information systems. The Stuxnet worm unleashed a precision attack on Iran’s centrifuges for uranium enrichment at the Natanz nuclear facility. And the North Korean hacks on Sony inflicted punitive damage on the Sony Corporation for its cinematic depiction of Kim Jong-un. In sharp contrast, what happened in Estonia was a gateway attack; by disabling services used by nearly all Estonians, the hackers gave the world a preview of the future extremes of cyberwarfare. While it is overblown to refer to what happened in Estonia as full-fledged cyberwar, the attacks raised the specter of digital targeting of a state’s critical infrastructure. It is this chilling possibility that prompted a multitude of complementary initiatives by Estonia to protect its population from a cyber redux.\n&gt; Ten years ago, the small Baltic state of Estonia fell victim to a state-sanctioned, or state-sponsored, cyberattack by Russian hackers.\nThis article explores the Estonian government’s efforts to safeguard their state from a future cyberattack of an equivalent or greater magnitude than the 2007 hacking. After reviewing the events of 2007, I discuss four different policy arenas: national cyber defense, legal modifications, societal adaptation, and international collaboration. I argue that the changing nature of Estonia’s national capabilities and readiness to counter disruptive Internet strikes sets the global FALL 2017, VOLUME XVIII, NUMBER III 67 standard. Looking back at Tallinn's activities over the past decade, there is much for the international community to admire and emulate.\n## Revisiting the Estonian Cyberattacks The 1996 announcement of Project Tiger Leap foreshadowed Estonia's emergence as the most tech-savvy country in Europe through state investment in information and communication technology (ICT).1 By 2007, 60 percent of Estonians were daily Internet users, while 97 percent of banking took place online.2 Additionally, the Estonian national identification card made possible a digital signature for paying taxes, submitting social service requests, and even voting—all entirely over the Internet.3 Tallinn also relied on the Internet for its critical infrastructure, including the power grid and water supply. “E-Estonia” is thus a paradoxical case for understanding contemporary digital security, as beneficial technological advancements opened the door to pronounced strategic vulnerabilities.\nIt is no secret that Estonia-Russia relations are fraught with tension. A former imperial Russian governorate, Estonia won independence from the nascent Soviet Union in 1920, only to face twin occupations in 1940 and 1944, lasting until the USSR dissolved. Moscow ruled with an iron first and relocated hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians to Estonia to “Russify” the state's culture.4 After the Cold War, Tallinn deprived these transplants of opportunities for citizenship, while Russia issued them passports.5 Estonia then joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 2004 to gain protection against Russia and obtained formal Atlantic Alliance defense contingency planning in 2010.6 It even took until 2014 before the two countries adopted a treaty delineating their geopolitical borders.7 The intersection of Tallinn's ICT reliance and sour relations with Moscow set the stage for the Bronze Night protests. Following victory in the March 2007 parliamentary elections, the conservative government of Prime Minister Andrus Ansip prepared to relocate Bronze Soldier, a statue commemorating the Soviet liberation of Estonia from the Nazis, on April 30. The plan was to move the memorial—seen as a hallmark of oppression by many Estonians—from Tõnismägi Park in central Tallinn to the secluded Defense Forces Cemetery of Tallinn. Among Estonia's large Russian minority (26 percent of the national population at the time), the move smacked of further ethnic discrimination, prompting large-scale riots from April 27 to 29 and smaller demonstrations thereafter.8 When the dust settled, there were more than 1,300 arrests, one hundred injuries, and one fatality.9 This conflict was not simply ethnopolitics and Molotov cocktails—the accompanying cyberattacks were more frightening than the physical riots themselves. For three weeks, “hacktivists” targeted “the government, the president, the parliament, police, banks, Internet service providers (ISPs), online media, as well as many small businesses and local government sites.”10 The culprits took control of computers in Egypt, Russia, and the United States and used them against Estonian servers and routers with email spam and ping and user datagram protocol flooding attacks.11 In this distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, websites normally handling 1,000 hits a day crashed upon receiving 2,000 hits per second.12 Online banking, credit card, and ATM transactions ground to a halt, while government email servers and websites went offline or were defaced.13 Estonian news media websites lost the ability to upload articles, while false TEN YEARS AFTER THE ESTONIAN CYBERATTACKS Russian-language media reports streamed in describing the destruction of the Bronze Soldier and the graves of Russian veterans.¹⁴ The Estonian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) needed to collaborate with private-sector volunteers; the governments of Finland, Germany, Israel, and Slovenia; and NATO and European Union (EU) institutions to restore normal network operations.¹⁵ This process involved temporary disconnection from international data links, allowing Estonia to “keep communications running domestically” as the CERT repaired infected systems.¹⁶ ## Assessing the Events of April 2007 Definitive attribution was unsuccessful owing to the hackers’ ability to control remote networks and hide behind masked Internet protocol (IP) addresses.

Free societies are not dictatorships that may simply create laws on the fly to meet evolving security challenges. One of the central problems was that Estonian laws prohibited certain surveillance and investigation procedures of suspected crimes if a conviction would result in fewer than three years' imprisonment; at the time, nearly all cybercrimes fell under this umbrella.39 With these limitations and attribution issues, Dmitri Galushkevich, a twenty-year-old ethnic Russian living in Tallinn, was the only perpetrator convicted for the DDoS strikes. Galushkevich received a fine of 17,500 kroons (roughly $1,650 at the time) for blocking the website of Prime Minister Ansip's political party.40 There thus arose a recognition that the country needed more than military hardening to protect itself from hackers. Estonia required a legal framework to deter cyberattacks, but also to identify and punish perpetrators in the event that deterrence failed.\nOne of the most significant changes in Estonian law was the modification of the country's penal code to punish criminal offenses involving computers “that did not clearly seek financial gain.”41 The revised penal code includes a number of sections dealing with cyberattacks and cybercrime. They are not limited to “interference with computer data,” “hindering of functions of computer systems,” “dissemination of spyware, malware or computer viruses,” “preparation of computer-related crime,” or “illegal obtaining of access to computer systems.”42 The code spells out new computer-related criminal offenses, offers stiff sentencing guidelines for digital crimes (including jail time), and paves the way for the Information System Authority to have enhanced powers of surveillance and investigation. Illegal cyberspace activities are also noted among the penal code's list of potential acts of terrorism.43 While the penal code focuses on deterrence, responsibility, and punishment, other legal changes are directed at data protection. For instance, there were updates in information access procedures to the Public Information Act and revisions to the Electronic Communications Act that “establish common security standards” that ISPs must follow.44 Furthermore, the Personal Data Protection Act now includes procedures that entities processing Estonians' personal data must abide by when collecting, safeguarding, and using such data.45 The Information System Authority has taken on a regulatory role with respect to these acts, monitoring relevant actors, and imposing sanctions or ordering corrective changes. Altogether, Estonian legal structures developed in the wake of the Bronze Soldier events have influenced and shaped international cyberlaw studies.46 ## Societal Adaptation As the discussion of national defense and legal changes in Estonia indicates, governments often take the lead in proactive and preventive cybersecurity policy. However, state activities alone are insufficient, as protecting against digital threats requires an overarching sense of societal awareness and vigilance. After all, even sensible Internet conduct by young schoolchildren may prevent the spread of Trojans and other malware that may compromise networks. The need for public awareness in a digital society raises the question: Are Estonians aware of threats to their banking system, government service provision, and critical infrastructure? If December 2016 survey data are any indication, the answer is a resounding yes. Respondents to a nationally representative survey ranked the most pressing threat facing Estonia as a cyberattack on the government or society.47 This is most likely due to the events of 2007 and resultant government public awareness campaigns. Today, it is not just the government and CDL volunteers who are concerned about the vitality of Estonia's digital infrastructure—it is society as a whole.\nIn 2014 the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications released its “Digital Agenda 2020 for Estonia.”48 This document recognizes that over 90 percent of Estonians have easy access to broadband Internet and other ICT, with the rate of Internet use at nearly 100 percent among young Estonians.49 The Digital Agenda further notes that more than 20 percent of Estonian exports now come from ICT sources and discusses a bevy of information security training programs at the national, regional, and local levels.50 These programs are designed for school pupils, their parents, teachers, the private sector, and even cybersecurity training instructors. Overall, the agenda showcases a national program to continually train, retrain, and educate the population through government initiatives, public-private partnerships, and societal verification of best practices.\nThe Cyber Security Strategy also points to the role of the Estonian Information Technology Foundation for Education.51 Previously named the Tiger Leap Foundation, this state-funded institute was instrumental in facilitating public awareness of digital technologies during Estonia's information revolution. Now the foundation provides cybersecurity training across all segments of society, whether by incorporating it into coding bootcamps for teenagers or offering courses to the elderly. In consultation with the foundation, the Tallinn University of Technology and Tartu University designed a new master's program in cybersecurity, which accepted its first cohort of students in 2009. Tallinn University of Technology built on this program in 2014, collaborating with Estonia's 2CENTRE Cybercrime Center of Excellence to stand up a postgraduate degree program in digital forensics.52 These educational opportunities help to ensure that the country and neighboring states have a cadre of well-equipped cybersecurity professionals.\n## International Collaboration and Outreach Digital interconnectivity means that computer issues do not stop at geopolitical borders, which is why international collaboration is a necessity.53 Much of Estonia's cooperation has taken place alongside its NATO partners, some of whom provided CERT assistance during the 2007 cyberattacks. In the aftermath of these events, there were conversations about extending Article 5 security guarantees to cyberattacks.54 Tallinn supported the Atlantic Alliance's decision to instead include—in its 2010 Strategic Concept—digital aggressions as actions that might warrant consultation under Article 4 of the Washington Treaty.55 Estonian experts have also taken on leadership roles in NATO's Brussels-based Cyber Defense Management Authority (CDMA), and Tallinn has hosted the organization's Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) since August 2008. The CCDCOE serves as NATO's focal point for cooperation, data exchange, and research on cybersecurity. The center has done everything from organizing conferences of practitioners and academics, to publishing the notable Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyberwarfare, to planning the annual Locked Shields exercises. The latest Locked Shields iteration in April 2017 involved 800 cybersecurity specialists from 25 countries participating in a real-time simulation of more than 2,500 cyberattacks.56 Similarly, Estonia has pushed for further attention to ICT security within the EU system. These initiatives have included increased funding for the EU Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA), which has provided capacity-building training, produced joint exercises for member states, and supported the development of the EU's 2013 Cybersecurity Strategy.57 This year, the EU will review ENISA's mandate and will likely draft a revised cybersecurity strategy. In 2012 the EU established its European Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security, and Justice (eu-LISA). The Estonian government was a strong advocate for creating the eu-LISA, which manages organizational databases on justice and homeland affairs (most notably the Schengen Information System). Tallinn hosts the eu-LISA headquarters.\nEstonia's collaborative cybersecurity efforts include outreach and partnerships beyond its traditional European and transatlantic partnerships. This is based on a statement in the state's Cyber Security Strategy: “Through cooperation, Estonia promotes global cybersecurity and enhances its own competence.”58 Activities embodying this commitment include working with the “Association of Southeast Asian Nations in promoting the harmonization of laws concerning cyber crime” and creating the e-Governance Academy (eGA) think tank and consultancy.59 The eGA has provided training on best practices in paperless government and information security to more than 3,500 experts from over sixty countries, ranging from Azerbaijan to Benin.60 Estonian universities have also chosen English as the language of instruction in postgraduate cybersecurity courses, thereby attracting international students.\n## Learning from Estonia The April 2007 DDoS attacks forever changed Estonia's path in the digital age. A small Baltic state, Estonia is counting on ICT for its prosperity, and its government has made one of its core missions the pursuit of safe, secure, and profitable use of technol ogies in cyberspace. This article has covered many, but not all, complementary Estonian initiatives to protect its government and people from repetition of the 2007 events.

To date, Estonia's impressive variety of programs has produced a culture of cyber best practices, hardened the country against attacks, and developed resources for incident response.

    "# Country in Focus\n\n## Ten Years after the Estonian Cyberattacks\n\n### Defense and Adaptation in the Age of Digital Insecurity\n\nStephen Herzog\n\nJust a decade ago, cybersecurity was a somewhat emergent field in global affairs. Much has changed in terms of public awareness, political and corporate discourse, and the availability of policy and academic literature. From the Clinton and Macron hacks, to allegations of Russian-controlled Twitterbots spreading “fake news,” to the WannaCry ransomware attacks, threats emanating from the Internet have gone mainstream. But has the media attention given to political disinformation campaigns, digital vandalism, and industrial espionage come at a cost? Have we simply forgotten that anonymous and sophisticated hackers—often employed or supported by states—may have the ability to threaten power grids, online banking, and strategic weapon systems?\n\nTen years ago, the small Baltic state of Estonia fell victim to a state-sanctioned, or state-sponsored, cyberattack by Russian hackers. The 2007 strikes on Estonia were comparatively different than other incidents involving state actors. Titan Rain entailed coordinated cyberespionage of Chinese origin on US government information systems. The Stuxnet worm unleashed a precision attack on Iran’s centrifuges for uranium enrichment at the Natanz nuclear facility. And the North Korean hacks on Sony inflicted punitive damage on the Sony Corporation for its cinematic depiction of Kim Jong-un. In sharp contrast, what happened in Estonia was a gateway attack; by disabling services used by nearly all Estonians, the hackers gave the world a preview of the future extremes of cyberwarfare. While it is overblown to refer to what happened in Estonia as full-fledged cyberwar, the attacks raised the specter of digital targeting of a state’s critical infrastructure. It is this chilling possibility that prompted a multitude of complementary initiatives by Estonia to protect its population from a cyber redux.\n\n&gt; Ten years ago, the small Baltic state of Estonia fell victim to a state-sanctioned, or state-sponsored, cyberattack by Russian hackers.\n\nThis article explores the Estonian government’s efforts to safeguard their state from a future cyberattack of an equivalent or greater magnitude than the 2007 hacking. After reviewing the events of 2007, I discuss four different policy arenas: national cyber defense, legal modifications, societal adaptation, and international collaboration. I argue that the changing nature of Estonia’s national capabilities and readiness to counter disruptive Internet strikes sets the global\n\nFALL 2017, VOLUME XVIII, NUMBER III 67",
    "standard. Looking back at Tallinn's activities over the past decade, there is much for the international community to admire and emulate.\n\n## Revisiting the Estonian Cyberattacks\n\nThe 1996 announcement of Project Tiger Leap foreshadowed Estonia's emergence as the most tech-savvy country in Europe through state investment in information and communication technology (ICT).1 By 2007, 60 percent of Estonians were daily Internet users, while 97 percent of banking took place online.2 Additionally, the Estonian national identification card made possible a digital signature for paying taxes, submitting social service requests, and even voting—all entirely over the Internet.3 Tallinn also relied on the Internet for its critical infrastructure, including the power grid and water supply. “E-Estonia” is thus a paradoxical case for understanding contemporary digital security, as beneficial technological advancements opened the door to pronounced strategic vulnerabilities.\n\nIt is no secret that Estonia-Russia relations are fraught with tension. A former imperial Russian governorate, Estonia won independence from the nascent Soviet Union in 1920, only to face twin occupations in 1940 and 1944, lasting until the USSR dissolved. Moscow ruled with an iron first and relocated hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians to Estonia to “Russify” the state's culture.4 After the Cold War, Tallinn deprived these transplants of opportunities for citizenship, while Russia issued them passports.5 Estonia then joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 2004 to gain protection against Russia and obtained formal Atlantic Alliance defense contingency planning in 2010.6 It even took until 2014 before the two countries adopted a treaty delineating their geopolitical borders.7\n\nThe intersection of Tallinn's ICT reliance and sour relations with Moscow set the stage for the Bronze Night protests. Following victory in the March 2007 parliamentary elections, the conservative government of Prime Minister Andrus Ansip prepared to relocate Bronze Soldier, a statue commemorating the Soviet liberation of Estonia from the Nazis, on April 30. The plan was to move the memorial—seen as a hallmark of oppression by many Estonians—from Tõnismägi Park in central Tallinn to the secluded Defense Forces Cemetery of Tallinn. Among Estonia's large Russian minority (26 percent of the national population at the time), the move smacked of further ethnic discrimination, prompting large-scale riots from April 27 to 29 and smaller demonstrations thereafter.8 When the dust settled, there were more than 1,300 arrests, one hundred injuries, and one fatality.9\n\nThis conflict was not simply ethnopolitics and Molotov cocktails—the accompanying cyberattacks were more frightening than the physical riots themselves. For three weeks, “hacktivists” targeted “the government, the president, the parliament, police, banks, Internet service providers (ISPs), online media, as well as many small businesses and local government sites.”10 The culprits took control of computers in Egypt, Russia, and the United States and used them against Estonian servers and routers with email spam and ping and user datagram protocol flooding attacks.11 In this distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, websites normally handling 1,000 hits a day crashed upon receiving 2,000 hits per second.12 Online banking, credit card, and ATM transactions ground to a halt, while government email servers and websites went offline or were defaced.13 Estonian news media websites lost the ability to upload articles, while false",
    "TEN YEARS AFTER THE ESTONIAN CYBERATTACKS\n\nRussian-language media reports streamed in describing the destruction of the Bronze Soldier and the graves of Russian veterans.¹⁴ The Estonian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) needed to collaborate with private-sector volunteers; the governments of Finland, Germany, Israel, and Slovenia; and NATO and European Union (EU) institutions to restore normal network operations.¹⁵ This process involved temporary disconnection from international data links, allowing Estonia to “keep communications running domestically” as the CERT repaired infected systems.¹⁶\n\n## Assessing the Events of April 2007\n\nDefinitive attribution was unsuccessful owing to the hackers’ ability to control remote networks and hide behind masked Internet protocol (IP) addresses. What is clear is that Russian-language Internet forums urged on the activities.¹⁷ While the Kremlin denied culpability, “Estonian officials like Foreign Minister Urmas Paet quickly accused Russia of perpetrating the attacks, but European Commission and NATO technical experts were unable to find credible evidence of Kremlin participation in the DDoS strikes.”¹⁸ This lack of evidence came despite many experts, including NATO officials, asserting that the attacks were beyond non-state actor capacities.¹⁹ However, Moscow refused to cooperate on attribution, accused Tallinn of human rights violations, and called on Ansip to resign.²⁰ As the DDoS raged on, Russian president Vladimir Putin condemned the Bronze Soldier’s relocation: “Those who desecrate monuments to the heroes of the war are insulting their own people and sowing discord and new distrust between states and people.”²¹ The Kremlin declined to intervene in violent protests outside the Estonian embassy in Moscow,\n\nwhich even saw an assault on Tallinn’s ambassador.²² In the end, Estonia made a few token arrests, with a single conviction carrying a minor fine.\n\nWere the cyberattacks successful? Initially, at the time of the attacks, White House cybersecurity official Howard Schmidt said, “Estonia has built their future on having a high-tech government and economy, and they’ve basically been brought to their knees because of these attacks.”²³ But was there any lasting damage? Assessments are hard to come by, but one bank reported estimated losses of $1 million.²⁴ The DDoS strikes did not target Estonian’s electricity, water supply, or military weapon systems; some analysts have thus labeled them as merely disruptive, or as a “cyber riot.”²⁵ While there is validity to this assessment, more extreme actions are not outside of the imagination, as “hacktivists” threatened nation-state sovereignty while coding in the comfort of their workspaces. The 2007 cyberattacks raised considerations about how NATO Article 5 mutual defense guarantees might apply in cyberspace.²⁶ Ultimately, “success” depends on the metric one uses. I visited the Bronze Soldier one cold afternoon in January 2015 at its home—the Defense Forces Cemetery of Tallinn. Although there were some wilting flowers and Russian flags laid at its base, one thing was apparent: If the hackers intended to digitally coerce Estonia, they had abjectly failed. Perhaps this is why we instead now see Russian disinformation campaigns against developed countries like Finland, France, Sweden, and the United States. On the other hand, Estonia was inevitably a training ground for future Russian cyberattacks in Kyrgyzstan and information\n\nIf the hackers intended to digitally coerce Estonia, they had abjectly failed.\n\nFALL 2017, VOLUME XVIII, NUMBER III 69",

Building up national defenses to protect against future attacks became a key element of foreign policy, and pursuant to the cabinet's July 2007 Action Plan to Fight Cyber-attacks, Estonia became one of the first countries to adopt a national Cyber Security Strategy.27 The country's first strategy was adopted in 2008 and covered the years 2009--2013, while the current strategy applies to 2014--2017.28 The latter improves on its predecessor and highlights five umbrella goals: Ensuring the protection of information systems underlying important servicesEnhancing the fight against cybercrimeDeveloping national cyber-defense capabilitiesManaging evolving cybersecurity threatsDeveloping develops cross-sectoral activities29\n\nThese overarching goals have been instrumental in shaping policies to define and combat threats in cyberspace, establishing new capabilities for protecting the Estonian government and society, and creating a broad platform for international collaboration.\n\nThe defense aspects of Estonian information security involve an array of agencies: the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, Information System Authority, and Police and Border Guard Board, to name a few. For this reason, in 2009, the government established a Cyber Security Council “to contribute to smooth cooperation between various institutions and conduct surveillance over the implementation of the goals of the Cyber Security Strategy.”30 Under council guidance, the revised 2010 Estonian National Security Concept approved by parliament was inclusive of the need to protect vital services from digital threats.31 Some consequent policies were the military's buildup of defensive cyberwarfare capabilities to assist Estonia's CERT and the Information System Authority's efforts to identify service vulnerabilities.32 Meanwhile, the 2009 Emergency Act applies to cyberattacks and calls for emergency preparedness exercises and development of regional and local authorities for incident response.33\n\nTallinn has not limited its cyberdefense centralization to traditional state capabilities. Its Cyber Security Strategy discusses the role of the Estonian Cyber Defense League (CDL) “to support civilian institutions and protect critical infrastructure in a crisis situation.”34 The CDL is part of the Estonian Defense League (EDL), a voluntary paramilitary organization dating back to 1918 that has been an official component of the Estonian Defense Forces since 1992. The EDL established two regional units of the CDL in Tallinn and Tartu in 2009, which generally consist of private-sector ICT specialists who want to help defend Estonian sovereignty in cyberspace.35 These units have since participated in a variety of exercises with the government and assisted in public outreach. They are ready for mobilization should it be necessary.\n\nIn addition to looking at malicious activities in cyberspace through a kinetic lens, the Cyber Security Strategy contains several innovative provisions. Among the most interesting is a statement that reads:",
    "“E-services, processes, and information systems (including digital records of evidential value) that are essential for the digital continuity of the state are constantly updated and mapped, and they have mirror and backup alternatives. Virtual embassies will ensure the functioning of the state, regardless of Estonia's territorial integrity.”36 Tallinn has accordingly initiated talks to essentially host a copy of its state with countries such as Luxembourg and the United Kingdom.37 Even if Estonia faces invasion or a crippling cyberattack, the government is taking steps to ensure its digital survival and sovereignty. Further, the Cyber Security Strategy mandates identification of alternatives for cross-border service provision to secure continuity if hackers sever international supply lines.38\n\nEven if Estonia faces invasion or a crippling cyberattack, the government is taking steps to ensure its digital survival and sovereignty.\n\n## Changing Legal Framework: Responsibility, Punishment, Protection\n\nDefending against cyberattacks is a difficult endeavor, but how does a state investigate and prosecute such criminal activities, especially if the perpetrators operate from within its own borders? Estonia faced obstacles in performing these activities after the 2007 attacks owing to its lack of proper legal authorities and structures for managing incidents in cyberspace. Free societies are not dictatorships that may simply create laws on the fly to meet evolving security challenges. One of the central problems was that Estonian laws prohibited certain surveillance and investigation procedures of suspected crimes if a conviction would result in fewer than three years' imprisonment; at the time, nearly all cybercrimes fell under this umbrella.39 With these limitations and attribution issues, Dmitri Galushkevich, a twenty-year-old ethnic Russian living in Tallinn, was the only perpetrator convicted for the DDoS strikes. Galushkevich received a fine of 17,500 kroons (roughly $1,650 at the time) for blocking the website of Prime Minister Ansip's political party.40 There thus arose a recognition that the country needed more than military hardening to protect itself from hackers. Estonia required a legal framework to deter cyberattacks, but also to identify and punish perpetrators in the event that deterrence failed.\n\nOne of the most significant changes in Estonian law was the modification of the country's penal code to punish criminal offenses involving computers “that did not clearly seek financial gain.”41 The revised penal code includes a number of sections dealing with cyberattacks and cybercrime. They are not limited to “interference with computer data,” “hindering of functions of computer systems,” “dissemination of spyware, malware or computer viruses,” “preparation of computer-related crime,” or “illegal obtaining of access to computer systems.”42 The code spells out new computer-related criminal offenses, offers stiff sentencing guidelines for digital crimes (including jail time), and paves the way for the Information System Authority to have enhanced powers of surveillance and investigation. Illegal cyberspace activities are also noted among the penal code's list of potential acts of terrorism.43\n\nWhile the penal code focuses on deterrence, responsibility, and punishment, other legal changes are directed at data protection. For instance, there were updates in information access procedures to the Public Information Act and revisions to the Electronic Communications Act that “establish common security standards” that ISPs must follow.44 Furthermore, the Personal Data",
    "Protection Act now includes procedures that entities processing Estonians' personal data must abide by when collecting, safeguarding, and using such data.45 The Information System Authority has taken on a regulatory role with respect to these acts, monitoring relevant actors, and imposing sanctions or ordering corrective changes. Altogether, Estonian legal structures developed in the wake of the Bronze Soldier events have influenced and shaped international cyberlaw studies.46\n\n## Societal Adaptation\n\nAs the discussion of national defense and legal changes in Estonia indicates, governments often take the lead in proactive and preventive cybersecurity policy. However, state activities alone are insufficient, as protecting against digital threats requires an overarching sense of societal awareness and vigilance. After all, even sensible Internet conduct by young schoolchildren may prevent the spread of Trojans and other malware that may compromise networks. The need for public awareness in a digital society raises the question: Are Estonians aware of threats to their banking system, government service provision, and critical infrastructure? If December 2016 survey data are any indication, the answer is a resounding yes. Respondents to a nationally representative survey ranked the most pressing threat facing Estonia as a cyberattack on the government or society.47 This is most likely due to the events of 2007 and resultant government public awareness campaigns. Today, it is not just the government and CDL volunteers who are concerned about the vitality of Estonia's digital infrastructure—it is society as a whole.\n\nIn 2014 the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications released its “Digital Agenda 2020 for Estonia.”48 This document recognizes that over 90 percent of Estonians have easy access to broadband Internet and other ICT, with the rate of Internet use at nearly 100 percent among young Estonians.49 The Digital Agenda further notes that more than 20 percent of Estonian exports now come from ICT sources and discusses a bevy of information security training programs at the national, regional, and local levels.50 These programs are designed for school pupils, their parents, teachers, the private sector, and even cybersecurity training instructors. Overall, the agenda showcases a national program to continually train, retrain, and educate the population through government initiatives, public-private partnerships, and societal verification of best practices.\n\nThe Cyber Security Strategy also points to the role of the Estonian Information Technology Foundation for Education.51 Previously named the Tiger Leap Foundation, this state-funded institute was instrumental in facilitating public awareness of digital technologies during Estonia's information revolution. Now the foundation provides cybersecurity training across all segments of society, whether by incorporating it into coding bootcamps for teenagers or offering courses to the elderly. In consultation with the foundation, the Tallinn University of Technology and Tartu University designed a new master's program in cybersecurity, which accepted its first cohort of students in 2009. Tallinn University of Technology built on this program in 2014, collaborating with Estonia's 2CENTRE Cybercrime Center of Excellence to stand up a postgraduate degree program in digital forensics.52 These educational opportunities help to ensure that the country and neighboring states have a cadre of well-equipped cybersecurity professionals.",
    "## International Collaboration and Outreach\n\nDigital interconnectivity means that computer issues do not stop at geopolitical borders, which is why international collaboration is a necessity.53 Much of Estonia's cooperation has taken place alongside its NATO partners, some of whom provided CERT assistance during the 2007 cyberattacks. In the aftermath of these events, there were conversations about extending Article 5 security guarantees to cyberattacks.54 Tallinn supported the Atlantic Alliance's decision to instead include—in its 2010 Strategic Concept—digital aggressions as actions that might warrant consultation under Article 4 of the Washington Treaty.55 Estonian experts have also taken on leadership roles in NATO's Brussels-based Cyber Defense Management Authority (CDMA), and Tallinn has hosted the organization's Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) since August 2008. The CCDCOE serves as NATO's focal point for cooperation, data exchange, and research on cybersecurity. The center has done everything from organizing conferences of practitioners and academics, to publishing the notable Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyberwarfare, to planning the annual Locked Shields exercises. The latest Locked Shields iteration in April 2017 involved 800 cybersecurity specialists from 25 countries participating in a real-time simulation of more than 2,500 cyberattacks.56\n\nSimilarly, Estonia has pushed for further attention to ICT security within the EU system. These initiatives have included increased funding for the EU Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA), which has provided capacity-building training, produced joint exercises for member states, and supported the development of the EU's 2013 Cybersecurity Strategy.57 This year, the EU will review ENISA's mandate and will likely draft a revised cybersecurity strategy. In 2012 the EU established its European Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security, and Justice (eu-LISA). The Estonian government was a strong advocate for creating the eu-LISA, which manages organizational databases on justice and homeland affairs (most notably the Schengen Information System). Tallinn hosts the eu-LISA headquarters.\n\nEstonia's collaborative cybersecurity efforts include outreach and partnerships beyond its traditional European and transatlantic partnerships. This is based on a statement in the state's Cyber Security Strategy: “Through cooperation, Estonia promotes global cybersecurity and enhances its own competence.”58 Activities embodying this commitment include working with the “Association of Southeast Asian Nations in promoting the harmonization of laws concerning cyber crime” and creating the e-Governance Academy (eGA) think tank and consultancy.59 The eGA has provided training on best practices in paperless government and information security to more than 3,500 experts from over sixty countries, ranging from Azerbaijan to Benin.60 Estonian universities have also chosen English as the language of instruction in postgraduate cybersecurity courses, thereby attracting international students.\n\n## Learning from Estonia\n\nThe April 2007 DDoS attacks forever changed Estonia's path in the digital age. A small Baltic state, Estonia is counting on ICT for its prosperity, and its government has made one of its core missions the pursuit of safe, secure, and profitable use of technol",
    "ogies in cyberspace. This article has covered many, but not all, complementary Estonian initiatives to protect its government and people from repetition of the 2007 events. From cyber militia to virtual embassies, no country is quite like Estonia in the information security realm.\n\nHave these activities facilitated a safer digital environment for Estonians? That is a tough question. Lloyd's of London reported that cybercrimes resulted in over $400 billion of global economic losses in 2015, with Juniper Research predicting such losses will balloon to $2.1 trillion by 2019.61 These staggering figures do not even attempt to encompass damages from politically motivated cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism. To date, Estonia's impressive variety of programs has produced a culture of cyber best practices, hardened the country against attacks, and developed resources for incident response. Tallinn has also performed exceptionally well in EU and NATO cybersecurity simulations. Still, deterrence is an exercise in unobserved counterfactuals and assigning values to probabilistic events. We may not truly understand the efficacy of Estonia's cybersecurity programs until they are put to the test in real world crises. Routine disruptions of Georgian military communications and hacks on the Ukrainian power grid indicate that such field testing may not be such a distant pipedream.\n\nWe may not truly understand the efficacy of Estonia's cybersecurity programs until they are put to the test in real world crises.\n\nBy its nature, cyberwarfare carries complications somewhat unlike those of conventional and nuclear military operations. Academics, governments, and international organizations have struggled to develop theories of deterrence in a domain with attribution problems, largely unknowable capabilities, and the power of highly asymmetric forces to inflict pain and punishment. Regardless, a number of notable scholars have argued fairly convincingly that cyberwarfare is either unlikely to occur or is of lesser importance than traditional elements of grand strategy.62 Until new, unified theories of cybersecurity emerge, states will likely focus on classic considerations of deterrence and dissuasion: punishment, denial, entanglement/interdependence, and international norms.63 If these are the ideal criteria, Estonia has indeed made admirable strides on all fronts of cyberdeterrence and dissuasion.\n\nThe Estonian case demonstrates both the potential severity of digital threats, as well as responses that states may take to safeguard against future cyberattacks. Few countries have pursued the breadth and depth of steps in the direction of Internet security that Estonia has in the wake of the April 2007 DDoS strikes. NATO has yet to develop an organization-wide cybersecurity strategy, and the United States does not have a macro-level policy or strategy for cyberdeterrence. When countering digital threats, states must first have a concrete strategy. Then, such a strategy will guide tailored national defense efforts, legal modifications, societal adaptation, and international partnerships. In the future, businesses, militaries, and civilian governments will inevitably depend increasingly on cyberspace, drawing attention to the importance of securing critical infrastructure. Clearly, it would be a mistake to conceive of information security as an issue confined to Twitter botnets, the latest WikiLeaks document dump, or “fake news” websites.\n\nEstonia is a first mover among states in taking steps to minimize threats to its diverse array of digital infrastructure.

Estonian policies of this nature included conditioning citizenship on proficiency in the Estonian language. After years of objections from Russia and various human rights organizations in the forum of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Tallinn eventually reversed many of these policies. Still, many ethnic Russians in Estonia are functionally “stateless” as a result. For a further discussion of the integration of ethnic Russians in Estonia, see, e.g., David J.
