Whilst some of these threats are linked to wrongful acts directly attributable to States, many attacks and intrusions are authored by private persons. These threats from non-State actors catalyse the call for due diligence standards for States in terms of prevention, monitoring, and international cooperation. Responsibility of States for acts by private persons should rest on 'overall control' rather than 'effective control'. Due diligence standards with respect to cyber security can draw on several interconnected conceptual bases for due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty: respect for international common goods, obligations to prevent private acts aiming at transboundary harm (as recognised in the Corfu Channel case), freedom of communication, and the responsibility for shared sources. Due diligence includes the obligation to take appropriate measures which are commensurate with the risk to be averted. It also encompasses vigilance and prevention as well as an exchange of information and warnings. Regulatory approaches must identify responsible actors (private persons, States of origin of cyber threats, and corporate targets). International cooperation can be based on international agreements or instruments of 'soft law'. For the design of the institutional framework, strong reasons suggest a multi-stakeholder approach which integrates private bodies, non-governmental organisations, or hybrid organisations.\nKEYWORDS: Cyber Security, State Responsibility, Standards of Control, Due Diligence, Prevention, Warning, International Cooperation\n* Professor for Public Law; Director of the Institute for Public International Law, University of Bonn.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n## I. Different Threats to Cyber Security\nIn the design of cyberspace and digital infrastructures unhampered access and free flow of data are key principles when determining function and utilisation. These functional criteria have so far trumped other objectives such as resilience to risks of abuse and security. This makes digital networks an easy and tempting target for attacks which aim at siphoning off data or at functional disruption by States, non-governmental entities, or individuals.\nThis contribution will not focus on the current debate on legitimate or illegitimate harvesting of data. Nor will it comment on the complex relationship between allied States which includes unilateral or mutual data fishing as well as sharing informations relevant to their national security interests.\nDiscussion in international law on cyberspace¹ has, until recently, focused on cyber attacks in context with armed conflicts. Only in recent years, has the debate in public international law extended to threats beyond a military context. It seems appropriate to distinguish between different kinds of threats to security and stability of cyber systems:\n1. Attacks directly against the integrity of cyber systems in terms of intentionally inflicted damage to computer systems or networks or digital information and\n2. Intrusions intended to abuse and exploit digital networks and other systems without affecting the integrity of the infrastructures as such, e.g. for purposes of cyber espionage (cyber trespassing, cyber exploitation).\nIn both cases, we must further distinguish between wrongful acts attributable to States and responsibility flowing from due diligence standards of monitoring and international cooperation.\n---\n¹ Catherine B.

Responsibility for Wrongful Acts Attributable to States\n### A. Primary Norms Related to Cyber Security\nState responsibility, in principle, rests on the violation of a ‘primary’ norm of international law (Article 1 ILC Articles on State Responsibility²). There are a number of such primary norms related to cyber security in specific sectors of international law, especially with respect to treaties and security council resolutions against terrorism, the law of the sea, the law of air transport, and telecommunications law.\nFor present purposes, it seems more important to focus on the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs of other States and, possibly, human rights which prohibit States from threatening or damaging the life and property of persons abroad as well as civil and military assets of other States including clinical infrastructures. As far as these protected rights and goods are affected, customary international law taints attacks against the integrity of computer networks with illegality.\nThe legal situation is quite different with respect to other cross-border intrusions and abuses of digital infrastructures, especially for the purpose of military or industrial espionage. In this context, acts directed against cyber security, as a rule, do not appear on the regulatory screen of international law. The international perspective merely qualifies espionage as acts fraught with high risks for the perpetrators and defers to sanctions under national law.³ In both times of peace and war, espionage is not a regulatory theme of customary international law (which simply leaves the target State free to prosecute the spy or to declare him *persona non grata* if he is vested with diplomatic immunity). Therefore, protection of confidentiality and privacy of data flows can only be established on the basis of international treaties.\n---\n² International Law Commission (ILC) Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 43 et seq.

Attribution and State Responsibility\n### 1. Actions of State Organs\nAs a rule, State responsibility for the violation of international law will be triggered by the acts of State organs (Article 2 ILC Articles on State Responsibility).\n### 2. Actions by Private Persons and Non-Governmental Entities: Control by the State\nActs of private persons and non-State entities establish State responsibility only where there is a certain degree of authority and control over the private activities, e.g. hackers instigated and sponsored by their home government. The ILC Articles on State Responsibility simply refer to actions “on the instructions of, or under the direction and control” of the State concerned.⁴ This necessary degree of “direction and control” is, however, a matter of controversy.\nAt least in the context of armed activities, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) clearly favours very narrow conditions for attribution, e.g. the establishment of ‘effective control’ that also extends to specific operations carried out by private persons or entities.⁵\nBy contrast, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia adopted a more lenient standard of attribution, the ‘overall control’ test.⁶ There is a growing tendency in international law to follow the more flexible ‘overall control’, which emerged in the context of the attribution of armed attacks to States ‘harbour-\n⁴ Art. 8 ILC Articles on State Responsibility: “The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of that State in carrying out the conduct”.\n⁵ International Court of Justice (ICJ), Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Otherwise the requisite evidence would amount to a kind of probatio diabolica.\nOf course, traceability is a most complex and contentious issue where concerns of privacy and free communication in an open society clash with interests of national and international security. Traceability vests democratic governments and authoritarian regimes alike with instruments of supervision, albeit for quite different purposes. In any case, traceability can realistically be conceptualised in an asymmetric way. The European debate on the processing of electronic communication and privacy8 amply demonstrates the controversial nature of the issue.\nIn the context of traceability, we must also consider preexisting imbalances in the non-negotiated access of certain governments to transatlantic glass fibre-cables and other communication facilities. The State in which a service provider is incorporated or has its seat of management has usually more leverage as to the disclosure of data by the provider. If a State siphons off electronic communication networks located on its own territory or glass fibre cables running through its territorial sea, it acts within its\n7 Johann-Christoph Woltag, Cyber Warfare, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), MPEPIL, Vol. II (2012), 988, para. 22; Alexander Kees, Responsibility of States for Private Actors, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), MPEPIL, Vol. VIII (2012), 959, para. 18; Stefan Talmon, The Various Control Tests in the Law of State Responsibility and the Responsibility of Outside powers for Acts of Secessionist Entities, International and Comparative Law Quarterly 58 (2009), 493; Shackelford/Andres (note 1), 988; Laurie R.

Similarly, a State may be tapping into cables running through its exclusive economic zone.⁹\n## III. Due Diligence and Cyber Security\n## A. Prevention of Transboundary Harm – Conceptual Basis\nIn contemporary international law, a general principle has emerged which requires States to exercise due diligence to avoid transboundary harm to life and tangible assets of persons domiciled abroad and of foreign States. This principle can be inferred, by way of extrapolation, from a broad range of due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty and the possible control of private actors.\nThere are four interconnected conceptual bases for due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty\n1. Respect for international and domestic common goods, such as the environment in inter-State relations,\n2. Prevention of private actions directed against assets of foreign States or life and property of persons located in foreign territory,\n3. Freedom of communications, and\n4. Responsibility for resources shared with other States.\nDue diligence with respect to cyber security stands in close connection with all four rationales.\n## 1. Respect for the Environment of Other States and for International Common Goods\nBy now, due respect for the environment of other States and global public goods may be considered as part of customary international law. Several United Nations\n⁹ See Arts. 58 (1), 79 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 10 December 1982, UNTS 1833, 3 (UNCLOS).\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n(UN) conferences have endorsed such an obligation. Thus, Principle 2 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development¹⁰ declares:\nStates have [...] the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.\nPrinciple 21 Stockholm Declaration¹¹ follows the same line:\nStates have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.\nA great number of environmental treaties embody this principle and call for appropriate measures to prevent damage to the environment.¹² In its Nuclear Weapons advisory opinion, the ICJ stated:¹³\nThe Court recognizes that the environment is under daily threat and that the use of nuclear weapons could constitute a catastrophe for the environment. The Court also recognizes that the environment is not an abstraction but represents the living space, the quality of life and the very health of human beings, including generations unborn.

In the Pulp Mills case,^[15] the Court held:\nThe Court considers that the obligation laid down in Article 36 [of the Statute on the Rio Uruguay agreed between Argentina and Uruguay] is addressed to both Parties and prescribes the specific conduct of co-ordinating the necessary measures through the Commission to avoid changes to the ecological balance. An obligation to adopt regulatory or administrative measures either individually or jointly and to enforce them is an obligation of conduct. Both Parties are therefore called upon, under Article 36, to exercise due diligence in acting through the Commission for the necessary measures to preserve the ecological balance of the river.\nThis vigilance and prevention is all the more important in the preservation of the ecological balance, since the negative impact of human activities on the waters of the river may affect other components of the ecosystem of the watercourse such as its flora, fauna, and soil. The obligation to co-ordinate, through the Commission, the adoption of the necessary measures, as well as their enforcement and observance, assumes, in this context, a central role in the overall system of protection of the River Uruguay established by the 1975 Statute [...]\nThe Court concluded:\nIt is the opinion of the Court that in order for the Parties properly to comply with their obligations under Article 41 (a) and (b) of the 1975 Statute, they must, for the purposes of protecting and preserving the aquatic environment with respect to activities which may be liable to cause transboundary harm, carry out an environmental impact assessment. [...] In this sense, the obligation to protect and preserve, under Article 41 (a) of the Statute, has to be interpreted in accordance with a practice, which in recent years has gained so much acceptance among States that it may now be considered a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource. Moreover, due diligence, and the duty of vigilance and prevention which it implies, would not be considered to have been exercised, if a party planning works liable to affect the regime of the river or the quality of its waters did not undertake an environmental impact assessment on the potential effects of such works.\n^[14] ICJ, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* (note 13), 226, para. 29.\n^[15] Id., *Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, ICJ Reports 2010, 14, paras. 187 et seq., 204.\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\nThe required standard for prevention is due diligence. In the context of environmental risks associated with deep seabed mining and exploration, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) adopted this standard in its advisory opinion on the Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area.¹⁶ The Tribunal applied the due diligence standard to the supervision of mining companies by their home State or another sponsoring State and related it to “reasonably appropriate measures” in terms of Article 153 (4) UNCLOS and Annex III Article 4 (4) UNCLOS.¹⁷\nCyberspace and the protection of cyber security stand in close analogy with the environment and environmental protection, at least to the extent that they constitute international public goods and global commons.\n¹⁶ International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, Advisory Opinion of 1 February 2011, para. 117, available at: https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no_17/17_adv_op_010211_en.pdf (accessed on 12 November 2015).\n¹⁷ Ibid., paras. 118 et seq.: “118. Article 153, paragraph 4, last sentence, of the Convention states that the obligation of the sponsoring State in accordance with article 139 of the Convention entails ‘taking all measures necessary to ensure’ compliance by the sponsored contractor. Annex III, article 4, paragraph 4, of the Convention makes it clear that sponsoring States’ ‘responsibility to ensure’ applies ‘within their legal systems’. With these indications [emphasis added] the Convention provides some elements concerning the content of the ‘due diligence’ obligation to ensure. Necessary measures are required and these must be adopted within the legal system of the sponsoring State.\n119. Further light on the expression ‘measures necessary to ensure’ is shed by the Convention if one considers article 139, paragraph 2, last sentence, and Annex III, article 4, paragraph 4, last sentence, of the Convention. The main purpose of these provisions is to exempt sponsoring States that have taken certain measures from liability for damage. The description of the measures to be taken by that State may also be used to clarify its ‘due diligence’ obligation. This description remains in general terms in article 139, paragraph 2, of the Convention which mentions ‘all necessary and appropriate measures to secure effective compliance under article 153, paragraph 4, and Annex III, article 4, paragraph 4’. The latter provision is more specific as it requires the sponsoring State to adopt ‘laws and regulations’ and to take ‘administrative measures which are, within the framework of its legal system, reasonably appropriate for securing compliance by persons under its jurisdiction’.\n120. More specific indications concerning the content of these measures, including aspects relating to their enforcement, with respect to the contents of these measures will be provided in the reply to Question 3. As regards Question 1, it has been established that the ‘due diligence’ obligation ‘to ensure’ requires the sponsoring State to take measures within its legal system and that the measures must be ‘reasonably appropriate’.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n## 2. Prevention of Acts Aimed at Transboundary Harm\nUnder customary international law, States have an obligation to prevent acts carried out within their territory which are designed to cause transboundary harm. The *locus classicus* is to be found in the judgment of the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case (Merits). The Court recognised that States have obligations as to the notification of the existence of a mine field in their territorial waters and to the warning of approaching warships. It based these obligations on\nelementary considerations of humanity, even more exacting in peace than in war; [...] and every State's obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.^[18]^\nThe *Corfu Channel* judgment made the obligation to prevent acts encroaching on the rights of other States dependent on knowledge of such use of its territory. The dissenting opinions of Judge *Winiarski*^[19]^ and *Krylov*^[20]^ focused on the standard of due diligence (\"ought to have seen or heard\"). In the context of the obligation to prevent cross-border armed traffic, the ICJ adopted the due diligence standard in the *Nicaragua Case*.^[21]^\nThe Draft Articles of the International Law Commission (ILC) on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities^[22]^ require the State of origin to \"take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimise the risk thereof\" (Article 3 Draft Articles). As a matter of consequential logic this standard, formulated in the context of high-risk activities not prohibited by international law (Article 1 Draft Articles) must apply to acts which purport to cause significant transboundary harm.\n^[18]^ ICJ, *The Corfu Channel Case* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v. Albania), Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 22.\n^[19]^ *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), Dissenting Opinion of Judge *Winiarski*, ICJ Reports 1949, 4, 51.\n^[20]^ *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), Dissenting Opinion of Judge *Krylov*, ICJ Reports 1949, 4, 71 et seq.\n^[21]^ *Id.*, *Nicaragua Case* (note 5), 14, para. 157.\n^[22]^ ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 148 et seq.\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK 179\nNATO’s Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare²³ states in Rule 5 Tallinn Manual: “A State shall not knowingly allow the cyber instructions located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that aversely and unlawfully affect other States.”\nRule 5 is an echo of the *Corfu Channel* judgment. Under current international law, the narrow criterion of positive knowledge of harmful activities as condition for duties of prevention seems to be justified only in the context of activities which 1. affect other States within the territory, the territorial waters, or the exclusive economic zone of the State concerned or which 2. cause no significant physical harm. In cases of transboundary physical harm, the standard of due diligence applies.\n## 3. Freedom of Communication\nIn the *Corfu Channel* case, the ICJ based the duty of a State to avert damage from activities carried out within its territory (obligations of notification and warning) also on “the principle of the freedom of maritime communication”.²⁴\n## 4. Responsibility for Shared Resources\nFinally, obligations of States to avert or minimise the harmful effects from activities carried out within their territory can arise from the common responsibility for shared resources. In this context, cyberspace can be compared to shared resources such as water resources shared by two or more States. Article 7 (1) Draft Articles of the ILC on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses,²⁵ reads: “Watercourse States shall exercise due diligence to utilize an international water course in such a way as not to cause significant harm to other watercourse States.”\n---\n²³ *Michael N. Schmitt* (ed.), (note 7).\n²⁴ ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), 22.\n²⁵ ILC, *The law of the non-navigational uses of international watercourses*, Yearbook of the International Law Commission (YILC) 1994, Vol. II (Part Two), para. 222, 102.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nThe Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses (in force since 17 August 2014) no longer refers to due diligence but obliges watercourse States “to take all appropriate measures to prevent the causing of significant harm to other watercourse States.”\nIn the Pulp Mills case, the ICJ underlined the obligation of vigilance and prevention with respect to private activities which adversely affect a shared resource.²⁶ Cyberspace constitutes a physical and non-physical resource shared by the internet community (Article 1 Statute of the Internet Corporation for assigned Numbers and Names (ICANN)). The dispute settlement panel in ICM Registry v. ICANN classified ICANN’s functions as the administration of “an intrinsically international resource of immense importance to global communications and economies”.²⁷ It therefore seems appropriate to apply the due diligence standard broadly recognised in the context of other sources shared by several States to cyberspace.\n## B. Significance of Due Diligence\nUp to now, no precise criteria have been identified to define due diligence with respect to the prevention of cyber attacks and the maintenance of cyber security. Still, some elements can be distilled from international rulings in other contexts.\n## 1. Obligation to Take Appropriate Measures\nThe starting point for obligations to prevent and avert damage to other States and interference with their rights is the obligation to take appropriate measures. This standard is adopted in a number of international treaties on the protection of the environment,²⁸ the Draft Articles of the ILC on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities²⁹ (Article 3 Draft Articles), the ITLOS advisory opinion\n²⁶ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 204.\n²⁷ International Centre for Dispute Resolution, ICM Registry v.

Commensurability with the Risk to be Averted\nWith respect to obligations to prevent shipments of military equipment under the rules of neutrality, the award in the Alabama Arbitration (1872) held that the required measures must be commensurate with the risk to be averted.³² The same criterion appears in the Pulp Mills judgment of the ICJ.³³ In its advisory opinion on the Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, the ITLOS relates due diligence to the degree of risks associated with a particular activity:\nThe content of ‘due diligence’ obligations may not easily be described in precise terms. Among the factors that make such a description difficult is the fact that ‘due diligence’ is a variable concept. It may change over time as measures considered sufficiently diligent at a certain moment may become not diligent enough in light, for instance, of new scientific or\n³⁰ See supra, note 16.\n³¹ ICJ, United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States v. Iran), Judgment of 24 May 1980, ICJ Reports 1980, 3, para. 63.\n³² Geneva Arbitration Tribunal, Alabama claims of the United States of America against Great Britain, Arbitral Award of 14 September 1872, Reports of International Arbitral Awards XXIX, 125 et seq.\n³³ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 205: “The Court observes that neither the 1975 Statute nor general international law specify the scope and content of an environmental impact assessment. It points out moreover that Argentina and Uruguay are not parties to the Espoo Convention. Finally, the Court notes that the other instrument to which Argentina refers in support of its arguments, namely, the UNEP Goals and Principles, is not binding on the Parties, but, as guidelines issued by an international technical body, has to be taken into account by each Party in accordance with Article 41 (a) in adopting measures within its domestic regulatory framework. Moreover, this instrument provides only that the ‘environmental effects in an EIA should be assessed with a degree of detail commensurate with their likely environmental significance’ (Principle 5) without giving any indication of minimum core components of the assessment. Consequently, it is the view of the Court that it is for each State to determine in its domestic legislation or in the authorization process for the project, the specific content of the environmental impact assessment required in each case, having regard to the nature and magnitude of the proposed development and its likely adverse impact on the environment as well as to the need to exercise due diligence in conducting such an assessment. The Court also considers that an environmental impact assessment must be conducted prior to the implementation of a project. Moreover, once operations have started and, where necessary, throughout the life of the project, continuous monitoring of its effects on the environment shall be undertaken”.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\ntechnological knowledge. It may also change in relation to the risks involved in the activity. As regards activities in the Area, it seems reasonable to state that prospecting is, generally speaking, less risky than exploration activities which, in turn, entail less risk than exploitation. Moreover, activities in the Area concerning different kinds of minerals, for example, polymetallic nodules on the one hand and polymetallic sulphides or cobalt rich ferromanganese crusts on the other, may require different standards of diligence. The standard of due diligence has to be more severe for the riskier activities.³⁴\n## 3. Vigilance and Prevention\nDue diligence includes vigilance and prevention as held by the ICJ with respect to the maintenance of ecological balance in the *Pulp Mills* case.\nThis vigilance and prevention is all the more important in the preservation of the ecological balance, since the negative impact of human activities on the waters of the river may affect other components of the ecosystem of the watercourse such as its flora, fauna, and soil. The obligation to co-ordinate, through the Commission, the adoption of the necessary measures, as well as their enforcement and observance, assumes, in this context, a central role in the overall system of protection of the River Uruguay established by the 1975 Statute. It is therefore of crucial importance that the Parties respect this obligation.³⁵\nIn this case, the Court concluded that under customary environmental law, due diligence calls for an environmental impact assessment, when industrial activities risk having a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource.³⁶\n## 4.

Regulatory Approaches\n### A. Layers of Responsibility\n#### 1. Private Actors Including Service Providers\nThe responsibility of private actors which undertake cyber attacks has several dimensions which range from civil liability to criminal responsibility, e.g. under the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.³⁸ However, ‘Corporate cyber-responsibility’ of service providers will not be easy to establish, as requirements of reliable identification of e-mail account holders and of senders encounter political resistance and raise difficult legal issues.³⁹\n#### 2. Responsibility of States of Origin of Cyber Threats\nDe lege ferenda, the responsibility of States of origin of cyber threats can be established by treaty-based, institutional arrangements, e.g. for the exchange of risk relevant information. In addition, the establishment of an institutionalised supervision mechanism which monitors individual and corporate activities should be considered. A possible model is the National Contact Points for Corporate Social Responsibility system set out in the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development’s (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.⁴⁰\n---\n³⁸ Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, CETS No. 185.\n³⁹ See Debra Wong Yang/Brian M.

Due Diligence of Corporate Targets\nCorporate targets of cyber attacks should also be deemed to have a duty of diligence to prevent and minimise damages. This is, however, primarily a matter of national policy and domestic regulation.\n## B. Form of Regulation\nWhile intergovernmental cooperation can be based on international agreements, an alternative might be ‘soft law’ instruments such as guiding principles or codes of conduct of international organisations such as the OECD.\n## C. Institutional Framework\nIn the institutional design, an intergovernmental architecture may be constructed with a multi-stakeholder approach which integrates private bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force,⁴¹ non-governmental organisations, or hybrid organisations (ICANN) into fora for cooperation or for the development of technical standards.\nWhile the added value of a multi-stakeholder approach should not be over-estimated, it would enhance the pull to compliance with any international standards on due diligence and foster the effective protection of cyber-security.\n## V. Conclusion\nInternational law is still in a rather early stage in terms of responding to cyber-threats. States must apply due diligence in supervising threats to cyber-security which may affect other States and prevent substantial harm by transboundary activities, however the rules on State responsibility for attacs on cyber-security by private actors are rather rudimentary. It is submitted that ‘overall control’ rather than ‘effective\n⁴¹ For further information see https://www.ietf.org/ (accessed on 12 November 2015).\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\ncontrol' should be the appropriate standard of attribution and regulatory models for international cooperation should include governments, non-governmental organisations, private corporations as well as hybrid organisations such as ICANN.\n.\n# GENERAL ARTICLES\n.",

Whilst some of these threats are linked to wrongful acts directly attributable to States, many attacks and intrusions are authored by private persons. These threats from non-State actors catalyse the call for due diligence standards for States in terms of prevention, monitoring, and international cooperation. Responsibility of States for acts by private persons should rest on 'overall control' rather than 'effective control'. Due diligence standards with respect to cyber security can draw on several interconnected conceptual bases for due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty: respect for international common goods, obligations to prevent private acts aiming at transboundary harm (as recognised in the Corfu Channel case), freedom of communication, and the responsibility for shared sources. Due diligence includes the obligation to take appropriate measures which are commensurate with the risk to be averted. It also encompasses vigilance and prevention as well as an exchange of information and warnings. Regulatory approaches must identify responsible actors (private persons, States of origin of cyber threats, and corporate targets). International cooperation can be based on international agreements or instruments of 'soft law'. For the design of the institutional framework, strong reasons suggest a multi-stakeholder approach which integrates private bodies, non-governmental organisations, or hybrid organisations.\nKEYWORDS: Cyber Security, State Responsibility, Standards of Control, Due Diligence, Prevention, Warning, International Cooperation\n* Professor for Public Law; Director of the Institute for Public International Law, University of Bonn.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n## I. Different Threats to Cyber Security\nIn the design of cyberspace and digital infrastructures unhampered access and free flow of data are key principles when determining function and utilisation. These functional criteria have so far trumped other objectives such as resilience to risks of abuse and security. This makes digital networks an easy and tempting target for attacks which aim at siphoning off data or at functional disruption by States, non-governmental entities, or individuals.\nThis contribution will not focus on the current debate on legitimate or illegitimate harvesting of data. Nor will it comment on the complex relationship between allied States which includes unilateral or mutual data fishing as well as sharing informations relevant to their national security interests.\nDiscussion in international law on cyberspace has, until recently, focused on cyber attacks in context with armed conflicts. Only in recent years, has the debate in public international law extended to threats beyond a military context. It seems appropriate to distinguish between different kinds of threats to security and stability of cyber systems:\n1. Attacks directly against the integrity of cyber systems in terms of intentionally inflicted damage to computer systems or networks or digital information and\n2. Intrusions intended to abuse and exploit digital networks and other systems without affecting the integrity of the infrastructures as such, e.g. for purposes of cyber espionage (cyber trespassing, cyber exploitation).\nIn both cases, we must further distinguish between wrongful acts attributable to States and responsibility flowing from due diligence standards of monitoring and international cooperation.\n---\n Catherine B.

Responsibility for Wrongful Acts Attributable to States\n### A. Primary Norms Related to Cyber Security\nState responsibility, in principle, rests on the violation of a ‘primary’ norm of international law (Article 1 ILC Articles on State Responsibility). There are a number of such primary norms related to cyber security in specific sectors of international law, especially with respect to treaties and security council resolutions against terrorism, the law of the sea, the law of air transport, and telecommunications law.\nFor present purposes, it seems more important to focus on the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs of other States and, possibly, human rights which prohibit States from threatening or damaging the life and property of persons abroad as well as civil and military assets of other States including clinical infrastructures. As far as these protected rights and goods are affected, customary international law taints attacks against the integrity of computer networks with illegality.\nThe legal situation is quite different with respect to other cross-border intrusions and abuses of digital infrastructures, especially for the purpose of military or industrial espionage. In this context, acts directed against cyber security, as a rule, do not appear on the regulatory screen of international law. The international perspective merely qualifies espionage as acts fraught with high risks for the perpetrators and defers to sanctions under national law. In both times of peace and war, espionage is not a regulatory theme of customary international law (which simply leaves the target State free to prosecute the spy or to declare him *persona non grata* if he is vested with diplomatic immunity). Therefore, protection of confidentiality and privacy of data flows can only be established on the basis of international treaties.\n---\n International Law Commission (ILC) Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 43 et seq.

Attribution and State Responsibility\n### 1. Actions of State Organs\nAs a rule, State responsibility for the violation of international law will be triggered by the acts of State organs (Article 2 ILC Articles on State Responsibility).\n### 2. Actions by Private Persons and Non-Governmental Entities: Control by the State\nActs of private persons and non-State entities establish State responsibility only where there is a certain degree of authority and control over the private activities, e.g. hackers instigated and sponsored by their home government. The ILC Articles on State Responsibility simply refer to actions “on the instructions of, or under the direction and control” of the State concerned. This necessary degree of “direction and control” is, however, a matter of controversy.\nAt least in the context of armed activities, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) clearly favours very narrow conditions for attribution, e.g. the establishment of ‘effective control’ that also extends to specific operations carried out by private persons or entities.\nBy contrast, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia adopted a more lenient standard of attribution, the ‘overall control’ test. There is a growing tendency in international law to follow the more flexible ‘overall control’, which emerged in the context of the attribution of armed attacks to States ‘harbour-\n Art. 8 ILC Articles on State Responsibility: “The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of that State in carrying out the conduct”.\n International Court of Justice (ICJ), Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Otherwise the requisite evidence would amount to a kind of probatio diabolica.\nOf course, traceability is a most complex and contentious issue where concerns of privacy and free communication in an open society clash with interests of national and international security. Traceability vests democratic governments and authoritarian regimes alike with instruments of supervision, albeit for quite different purposes. In any case, traceability can realistically be conceptualised in an asymmetric way. The European debate on the processing of electronic communication and privacy8 amply demonstrates the controversial nature of the issue.\nIn the context of traceability, we must also consider preexisting imbalances in the non-negotiated access of certain governments to transatlantic glass fibre-cables and other communication facilities. The State in which a service provider is incorporated or has its seat of management has usually more leverage as to the disclosure of data by the provider. If a State siphons off electronic communication networks located on its own territory or glass fibre cables running through its territorial sea, it acts within its\n\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nown territorial jurisdiction. Similarly, a State may be tapping into cables running through its exclusive economic zone.\n## III. Due Diligence and Cyber Security\n## A. Prevention of Transboundary Harm – Conceptual Basis\nIn contemporary international law, a general principle has emerged which requires States to exercise due diligence to avoid transboundary harm to life and tangible assets of persons domiciled abroad and of foreign States. This principle can be inferred, by way of extrapolation, from a broad range of due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty and the possible control of private actors.\nThere are four interconnected conceptual bases for due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty\n1. Respect for international and domestic common goods, such as the environment in inter-State relations,\n2. Prevention of private actions directed against assets of foreign States or life and property of persons located in foreign territory,\n3. Freedom of communications, and\n4. Responsibility for resources shared with other States.\nDue diligence with respect to cyber security stands in close connection with all four rationales.\n## 1. Respect for the Environment of Other States and for International Common Goods\nBy now, due respect for the environment of other States and global public goods may be considered as part of customary international law. Several United Nations\n See Arts. 58 (1), 79 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 10 December 1982, UNTS 1833, 3 (UNCLOS).\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n(UN) conferences have endorsed such an obligation. Thus, Principle 2 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development declares:\nStates have [...] the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.\nPrinciple 21 Stockholm Declaration follows the same line:\nStates have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.\nA great number of environmental treaties embody this principle and call for appropriate measures to prevent damage to the environment. In its Nuclear Weapons advisory opinion, the ICJ stated:\nThe Court recognizes that the environment is under daily threat and that the use of nuclear weapons could constitute a catastrophe for the environment. The Court also recognizes that the environment is not an abstraction but represents the living space, the quality of life and the very health of human beings, including generations unborn.

In the Pulp Mills case,^[15] the Court held:\nThe Court considers that the obligation laid down in Article 36 [of the Statute on the Rio Uruguay agreed between Argentina and Uruguay] is addressed to both Parties and prescribes the specific conduct of co-ordinating the necessary measures through the Commission to avoid changes to the ecological balance. An obligation to adopt regulatory or administrative measures either individually or jointly and to enforce them is an obligation of conduct. Both Parties are therefore called upon, under Article 36, to exercise due diligence in acting through the Commission for the necessary measures to preserve the ecological balance of the river.\nThis vigilance and prevention is all the more important in the preservation of the ecological balance, since the negative impact of human activities on the waters of the river may affect other components of the ecosystem of the watercourse such as its flora, fauna, and soil. The obligation to co-ordinate, through the Commission, the adoption of the necessary measures, as well as their enforcement and observance, assumes, in this context, a central role in the overall system of protection of the River Uruguay established by the 1975 Statute [...]\nThe Court concluded:\nIt is the opinion of the Court that in order for the Parties properly to comply with their obligations under Article 41 (a) and (b) of the 1975 Statute, they must, for the purposes of protecting and preserving the aquatic environment with respect to activities which may be liable to cause transboundary harm, carry out an environmental impact assessment. [...] In this sense, the obligation to protect and preserve, under Article 41 (a) of the Statute, has to be interpreted in accordance with a practice, which in recent years has gained so much acceptance among States that it may now be considered a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource. Moreover, due diligence, and the duty of vigilance and prevention which it implies, would not be considered to have been exercised, if a party planning works liable to affect the regime of the river or the quality of its waters did not undertake an environmental impact assessment on the potential effects of such works.\n^[14] ICJ, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* (note 13), 226, para. 29.\n^[15] Id., *Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, ICJ Reports 2010, 14, paras. 187 et seq., 204.\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\nThe required standard for prevention is due diligence. In the context of environmental risks associated with deep seabed mining and exploration, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) adopted this standard in its advisory opinion on the Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area. The Tribunal applied the due diligence standard to the supervision of mining companies by their home State or another sponsoring State and related it to “reasonably appropriate measures” in terms of Article 153 (4) UNCLOS and Annex III Article 4 (4) UNCLOS.\nCyberspace and the protection of cyber security stand in close analogy with the environment and environmental protection, at least to the extent that they constitute international public goods and global commons.\n International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, Advisory Opinion of 1 February 2011, para. 117, available at: https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no_17/17_adv_op_010211_en.pdf (accessed on 12 November 2015).\n Ibid., paras. 118 et seq.: “118. Article 153, paragraph 4, last sentence, of the Convention states that the obligation of the sponsoring State in accordance with article 139 of the Convention entails ‘taking all measures necessary to ensure’ compliance by the sponsored contractor. Annex III, article 4, paragraph 4, of the Convention makes it clear that sponsoring States’ ‘responsibility to ensure’ applies ‘within their legal systems’. With these indications [emphasis added] the Convention provides some elements concerning the content of the ‘due diligence’ obligation to ensure. Necessary measures are required and these must be adopted within the legal system of the sponsoring State.\n119. Further light on the expression ‘measures necessary to ensure’ is shed by the Convention if one considers article 139, paragraph 2, last sentence, and Annex III, article 4, paragraph 4, last sentence, of the Convention. The main purpose of these provisions is to exempt sponsoring States that have taken certain measures from liability for damage. The description of the measures to be taken by that State may also be used to clarify its ‘due diligence’ obligation. This description remains in general terms in article 139, paragraph 2, of the Convention which mentions ‘all necessary and appropriate measures to secure effective compliance under article 153, paragraph 4, and Annex III, article 4, paragraph 4’. The latter provision is more specific as it requires the sponsoring State to adopt ‘laws and regulations’ and to take ‘administrative measures which are, within the framework of its legal system, reasonably appropriate for securing compliance by persons under its jurisdiction’.\n120. More specific indications concerning the content of these measures, including aspects relating to their enforcement, with respect to the contents of these measures will be provided in the reply to Question 3. As regards Question 1, it has been established that the ‘due diligence’ obligation ‘to ensure’ requires the sponsoring State to take measures within its legal system and that the measures must be ‘reasonably appropriate’.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n## 2. Prevention of Acts Aimed at Transboundary Harm\nUnder customary international law, States have an obligation to prevent acts carried out within their territory which are designed to cause transboundary harm. The *locus classicus* is to be found in the judgment of the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case (Merits). The Court recognised that States have obligations as to the notification of the existence of a mine field in their territorial waters and to the warning of approaching warships. It based these obligations on\nelementary considerations of humanity, even more exacting in peace than in war; [...] and every State's obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.^[18]^\nThe *Corfu Channel* judgment made the obligation to prevent acts encroaching on the rights of other States dependent on knowledge of such use of its territory. The dissenting opinions of Judge *Winiarski*^[19]^ and *Krylov*^[20]^ focused on the standard of due diligence (\"ought to have seen or heard\"). In the context of the obligation to prevent cross-border armed traffic, the ICJ adopted the due diligence standard in the *Nicaragua Case*.^[21]^\nThe Draft Articles of the International Law Commission (ILC) on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities^[22]^ require the State of origin to \"take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimise the risk thereof\" (Article 3 Draft Articles). As a matter of consequential logic this standard, formulated in the context of high-risk activities not prohibited by international law (Article 1 Draft Articles) must apply to acts which purport to cause significant transboundary harm.\n^[18]^ ICJ, *The Corfu Channel Case* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v. Albania), Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 22.\n^[19]^ *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), Dissenting Opinion of Judge *Winiarski*, ICJ Reports 1949, 4, 51.\n^[20]^ *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), Dissenting Opinion of Judge *Krylov*, ICJ Reports 1949, 4, 71 et seq.\n^[21]^ *Id.*, *Nicaragua Case* (note 5), 14, para. 157.\n^[22]^ ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 148 et seq.\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK 179\nNATO’s Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare states in Rule 5 Tallinn Manual: “A State shall not knowingly allow the cyber instructions located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that aversely and unlawfully affect other States.”\nRule 5 is an echo of the *Corfu Channel* judgment. Under current international law, the narrow criterion of positive knowledge of harmful activities as condition for duties of prevention seems to be justified only in the context of activities which 1. affect other States within the territory, the territorial waters, or the exclusive economic zone of the State concerned or which 2. cause no significant physical harm. In cases of transboundary physical harm, the standard of due diligence applies.\n## 3. Freedom of Communication\nIn the *Corfu Channel* case, the ICJ based the duty of a State to avert damage from activities carried out within its territory (obligations of notification and warning) also on “the principle of the freedom of maritime communication”.\n## 4. Responsibility for Shared Resources\nFinally, obligations of States to avert or minimise the harmful effects from activities carried out within their territory can arise from the common responsibility for shared resources. In this context, cyberspace can be compared to shared resources such as water resources shared by two or more States. Article 7 (1) Draft Articles of the ILC on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses, reads: “Watercourse States shall exercise due diligence to utilize an international water course in such a way as not to cause significant harm to other watercourse States.”\n---\n *Michael N. Schmitt* (ed.), (note 7).\n ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), 22.\n ILC, *The law of the non-navigational uses of international watercourses*, Yearbook of the International Law Commission (YILC) 1994, Vol. II (Part Two), para. 222, 102.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nThe Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses (in force since 17 August 2014) no longer refers to due diligence but obliges watercourse States “to take all appropriate measures to prevent the causing of significant harm to other watercourse States.”\nIn the Pulp Mills case, the ICJ underlined the obligation of vigilance and prevention with respect to private activities which adversely affect a shared resource. Cyberspace constitutes a physical and non-physical resource shared by the internet community (Article 1 Statute of the Internet Corporation for assigned Numbers and Names (ICANN)). The dispute settlement panel in ICM Registry v. ICANN classified ICANN’s functions as the administration of “an intrinsically international resource of immense importance to global communications and economies”. It therefore seems appropriate to apply the due diligence standard broadly recognised in the context of other sources shared by several States to cyberspace.\n## B. Significance of Due Diligence\nUp to now, no precise criteria have been identified to define due diligence with respect to the prevention of cyber attacks and the maintenance of cyber security. Still, some elements can be distilled from international rulings in other contexts.\n## 1. Obligation to Take Appropriate Measures\nThe starting point for obligations to prevent and avert damage to other States and interference with their rights is the obligation to take appropriate measures. This standard is adopted in a number of international treaties on the protection of the environment, the Draft Articles of the ILC on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities (Article 3 Draft Articles), the ITLOS advisory opinion\n ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 204.\n International Centre for Dispute Resolution, ICM Registry v. ICANN, Declaration of the Independent Review Panel, 19 February 2010, ICDR Case No. 50 117 T 00224 08, reprinted in: International Legal Materials 956, Vol. 49 (2010), para. 140.\n See supra, note 12.\n See supra, note 22.\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\non the Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area and the judgment of the ICJ in the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case.\n## 2. Commensurability with the Risk to be Averted\nWith respect to obligations to prevent shipments of military equipment under the rules of neutrality, the award in the Alabama Arbitration (1872) held that the required measures must be commensurate with the risk to be averted. The same criterion appears in the Pulp Mills judgment of the ICJ. In its advisory opinion on the Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, the ITLOS relates due diligence to the degree of risks associated with a particular activity:\nThe content of ‘due diligence’ obligations may not easily be described in precise terms. Among the factors that make such a description difficult is the fact that ‘due diligence’ is a variable concept. It may change over time as measures considered sufficiently diligent at a certain moment may become not diligent enough in light, for instance, of new scientific or\n See supra, note 16.\n ICJ, United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States v. Iran), Judgment of 24 May 1980, ICJ Reports 1980, 3, para. 63.\n Geneva Arbitration Tribunal, Alabama claims of the United States of America against Great Britain, Arbitral Award of 14 September 1872, Reports of International Arbitral Awards XXIX, 125 et seq.\n ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 205: “The Court observes that neither the 1975 Statute nor general international law specify the scope and content of an environmental impact assessment. It points out moreover that Argentina and Uruguay are not parties to the Espoo Convention. Finally, the Court notes that the other instrument to which Argentina refers in support of its arguments, namely, the UNEP Goals and Principles, is not binding on the Parties, but, as guidelines issued by an international technical body, has to be taken into account by each Party in accordance with Article 41 (a) in adopting measures within its domestic regulatory framework. Moreover, this instrument provides only that the ‘environmental effects in an EIA should be assessed with a degree of detail commensurate with their likely environmental significance’ (Principle 5) without giving any indication of minimum core components of the assessment. Consequently, it is the view of the Court that it is for each State to determine in its domestic legislation or in the authorization process for the project, the specific content of the environmental impact assessment required in each case, having regard to the nature and magnitude of the proposed development and its likely adverse impact on the environment as well as to the need to exercise due diligence in conducting such an assessment. The Court also considers that an environmental impact assessment must be conducted prior to the implementation of a project. Moreover, once operations have started and, where necessary, throughout the life of the project, continuous monitoring of its effects on the environment shall be undertaken”.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\ntechnological knowledge. It may also change in relation to the risks involved in the activity. As regards activities in the Area, it seems reasonable to state that prospecting is, generally speaking, less risky than exploration activities which, in turn, entail less risk than exploitation. Moreover, activities in the Area concerning different kinds of minerals, for example, polymetallic nodules on the one hand and polymetallic sulphides or cobalt rich ferromanganese crusts on the other, may require different standards of diligence. The standard of due diligence has to be more severe for the riskier activities.\n## 3. Vigilance and Prevention\nDue diligence includes vigilance and prevention as held by the ICJ with respect to the maintenance of ecological balance in the *Pulp Mills* case.\nThis vigilance and prevention is all the more important in the preservation of the ecological balance, since the negative impact of human activities on the waters of the river may affect other components of the ecosystem of the watercourse such as its flora, fauna, and soil. The obligation to co-ordinate, through the Commission, the adoption of the necessary measures, as well as their enforcement and observance, assumes, in this context, a central role in the overall system of protection of the River Uruguay established by the 1975 Statute. It is therefore of crucial importance that the Parties respect this obligation.\nIn this case, the Court concluded that under customary environmental law, due diligence calls for an environmental impact assessment, when industrial activities risk having a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource.\n## 4. Exchange of Information and Warning\nDue diligence with respect to the safeguarding of the rights of other States includes an exchange of information and warning, as the ICJ already stated in the *Corfu Channel* case.\n ITLOS, *Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area* (note 16), para. 117.\n ICJ, *Pulp Mills* (note 15), para. 188.\n *Ibid.*, para. 204.\n *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), 22.\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK 183\n## IV. Regulatory Approaches\n### A. Layers of Responsibility\n#### 1. Private Actors Including Service Providers\nThe responsibility of private actors which undertake cyber attacks has several dimensions which range from civil liability to criminal responsibility, e.g. under the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. However, ‘Corporate cyber-responsibility’ of service providers will not be easy to establish, as requirements of reliable identification of e-mail account holders and of senders encounter political resistance and raise difficult legal issues.\n#### 2. Responsibility of States of Origin of Cyber Threats\nDe lege ferenda, the responsibility of States of origin of cyber threats can be established by treaty-based, institutional arrangements, e.g. for the exchange of risk relevant information. In addition, the establishment of an institutionalised supervision mechanism which monitors individual and corporate activities should be considered. A possible model is the National Contact Points for Corporate Social Responsibility system set out in the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development’s (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n---\n Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, CETS No. 185.\n See Debra Wong Yang/Brian M.

Due Diligence of Corporate Targets\nCorporate targets of cyber attacks should also be deemed to have a duty of diligence to prevent and minimise damages. This is, however, primarily a matter of national policy and domestic regulation.\n## B. Form of Regulation\nWhile intergovernmental cooperation can be based on international agreements, an alternative might be ‘soft law’ instruments such as guiding principles or codes of conduct of international organisations such as the OECD.\n## C. Institutional Framework\nIn the institutional design, an intergovernmental architecture may be constructed with a multi-stakeholder approach which integrates private bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force, non-governmental organisations, or hybrid organisations (ICANN) into fora for cooperation or for the development of technical standards.\nWhile the added value of a multi-stakeholder approach should not be over-estimated, it would enhance the pull to compliance with any international standards on due diligence and foster the effective protection of cyber-security.\n## V. Conclusion\nInternational law is still in a rather early stage in terms of responding to cyber-threats. States must apply due diligence in supervising threats to cyber-security which may affect other States and prevent substantial harm by transboundary activities, however the rules on State responsibility for attacs on cyber-security by private actors are rather rudimentary. It is submitted that ‘overall control’ rather than ‘effective\n For further information see https://www.ietf.org/ (accessed on 12 November 2015).\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\ncontrol' should be the appropriate standard of attribution and regulatory models for international cooperation should include governments, non-governmental organisations, private corporations as well as hybrid organisations such as ICANN.\n.\n# GENERAL ARTICLES\n.",

Whilst some of these threats are linked to wrongful acts directly attributable to States, many attacks and intrusions are authored by private persons. These threats from non-State actors catalyse the call for due diligence standards for States in terms of prevention, monitoring, and international cooperation. Responsibility of States for acts by private persons should rest on 'overall control' rather than 'effective control'. Due diligence standards with respect to cyber security can draw on several interconnected conceptual bases for due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty: respect for international common goods, obligations to prevent private acts aiming at transboundary harm (as recognised in the Corfu Channel case), freedom of communication, and the responsibility for shared sources. Due diligence includes the obligation to take appropriate measures which are commensurate with the risk to be averted. It also encompasses vigilance and prevention as well as an exchange of information and warnings. Regulatory approaches must identify responsible actors (private persons, States of origin of cyber threats, and corporate targets). International cooperation can be based on international agreements or instruments of 'soft law'. For the design of the institutional framework, strong reasons suggest a multi-stakeholder approach which integrates private bodies, non-governmental organisations, or hybrid organisations.\nKEYWORDS: Cyber Security, State Responsibility, Standards of Control, Due Diligence, Prevention, Warning, International Cooperation\n* Professor for Public Law; Director of the Institute for Public International Law, University of Bonn.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015",
    "I. Different Threats to Cyber Security": "In the design of cyberspace and digital infrastructures unhampered access and free flow of data are key principles when determining function and utilisation. These functional criteria have so far trumped other objectives such as resilience to risks of abuse and security. This makes digital networks an easy and tempting target for attacks which aim at siphoning off data or at functional disruption by States, non-governmental entities, or individuals.\nThis contribution will not focus on the current debate on legitimate or illegitimate harvesting of data. Nor will it comment on the complex relationship between allied States which includes unilateral or mutual data fishing as well as sharing informations relevant to their national security interests.\nDiscussion in international law on cyberspace¹ has, until recently, focused on cyber attacks in context with armed conflicts. Only in recent years, has the debate in public international law extended to threats beyond a military context. It seems appropriate to distinguish between different kinds of threats to security and stability of cyber systems:\n1. Attacks directly against the integrity of cyber systems in terms of intentionally inflicted damage to computer systems or networks or digital information and\n2. Intrusions intended to abuse and exploit digital networks and other systems without affecting the integrity of the infrastructures as such, e.g. for purposes of cyber espionage (cyber trespassing, cyber exploitation).\nIn both cases, we must further distinguish between wrongful acts attributable to States and responsibility flowing from due diligence standards of monitoring and international cooperation.\n---\n¹ Catherine B.

    "II. Responsibility for Wrongful Acts Attributable to States": "### A. Primary Norms Related to Cyber Security\nState responsibility, in principle, rests on the violation of a ‘primary’ norm of international law (Article 1 ILC Articles on State Responsibility²). There are a number of such primary norms related to cyber security in specific sectors of international law, especially with respect to treaties and security council resolutions against terrorism, the law of the sea, the law of air transport, and telecommunications law.\nFor present purposes, it seems more important to focus on the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs of other States and, possibly, human rights which prohibit States from threatening or damaging the life and property of persons abroad as well as civil and military assets of other States including clinical infrastructures. As far as these protected rights and goods are affected, customary international law taints attacks against the integrity of computer networks with illegality.\nThe legal situation is quite different with respect to other cross-border intrusions and abuses of digital infrastructures, especially for the purpose of military or industrial espionage. In this context, acts directed against cyber security, as a rule, do not appear on the regulatory screen of international law. The international perspective merely qualifies espionage as acts fraught with high risks for the perpetrators and defers to sanctions under national law.³ In both times of peace and war, espionage is not a regulatory theme of customary international law (which simply leaves the target State free to prosecute the spy or to declare him *persona non grata* if he is vested with diplomatic immunity). Therefore, protection of confidentiality and privacy of data flows can only be established on the basis of international treaties.\n---\n² International Law Commission (ILC) Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 43 et seq.

Attribution and State Responsibility\n### 1. Actions of State Organs\nAs a rule, State responsibility for the violation of international law will be triggered by the acts of State organs (Article 2 ILC Articles on State Responsibility).\n### 2. Actions by Private Persons and Non-Governmental Entities: Control by the State\nActs of private persons and non-State entities establish State responsibility only where there is a certain degree of authority and control over the private activities, e.g. hackers instigated and sponsored by their home government. The ILC Articles on State Responsibility simply refer to actions “on the instructions of, or under the direction and control” of the State concerned.⁴ This necessary degree of “direction and control” is, however, a matter of controversy.\nAt least in the context of armed activities, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) clearly favours very narrow conditions for attribution, e.g. the establishment of ‘effective control’ that also extends to specific operations carried out by private persons or entities.⁵\nBy contrast, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia adopted a more lenient standard of attribution, the ‘overall control’ test.⁶ There is a growing tendency in international law to follow the more flexible ‘overall control’, which emerged in the context of the attribution of armed attacks to States ‘harbour-\n⁴ Art. 8 ILC Articles on State Responsibility: “The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of that State in carrying out the conduct”.\n⁵ International Court of Justice (ICJ), Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Otherwise the requisite evidence would amount to a kind of probatio diabolica.\nOf course, traceability is a most complex and contentious issue where concerns of privacy and free communication in an open society clash with interests of national and international security. Traceability vests democratic governments and authoritarian regimes alike with instruments of supervision, albeit for quite different purposes. In any case, traceability can realistically be conceptualised in an asymmetric way. The European debate on the processing of electronic communication and privacy8 amply demonstrates the controversial nature of the issue.\nIn the context of traceability, we must also consider preexisting imbalances in the non-negotiated access of certain governments to transatlantic glass fibre-cables and other communication facilities. The State in which a service provider is incorporated or has its seat of management has usually more leverage as to the disclosure of data by the provider. If a State siphons off electronic communication networks located on its own territory or glass fibre cables running through its territorial sea, it acts within its\n7 Johann-Christoph Woltag, Cyber Warfare, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), MPEPIL, Vol. II (2012), 988, para. 22; Alexander Kees, Responsibility of States for Private Actors, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), MPEPIL, Vol. VIII (2012), 959, para. 18; Stefan Talmon, The Various Control Tests in the Law of State Responsibility and the Responsibility of Outside powers for Acts of Secessionist Entities, International and Comparative Law Quarterly 58 (2009), 493; Shackelford/Andres (note 1), 988; Laurie R.

    "III. Due Diligence and Cyber Security": "## A. Prevention of Transboundary Harm – Conceptual Basis\nIn contemporary international law, a general principle has emerged which requires States to exercise due diligence to avoid transboundary harm to life and tangible assets of persons domiciled abroad and of foreign States. This principle can be inferred, by way of extrapolation, from a broad range of due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty and the possible control of private actors.\nThere are four interconnected conceptual bases for due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty\n1. Respect for international and domestic common goods, such as the environment in inter-State relations,\n2. Prevention of private actions directed against assets of foreign States or life and property of persons located in foreign territory,\n3. Freedom of communications, and\n4. Responsibility for resources shared with other States.\nDue diligence with respect to cyber security stands in close connection with all four rationales.\n## 1. Respect for the Environment of Other States and for International Common Goods\nBy now, due respect for the environment of other States and global public goods may be considered as part of customary international law. Several United Nations\n⁹ See Arts. 58 (1), 79 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 10 December 1982, UNTS 1833, 3 (UNCLOS).\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n(UN) conferences have endorsed such an obligation. Thus, Principle 2 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development¹⁰ declares:\nStates have [...] the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.\nPrinciple 21 Stockholm Declaration¹¹ follows the same line:\nStates have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.\nA great number of environmental treaties embody this principle and call for appropriate measures to prevent damage to the environment.¹² In its Nuclear Weapons advisory opinion, the ICJ stated:¹³\nThe Court recognizes that the environment is under daily threat and that the use of nuclear weapons could constitute a catastrophe for the environment. The Court also recognizes that the environment is not an abstraction but represents the living space, the quality of life and the very health of human beings, including generations unborn.

In the Pulp Mills case,^ the Court held:\nThe Court considers that the obligation laid down in Article 36 [of the Statute on the Rio Uruguay agreed between Argentina and Uruguay] is addressed to both Parties and prescribes the specific conduct of co-ordinating the necessary measures through the Commission to avoid changes to the ecological balance. An obligation to adopt regulatory or administrative measures either individually or jointly and to enforce them is an obligation of conduct. Both Parties are therefore called upon, under Article 36, to exercise due diligence in acting through the Commission for the necessary measures to preserve the ecological balance of the river.\nThis vigilance and prevention is all the more important in the preservation of the ecological balance, since the negative impact of human activities on the waters of the river may affect other components of the ecosystem of the watercourse such as its flora, fauna, and soil. The obligation to co-ordinate, through the Commission, the adoption of the necessary measures, as well as their enforcement and observance, assumes, in this context, a central role in the overall system of protection of the River Uruguay established by the 1975 Statute [...]\nThe Court concluded:\nIt is the opinion of the Court that in order for the Parties properly to comply with their obligations under Article 41 (a) and (b) of the 1975 Statute, they must, for the purposes of protecting and preserving the aquatic environment with respect to activities which may be liable to cause transboundary harm, carry out an environmental impact assessment. [...] In this sense, the obligation to protect and preserve, under Article 41 (a) of the Statute, has to be interpreted in accordance with a practice, which in recent years has gained so much acceptance among States that it may now be considered a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource. Moreover, due diligence, and the duty of vigilance and prevention which it implies, would not be considered to have been exercised, if a party planning works liable to affect the regime of the river or the quality of its waters did not undertake an environmental impact assessment on the potential effects of such works.\n^ ICJ, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* (note 13), 226, para. 29.\n^ Id., *Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, ICJ Reports 2010, 14, paras. 187 et seq., 204.\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\nThe required standard for prevention is due diligence. In the context of environmental risks associated with deep seabed mining and exploration, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) adopted this standard in its advisory opinion on the Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area.¹⁶ The Tribunal applied the due diligence standard to the supervision of mining companies by their home State or another sponsoring State and related it to “reasonably appropriate measures” in terms of Article 153 (4) UNCLOS and Annex III Article 4 (4) UNCLOS.¹⁷\nCyberspace and the protection of cyber security stand in close analogy with the environment and environmental protection, at least to the extent that they constitute international public goods and global commons.\n¹⁶ International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, Advisory Opinion of 1 February 2011, para. 117, available at: https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no_17/17_adv_op_010211_en.pdf (accessed on 12 November 2015).\n¹⁷ Ibid., paras. 118 et seq.: “118. Article 153, paragraph 4, last sentence, of the Convention states that the obligation of the sponsoring State in accordance with article 139 of the Convention entails ‘taking all measures necessary to ensure’ compliance by the sponsored contractor. Annex III, article 4, paragraph 4, of the Convention makes it clear that sponsoring States’ ‘responsibility to ensure’ applies ‘within their legal systems’. With these indications [emphasis added] the Convention provides some elements concerning the content of the ‘due diligence’ obligation to ensure. Necessary measures are required and these must be adopted within the legal system of the sponsoring State.\n119. Further light on the expression ‘measures necessary to ensure’ is shed by the Convention if one considers article 139, paragraph 2, last sentence, and Annex III, article 4, paragraph 4, last sentence, of the Convention. The main purpose of these provisions is to exempt sponsoring States that have taken certain measures from liability for damage. The description of the measures to be taken by that State may also be used to clarify its ‘due diligence’ obligation. This description remains in general terms in article 139, paragraph 2, of the Convention which mentions ‘all necessary and appropriate measures to secure effective compliance under article 153, paragraph 4, and Annex III, article 4, paragraph 4’. The latter provision is more specific as it requires the sponsoring State to adopt ‘laws and regulations’ and to take ‘administrative measures which are, within the framework of its legal system, reasonably appropriate for securing compliance by persons under its jurisdiction’.\n120. More specific indications concerning the content of these measures, including aspects relating to their enforcement, with respect to the contents of these measures will be provided in the reply to Question 3. As regards Question 1, it has been established that the ‘due diligence’ obligation ‘to ensure’ requires the sponsoring State to take measures within its legal system and that the measures must be ‘reasonably appropriate’.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n## 2. Prevention of Acts Aimed at Transboundary Harm\nUnder customary international law, States have an obligation to prevent acts carried out within their territory which are designed to cause transboundary harm. The *locus classicus* is to be found in the judgment of the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case (Merits). The Court recognised that States have obligations as to the notification of the existence of a mine field in their territorial waters and to the warning of approaching warships. It based these obligations on\nelementary considerations of humanity, even more exacting in peace than in war; [...] and every State's obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.^^\nThe *Corfu Channel* judgment made the obligation to prevent acts encroaching on the rights of other States dependent on knowledge of such use of its territory. The dissenting opinions of Judge *Winiarski*^^ and *Krylov*^^ focused on the standard of due diligence (\"ought to have seen or heard\"). In the context of the obligation to prevent cross-border armed traffic, the ICJ adopted the due diligence standard in the *Nicaragua Case*.^^\nThe Draft Articles of the International Law Commission (ILC) on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities^^ require the State of origin to \"take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimise the risk thereof\" (Article 3 Draft Articles). As a matter of consequential logic this standard, formulated in the context of high-risk activities not prohibited by international law (Article 1 Draft Articles) must apply to acts which purport to cause significant transboundary harm.\n^^ ICJ, *The Corfu Channel Case* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v. Albania), Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 22.\n^^ *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), Dissenting Opinion of Judge *Winiarski*, ICJ Reports 1949, 4, 51.\n^^ *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), Dissenting Opinion of Judge *Krylov*, ICJ Reports 1949, 4, 71 et seq.\n^^ *Id.*, *Nicaragua Case* (note 5), 14, para. 157.\n^^ ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 148 et seq.\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK 179\nNATO’s Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare²³ states in Rule 5 Tallinn Manual: “A State shall not knowingly allow the cyber instructions located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that aversely and unlawfully affect other States.”\nRule 5 is an echo of the *Corfu Channel* judgment. Under current international law, the narrow criterion of positive knowledge of harmful activities as condition for duties of prevention seems to be justified only in the context of activities which 1. affect other States within the territory, the territorial waters, or the exclusive economic zone of the State concerned or which 2. cause no significant physical harm. In cases of transboundary physical harm, the standard of due diligence applies.\n## 3. Freedom of Communication\nIn the *Corfu Channel* case, the ICJ based the duty of a State to avert damage from activities carried out within its territory (obligations of notification and warning) also on “the principle of the freedom of maritime communication”.²⁴\n## 4. Responsibility for Shared Resources\nFinally, obligations of States to avert or minimise the harmful effects from activities carried out within their territory can arise from the common responsibility for shared resources. In this context, cyberspace can be compared to shared resources such as water resources shared by two or more States. Article 7 (1) Draft Articles of the ILC on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses,²⁵ reads: “Watercourse States shall exercise due diligence to utilize an international water course in such a way as not to cause significant harm to other watercourse States.”\n---\n²³ *Michael N.

ICANN classified ICANN’s functions as the administration of “an intrinsically international resource of immense importance to global communications and economies”.²⁷ It therefore seems appropriate to apply the due diligence standard broadly recognised in the context of other sources shared by several States to cyberspace.\n## B. Significance of Due Diligence\nUp to now, no precise criteria have been identified to define due diligence with respect to the prevention of cyber attacks and the maintenance of cyber security. Still, some elements can be distilled from international rulings in other contexts.\n## 1. Obligation to Take Appropriate Measures\nThe starting point for obligations to prevent and avert damage to other States and interference with their rights is the obligation to take appropriate measures. This standard is adopted in a number of international treaties on the protection of the environment,²⁸ the Draft Articles of the ILC on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities²⁹ (Article 3 Draft Articles), the ITLOS advisory opinion\n²⁶ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 204.\n²⁷ International Centre for Dispute Resolution, ICM Registry v.

Commensurability with the Risk to be Averted\nWith respect to obligations to prevent shipments of military equipment under the rules of neutrality, the award in the Alabama Arbitration (1872) held that the required measures must be commensurate with the risk to be averted.³² The same criterion appears in the Pulp Mills judgment of the ICJ.³³ In its advisory opinion on the Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, the ITLOS relates due diligence to the degree of risks associated with a particular activity:\nThe content of ‘due diligence’ obligations may not easily be described in precise terms. Among the factors that make such a description difficult is the fact that ‘due diligence’ is a variable concept. It may change over time as measures considered sufficiently diligent at a certain moment may become not diligent enough in light, for instance, of new scientific or\n³⁰ See supra, note 16.\n³¹ ICJ, United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States v. Iran), Judgment of 24 May 1980, ICJ Reports 1980, 3, para. 63.\n³² Geneva Arbitration Tribunal, Alabama claims of the United States of America against Great Britain, Arbitral Award of 14 September 1872, Reports of International Arbitral Awards XXIX, 125 et seq.\n³³ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 205: “The Court observes that neither the 1975 Statute nor general international law specify the scope and content of an environmental impact assessment. It points out moreover that Argentina and Uruguay are not parties to the Espoo Convention. Finally, the Court notes that the other instrument to which Argentina refers in support of its arguments, namely, the UNEP Goals and Principles, is not binding on the Parties, but, as guidelines issued by an international technical body, has to be taken into account by each Party in accordance with Article 41 (a) in adopting measures within its domestic regulatory framework. Moreover, this instrument provides only that the ‘environmental effects in an EIA should be assessed with a degree of detail commensurate with their likely environmental significance’ (Principle 5) without giving any indication of minimum core components of the assessment. Consequently, it is the view of the Court that it is for each State to determine in its domestic legislation or in the authorization process for the project, the specific content of the environmental impact assessment required in each case, having regard to the nature and magnitude of the proposed development and its likely adverse impact on the environment as well as to the need to exercise due diligence in conducting such an assessment. The Court also considers that an environmental impact assessment must be conducted prior to the implementation of a project. Moreover, once operations have started and, where necessary, throughout the life of the project, continuous monitoring of its effects on the environment shall be undertaken”.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\ntechnological knowledge. It may also change in relation to the risks involved in the activity. As regards activities in the Area, it seems reasonable to state that prospecting is, generally speaking, less risky than exploration activities which, in turn, entail less risk than exploitation. Moreover, activities in the Area concerning different kinds of minerals, for example, polymetallic nodules on the one hand and polymetallic sulphides or cobalt rich ferromanganese crusts on the other, may require different standards of diligence. The standard of due diligence has to be more severe for the riskier activities.³⁴\n## 3. Vigilance and Prevention\nDue diligence includes vigilance and prevention as held by the ICJ with respect to the maintenance of ecological balance in the *Pulp Mills* case.\nThis vigilance and prevention is all the more important in the preservation of the ecological balance, since the negative impact of human activities on the waters of the river may affect other components of the ecosystem of the watercourse such as its flora, fauna, and soil. The obligation to co-ordinate, through the Commission, the adoption of the necessary measures, as well as their enforcement and observance, assumes, in this context, a central role in the overall system of protection of the River Uruguay established by the 1975 Statute. It is therefore of crucial importance that the Parties respect this obligation.³⁵\nIn this case, the Court concluded that under customary environmental law, due diligence calls for an environmental impact assessment, when industrial activities risk having a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource.³⁶\n## 4. Exchange of Information and Warning\nDue diligence with respect to the safeguarding of the rights of other States includes an exchange of information and warning, as the ICJ already stated in the *Corfu Channel* case.³⁷\n³⁴ ITLOS, *Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area* (note 16), para. 117.\n³⁵ ICJ, *Pulp Mills* (note 15), para. 188.\n³⁶ *Ibid.*, para. 204.\n³⁷ *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), 22.\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK 183",
    "IV. Regulatory Approaches": "### A. Layers of Responsibility\n#### 1. Private Actors Including Service Providers\nThe responsibility of private actors which undertake cyber attacks has several dimensions which range from civil liability to criminal responsibility, e.g. under the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.³⁸ However, ‘Corporate cyber-responsibility’ of service providers will not be easy to establish, as requirements of reliable identification of e-mail account holders and of senders encounter political resistance and raise difficult legal issues.³⁹\n#### 2. Responsibility of States of Origin of Cyber Threats\nDe lege ferenda, the responsibility of States of origin of cyber threats can be established by treaty-based, institutional arrangements, e.g. for the exchange of risk relevant information. In addition, the establishment of an institutionalised supervision mechanism which monitors individual and corporate activities should be considered. A possible model is the National Contact Points for Corporate Social Responsibility system set out in the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development’s (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.⁴⁰\n---\n³⁸ Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, CETS No. 185.\n³⁹ See Debra Wong Yang/Brian M.

Due Diligence of Corporate Targets\nCorporate targets of cyber attacks should also be deemed to have a duty of diligence to prevent and minimise damages. This is, however, primarily a matter of national policy and domestic regulation.\n## B. Form of Regulation\nWhile intergovernmental cooperation can be based on international agreements, an alternative might be ‘soft law’ instruments such as guiding principles or codes of conduct of international organisations such as the OECD.\n## C. Institutional Framework\nIn the institutional design, an intergovernmental architecture may be constructed with a multi-stakeholder approach which integrates private bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force,⁴¹ non-governmental organisations, or hybrid organisations (ICANN) into fora for cooperation or for the development of technical standards.\nWhile the added value of a multi-stakeholder approach should not be over-estimated, it would enhance the pull to compliance with any international standards on due diligence and foster the effective protection of cyber-security.",
    "Conclusion": "International law is still in a rather early stage in terms of responding to cyber-threats. States must apply due diligence in supervising threats to cyber-security which may affect other States and prevent substantial harm by transboundary activities, however the rules on State responsibility for attacs on cyber-security by private actors are rather rudimentary.

Whilst some of these threats are linked to wrongful acts directly attributable to States, many attacks and intrusions are authored by private persons. These threats from non-State actors catalyse the call for due diligence standards for States in terms of prevention, monitoring, and international cooperation. Responsibility of States for acts by private persons should rest on 'overall control' rather than 'effective control'. Due diligence standards with respect to cyber security can draw on several interconnected conceptual bases for due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty: respect for international common goods, obligations to prevent private acts aiming at transboundary harm (as recognised in the Corfu Channel case), freedom of communication, and the responsibility for shared sources. Due diligence includes the obligation to take appropriate measures which are commensurate with the risk to be averted. It also encompasses vigilance and prevention as well as an exchange of information and warnings. Regulatory approaches must identify responsible actors (private persons, States of origin of cyber threats, and corporate targets). International cooperation can be based on international agreements or instruments of 'soft law'. For the design of the institutional framework, strong reasons suggest a multi-stakeholder approach which integrates private bodies, non-governmental organisations, or hybrid organisations.\nKEYWORDS: Cyber Security, State Responsibility, Standards of Control, Due Diligence, Prevention, Warning, International Cooperation\n* Professor for Public Law; Director of the Institute for Public International Law, University of Bonn.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n## I. Different Threats to Cyber Security\nIn the design of cyberspace and digital infrastructures unhampered access and free flow of data are key principles when determining function and utilisation. These functional criteria have so far trumped other objectives such as resilience to risks of abuse and security. This makes digital networks an easy and tempting target for attacks which aim at siphoning off data or at functional disruption by States, non-governmental entities, or individuals.\nThis contribution will not focus on the current debate on legitimate or illegitimate harvesting of data. Nor will it comment on the complex relationship between allied States which includes unilateral or mutual data fishing as well as sharing informations relevant to their national security interests.\nDiscussion in international law on cyberspace has, until recently, focused on cyber attacks in context with armed conflicts. Only in recent years, has the debate in public international law extended to threats beyond a military context. It seems appropriate to distinguish between different kinds of threats to security and stability of cyber systems:\n1. Attacks directly against the integrity of cyber systems in terms of intentionally inflicted damage to computer systems or networks or digital information and\n2. Intrusions intended to abuse and exploit digital networks and other systems without affecting the integrity of the infrastructures as such, e.g. for purposes of cyber espionage (cyber trespassing, cyber exploitation).\nIn both cases, we must further distinguish between wrongful acts attributable to States and responsibility flowing from due diligence standards of monitoring and international cooperation.\n---\n Catherine B.

Andres, State Responsibility for Cyber Attacks: Competing Standards for a Growing Problem, Geo. J. Int'l Affairs 42 (2010), 971.\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK 171\n## II. Responsibility for Wrongful Acts Attributable to States\n### A. Primary Norms Related to Cyber Security\nState responsibility, in principle, rests on the violation of a ‘primary’ norm of international law (Article 1 ILC Articles on State Responsibility). There are a number of such primary norms related to cyber security in specific sectors of international law, especially with respect to treaties and security council resolutions against terrorism, the law of the sea, the law of air transport, and telecommunications law.\nFor present purposes, it seems more important to focus on the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs of other States and, possibly, human rights which prohibit States from threatening or damaging the life and property of persons abroad as well as civil and military assets of other States including clinical infrastructures. As far as these protected rights and goods are affected, customary international law taints attacks against the integrity of computer networks with illegality.\nThe legal situation is quite different with respect to other cross-border intrusions and abuses of digital infrastructures, especially for the purpose of military or industrial espionage. In this context, acts directed against cyber security, as a rule, do not appear on the regulatory screen of international law. The international perspective merely qualifies espionage as acts fraught with high risks for the perpetrators and defers to sanctions under national law. In both times of peace and war, espionage is not a regulatory theme of customary international law (which simply leaves the target State free to prosecute the spy or to declare him *persona non grata* if he is vested with diplomatic immunity). Therefore, protection of confidentiality and privacy of data flows can only be established on the basis of international treaties.\n---\n International Law Commission (ILC) Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 43 et seq.

Attribution and State Responsibility\n### 1. Actions of State Organs\nAs a rule, State responsibility for the violation of international law will be triggered by the acts of State organs (Article 2 ILC Articles on State Responsibility).\n### 2. Actions by Private Persons and Non-Governmental Entities: Control by the State\nActs of private persons and non-State entities establish State responsibility only where there is a certain degree of authority and control over the private activities, e.g. hackers instigated and sponsored by their home government. The ILC Articles on State Responsibility simply refer to actions “on the instructions of, or under the direction and control” of the State concerned. This necessary degree of “direction and control” is, however, a matter of controversy.\nAt least in the context of armed activities, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) clearly favours very narrow conditions for attribution, e.g. the establishment of ‘effective control’ that also extends to specific operations carried out by private persons or entities.\nBy contrast, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia adopted a more lenient standard of attribution, the ‘overall control’ test. There is a growing tendency in international law to follow the more flexible ‘overall control’, which emerged in the context of the attribution of armed attacks to States ‘harbour-\n Art. 8 ILC Articles on State Responsibility: “The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of that State in carrying out the conduct”.\n International Court of Justice (ICJ), Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Otherwise the requisite evidence would amount to a kind of probatio diabolica.\nOf course, traceability is a most complex and contentious issue where concerns of privacy and free communication in an open society clash with interests of national and international security. Traceability vests democratic governments and authoritarian regimes alike with instruments of supervision, albeit for quite different purposes. In any case, traceability can realistically be conceptualised in an asymmetric way. The European debate on the processing of electronic communication and privacy8 amply demonstrates the controversial nature of the issue.\nIn the context of traceability, we must also consider preexisting imbalances in the non-negotiated access of certain governments to transatlantic glass fibre-cables and other communication facilities. The State in which a service provider is incorporated or has its seat of management has usually more leverage as to the disclosure of data by the provider. If a State siphons off electronic communication networks located on its own territory or glass fibre cables running through its territorial sea, it acts within its\n\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nown territorial jurisdiction. Similarly, a State may be tapping into cables running through its exclusive economic zone.\n## III. Due Diligence and Cyber Security\n## A. Prevention of Transboundary Harm – Conceptual Basis\nIn contemporary international law, a general principle has emerged which requires States to exercise due diligence to avoid transboundary harm to life and tangible assets of persons domiciled abroad and of foreign States. This principle can be inferred, by way of extrapolation, from a broad range of due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty and the possible control of private actors.\nThere are four interconnected conceptual bases for due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty\n1. Respect for international and domestic common goods, such as the environment in inter-State relations,\n2. Prevention of private actions directed against assets of foreign States or life and property of persons located in foreign territory,\n3. Freedom of communications, and\n4. Responsibility for resources shared with other States.\nDue diligence with respect to cyber security stands in close connection with all four rationales.\n## 1. Respect for the Environment of Other States and for International Common Goods\nBy now, due respect for the environment of other States and global public goods may be considered as part of customary international law. Several United Nations\n See Arts. 58 (1), 79 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 10 December 1982, UNTS 1833, 3 (UNCLOS).\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n(UN) conferences have endorsed such an obligation. Thus, Principle 2 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development declares:\nStates have [...] the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.\nPrinciple 21 Stockholm Declaration follows the same line:\nStates have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.\nA great number of environmental treaties embody this principle and call for appropriate measures to prevent damage to the environment. In its Nuclear Weapons advisory opinion, the ICJ stated:\nThe Court recognizes that the environment is under daily threat and that the use of nuclear weapons could constitute a catastrophe for the environment. The Court also recognizes that the environment is not an abstraction but represents the living space, the quality of life and the very health of human beings, including generations unborn.

In the Pulp Mills case,^[15] the Court held:\nThe Court considers that the obligation laid down in Article 36 [of the Statute on the Rio Uruguay agreed between Argentina and Uruguay] is addressed to both Parties and prescribes the specific conduct of co-ordinating the necessary measures through the Commission to avoid changes to the ecological balance. An obligation to adopt regulatory or administrative measures either individually or jointly and to enforce them is an obligation of conduct. Both Parties are therefore called upon, under Article 36, to exercise due diligence in acting through the Commission for the necessary measures to preserve the ecological balance of the river.\nThis vigilance and prevention is all the more important in the preservation of the ecological balance, since the negative impact of human activities on the waters of the river may affect other components of the ecosystem of the watercourse such as its flora, fauna, and soil. The obligation to co-ordinate, through the Commission, the adoption of the necessary measures, as well as their enforcement and observance, assumes, in this context, a central role in the overall system of protection of the River Uruguay established by the 1975 Statute [...]\nThe Court concluded:\nIt is the opinion of the Court that in order for the Parties properly to comply with their obligations under Article 41 (a) and (b) of the 1975 Statute, they must, for the purposes of protecting and preserving the aquatic environment with respect to activities which may be liable to cause transboundary harm, carry out an environmental impact assessment. [...] In this sense, the obligation to protect and preserve, under Article 41 (a) of the Statute, has to be interpreted in accordance with a practice, which in recent years has gained so much acceptance among States that it may now be considered a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource. Moreover, due diligence, and the duty of vigilance and prevention which it implies, would not be considered to have been exercised, if a party planning works liable to affect the regime of the river or the quality of its waters did not undertake an environmental impact assessment on the potential effects of such works.\n^[14] ICJ, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* (note 13), 226, para. 29.\n^[15] Id., *Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, ICJ Reports 2010, 14, paras. 187 et seq., 204.\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\nThe required standard for prevention is due diligence. In the context of environmental risks associated with deep seabed mining and exploration, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) adopted this standard in its advisory opinion on the Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area. The Tribunal applied the due diligence standard to the supervision of mining companies by their home State or another sponsoring State and related it to “reasonably appropriate measures” in terms of Article 153 (4) UNCLOS and Annex III Article 4 (4) UNCLOS.\nCyberspace and the protection of cyber security stand in close analogy with the environment and environmental protection, at least to the extent that they constitute international public goods and global commons.\n International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, Advisory Opinion of 1 February 2011, para. 117, available at: https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no_17/17_adv_op_010211_en.pdf (accessed on 12 November 2015).\n Ibid., paras. 118 et seq.: “118. Article 153, paragraph 4, last sentence, of the Convention states that the obligation of the sponsoring State in accordance with article 139 of the Convention entails ‘taking all measures necessary to ensure’ compliance by the sponsored contractor. Annex III, article 4, paragraph 4, of the Convention makes it clear that sponsoring States’ ‘responsibility to ensure’ applies ‘within their legal systems’. With these indications [emphasis added] the Convention provides some elements concerning the content of the ‘due diligence’ obligation to ensure. Necessary measures are required and these must be adopted within the legal system of the sponsoring State.\n119. Further light on the expression ‘measures necessary to ensure’ is shed by the Convention if one considers article 139, paragraph 2, last sentence, and Annex III, article 4, paragraph 4, last sentence, of the Convention. The main purpose of these provisions is to exempt sponsoring States that have taken certain measures from liability for damage. The description of the measures to be taken by that State may also be used to clarify its ‘due diligence’ obligation. This description remains in general terms in article 139, paragraph 2, of the Convention which mentions ‘all necessary and appropriate measures to secure effective compliance under article 153, paragraph 4, and Annex III, article 4, paragraph 4’. The latter provision is more specific as it requires the sponsoring State to adopt ‘laws and regulations’ and to take ‘administrative measures which are, within the framework of its legal system, reasonably appropriate for securing compliance by persons under its jurisdiction’.\n120. More specific indications concerning the content of these measures, including aspects relating to their enforcement, with respect to the contents of these measures will be provided in the reply to Question 3. As regards Question 1, it has been established that the ‘due diligence’ obligation ‘to ensure’ requires the sponsoring State to take measures within its legal system and that the measures must be ‘reasonably appropriate’.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n## 2. Prevention of Acts Aimed at Transboundary Harm\nUnder customary international law, States have an obligation to prevent acts carried out within their territory which are designed to cause transboundary harm. The *locus classicus* is to be found in the judgment of the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case (Merits). The Court recognised that States have obligations as to the notification of the existence of a mine field in their territorial waters and to the warning of approaching warships. It based these obligations on\nelementary considerations of humanity, even more exacting in peace than in war; [...] and every State's obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.^[18]^\nThe *Corfu Channel* judgment made the obligation to prevent acts encroaching on the rights of other States dependent on knowledge of such use of its territory. The dissenting opinions of Judge *Winiarski*^[19]^ and *Krylov*^[20]^ focused on the standard of due diligence (\"ought to have seen or heard\"). In the context of the obligation to prevent cross-border armed traffic, the ICJ adopted the due diligence standard in the *Nicaragua Case*.^[21]^\nThe Draft Articles of the International Law Commission (ILC) on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities^[22]^ require the State of origin to \"take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimise the risk thereof\" (Article 3 Draft Articles). As a matter of consequential logic this standard, formulated in the context of high-risk activities not prohibited by international law (Article 1 Draft Articles) must apply to acts which purport to cause significant transboundary harm.\n^[18]^ ICJ, *The Corfu Channel Case* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v. Albania), Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 22.\n^[19]^ *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), Dissenting Opinion of Judge *Winiarski*, ICJ Reports 1949, 4, 51.\n^[20]^ *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), Dissenting Opinion of Judge *Krylov*, ICJ Reports 1949, 4, 71 et seq.\n^[21]^ *Id.*, *Nicaragua Case* (note 5), 14, para. 157.\n^[22]^ ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 148 et seq.\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK 179\nNATO’s Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare states in Rule 5 Tallinn Manual: “A State shall not knowingly allow the cyber instructions located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that aversely and unlawfully affect other States.”\nRule 5 is an echo of the *Corfu Channel* judgment. Under current international law, the narrow criterion of positive knowledge of harmful activities as condition for duties of prevention seems to be justified only in the context of activities which 1. affect other States within the territory, the territorial waters, or the exclusive economic zone of the State concerned or which 2. cause no significant physical harm. In cases of transboundary physical harm, the standard of due diligence applies.\n## 3. Freedom of Communication\nIn the *Corfu Channel* case, the ICJ based the duty of a State to avert damage from activities carried out within its territory (obligations of notification and warning) also on “the principle of the freedom of maritime communication”.\n## 4. Responsibility for Shared Resources\nFinally, obligations of States to avert or minimise the harmful effects from activities carried out within their territory can arise from the common responsibility for shared resources. In this context, cyberspace can be compared to shared resources such as water resources shared by two or more States. Article 7 (1) Draft Articles of the ILC on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses, reads: “Watercourse States shall exercise due diligence to utilize an international water course in such a way as not to cause significant harm to other watercourse States.”\n---\n *Michael N. Schmitt* (ed.), (note 7).\n ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), 22.\n ILC, *The law of the non-navigational uses of international watercourses*, Yearbook of the International Law Commission (YILC) 1994, Vol. II (Part Two), para. 222, 102.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nThe Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses (in force since 17 August 2014) no longer refers to due diligence but obliges watercourse States “to take all appropriate measures to prevent the causing of significant harm to other watercourse States.”\nIn the Pulp Mills case, the ICJ underlined the obligation of vigilance and prevention with respect to private activities which adversely affect a shared resource. Cyberspace constitutes a physical and non-physical resource shared by the internet community (Article 1 Statute of the Internet Corporation for assigned Numbers and Names (ICANN)). The dispute settlement panel in ICM Registry v. ICANN classified ICANN’s functions as the administration of “an intrinsically international resource of immense importance to global communications and economies”. It therefore seems appropriate to apply the due diligence standard broadly recognised in the context of other sources shared by several States to cyberspace.\n## B. Significance of Due Diligence\nUp to now, no precise criteria have been identified to define due diligence with respect to the prevention of cyber attacks and the maintenance of cyber security. Still, some elements can be distilled from international rulings in other contexts.\n## 1. Obligation to Take Appropriate Measures\nThe starting point for obligations to prevent and avert damage to other States and interference with their rights is the obligation to take appropriate measures. This standard is adopted in a number of international treaties on the protection of the environment, the Draft Articles of the ILC on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities (Article 3 Draft Articles), the ITLOS advisory opinion\n ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 204.\n International Centre for Dispute Resolution, ICM Registry v. ICANN, Declaration of the Independent Review Panel, 19 February 2010, ICDR Case No. 50 117 T 00224 08, reprinted in: International Legal Materials 956, Vol. 49 (2010), para. 140.\n See supra, note 12.\n See supra, note 22.\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\non the Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area and the judgment of the ICJ in the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case.\n## 2. Commensurability with the Risk to be Averted\nWith respect to obligations to prevent shipments of military equipment under the rules of neutrality, the award in the Alabama Arbitration (1872) held that the required measures must be commensurate with the risk to be averted. The same criterion appears in the Pulp Mills judgment of the ICJ. In its advisory opinion on the Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, the ITLOS relates due diligence to the degree of risks associated with a particular activity:\nThe content of ‘due diligence’ obligations may not easily be described in precise terms. Among the factors that make such a description difficult is the fact that ‘due diligence’ is a variable concept. It may change over time as measures considered sufficiently diligent at a certain moment may become not diligent enough in light, for instance, of new scientific or\n See supra, note 16.\n ICJ, United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States v. Iran), Judgment of 24 May 1980, ICJ Reports 1980, 3, para. 63.\n Geneva Arbitration Tribunal, Alabama claims of the United States of America against Great Britain, Arbitral Award of 14 September 1872, Reports of International Arbitral Awards XXIX, 125 et seq.\n ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 205: “The Court observes that neither the 1975 Statute nor general international law specify the scope and content of an environmental impact assessment. It points out moreover that Argentina and Uruguay are not parties to the Espoo Convention. Finally, the Court notes that the other instrument to which Argentina refers in support of its arguments, namely, the UNEP Goals and Principles, is not binding on the Parties, but, as guidelines issued by an international technical body, has to be taken into account by each Party in accordance with Article 41 (a) in adopting measures within its domestic regulatory framework. Moreover, this instrument provides only that the ‘environmental effects in an EIA should be assessed with a degree of detail commensurate with their likely environmental significance’ (Principle 5) without giving any indication of minimum core components of the assessment. Consequently, it is the view of the Court that it is for each State to determine in its domestic legislation or in the authorization process for the project, the specific content of the environmental impact assessment required in each case, having regard to the nature and magnitude of the proposed development and its likely adverse impact on the environment as well as to the need to exercise due diligence in conducting such an assessment. The Court also considers that an environmental impact assessment must be conducted prior to the implementation of a project. Moreover, once operations have started and, where necessary, throughout the life of the project, continuous monitoring of its effects on the environment shall be undertaken”.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\ntechnological knowledge. It may also change in relation to the risks involved in the activity. As regards activities in the Area, it seems reasonable to state that prospecting is, generally speaking, less risky than exploration activities which, in turn, entail less risk than exploitation. Moreover, activities in the Area concerning different kinds of minerals, for example, polymetallic nodules on the one hand and polymetallic sulphides or cobalt rich ferromanganese crusts on the other, may require different standards of diligence. The standard of due diligence has to be more severe for the riskier activities.\n## 3. Vigilance and Prevention\nDue diligence includes vigilance and prevention as held by the ICJ with respect to the maintenance of ecological balance in the *Pulp Mills* case.\nThis vigilance and prevention is all the more important in the preservation of the ecological balance, since the negative impact of human activities on the waters of the river may affect other components of the ecosystem of the watercourse such as its flora, fauna, and soil. The obligation to co-ordinate, through the Commission, the adoption of the necessary measures, as well as their enforcement and observance, assumes, in this context, a central role in the overall system of protection of the River Uruguay established by the 1975 Statute. It is therefore of crucial importance that the Parties respect this obligation.\nIn this case, the Court concluded that under customary environmental law, due diligence calls for an environmental impact assessment, when industrial activities risk having a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource.\n## 4. Exchange of Information and Warning\nDue diligence with respect to the safeguarding of the rights of other States includes an exchange of information and warning, as the ICJ already stated in the *Corfu Channel* case.\n ITLOS, *Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area* (note 16), para. 117.\n ICJ, *Pulp Mills* (note 15), para. 188.\n *Ibid.*, para. 204.\n *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), 22.\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK 183\n## IV. Regulatory Approaches\n### A. Layers of Responsibility\n#### 1. Private Actors Including Service Providers\nThe responsibility of private actors which undertake cyber attacks has several dimensions which range from civil liability to criminal responsibility, e.g. under the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. However, ‘Corporate cyber-responsibility’ of service providers will not be easy to establish, as requirements of reliable identification of e-mail account holders and of senders encounter political resistance and raise difficult legal issues.\n#### 2. Responsibility of States of Origin of Cyber Threats\nDe lege ferenda, the responsibility of States of origin of cyber threats can be established by treaty-based, institutional arrangements, e.g. for the exchange of risk relevant information. In addition, the establishment of an institutionalised supervision mechanism which monitors individual and corporate activities should be considered. A possible model is the National Contact Points for Corporate Social Responsibility system set out in the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development’s (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n---\n Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, CETS No. 185.\n See Debra Wong Yang/Brian M. Hoffstadt, Countering the Cyber-Crime Threat, American Criminal Law Review 43 (2006), 201; Oona A. Hathaway, The Law of Cyber-Attack, California Law Review 100 (2012), 817, 879 et seq.\n See Herdegen (note 13), 111 et seq.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n## 3. Due Diligence of Corporate Targets\nCorporate targets of cyber attacks should also be deemed to have a duty of diligence to prevent and minimise damages. This is, however, primarily a matter of national policy and domestic regulation.\n## B. Form of Regulation\nWhile intergovernmental cooperation can be based on international agreements, an alternative might be ‘soft law’ instruments such as guiding principles or codes of conduct of international organisations such as the OECD.\n## C. Institutional Framework\nIn the institutional design, an intergovernmental architecture may be constructed with a multi-stakeholder approach which integrates private bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force, non-governmental organisations, or hybrid organisations (ICANN) into fora for cooperation or for the development of technical standards.\nWhile the added value of a multi-stakeholder approach should not be over-estimated, it would enhance the pull to compliance with any international standards on due diligence and foster the effective protection of cyber-security.\n## V. Conclusion\nInternational law is still in a rather early stage in terms of responding to cyber-threats. States must apply due diligence in supervising threats to cyber-security which may affect other States and prevent substantial harm by transboundary activities, however the rules on State responsibility for attacs on cyber-security by private actors are rather rudimentary. It is submitted that ‘overall control’ rather than ‘effective\n For further information see https://www.ietf.org/ (accessed on 12 November 2015).\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\ncontrol' should be the appropriate standard of attribution and regulatory models for international cooperation should include governments, non-governmental organisations, private corporations as well as hybrid organisations such as ICANN.\n.\n# GENERAL ARTICLES\n.",

Responsibility for Wrongful Acts Attributable to States ### A. Primary Norms Related to Cyber Security State responsibility, in principle, rests on the violation of a ‘primary’ norm of international law (Article 1 ILC Articles on State Responsibility²). There are a number of such primary norms related to cyber security in specific sectors of international law, especially with respect to treaties and security council resolutions against terrorism, the law of the sea, the law of air transport, and telecommunications law. For present purposes, it seems more important to focus on the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs of other States and, possibly, human rights which prohibit States from threatening or damaging the life and property of persons abroad as well as civil and military assets of other States including clinical infrastructures. As far as these protected rights and goods are affected, customary international law taints attacks against the integrity of computer networks with illegality. The legal situation is quite different with respect to other cross-border intrusions and abuses of digital infrastructures, especially for the purpose of military or industrial espionage. In this context, acts directed against cyber security, as a rule, do not appear on the regulatory screen of international law. The international perspective merely qualifies espionage as acts fraught with high risks for the perpetrators and defers to sanctions under national law.³ In both times of peace and war, espionage is not a regulatory theme of customary international law (which simply leaves the target State free to prosecute the spy or to declare him *persona non grata* if he is vested with diplomatic immunity). Therefore, protection of confidentiality and privacy of data flows can only be established on the basis of international treaties. --- ² International Law Commission (ILC) Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 43 et seq.

GERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 ## B. Attribution and State Responsibility ### 1. Actions of State Organs As a rule, State responsibility for the violation of international law will be triggered by the acts of State organs (Article 2 ILC Articles on State Responsibility). ### 2. Actions by Private Persons and Non-Governmental Entities: Control by the State Acts of private persons and non-State entities establish State responsibility only where there is a certain degree of authority and control over the private activities, e.g. hackers instigated and sponsored by their home government. The ILC Articles on State Responsibility simply refer to actions “on the instructions of, or under the direction and control” of the State concerned.⁴ This necessary degree of “direction and control” is, however, a matter of controversy. At least in the context of armed activities, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) clearly favours very narrow conditions for attribution, e.g. the establishment of ‘effective control’ that also extends to specific operations carried out by private persons or entities.⁵ By contrast, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia adopted a more lenient standard of attribution, the ‘overall control’ test.⁶ There is a growing tendency in international law to follow the more flexible ‘overall control’, which emerged in the context of the attribution of armed attacks to States ‘harbour- ⁴ Art. 8 ILC Articles on State Responsibility: “The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of that State in carrying out the conduct”. ⁵ International Court of Justice (ICJ), Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

POSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK ing' terrorists and which was consolidated, more recently, for the purpose of establishing State responsibility for cyber attacks carried out by private persons.7 It is already difficult enough to trace cyber attacks back to the country of origin thus if State responsibility for cyber attacks perpetrated by private actors is to have any practical relevance, the 'overall control' test should govern attribution. Otherwise the requisite evidence would amount to a kind of probatio diabolica. Of course, traceability is a most complex and contentious issue where concerns of privacy and free communication in an open society clash with interests of national and international security. Traceability vests democratic governments and authoritarian regimes alike with instruments of supervision, albeit for quite different purposes. In any case, traceability can realistically be conceptualised in an asymmetric way. The European debate on the processing of electronic communication and privacy8 amply demonstrates the controversial nature of the issue. In the context of traceability, we must also consider preexisting imbalances in the non-negotiated access of certain governments to transatlantic glass fibre-cables and other communication facilities. The State in which a service provider is incorporated or has its seat of management has usually more leverage as to the disclosure of data by the provider. If a State siphons off electronic communication networks located on its own territory or glass fibre cables running through its territorial sea, it acts within its 7 Johann-Christoph Woltag, Cyber Warfare, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), MPEPIL, Vol. II (2012), 988, para. 22; Alexander Kees, Responsibility of States for Private Actors, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), MPEPIL, Vol. VIII (2012), 959, para. 18; Stefan Talmon, The Various Control Tests in the Law of State Responsibility and the Responsibility of Outside powers for Acts of Secessionist Entities, International and Comparative Law Quarterly 58 (2009), 493; Shackelford/Andres (note 1), 988; Laurie R.

Due Diligence and Cyber Security ## A. Prevention of Transboundary Harm – Conceptual Basis In contemporary international law, a general principle has emerged which requires States to exercise due diligence to avoid transboundary harm to life and tangible assets of persons domiciled abroad and of foreign States. This principle can be inferred, by way of extrapolation, from a broad range of due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty and the possible control of private actors. There are four interconnected conceptual bases for due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty",

        "4": "Responsibility for resources shared with other States. Due diligence with respect to cyber security stands in close connection with all four rationales. ## 1. Respect for the Environment of Other States and for International Common Goods By now, due respect for the environment of other States and global public goods may be considered as part of customary international law. Several United Nations ⁹ See Arts. 58 (1), 79 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 10 December 1982, UNTS 1833, 3 (UNCLOS). POSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK (UN) conferences have endorsed such an obligation. Thus, Principle 2 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development¹⁰ declares: States have [...] the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. Principle 21 Stockholm Declaration¹¹ follows the same line: States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. A great number of environmental treaties embody this principle and call for appropriate measures to prevent damage to the environment.¹² In its Nuclear Weapons advisory opinion, the ICJ stated:¹³ The Court recognizes that the environment is under daily threat and that the use of nuclear weapons could constitute a catastrophe for the environment. The Court also recognizes that the environment is not an abstraction but represents the living space, the quality of life and the very health of human beings, including generations unborn.

GERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 existence of the general obligation of States to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction and control respect the environment of other States and of areas beyond national control is now part of the corpus of international law relating to the environment.^[14] More recently, the ICJ recognised a customary obligation of States to prevent transboundary damages to the environment. In the Pulp Mills case,^[15] the Court held: The Court considers that the obligation laid down in Article 36 [of the Statute on the Rio Uruguay agreed between Argentina and Uruguay] is addressed to both Parties and prescribes the specific conduct of co-ordinating the necessary measures through the Commission to avoid changes to the ecological balance. An obligation to adopt regulatory or administrative measures either individually or jointly and to enforce them is an obligation of conduct. Both Parties are therefore called upon, under Article 36, to exercise due diligence in acting through the Commission for the necessary measures to preserve the ecological balance of the river. This vigilance and prevention is all the more important in the preservation of the ecological balance, since the negative impact of human activities on the waters of the river may affect other components of the ecosystem of the watercourse such as its flora, fauna, and soil. The obligation to co-ordinate, through the Commission, the adoption of the necessary measures, as well as their enforcement and observance, assumes, in this context, a central role in the overall system of protection of the River Uruguay established by the 1975 Statute [...] The Court concluded: It is the opinion of the Court that in order for the Parties properly to comply with their obligations under Article 41 (a) and (b) of the 1975 Statute, they must, for the purposes of protecting and preserving the aquatic environment with respect to activities which may be liable to cause transboundary harm, carry out an environmental impact assessment. [...] In this sense, the obligation to protect and preserve, under Article 41 (a) of the Statute, has to be interpreted in accordance with a practice, which in recent years has gained so much acceptance among States that it may now be considered a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource. Moreover, due diligence, and the duty of vigilance and prevention which it implies, would not be considered to have been exercised, if a party planning works liable to affect the regime of the river or the quality of its waters did not undertake an environmental impact assessment on the potential effects of such works. ^[14] ICJ, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* (note 13), 226, para. 29. ^[15] Id., *Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina v.

In the context of environmental risks associated with deep seabed mining and exploration, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) adopted this standard in its advisory opinion on the Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area.¹⁶ The Tribunal applied the due diligence standard to the supervision of mining companies by their home State or another sponsoring State and related it to “reasonably appropriate measures” in terms of Article 153 (4) UNCLOS and Annex III Article 4 (4) UNCLOS.¹⁷ Cyberspace and the protection of cyber security stand in close analogy with the environment and environmental protection, at least to the extent that they constitute international public goods and global commons. ¹⁶ International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, Advisory Opinion of 1 February 2011, para. 117, available at: https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no_17/17_adv_op_010211_en.pdf (accessed on 12 November 2015). ¹⁷ Ibid., paras. 118 et seq.: “118. Article 153, paragraph 4, last sentence, of the Convention states that the obligation of the sponsoring State in accordance with article 139 of the Convention entails ‘taking all measures necessary to ensure’ compliance by the sponsored contractor. Annex III, article 4, paragraph 4, of the Convention makes it clear that sponsoring States’ ‘responsibility to ensure’ applies ‘within their legal systems’. With these indications [emphasis added] the Convention provides some elements concerning the content of the ‘due diligence’ obligation to ensure. Necessary measures are required and these must be adopted within the legal system of the sponsoring State.",
        "119": "Further light on the expression ‘measures necessary to ensure’ is shed by the Convention if one considers article 139, paragraph 2, last sentence, and Annex III, article 4, paragraph 4, last sentence, of the Convention. The main purpose of these provisions is to exempt sponsoring States that have taken certain measures from liability for damage. The description of the measures to be taken by that State may also be used to clarify its ‘due diligence’ obligation. This description remains in general terms in article 139, paragraph 2, of the Convention which mentions ‘all necessary and appropriate measures to secure effective compliance under article 153, paragraph 4, and Annex III, article 4, paragraph 4’. The latter provision is more specific as it requires the sponsoring State to adopt ‘laws and regulations’ and to take ‘administrative measures which are, within the framework of its legal system, reasonably appropriate for securing compliance by persons under its jurisdiction’.",
        "120": "More specific indications concerning the content of these measures, including aspects relating to their enforcement, with respect to the contents of these measures will be provided in the reply to Question 3. As regards Question 1, it has been established that the ‘due diligence’ obligation ‘to ensure’ requires the sponsoring State to take measures within its legal system and that the measures must be ‘reasonably appropriate’. GERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 ## 2. Prevention of Acts Aimed at Transboundary Harm Under customary international law, States have an obligation to prevent acts carried out within their territory which are designed to cause transboundary harm. The *locus classicus* is to be found in the judgment of the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case (Merits). The Court recognised that States have obligations as to the notification of the existence of a mine field in their territorial waters and to the warning of approaching warships. It based these obligations on elementary considerations of humanity, even more exacting in peace than in war; [...] and every State's obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.^[18]^ The *Corfu Channel* judgment made the obligation to prevent acts encroaching on the rights of other States dependent on knowledge of such use of its territory. The dissenting opinions of Judge *Winiarski*^[19]^ and *Krylov*^[20]^ focused on the standard of due diligence (\"ought to have seen or heard\"). In the context of the obligation to prevent cross-border armed traffic, the ICJ adopted the due diligence standard in the *Nicaragua Case*.^[21]^ The Draft Articles of the International Law Commission (ILC) on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities^[22]^ require the State of origin to \"take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimise the risk thereof\" (Article 3 Draft Articles). As a matter of consequential logic this standard, formulated in the context of high-risk activities not prohibited by international law (Article 1 Draft Articles) must apply to acts which purport to cause significant transboundary harm. ^[18]^ ICJ, *The Corfu Channel Case* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v. Albania), Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 22. ^[19]^ *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), Dissenting Opinion of Judge *Winiarski*, ICJ Reports 1949, 4, 51. ^[20]^ *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), Dissenting Opinion of Judge *Krylov*, ICJ Reports 1949, 4, 71 et seq. ^[21]^ *Id.*, *Nicaragua Case* (note 5), 14, para. 157. ^[22]^ ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 148 et seq. POSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK 179 NATO’s Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare²³ states in Rule 5 Tallinn Manual: “A State shall not knowingly allow the cyber instructions located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that aversely and unlawfully affect other States.” Rule 5 is an echo of the *Corfu Channel* judgment. Under current international law, the narrow criterion of positive knowledge of harmful activities as condition for duties of prevention seems to be justified only in the context of activities which 1. affect other States within the territory, the territorial waters, or the exclusive economic zone of the State concerned or which 2. cause no significant physical harm. In cases of transboundary physical harm, the standard of due diligence applies. ## 3. Freedom of Communication In the *Corfu Channel* case, the ICJ based the duty of a State to avert damage from activities carried out within its territory (obligations of notification and warning) also on “the principle of the freedom of maritime communication”.²⁴ ## 4. Responsibility for Shared Resources Finally, obligations of States to avert or minimise the harmful effects from activities carried out within their territory can arise from the common responsibility for shared resources. In this context, cyberspace can be compared to shared resources such as water resources shared by two or more States. Article 7 (1) Draft Articles of the ILC on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses,²⁵ reads: “Watercourse States shall exercise due diligence to utilize an international water course in such a way as not to cause significant harm to other watercourse States.” --- ²³ *Michael N. Schmitt* (ed.), (note 7). ²⁴ ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), 22. ²⁵ ILC, *The law of the non-navigational uses of international watercourses*, Yearbook of the International Law Commission (YILC) 1994, Vol. II (Part Two), para. 222, 102. GERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 The Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses (in force since 17 August 2014) no longer refers to due diligence but obliges watercourse States “to take all appropriate measures to prevent the causing of significant harm to other watercourse States.” In the Pulp Mills case, the ICJ underlined the obligation of vigilance and prevention with respect to private activities which adversely affect a shared resource.²⁶ Cyberspace constitutes a physical and non-physical resource shared by the internet community (Article 1 Statute of the Internet Corporation for assigned Numbers and Names (ICANN)). The dispute settlement panel in ICM Registry v. ICANN classified ICANN’s functions as the administration of “an intrinsically international resource of immense importance to global communications and economies”.²⁷ It therefore seems appropriate to apply the due diligence standard broadly recognised in the context of other sources shared by several States to cyberspace. ## B. Significance of Due Diligence Up to now, no precise criteria have been identified to define due diligence with respect to the prevention of cyber attacks and the maintenance of cyber security. Still, some elements can be distilled from international rulings in other contexts. ## 1. Obligation to Take Appropriate Measures The starting point for obligations to prevent and avert damage to other States and interference with their rights is the obligation to take appropriate measures. This standard is adopted in a number of international treaties on the protection of the environment,²⁸ the Draft Articles of the ILC on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities²⁹ (Article 3 Draft Articles), the ITLOS advisory opinion ²⁶ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 204. ²⁷ International Centre for Dispute Resolution, ICM Registry v. ICANN, Declaration of the Independent Review Panel, 19 February 2010, ICDR Case No. 50 117 T 00224 08, reprinted in: International Legal Materials 956, Vol. 49 (2010), para. 140. ²⁸ See supra, note 12. ²⁹ See supra, note 22. POSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK on the Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area³⁰ and the judgment of the ICJ in the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case.³¹ ## 2. Commensurability with the Risk to be Averted With respect to obligations to prevent shipments of military equipment under the rules of neutrality, the award in the Alabama Arbitration (1872) held that the required measures must be commensurate with the risk to be averted.³² The same criterion appears in the Pulp Mills judgment of the ICJ.³³ In its advisory opinion on the Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, the ITLOS relates due diligence to the degree of risks associated with a particular activity: The content of ‘due diligence’ obligations may not easily be described in precise terms. Among the factors that make such a description difficult is the fact that ‘due diligence’ is a variable concept. It may change over time as measures considered sufficiently diligent at a certain moment may become not diligent enough in light, for instance, of new scientific or ³⁰ See supra, note 16. ³¹ ICJ, United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States v. Iran), Judgment of 24 May 1980, ICJ Reports 1980, 3, para. 63. ³² Geneva Arbitration Tribunal, Alabama claims of the United States of America against Great Britain, Arbitral Award of 14 September 1872, Reports of International Arbitral Awards XXIX, 125 et seq. ³³ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 205: “The Court observes that neither the 1975 Statute nor general international law specify the scope and content of an environmental impact assessment. It points out moreover that Argentina and Uruguay are not parties to the Espoo Convention. Finally, the Court notes that the other instrument to which Argentina refers in support of its arguments, namely, the UNEP Goals and Principles, is not binding on the Parties, but, as guidelines issued by an international technical body, has to be taken into account by each Party in accordance with Article 41 (a) in adopting measures within its domestic regulatory framework. Moreover, this instrument provides only that the ‘environmental effects in an EIA should be assessed with a degree of detail commensurate with their likely environmental significance’ (Principle 5) without giving any indication of minimum core components of the assessment. Consequently, it is the view of the Court that it is for each State to determine in its domestic legislation or in the authorization process for the project, the specific content of the environmental impact assessment required in each case, having regard to the nature and magnitude of the proposed development and its likely adverse impact on the environment as well as to the need to exercise due diligence in conducting such an assessment. The Court also considers that an environmental impact assessment must be conducted prior to the implementation of a project. Moreover, once operations have started and, where necessary, throughout the life of the project, continuous monitoring of its effects on the environment shall be undertaken”. GERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 technological knowledge. It may also change in relation to the risks involved in the activity. As regards activities in the Area, it seems reasonable to state that prospecting is, generally speaking, less risky than exploration activities which, in turn, entail less risk than exploitation. Moreover, activities in the Area concerning different kinds of minerals, for example, polymetallic nodules on the one hand and polymetallic sulphides or cobalt rich ferromanganese crusts on the other, may require different standards of diligence. The standard of due diligence has to be more severe for the riskier activities.³⁴ ## 3. Vigilance and Prevention Due diligence includes vigilance and prevention as held by the ICJ with respect to the maintenance of ecological balance in the *Pulp Mills* case. This vigilance and prevention is all the more important in the preservation of the ecological balance, since the negative impact of human activities on the waters of the river may affect other components of the ecosystem of the watercourse such as its flora, fauna, and soil. The obligation to co-ordinate, through the Commission, the adoption of the necessary measures, as well as their enforcement and observance, assumes, in this context, a central role in the overall system of protection of the River Uruguay established by the 1975 Statute. It is therefore of crucial importance that the Parties respect this obligation.³⁵ In this case, the Court concluded that under customary environmental law, due diligence calls for an environmental impact assessment, when industrial activities risk having a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource.³⁶ ## 4. Exchange of Information and Warning Due diligence with respect to the safeguarding of the rights of other States includes an exchange of information and warning, as the ICJ already stated in the *Corfu Channel* case.³⁷ ³⁴ ITLOS, *Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area* (note 16), para. 117. ³⁵ ICJ, *Pulp Mills* (note 15), para. 188. ³⁶ *Ibid.*, para. 204. ³⁷ *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), 22. POSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK 183 ## IV. Regulatory Approaches ### A. Layers of Responsibility #### 1. Private Actors Including Service Providers The responsibility of private actors which undertake cyber attacks has several dimensions which range from civil liability to criminal responsibility, e.g. under the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.³⁸ However, ‘Corporate cyber-responsibility’ of service providers will not be easy to establish, as requirements of reliable identification of e-mail account holders and of senders encounter political resistance and raise difficult legal issues.³⁹ #### 2. Responsibility of States of Origin of Cyber Threats De lege ferenda, the responsibility of States of origin of cyber threats can be established by treaty-based, institutional arrangements, e.g. for the exchange of risk relevant information. In addition, the establishment of an institutionalised supervision mechanism which monitors individual and corporate activities should be considered. A possible model is the National Contact Points for Corporate Social Responsibility system set out in the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development’s (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.⁴⁰ --- ³⁸ Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, CETS No. 185. ³⁹ See Debra Wong Yang/Brian M. Hoffstadt, Countering the Cyber-Crime Threat, American Criminal Law Review 43 (2006), 201; Oona A. Hathaway, The Law of Cyber-Attack, California Law Review 100 (2012), 817, 879 et seq. ⁴⁰ See Herdegen (note 13), 111 et seq. GERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 ## 3. Due Diligence of Corporate Targets Corporate targets of cyber attacks should also be deemed to have a duty of diligence to prevent and minimise damages. This is, however, primarily a matter of national policy and domestic regulation. ## B. Form of Regulation While intergovernmental cooperation can be based on international agreements, an alternative might be ‘soft law’ instruments such as guiding principles or codes of conduct of international organisations such as the OECD. ## C. Institutional Framework In the institutional design, an intergovernmental architecture may be constructed with a multi-stakeholder approach which integrates private bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force,⁴¹ non-governmental organisations, or hybrid organisations (ICANN) into fora for cooperation or for the development of technical standards. While the added value of a multi-stakeholder approach should not be over-estimated, it would enhance the pull to compliance with any international standards on due diligence and foster the effective protection of cyber-security. ## V. Conclusion International law is still in a rather early stage in terms of responding to cyber-threats. States must apply due diligence in supervising threats to cyber-security which may affect other States and prevent substantial harm by transboundary activities, however the rules on State responsibility for attacs on cyber-security by private actors are rather rudimentary. It is submitted that ‘overall control’ rather than ‘effective ⁴¹ For further information see https://www.ietf.org/ (accessed on 12 November 2015). POSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK control' should be the appropriate standard of attribution and regulatory models for international cooperation should include governments, non-governmental organisations, private corporations as well as hybrid organisations such as ICANN. . # GENERAL ARTICLES ."

Whilst some of these threats are linked to wrongful acts directly attributable to States, many attacks and intrusions are authored by private persons. These threats from non-State actors catalyse the call for due diligence standards for States in terms of prevention, monitoring, and international cooperation. Responsibility of States for acts by private persons should rest on 'overall control' rather than 'effective control'. Due diligence standards with respect to cyber security can draw on several interconnected conceptual bases for due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty: respect for international common goods, obligations to prevent private acts aiming at transboundary harm (as recognised in the Corfu Channel case), freedom of communication, and the responsibility for shared sources. Due diligence includes the obligation to take appropriate measures which are commensurate with the risk to be averted. It also encompasses vigilance and prevention as well as an exchange of information and warnings. Regulatory approaches must identify responsible actors (private persons, States of origin of cyber threats, and corporate targets). International cooperation can be based on international agreements or instruments of 'soft law'. For the design of the institutional framework, strong reasons suggest a multi-stakeholder approach which integrates private bodies, non-governmental organisations, or hybrid organisations.\nKEYWORDS: Cyber Security, State Responsibility, Standards of Control, Due Diligence, Prevention, Warning, International Cooperation\n* Professor for Public Law; Director of the Institute for Public International Law, University of Bonn.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n## I. Different Threats to Cyber Security\nIn the design of cyberspace and digital infrastructures unhampered access and free flow of data are key principles when determining function and utilisation. These functional criteria have so far trumped other objectives such as resilience to risks of abuse and security. This makes digital networks an easy and tempting target for attacks which aim at siphoning off data or at functional disruption by States, non-governmental entities, or individuals.\nThis contribution will not focus on the current debate on legitimate or illegitimate harvesting of data. Nor will it comment on the complex relationship between allied States which includes unilateral or mutual data fishing as well as sharing informations relevant to their national security interests.\nDiscussion in international law on cyberspace has, until recently, focused on cyber attacks in context with armed conflicts. Only in recent years, has the debate in public international law extended to threats beyond a military context. It seems appropriate to distinguish between different kinds of threats to security and stability of cyber systems:\n1. Attacks directly against the integrity of cyber systems in terms of intentionally inflicted damage to computer systems or networks or digital information and\n2. Intrusions intended to abuse and exploit digital networks and other systems without affecting the integrity of the infrastructures as such, e.g. for purposes of cyber espionage (cyber trespassing, cyber exploitation).\nIn both cases, we must further distinguish between wrongful acts attributable to States and responsibility flowing from due diligence standards of monitoring and international cooperation.\n---\n Catherine B.

Responsibility for Wrongful Acts Attributable to States\n### A. Primary Norms Related to Cyber Security\nState responsibility, in principle, rests on the violation of a ‘primary’ norm of international law (Article 1 ILC Articles on State Responsibility). There are a number of such primary norms related to cyber security in specific sectors of international law, especially with respect to treaties and security council resolutions against terrorism, the law of the sea, the law of air transport, and telecommunications law.\nFor present purposes, it seems more important to focus on the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs of other States and, possibly, human rights which prohibit States from threatening or damaging the life and property of persons abroad as well as civil and military assets of other States including clinical infrastructures. As far as these protected rights and goods are affected, customary international law taints attacks against the integrity of computer networks with illegality.\nThe legal situation is quite different with respect to other cross-border intrusions and abuses of digital infrastructures, especially for the purpose of military or industrial espionage. In this context, acts directed against cyber security, as a rule, do not appear on the regulatory screen of international law. The international perspective merely qualifies espionage as acts fraught with high risks for the perpetrators and defers to sanctions under national law. In both times of peace and war, espionage is not a regulatory theme of customary international law (which simply leaves the target State free to prosecute the spy or to declare him *persona non grata* if he is vested with diplomatic immunity). Therefore, protection of confidentiality and privacy of data flows can only be established on the basis of international treaties.\n---\n International Law Commission (ILC) Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 43 et seq.

Attribution and State Responsibility\n### 1. Actions of State Organs\nAs a rule, State responsibility for the violation of international law will be triggered by the acts of State organs (Article 2 ILC Articles on State Responsibility).\n### 2. Actions by Private Persons and Non-Governmental Entities: Control by the State\nActs of private persons and non-State entities establish State responsibility only where there is a certain degree of authority and control over the private activities, e.g. hackers instigated and sponsored by their home government. The ILC Articles on State Responsibility simply refer to actions “on the instructions of, or under the direction and control” of the State concerned. This necessary degree of “direction and control” is, however, a matter of controversy.\nAt least in the context of armed activities, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) clearly favours very narrow conditions for attribution, e.g. the establishment of ‘effective control’ that also extends to specific operations carried out by private persons or entities.\nBy contrast, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia adopted a more lenient standard of attribution, the ‘overall control’ test. There is a growing tendency in international law to follow the more flexible ‘overall control’, which emerged in the context of the attribution of armed attacks to States ‘harbour-\n Art. 8 ILC Articles on State Responsibility: “The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of that State in carrying out the conduct”.\n International Court of Justice (ICJ), Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Otherwise the requisite evidence would amount to a kind of probatio diabolica.\nOf course, traceability is a most complex and contentious issue where concerns of privacy and free communication in an open society clash with interests of national and international security. Traceability vests democratic governments and authoritarian regimes alike with instruments of supervision, albeit for quite different purposes. In any case, traceability can realistically be conceptualised in an asymmetric way. The European debate on the processing of electronic communication and privacy8 amply demonstrates the controversial nature of the issue.\nIn the context of traceability, we must also consider preexisting imbalances in the non-negotiated access of certain governments to transatlantic glass fibre-cables and other communication facilities. The State in which a service provider is incorporated or has its seat of management has usually more leverage as to the disclosure of data by the provider. If a State siphons off electronic communication networks located on its own territory or glass fibre cables running through its territorial sea, it acts within its\n\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nown territorial jurisdiction. Similarly, a State may be tapping into cables running through its exclusive economic zone.\n## III. Due Diligence and Cyber Security\n## A. Prevention of Transboundary Harm – Conceptual Basis\nIn contemporary international law, a general principle has emerged which requires States to exercise due diligence to avoid transboundary harm to life and tangible assets of persons domiciled abroad and of foreign States. This principle can be inferred, by way of extrapolation, from a broad range of due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty and the possible control of private actors.\nThere are four interconnected conceptual bases for due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty\n1. Respect for international and domestic common goods, such as the environment in inter-State relations,\n2. Prevention of private actions directed against assets of foreign States or life and property of persons located in foreign territory,\n3. Freedom of communications, and\n4. Responsibility for resources shared with other States.\nDue diligence with respect to cyber security stands in close connection with all four rationales.\n## 1. Respect for the Environment of Other States and for International Common Goods\nBy now, due respect for the environment of other States and global public goods may be considered as part of customary international law. Several United Nations\n See Arts. 58 (1), 79 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 10 December 1982, UNTS 1833, 3 (UNCLOS).\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n(UN) conferences have endorsed such an obligation. Thus, Principle 2 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development declares:\nStates have [...] the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.\nPrinciple 21 Stockholm Declaration follows the same line:\nStates have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.\nA great number of environmental treaties embody this principle and call for appropriate measures to prevent damage to the environment. In its Nuclear Weapons advisory opinion, the ICJ stated:\nThe Court recognizes that the environment is under daily threat and that the use of nuclear weapons could constitute a catastrophe for the environment. The Court also recognizes that the environment is not an abstraction but represents the living space, the quality of life and the very health of human beings, including generations unborn.

In the Pulp Mills case,^[15] the Court held:\nThe Court considers that the obligation laid down in Article 36 [of the Statute on the Rio Uruguay agreed between Argentina and Uruguay] is addressed to both Parties and prescribes the specific conduct of co-ordinating the necessary measures through the Commission to avoid changes to the ecological balance. An obligation to adopt regulatory or administrative measures either individually or jointly and to enforce them is an obligation of conduct. Both Parties are therefore called upon, under Article 36, to exercise due diligence in acting through the Commission for the necessary measures to preserve the ecological balance of the river.\nThis vigilance and prevention is all the more important in the preservation of the ecological balance, since the negative impact of human activities on the waters of the river may affect other components of the ecosystem of the watercourse such as its flora, fauna, and soil. The obligation to co-ordinate, through the Commission, the adoption of the necessary measures, as well as their enforcement and observance, assumes, in this context, a central role in the overall system of protection of the River Uruguay established by the 1975 Statute [...]\nThe Court concluded:\nIt is the opinion of the Court that in order for the Parties properly to comply with their obligations under Article 41 (a) and (b) of the 1975 Statute, they must, for the purposes of protecting and preserving the aquatic environment with respect to activities which may be liable to cause transboundary harm, carry out an environmental impact assessment. [...] In this sense, the obligation to protect and preserve, under Article 41 (a) of the Statute, has to be interpreted in accordance with a practice, which in recent years has gained so much acceptance among States that it may now be considered a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource. Moreover, due diligence, and the duty of vigilance and prevention which it implies, would not be considered to have been exercised, if a party planning works liable to affect the regime of the river or the quality of its waters did not undertake an environmental impact assessment on the potential effects of such works.\n^[14] ICJ, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* (note 13), 226, para. 29.\n^[15] Id., *Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, ICJ Reports 2010, 14, paras. 187 et seq., 204.\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\nThe required standard for prevention is due diligence. In the context of environmental risks associated with deep seabed mining and exploration, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) adopted this standard in its advisory opinion on the Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area. The Tribunal applied the due diligence standard to the supervision of mining companies by their home State or another sponsoring State and related it to “reasonably appropriate measures” in terms of Article 153 (4) UNCLOS and Annex III Article 4 (4) UNCLOS.\nCyberspace and the protection of cyber security stand in close analogy with the environment and environmental protection, at least to the extent that they constitute international public goods and global commons.\n International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, Advisory Opinion of 1 February 2011, para. 117, available at: https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no_17/17_adv_op_010211_en.pdf (accessed on 12 November 2015).\n Ibid., paras. 118 et seq.: “118. Article 153, paragraph 4, last sentence, of the Convention states that the obligation of the sponsoring State in accordance with article 139 of the Convention entails ‘taking all measures necessary to ensure’ compliance by the sponsored contractor. Annex III, article 4, paragraph 4, of the Convention makes it clear that sponsoring States’ ‘responsibility to ensure’ applies ‘within their legal systems’. With these indications [emphasis added] the Convention provides some elements concerning the content of the ‘due diligence’ obligation to ensure. Necessary measures are required and these must be adopted within the legal system of the sponsoring State.\n119. Further light on the expression ‘measures necessary to ensure’ is shed by the Convention if one considers article 139, paragraph 2, last sentence, and Annex III, article 4, paragraph 4, last sentence, of the Convention. The main purpose of these provisions is to exempt sponsoring States that have taken certain measures from liability for damage. The description of the measures to be taken by that State may also be used to clarify its ‘due diligence’ obligation. This description remains in general terms in article 139, paragraph 2, of the Convention which mentions ‘all necessary and appropriate measures to secure effective compliance under article 153, paragraph 4, and Annex III, article 4, paragraph 4’. The latter provision is more specific as it requires the sponsoring State to adopt ‘laws and regulations’ and to take ‘administrative measures which are, within the framework of its legal system, reasonably appropriate for securing compliance by persons under its jurisdiction’.\n120. More specific indications concerning the content of these measures, including aspects relating to their enforcement, with respect to the contents of these measures will be provided in the reply to Question 3. As regards Question 1, it has been established that the ‘due diligence’ obligation ‘to ensure’ requires the sponsoring State to take measures within its legal system and that the measures must be ‘reasonably appropriate’.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n## 2. Prevention of Acts Aimed at Transboundary Harm\nUnder customary international law, States have an obligation to prevent acts carried out within their territory which are designed to cause transboundary harm. The *locus classicus* is to be found in the judgment of the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case (Merits). The Court recognised that States have obligations as to the notification of the existence of a mine field in their territorial waters and to the warning of approaching warships. It based these obligations on\nelementary considerations of humanity, even more exacting in peace than in war; [...] and every State's obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.^[18]^\nThe *Corfu Channel* judgment made the obligation to prevent acts encroaching on the rights of other States dependent on knowledge of such use of its territory. The dissenting opinions of Judge *Winiarski*^[19]^ and *Krylov*^[20]^ focused on the standard of due diligence (\"ought to have seen or heard\"). In the context of the obligation to prevent cross-border armed traffic, the ICJ adopted the due diligence standard in the *Nicaragua Case*.^[21]^\nThe Draft Articles of the International Law Commission (ILC) on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities^[22]^ require the State of origin to \"take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimise the risk thereof\" (Article 3 Draft Articles). As a matter of consequential logic this standard, formulated in the context of high-risk activities not prohibited by international law (Article 1 Draft Articles) must apply to acts which purport to cause significant transboundary harm.\n^[18]^ ICJ, *The Corfu Channel Case* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v. Albania), Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 22.\n^[19]^ *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), Dissenting Opinion of Judge *Winiarski*, ICJ Reports 1949, 4, 51.\n^[20]^ *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), Dissenting Opinion of Judge *Krylov*, ICJ Reports 1949, 4, 71 et seq.\n^[21]^ *Id.*, *Nicaragua Case* (note 5), 14, para. 157.\n^[22]^ ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 148 et seq.\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK 179\nNATO’s Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare states in Rule 5 Tallinn Manual: “A State shall not knowingly allow the cyber instructions located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that aversely and unlawfully affect other States.”\nRule 5 is an echo of the *Corfu Channel* judgment. Under current international law, the narrow criterion of positive knowledge of harmful activities as condition for duties of prevention seems to be justified only in the context of activities which 1. affect other States within the territory, the territorial waters, or the exclusive economic zone of the State concerned or which 2. cause no significant physical harm. In cases of transboundary physical harm, the standard of due diligence applies.\n## 3. Freedom of Communication\nIn the *Corfu Channel* case, the ICJ based the duty of a State to avert damage from activities carried out within its territory (obligations of notification and warning) also on “the principle of the freedom of maritime communication”.\n## 4. Responsibility for Shared Resources\nFinally, obligations of States to avert or minimise the harmful effects from activities carried out within their territory can arise from the common responsibility for shared resources. In this context, cyberspace can be compared to shared resources such as water resources shared by two or more States. Article 7 (1) Draft Articles of the ILC on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses, reads: “Watercourse States shall exercise due diligence to utilize an international water course in such a way as not to cause significant harm to other watercourse States.”\n---\n *Michael N. Schmitt* (ed.), (note 7).\n ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), 22.\n ILC, *The law of the non-navigational uses of international watercourses*, Yearbook of the International Law Commission (YILC) 1994, Vol. II (Part Two), para. 222, 102.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nThe Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses (in force since 17 August 2014) no longer refers to due diligence but obliges watercourse States “to take all appropriate measures to prevent the causing of significant harm to other watercourse States.”\nIn the Pulp Mills case, the ICJ underlined the obligation of vigilance and prevention with respect to private activities which adversely affect a shared resource. Cyberspace constitutes a physical and non-physical resource shared by the internet community (Article 1 Statute of the Internet Corporation for assigned Numbers and Names (ICANN)). The dispute settlement panel in ICM Registry v. ICANN classified ICANN’s functions as the administration of “an intrinsically international resource of immense importance to global communications and economies”. It therefore seems appropriate to apply the due diligence standard broadly recognised in the context of other sources shared by several States to cyberspace.\n## B. Significance of Due Diligence\nUp to now, no precise criteria have been identified to define due diligence with respect to the prevention of cyber attacks and the maintenance of cyber security. Still, some elements can be distilled from international rulings in other contexts.\n## 1. Obligation to Take Appropriate Measures\nThe starting point for obligations to prevent and avert damage to other States and interference with their rights is the obligation to take appropriate measures. This standard is adopted in a number of international treaties on the protection of the environment, the Draft Articles of the ILC on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities (Article 3 Draft Articles), the ITLOS advisory opinion\n ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 204.\n International Centre for Dispute Resolution, ICM Registry v. ICANN, Declaration of the Independent Review Panel, 19 February 2010, ICDR Case No. 50 117 T 00224 08, reprinted in: International Legal Materials 956, Vol. 49 (2010), para. 140.\n See supra, note 12.\n See supra, note 22.\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\non the Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area and the judgment of the ICJ in the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case.\n## 2. Commensurability with the Risk to be Averted\nWith respect to obligations to prevent shipments of military equipment under the rules of neutrality, the award in the Alabama Arbitration (1872) held that the required measures must be commensurate with the risk to be averted. The same criterion appears in the Pulp Mills judgment of the ICJ. In its advisory opinion on the Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, the ITLOS relates due diligence to the degree of risks associated with a particular activity:\nThe content of ‘due diligence’ obligations may not easily be described in precise terms. Among the factors that make such a description difficult is the fact that ‘due diligence’ is a variable concept. It may change over time as measures considered sufficiently diligent at a certain moment may become not diligent enough in light, for instance, of new scientific or\n See supra, note 16.\n ICJ, United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States v. Iran), Judgment of 24 May 1980, ICJ Reports 1980, 3, para. 63.\n Geneva Arbitration Tribunal, Alabama claims of the United States of America against Great Britain, Arbitral Award of 14 September 1872, Reports of International Arbitral Awards XXIX, 125 et seq.\n ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 205: “The Court observes that neither the 1975 Statute nor general international law specify the scope and content of an environmental impact assessment. It points out moreover that Argentina and Uruguay are not parties to the Espoo Convention. Finally, the Court notes that the other instrument to which Argentina refers in support of its arguments, namely, the UNEP Goals and Principles, is not binding on the Parties, but, as guidelines issued by an international technical body, has to be taken into account by each Party in accordance with Article 41 (a) in adopting measures within its domestic regulatory framework. Moreover, this instrument provides only that the ‘environmental effects in an EIA should be assessed with a degree of detail commensurate with their likely environmental significance’ (Principle 5) without giving any indication of minimum core components of the assessment. Consequently, it is the view of the Court that it is for each State to determine in its domestic legislation or in the authorization process for the project, the specific content of the environmental impact assessment required in each case, having regard to the nature and magnitude of the proposed development and its likely adverse impact on the environment as well as to the need to exercise due diligence in conducting such an assessment. The Court also considers that an environmental impact assessment must be conducted prior to the implementation of a project. Moreover, once operations have started and, where necessary, throughout the life of the project, continuous monitoring of its effects on the environment shall be undertaken”.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\ntechnological knowledge. It may also change in relation to the risks involved in the activity. As regards activities in the Area, it seems reasonable to state that prospecting is, generally speaking, less risky than exploration activities which, in turn, entail less risk than exploitation. Moreover, activities in the Area concerning different kinds of minerals, for example, polymetallic nodules on the one hand and polymetallic sulphides or cobalt rich ferromanganese crusts on the other, may require different standards of diligence. The standard of due diligence has to be more severe for the riskier activities.\n## 3. Vigilance and Prevention\nDue diligence includes vigilance and prevention as held by the ICJ with respect to the maintenance of ecological balance in the *Pulp Mills* case.\nThis vigilance and prevention is all the more important in the preservation of the ecological balance, since the negative impact of human activities on the waters of the river may affect other components of the ecosystem of the watercourse such as its flora, fauna, and soil. The obligation to co-ordinate, through the Commission, the adoption of the necessary measures, as well as their enforcement and observance, assumes, in this context, a central role in the overall system of protection of the River Uruguay established by the 1975 Statute. It is therefore of crucial importance that the Parties respect this obligation.\nIn this case, the Court concluded that under customary environmental law, due diligence calls for an environmental impact assessment, when industrial activities risk having a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource.\n## 4. Exchange of Information and Warning\nDue diligence with respect to the safeguarding of the rights of other States includes an exchange of information and warning, as the ICJ already stated in the *Corfu Channel* case.\n ITLOS, *Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area* (note 16), para. 117.\n ICJ, *Pulp Mills* (note 15), para. 188.\n *Ibid.*, para. 204.\n *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), 22.\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK 183\n## IV. Regulatory Approaches\n### A. Layers of Responsibility\n#### 1. Private Actors Including Service Providers\nThe responsibility of private actors which undertake cyber attacks has several dimensions which range from civil liability to criminal responsibility, e.g. under the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. However, ‘Corporate cyber-responsibility’ of service providers will not be easy to establish, as requirements of reliable identification of e-mail account holders and of senders encounter political resistance and raise difficult legal issues.\n#### 2. Responsibility of States of Origin of Cyber Threats\nDe lege ferenda, the responsibility of States of origin of cyber threats can be established by treaty-based, institutional arrangements, e.g. for the exchange of risk relevant information. In addition, the establishment of an institutionalised supervision mechanism which monitors individual and corporate activities should be considered. A possible model is the National Contact Points for Corporate Social Responsibility system set out in the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development’s (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n---\n Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, CETS No. 185.\n See Debra Wong Yang/Brian M. Hoffstadt, Countering the Cyber-Crime Threat, American Criminal Law Review 43 (2006), 201; Oona A. Hathaway, The Law of Cyber-Attack, California Law Review 100 (2012), 817, 879 et seq.\n See Herdegen (note 13), 111 et seq.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n## 3. Due Diligence of Corporate Targets\nCorporate targets of cyber attacks should also be deemed to have a duty of diligence to prevent and minimise damages. This is, however, primarily a matter of national policy and domestic regulation.\n## B. Form of Regulation\nWhile intergovernmental cooperation can be based on international agreements, an alternative might be ‘soft law’ instruments such as guiding principles or codes of conduct of international organisations such as the OECD.\n## C. Institutional Framework\nIn the institutional design, an intergovernmental architecture may be constructed with a multi-stakeholder approach which integrates private bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force, non-governmental organisations, or hybrid organisations (ICANN) into fora for cooperation or for the development of technical standards.\nWhile the added value of a multi-stakeholder approach should not be over-estimated, it would enhance the pull to compliance with any international standards on due diligence and foster the effective protection of cyber-security.\n## V. Conclusion\nInternational law is still in a rather early stage in terms of responding to cyber-threats. States must apply due diligence in supervising threats to cyber-security which may affect other States and prevent substantial harm by transboundary activities, however the rules on State responsibility for attacs on cyber-security by private actors are rather rudimentary. It is submitted that ‘overall control’ rather than ‘effective\n For further information see https://www.ietf.org/ (accessed on 12 November 2015).\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\ncontrol' should be the appropriate standard of attribution and regulatory models for international cooperation should include governments, non-governmental organisations, private corporations as well as hybrid organisations such as ICANN.\n.\n# GENERAL ARTICLES\n."

Whilst some of these threats are linked to wrongful acts directly attributable to States, many attacks and intrusions are authored by private persons. These threats from non-State actors catalyse the call for due diligence standards for States in terms of prevention, monitoring, and international cooperation. Responsibility of States for acts by private persons should rest on 'overall control' rather than 'effective control'. Due diligence standards with respect to cyber security can draw on several interconnected conceptual bases for due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty: respect for international common goods, obligations to prevent private acts aiming at transboundary harm (as recognised in the Corfu Channel case), freedom of communication, and the responsibility for shared sources. Due diligence includes the obligation to take appropriate measures which are commensurate with the risk to be averted. It also encompasses vigilance and prevention as well as an exchange of information and warnings. Regulatory approaches must identify responsible actors (private persons, States of origin of cyber threats, and corporate targets). International cooperation can be based on international agreements or instruments of 'soft law'. For the design of the institutional framework, strong reasons suggest a multi-stakeholder approach which integrates private bodies, non-governmental organisations, or hybrid organisations.\nKEYWORDS: Cyber Security, State Responsibility, Standards of Control, Due Diligence, Prevention, Warning, International Cooperation\n* Professor for Public Law; Director of the Institute for Public International Law, University of Bonn.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n## I. Different Threats to Cyber Security\nIn the design of cyberspace and digital infrastructures unhampered access and free flow of data are key principles when determining function and utilisation. These functional criteria have so far trumped other objectives such as resilience to risks of abuse and security. This makes digital networks an easy and tempting target for attacks which aim at siphoning off data or at functional disruption by States, non-governmental entities, or individuals.\nThis contribution will not focus on the current debate on legitimate or illegitimate harvesting of data. Nor will it comment on the complex relationship between allied States which includes unilateral or mutual data fishing as well as sharing informations relevant to their national security interests.\nDiscussion in international law on cyberspace¹ has, until recently, focused on cyber attacks in context with armed conflicts. Only in recent years, has the debate in public international law extended to threats beyond a military context. It seems appropriate to distinguish between different kinds of threats to security and stability of cyber systems:\n1. Attacks directly against the integrity of cyber systems in terms of intentionally inflicted damage to computer systems or networks or digital information and\n2. Intrusions intended to abuse and exploit digital networks and other systems without affecting the integrity of the infrastructures as such, e.g. for purposes of cyber espionage (cyber trespassing, cyber exploitation).\nIn both cases, we must further distinguish between wrongful acts attributable to States and responsibility flowing from due diligence standards of monitoring and international cooperation.\n---\n¹ Catherine B.

Responsibility for Wrongful Acts Attributable to States\n### A. Primary Norms Related to Cyber Security\nState responsibility, in principle, rests on the violation of a ‘primary’ norm of international law (Article 1 ILC Articles on State Responsibility²). There are a number of such primary norms related to cyber security in specific sectors of international law, especially with respect to treaties and security council resolutions against terrorism, the law of the sea, the law of air transport, and telecommunications law.\nFor present purposes, it seems more important to focus on the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs of other States and, possibly, human rights which prohibit States from threatening or damaging the life and property of persons abroad as well as civil and military assets of other States including clinical infrastructures. As far as these protected rights and goods are affected, customary international law taints attacks against the integrity of computer networks with illegality.\nThe legal situation is quite different with respect to other cross-border intrusions and abuses of digital infrastructures, especially for the purpose of military or industrial espionage. In this context, acts directed against cyber security, as a rule, do not appear on the regulatory screen of international law. The international perspective merely qualifies espionage as acts fraught with high risks for the perpetrators and defers to sanctions under national law.³ In both times of peace and war, espionage is not a regulatory theme of customary international law (which simply leaves the target State free to prosecute the spy or to declare him *persona non grata* if he is vested with diplomatic immunity). Therefore, protection of confidentiality and privacy of data flows can only be established on the basis of international treaties.\n---\n² International Law Commission (ILC) Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 43 et seq.

Attribution and State Responsibility\n### 1. Actions of State Organs\nAs a rule, State responsibility for the violation of international law will be triggered by the acts of State organs (Article 2 ILC Articles on State Responsibility).\n### 2. Actions by Private Persons and Non-Governmental Entities: Control by the State\nActs of private persons and non-State entities establish State responsibility only where there is a certain degree of authority and control over the private activities, e.g. hackers instigated and sponsored by their home government. The ILC Articles on State Responsibility simply refer to actions “on the instructions of, or under the direction and control” of the State concerned.⁴ This necessary degree of “direction and control” is, however, a matter of controversy.\nAt least in the context of armed activities, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) clearly favours very narrow conditions for attribution, e.g. the establishment of ‘effective control’ that also extends to specific operations carried out by private persons or entities.⁵\nBy contrast, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia adopted a more lenient standard of attribution, the ‘overall control’ test.⁶ There is a growing tendency in international law to follow the more flexible ‘overall control’, which emerged in the context of the attribution of armed attacks to States ‘harbour-\n⁴ Art. 8 ILC Articles on State Responsibility: “The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of that State in carrying out the conduct”.\n⁵ International Court of Justice (ICJ), Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Otherwise the requisite evidence would amount to a kind of probatio diabolica.\nOf course, traceability is a most complex and contentious issue where concerns of privacy and free communication in an open society clash with interests of national and international security. Traceability vests democratic governments and authoritarian regimes alike with instruments of supervision, albeit for quite different purposes. In any case, traceability can realistically be conceptualised in an asymmetric way. The European debate on the processing of electronic communication and privacy8 amply demonstrates the controversial nature of the issue.\nIn the context of traceability, we must also consider preexisting imbalances in the non-negotiated access of certain governments to transatlantic glass fibre-cables and other communication facilities. The State in which a service provider is incorporated or has its seat of management has usually more leverage as to the disclosure of data by the provider. If a State siphons off electronic communication networks located on its own territory or glass fibre cables running through its territorial sea, it acts within its\n7 Johann-Christoph Woltag, Cyber Warfare, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), MPEPIL, Vol. II (2012), 988, para. 22; Alexander Kees, Responsibility of States for Private Actors, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), MPEPIL, Vol. VIII (2012), 959, para. 18; Stefan Talmon, The Various Control Tests in the Law of State Responsibility and the Responsibility of Outside powers for Acts of Secessionist Entities, International and Comparative Law Quarterly 58 (2009), 493; Shackelford/Andres (note 1), 988; Laurie R.

Similarly, a State may be tapping into cables running through its exclusive economic zone.⁹\n## III. Due Diligence and Cyber Security\n## A. Prevention of Transboundary Harm – Conceptual Basis\nIn contemporary international law, a general principle has emerged which requires States to exercise due diligence to avoid transboundary harm to life and tangible assets of persons domiciled abroad and of foreign States. This principle can be inferred, by way of extrapolation, from a broad range of due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty and the possible control of private actors.\nThere are four interconnected conceptual bases for due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty\n1. Respect for international and domestic common goods, such as the environment in inter-State relations,\n2. Prevention of private actions directed against assets of foreign States or life and property of persons located in foreign territory,\n3. Freedom of communications, and\n4. Responsibility for resources shared with other States.\nDue diligence with respect to cyber security stands in close connection with all four rationales.\n## 1. Respect for the Environment of Other States and for International Common Goods\nBy now, due respect for the environment of other States and global public goods may be considered as part of customary international law. Several United Nations\n⁹ See Arts. 58 (1), 79 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 10 December 1982, UNTS 1833, 3 (UNCLOS).\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n(UN) conferences have endorsed such an obligation. Thus, Principle 2 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development¹⁰ declares:\nStates have [...] the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.\nPrinciple 21 Stockholm Declaration¹¹ follows the same line:\nStates have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.\nA great number of environmental treaties embody this principle and call for appropriate measures to prevent damage to the environment.¹² In its Nuclear Weapons advisory opinion, the ICJ stated:¹³\nThe Court recognizes that the environment is under daily threat and that the use of nuclear weapons could constitute a catastrophe for the environment. The Court also recognizes that the environment is not an abstraction but represents the living space, the quality of life and the very health of human beings, including generations unborn.

In the Pulp Mills case,^ the Court held:\nThe Court considers that the obligation laid down in Article 36 [of the Statute on the Rio Uruguay agreed between Argentina and Uruguay] is addressed to both Parties and prescribes the specific conduct of co-ordinating the necessary measures through the Commission to avoid changes to the ecological balance. An obligation to adopt regulatory or administrative measures either individually or jointly and to enforce them is an obligation of conduct. Both Parties are therefore called upon, under Article 36, to exercise due diligence in acting through the Commission for the necessary measures to preserve the ecological balance of the river.\nThis vigilance and prevention is all the more important in the preservation of the ecological balance, since the negative impact of human activities on the waters of the river may affect other components of the ecosystem of the watercourse such as its flora, fauna, and soil. The obligation to co-ordinate, through the Commission, the adoption of the necessary measures, as well as their enforcement and observance, assumes, in this context, a central role in the overall system of protection of the River Uruguay established by the 1975 Statute [...]\nThe Court concluded:\nIt is the opinion of the Court that in order for the Parties properly to comply with their obligations under Article 41 (a) and (b) of the 1975 Statute, they must, for the purposes of protecting and preserving the aquatic environment with respect to activities which may be liable to cause transboundary harm, carry out an environmental impact assessment. [...] In this sense, the obligation to protect and preserve, under Article 41 (a) of the Statute, has to be interpreted in accordance with a practice, which in recent years has gained so much acceptance among States that it may now be considered a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource. Moreover, due diligence, and the duty of vigilance and prevention which it implies, would not be considered to have been exercised, if a party planning works liable to affect the regime of the river or the quality of its waters did not undertake an environmental impact assessment on the potential effects of such works.\n^ ICJ, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* (note 13), 226, para. 29.\n^ Id., *Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, ICJ Reports 2010, 14, paras. 187 et seq., 204.\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\nThe required standard for prevention is due diligence. In the context of environmental risks associated with deep seabed mining and exploration, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) adopted this standard in its advisory opinion on the Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area.¹⁶ The Tribunal applied the due diligence standard to the supervision of mining companies by their home State or another sponsoring State and related it to “reasonably appropriate measures” in terms of Article 153 (4) UNCLOS and Annex III Article 4 (4) UNCLOS.¹⁷\nCyberspace and the protection of cyber security stand in close analogy with the environment and environmental protection, at least to the extent that they constitute international public goods and global commons.\n¹⁶ International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, Advisory Opinion of 1 February 2011, para. 117, available at: https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no_17/17_adv_op_010211_en.pdf (accessed on 12 November 2015).\n¹⁷ Ibid., paras. 118 et seq.: “118. Article 153, paragraph 4, last sentence, of the Convention states that the obligation of the sponsoring State in accordance with article 139 of the Convention entails ‘taking all measures necessary to ensure’ compliance by the sponsored contractor. Annex III, article 4, paragraph 4, of the Convention makes it clear that sponsoring States’ ‘responsibility to ensure’ applies ‘within their legal systems’. With these indications [emphasis added] the Convention provides some elements concerning the content of the ‘due diligence’ obligation to ensure. Necessary measures are required and these must be adopted within the legal system of the sponsoring State.\n119. Further light on the expression ‘measures necessary to ensure’ is shed by the Convention if one considers article 139, paragraph 2, last sentence, and Annex III, article 4, paragraph 4, last sentence, of the Convention. The main purpose of these provisions is to exempt sponsoring States that have taken certain measures from liability for damage. The description of the measures to be taken by that State may also be used to clarify its ‘due diligence’ obligation. This description remains in general terms in article 139, paragraph 2, of the Convention which mentions ‘all necessary and appropriate measures to secure effective compliance under article 153, paragraph 4, and Annex III, article 4, paragraph 4’. The latter provision is more specific as it requires the sponsoring State to adopt ‘laws and regulations’ and to take ‘administrative measures which are, within the framework of its legal system, reasonably appropriate for securing compliance by persons under its jurisdiction’.\n120. More specific indications concerning the content of these measures, including aspects relating to their enforcement, with respect to the contents of these measures will be provided in the reply to Question 3. As regards Question 1, it has been established that the ‘due diligence’ obligation ‘to ensure’ requires the sponsoring State to take measures within its legal system and that the measures must be ‘reasonably appropriate’.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n## 2. Prevention of Acts Aimed at Transboundary Harm\nUnder customary international law, States have an obligation to prevent acts carried out within their territory which are designed to cause transboundary harm. The *locus classicus* is to be found in the judgment of the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case (Merits). The Court recognised that States have obligations as to the notification of the existence of a mine field in their territorial waters and to the warning of approaching warships. It based these obligations on\nelementary considerations of humanity, even more exacting in peace than in war; [...] and every State's obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.^^\nThe *Corfu Channel* judgment made the obligation to prevent acts encroaching on the rights of other States dependent on knowledge of such use of its territory. The dissenting opinions of Judge *Winiarski*^^ and *Krylov*^^ focused on the standard of due diligence (\"ought to have seen or heard\"). In the context of the obligation to prevent cross-border armed traffic, the ICJ adopted the due diligence standard in the *Nicaragua Case*.^^\nThe Draft Articles of the International Law Commission (ILC) on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities^^ require the State of origin to \"take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimise the risk thereof\" (Article 3 Draft Articles). As a matter of consequential logic this standard, formulated in the context of high-risk activities not prohibited by international law (Article 1 Draft Articles) must apply to acts which purport to cause significant transboundary harm.\n^^ ICJ, *The Corfu Channel Case* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v. Albania), Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 22.\n^^ *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), Dissenting Opinion of Judge *Winiarski*, ICJ Reports 1949, 4, 51.\n^^ *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), Dissenting Opinion of Judge *Krylov*, ICJ Reports 1949, 4, 71 et seq.\n^^ *Id.*, *Nicaragua Case* (note 5), 14, para. 157.\n^^ ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 148 et seq.\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK 179\nNATO’s Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare²³ states in Rule 5 Tallinn Manual: “A State shall not knowingly allow the cyber instructions located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that aversely and unlawfully affect other States.”\nRule 5 is an echo of the *Corfu Channel* judgment. Under current international law, the narrow criterion of positive knowledge of harmful activities as condition for duties of prevention seems to be justified only in the context of activities which 1. affect other States within the territory, the territorial waters, or the exclusive economic zone of the State concerned or which 2. cause no significant physical harm. In cases of transboundary physical harm, the standard of due diligence applies.\n## 3. Freedom of Communication\nIn the *Corfu Channel* case, the ICJ based the duty of a State to avert damage from activities carried out within its territory (obligations of notification and warning) also on “the principle of the freedom of maritime communication”.²⁴\n## 4. Responsibility for Shared Resources\nFinally, obligations of States to avert or minimise the harmful effects from activities carried out within their territory can arise from the common responsibility for shared resources. In this context, cyberspace can be compared to shared resources such as water resources shared by two or more States. Article 7 (1) Draft Articles of the ILC on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses,²⁵ reads: “Watercourse States shall exercise due diligence to utilize an international water course in such a way as not to cause significant harm to other watercourse States.”\n---\n²³ *Michael N. Schmitt* (ed.), (note 7).\n²⁴ ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), 22.\n²⁵ ILC, *The law of the non-navigational uses of international watercourses*, Yearbook of the International Law Commission (YILC) 1994, Vol. II (Part Two), para. 222, 102.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nThe Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses (in force since 17 August 2014) no longer refers to due diligence but obliges watercourse States “to take all appropriate measures to prevent the causing of significant harm to other watercourse States.”\nIn the Pulp Mills case, the ICJ underlined the obligation of vigilance and prevention with respect to private activities which adversely affect a shared resource.²⁶ Cyberspace constitutes a physical and non-physical resource shared by the internet community (Article 1 Statute of the Internet Corporation for assigned Numbers and Names (ICANN)). The dispute settlement panel in ICM Registry v. ICANN classified ICANN’s functions as the administration of “an intrinsically international resource of immense importance to global communications and economies”.²⁷ It therefore seems appropriate to apply the due diligence standard broadly recognised in the context of other sources shared by several States to cyberspace.\n## B. Significance of Due Diligence\nUp to now, no precise criteria have been identified to define due diligence with respect to the prevention of cyber attacks and the maintenance of cyber security. Still, some elements can be distilled from international rulings in other contexts.\n## 1. Obligation to Take Appropriate Measures\nThe starting point for obligations to prevent and avert damage to other States and interference with their rights is the obligation to take appropriate measures. This standard is adopted in a number of international treaties on the protection of the environment,²⁸ the Draft Articles of the ILC on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities²⁹ (Article 3 Draft Articles), the ITLOS advisory opinion\n²⁶ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 204.\n²⁷ International Centre for Dispute Resolution, ICM Registry v.

Commensurability with the Risk to be Averted\nWith respect to obligations to prevent shipments of military equipment under the rules of neutrality, the award in the Alabama Arbitration (1872) held that the required measures must be commensurate with the risk to be averted.³² The same criterion appears in the Pulp Mills judgment of the ICJ.³³ In its advisory opinion on the Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, the ITLOS relates due diligence to the degree of risks associated with a particular activity:\nThe content of ‘due diligence’ obligations may not easily be described in precise terms. Among the factors that make such a description difficult is the fact that ‘due diligence’ is a variable concept. It may change over time as measures considered sufficiently diligent at a certain moment may become not diligent enough in light, for instance, of new scientific or\n³⁰ See supra, note 16.\n³¹ ICJ, United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States v. Iran), Judgment of 24 May 1980, ICJ Reports 1980, 3, para. 63.\n³² Geneva Arbitration Tribunal, Alabama claims of the United States of America against Great Britain, Arbitral Award of 14 September 1872, Reports of International Arbitral Awards XXIX, 125 et seq.\n³³ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 205: “The Court observes that neither the 1975 Statute nor general international law specify the scope and content of an environmental impact assessment. It points out moreover that Argentina and Uruguay are not parties to the Espoo Convention. Finally, the Court notes that the other instrument to which Argentina refers in support of its arguments, namely, the UNEP Goals and Principles, is not binding on the Parties, but, as guidelines issued by an international technical body, has to be taken into account by each Party in accordance with Article 41 (a) in adopting measures within its domestic regulatory framework. Moreover, this instrument provides only that the ‘environmental effects in an EIA should be assessed with a degree of detail commensurate with their likely environmental significance’ (Principle 5) without giving any indication of minimum core components of the assessment. Consequently, it is the view of the Court that it is for each State to determine in its domestic legislation or in the authorization process for the project, the specific content of the environmental impact assessment required in each case, having regard to the nature and magnitude of the proposed development and its likely adverse impact on the environment as well as to the need to exercise due diligence in conducting such an assessment. The Court also considers that an environmental impact assessment must be conducted prior to the implementation of a project. Moreover, once operations have started and, where necessary, throughout the life of the project, continuous monitoring of its effects on the environment shall be undertaken”.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\ntechnological knowledge. It may also change in relation to the risks involved in the activity. As regards activities in the Area, it seems reasonable to state that prospecting is, generally speaking, less risky than exploration activities which, in turn, entail less risk than exploitation. Moreover, activities in the Area concerning different kinds of minerals, for example, polymetallic nodules on the one hand and polymetallic sulphides or cobalt rich ferromanganese crusts on the other, may require different standards of diligence. The standard of due diligence has to be more severe for the riskier activities.³⁴\n## 3. Vigilance and Prevention\nDue diligence includes vigilance and prevention as held by the ICJ with respect to the maintenance of ecological balance in the *Pulp Mills* case.\nThis vigilance and prevention is all the more important in the preservation of the ecological balance, since the negative impact of human activities on the waters of the river may affect other components of the ecosystem of the watercourse such as its flora, fauna, and soil. The obligation to co-ordinate, through the Commission, the adoption of the necessary measures, as well as their enforcement and observance, assumes, in this context, a central role in the overall system of protection of the River Uruguay established by the 1975 Statute. It is therefore of crucial importance that the Parties respect this obligation.³⁵\nIn this case, the Court concluded that under customary environmental law, due diligence calls for an environmental impact assessment, when industrial activities risk having a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource.³⁶\n## 4. Exchange of Information and Warning\nDue diligence with respect to the safeguarding of the rights of other States includes an exchange of information and warning, as the ICJ already stated in the *Corfu Channel* case.³⁷\n³⁴ ITLOS, *Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area* (note 16), para. 117.\n³⁵ ICJ, *Pulp Mills* (note 15), para. 188.\n³⁶ *Ibid.*, para. 204.\n³⁷ *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), 22.\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK 183\n## IV. Regulatory Approaches\n### A. Layers of Responsibility\n#### 1. Private Actors Including Service Providers\nThe responsibility of private actors which undertake cyber attacks has several dimensions which range from civil liability to criminal responsibility, e.g. under the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.³⁸ However, ‘Corporate cyber-responsibility’ of service providers will not be easy to establish, as requirements of reliable identification of e-mail account holders and of senders encounter political resistance and raise difficult legal issues.³⁹\n#### 2. Responsibility of States of Origin of Cyber Threats\nDe lege ferenda, the responsibility of States of origin of cyber threats can be established by treaty-based, institutional arrangements, e.g. for the exchange of risk relevant information. In addition, the establishment of an institutionalised supervision mechanism which monitors individual and corporate activities should be considered. A possible model is the National Contact Points for Corporate Social Responsibility system set out in the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development’s (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.⁴⁰\n---\n³⁸ Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, CETS No. 185.\n³⁹ See Debra Wong Yang/Brian M.

Due Diligence of Corporate Targets\nCorporate targets of cyber attacks should also be deemed to have a duty of diligence to prevent and minimise damages. This is, however, primarily a matter of national policy and domestic regulation.\n## B. Form of Regulation\nWhile intergovernmental cooperation can be based on international agreements, an alternative might be ‘soft law’ instruments such as guiding principles or codes of conduct of international organisations such as the OECD.\n## C. Institutional Framework\nIn the institutional design, an intergovernmental architecture may be constructed with a multi-stakeholder approach which integrates private bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force,⁴¹ non-governmental organisations, or hybrid organisations (ICANN) into fora for cooperation or for the development of technical standards.\nWhile the added value of a multi-stakeholder approach should not be over-estimated, it would enhance the pull to compliance with any international standards on due diligence and foster the effective protection of cyber-security.\n## V. Conclusion\nInternational law is still in a rather early stage in terms of responding to cyber-threats. States must apply due diligence in supervising threats to cyber-security which may affect other States and prevent substantial harm by transboundary activities, however the rules on State responsibility for attacs on cyber-security by private actors are rather rudimentary. It is submitted that ‘overall control’ rather than ‘effective\n⁴¹ For further information see https://www.ietf.org/ (accessed on 12 November 2015).\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\ncontrol' should be the appropriate standard of attribution and regulatory models for international cooperation should include governments, non-governmental organisations, private corporations as well as hybrid organisations such as ICANN.\n.\n# GENERAL ARTICLES\n."

Whilst some of these threats are linked to wrongful acts directly attributable to States, many attacks and intrusions are authored by private persons. These threats from non-State actors catalyse the call for due diligence standards for States in terms of prevention, monitoring, and international cooperation. Responsibility of States for acts by private persons should rest on 'overall control' rather than 'effective control'. Due diligence standards with respect to cyber security can draw on several interconnected conceptual bases for due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty: respect for international common goods, obligations to prevent private acts aiming at transboundary harm (as recognised in the Corfu Channel case), freedom of communication, and the responsibility for shared sources. Due diligence includes the obligation to take appropriate measures which are commensurate with the risk to be averted. It also encompasses vigilance and prevention as well as an exchange of information and warnings. Regulatory approaches must identify responsible actors (private persons, States of origin of cyber threats, and corporate targets). International cooperation can be based on international agreements or instruments of 'soft law'. For the design of the institutional framework, strong reasons suggest a multi-stakeholder approach which integrates private bodies, non-governmental organisations, or hybrid organisations.\nKEYWORDS: Cyber Security, State Responsibility, Standards of Control, Due Diligence, Prevention, Warning, International Cooperation * Professor for Public Law; Director of the Institute for Public International Law, University of Bonn.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 ## I. Different Threats to Cyber Security In the design of cyberspace and digital infrastructures unhampered access and free flow of data are key principles when determining function and utilisation. These functional criteria have so far trumped other objectives such as resilience to risks of abuse and security. This makes digital networks an easy and tempting target for attacks which aim at siphoning off data or at functional disruption by States, non-governmental entities, or individuals.\nThis contribution will not focus on the current debate on legitimate or illegitimate harvesting of data. Nor will it comment on the complex relationship between allied States which includes unilateral or mutual data fishing as well as sharing informations relevant to their national security interests.\nDiscussion in international law on cyberspace¹ has, until recently, focused on cyber attacks in context with armed conflicts. Only in recent years, has the debate in public international law extended to threats beyond a military context. It seems appropriate to distinguish between different kinds of threats to security and stability of cyber systems: In both cases, we must further distinguish between wrongful acts attributable to States and responsibility flowing from due diligence standards of monitoring and international cooperation.\n--- ¹ Catherine B.

Responsibility for Wrongful Acts Attributable to States ### A. Primary Norms Related to Cyber Security State responsibility, in principle, rests on the violation of a ‘primary’ norm of international law (Article 1 ILC Articles on State Responsibility²). There are a number of such primary norms related to cyber security in specific sectors of international law, especially with respect to treaties and security council resolutions against terrorism, the law of the sea, the law of air transport, and telecommunications law.\nFor present purposes, it seems more important to focus on the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs of other States and, possibly, human rights which prohibit States from threatening or damaging the life and property of persons abroad as well as civil and military assets of other States including clinical infrastructures. As far as these protected rights and goods are affected, customary international law taints attacks against the integrity of computer networks with illegality.\nThe legal situation is quite different with respect to other cross-border intrusions and abuses of digital infrastructures, especially for the purpose of military or industrial espionage. In this context, acts directed against cyber security, as a rule, do not appear on the regulatory screen of international law. The international perspective merely qualifies espionage as acts fraught with high risks for the perpetrators and defers to sanctions under national law.³ In both times of peace and war, espionage is not a regulatory theme of customary international law (which simply leaves the target State free to prosecute the spy or to declare him *persona non grata* if he is vested with diplomatic immunity). Therefore, protection of confidentiality and privacy of data flows can only be established on the basis of international treaties.\n--- ² International Law Commission (ILC) Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 43 et seq.

Attribution and State Responsibility ### 1. Actions of State Organs As a rule, State responsibility for the violation of international law will be triggered by the acts of State organs (Article 2 ILC Articles on State Responsibility).\n### 2. Actions by Private Persons and Non-Governmental Entities: Control by the State Acts of private persons and non-State entities establish State responsibility only where there is a certain degree of authority and control over the private activities, e.g. hackers instigated and sponsored by their home government. The ILC Articles on State Responsibility simply refer to actions “on the instructions of, or under the direction and control” of the State concerned.⁴ This necessary degree of “direction and control” is, however, a matter of controversy.\nAt least in the context of armed activities, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) clearly favours very narrow conditions for attribution, e.g. the establishment of ‘effective control’ that also extends to specific operations carried out by private persons or entities.⁵ By contrast, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia adopted a more lenient standard of attribution, the ‘overall control’ test.⁶ There is a growing tendency in international law to follow the more flexible ‘overall control’, which emerged in the context of the attribution of armed attacks to States ‘harbour- ⁴ Art. 8 ILC Articles on State Responsibility: “The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of that State in carrying out the conduct”.\n⁵ International Court of Justice (ICJ), Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Otherwise the requisite evidence would amount to a kind of probatio diabolica.\nOf course, traceability is a most complex and contentious issue where concerns of privacy and free communication in an open society clash with interests of national and international security. Traceability vests democratic governments and authoritarian regimes alike with instruments of supervision, albeit for quite different purposes. In any case, traceability can realistically be conceptualised in an asymmetric way. The European debate on the processing of electronic communication and privacy8 amply demonstrates the controversial nature of the issue.\nIn the context of traceability, we must also consider preexisting imbalances in the non-negotiated access of certain governments to transatlantic glass fibre-cables and other communication facilities. The State in which a service provider is incorporated or has its seat of management has usually more leverage as to the disclosure of data by the provider. If a State siphons off electronic communication networks located on its own territory or glass fibre cables running through its territorial sea, it acts within its GERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 own territorial jurisdiction. Similarly, a State may be tapping into cables running through its exclusive economic zone.⁹ ## III. Due Diligence and Cyber Security ## A. Prevention of Transboundary Harm – Conceptual Basis In contemporary international law, a general principle has emerged which requires States to exercise due diligence to avoid transboundary harm to life and tangible assets of persons domiciled abroad and of foreign States. This principle can be inferred, by way of extrapolation, from a broad range of due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty and the possible control of private actors.\nThere are four interconnected conceptual bases for due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty Due diligence with respect to cyber security stands in close connection with all four rationales.\n## 1. Respect for the Environment of Other States and for International Common Goods By now, due respect for the environment of other States and global public goods may be considered as part of customary international law. Several United Nations ⁹ See Arts. 58 (1), 79 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 10 December 1982, UNTS 1833, 3 (UNCLOS).\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK (UN) conferences have endorsed such an obligation. Thus, Principle 2 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development¹⁰ declares: States have [...] the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.\nPrinciple 21 Stockholm Declaration¹¹ follows the same line: States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.\nA great number of environmental treaties embody this principle and call for appropriate measures to prevent damage to the environment.¹² In its Nuclear Weapons advisory opinion, the ICJ stated:¹³ The Court recognizes that the environment is under daily threat and that the use of nuclear weapons could constitute a catastrophe for the environment. The Court also recognizes that the environment is not an abstraction but represents the living space, the quality of life and the very health of human beings, including generations unborn.

(1996).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 existence of the general obligation of States to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction and control respect the environment of other States and of areas beyond national control is now part of the corpus of international law relating to the environment.^[14] More recently, the ICJ recognised a customary obligation of States to prevent transboundary damages to the environment. In the Pulp Mills case,^[15] the Court held: The Court considers that the obligation laid down in Article 36 [of the Statute on the Rio Uruguay agreed between Argentina and Uruguay] is addressed to both Parties and prescribes the specific conduct of co-ordinating the necessary measures through the Commission to avoid changes to the ecological balance. An obligation to adopt regulatory or administrative measures either individually or jointly and to enforce them is an obligation of conduct. Both Parties are therefore called upon, under Article 36, to exercise due diligence in acting through the Commission for the necessary measures to preserve the ecological balance of the river.\nThis vigilance and prevention is all the more important in the preservation of the ecological balance, since the negative impact of human activities on the waters of the river may affect other components of the ecosystem of the watercourse such as its flora, fauna, and soil. The obligation to co-ordinate, through the Commission, the adoption of the necessary measures, as well as their enforcement and observance, assumes, in this context, a central role in the overall system of protection of the River Uruguay established by the 1975 Statute [...]\nThe Court concluded: It is the opinion of the Court that in order for the Parties properly to comply with their obligations under Article 41 (a) and (b) of the 1975 Statute, they must, for the purposes of protecting and preserving the aquatic environment with respect to activities which may be liable to cause transboundary harm, carry out an environmental impact assessment. [...] In this sense, the obligation to protect and preserve, under Article 41 (a) of the Statute, has to be interpreted in accordance with a practice, which in recent years has gained so much acceptance among States that it may now be considered a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource. Moreover, due diligence, and the duty of vigilance and prevention which it implies, would not be considered to have been exercised, if a party planning works liable to affect the regime of the river or the quality of its waters did not undertake an environmental impact assessment on the potential effects of such works.\n^[14] ICJ, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* (note 13), 226, para. 29.\n^[15] Id., *Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, ICJ Reports 2010, 14, paras. 187 et seq., 204.\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK The required standard for prevention is due diligence. In the context of environmental risks associated with deep seabed mining and exploration, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) adopted this standard in its advisory opinion on the Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area.¹⁶ The Tribunal applied the due diligence standard to the supervision of mining companies by their home State or another sponsoring State and related it to “reasonably appropriate measures” in terms of Article 153 (4) UNCLOS and Annex III Article 4 (4) UNCLOS.¹⁷ Cyberspace and the protection of cyber security stand in close analogy with the environment and environmental protection, at least to the extent that they constitute international public goods and global commons.\n¹⁶ International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, Advisory Opinion of 1 February 2011, para. 117, available at: https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no_17/17_adv_op_010211_en.pdf (accessed on 12 November 2015).\n¹⁷ Ibid., paras. 118 et seq.: “118. Article 153, paragraph 4, last sentence, of the Convention states that the obligation of the sponsoring State in accordance with article 139 of the Convention entails ‘taking all measures necessary to ensure’ compliance by the sponsored contractor. Annex III, article 4, paragraph 4, of the Convention makes it clear that sponsoring States’ ‘responsibility to ensure’ applies ‘within their legal systems’. With these indications [emphasis added] the Convention provides some elements concerning the content of the ‘due diligence’ obligation to ensure. Necessary measures are required and these must be adopted within the legal system of the sponsoring State.\n\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 ## 2. Prevention of Acts Aimed at Transboundary Harm Under customary international law, States have an obligation to prevent acts carried out within their territory which are designed to cause transboundary harm. The *locus classicus* is to be found in the judgment of the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case (Merits). The Court recognised that States have obligations as to the notification of the existence of a mine field in their territorial waters and to the warning of approaching warships. It based these obligations on elementary considerations of humanity, even more exacting in peace than in war; [...] and every State's obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.^[18]^ The *Corfu Channel* judgment made the obligation to prevent acts encroaching on the rights of other States dependent on knowledge of such use of its territory. The dissenting opinions of Judge *Winiarski*^[19]^ and *Krylov*^[20]^ focused on the standard of due diligence (\"ought to have seen or heard\"). In the context of the obligation to prevent cross-border armed traffic, the ICJ adopted the due diligence standard in the *Nicaragua Case*.^[21]^ The Draft Articles of the International Law Commission (ILC) on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities^[22]^ require the State of origin to\"take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimise the risk thereof\"(Article 3 Draft Articles). As a matter of consequential logic this standard, formulated in the context of high-risk activities not prohibited by international law (Article 1 Draft Articles) must apply to acts which purport to cause significant transboundary harm.\n^[18]^ ICJ, *The Corfu Channel Case* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v. Albania), Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 22.\n^[19]^ *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), Dissenting Opinion of Judge *Winiarski*, ICJ Reports 1949, 4, 51.\n^[20]^ *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), Dissenting Opinion of Judge *Krylov*, ICJ Reports 1949, 4, 71 et seq.\n^[21]^ *Id.*, *Nicaragua Case* (note 5), 14, para. 157.\n^[22]^ ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 148 et seq.\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK 179 NATO’s Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare²³ states in Rule 5 Tallinn Manual: “A State shall not knowingly allow the cyber instructions located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that aversely and unlawfully affect other States.”\nRule 5 is an echo of the *Corfu Channel* judgment. Under current international law, the narrow criterion of positive knowledge of harmful activities as condition for duties of prevention seems to be justified only in the context of activities which 1. affect other States within the territory, the territorial waters, or the exclusive economic zone of the State concerned or which 2. cause no significant physical harm. In cases of transboundary physical harm, the standard of due diligence applies.\n## 3. Freedom of Communication In the *Corfu Channel* case, the ICJ based the duty of a State to avert damage from activities carried out within its territory (obligations of notification and warning) also on “the principle of the freedom of maritime communication”.²⁴ ## 4. Responsibility for Shared Resources Finally, obligations of States to avert or minimise the harmful effects from activities carried out within their territory can arise from the common responsibility for shared resources. In this context, cyberspace can be compared to shared resources such as water resources shared by two or more States. Article 7 (1) Draft Articles of the ILC on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses,²⁵ reads: “Watercourse States shall exercise due diligence to utilize an international water course in such a way as not to cause significant harm to other watercourse States.”\n--- ²³ *Michael N. Schmitt* (ed.), (note 7).\n²⁴ ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), 22.\n²⁵ ILC, *The law of the non-navigational uses of international watercourses*, Yearbook of the International Law Commission (YILC) 1994, Vol. II (Part Two), para. 222, 102.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 The Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses (in force since 17 August 2014) no longer refers to due diligence but obliges watercourse States “to take all appropriate measures to prevent the causing of significant harm to other watercourse States.”\nIn the Pulp Mills case, the ICJ underlined the obligation of vigilance and prevention with respect to private activities which adversely affect a shared resource.²⁶ Cyberspace constitutes a physical and non-physical resource shared by the internet community (Article 1 Statute of the Internet Corporation for assigned Numbers and Names (ICANN)). The dispute settlement panel in ICM Registry v. ICANN classified ICANN’s functions as the administration of “an intrinsically international resource of immense importance to global communications and economies”.²⁷ It therefore seems appropriate to apply the due diligence standard broadly recognised in the context of other sources shared by several States to cyberspace.\n## B. Significance of Due Diligence Up to now, no precise criteria have been identified to define due diligence with respect to the prevention of cyber attacks and the maintenance of cyber security. Still, some elements can be distilled from international rulings in other contexts.\n## 1. Obligation to Take Appropriate Measures The starting point for obligations to prevent and avert damage to other States and interference with their rights is the obligation to take appropriate measures. This standard is adopted in a number of international treaties on the protection of the environment,²⁸ the Draft Articles of the ILC on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities²⁹ (Article 3 Draft Articles), the ITLOS advisory opinion ²⁶ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 204.\n²⁷ International Centre for Dispute Resolution, ICM Registry v. ICANN, Declaration of the Independent Review Panel, 19 February 2010, ICDR Case No. 50 117 T 00224 08, reprinted in: International Legal Materials 956, Vol. 49 (2010), para. 140.\n²⁸ See supra, note 12.\n²⁹ See supra, note 22.\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK on the Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area³⁰ and the judgment of the ICJ in the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case.³¹ ## 2. Commensurability with the Risk to be Averted With respect to obligations to prevent shipments of military equipment under the rules of neutrality, the award in the Alabama Arbitration (1872) held that the required measures must be commensurate with the risk to be averted.³² The same criterion appears in the Pulp Mills judgment of the ICJ.³³ In its advisory opinion on the Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, the ITLOS relates due diligence to the degree of risks associated with a particular activity: The content of ‘due diligence’ obligations may not easily be described in precise terms. Among the factors that make such a description difficult is the fact that ‘due diligence’ is a variable concept. It may change over time as measures considered sufficiently diligent at a certain moment may become not diligent enough in light, for instance, of new scientific or ³⁰ See supra, note 16.\n³¹ ICJ, United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States v. Iran), Judgment of 24 May 1980, ICJ Reports 1980, 3, para. 63.\n³² Geneva Arbitration Tribunal, Alabama claims of the United States of America against Great Britain, Arbitral Award of 14 September 1872, Reports of International Arbitral Awards XXIX, 125 et seq.\n³³ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 205: “The Court observes that neither the 1975 Statute nor general international law specify the scope and content of an environmental impact assessment. It points out moreover that Argentina and Uruguay are not parties to the Espoo Convention. Finally, the Court notes that the other instrument to which Argentina refers in support of its arguments, namely, the UNEP Goals and Principles, is not binding on the Parties, but, as guidelines issued by an international technical body, has to be taken into account by each Party in accordance with Article 41 (a) in adopting measures within its domestic regulatory framework. Moreover, this instrument provides only that the ‘environmental effects in an EIA should be assessed with a degree of detail commensurate with their likely environmental significance’ (Principle 5) without giving any indication of minimum core components of the assessment. Consequently, it is the view of the Court that it is for each State to determine in its domestic legislation or in the authorization process for the project, the specific content of the environmental impact assessment required in each case, having regard to the nature and magnitude of the proposed development and its likely adverse impact on the environment as well as to the need to exercise due diligence in conducting such an assessment. The Court also considers that an environmental impact assessment must be conducted prior to the implementation of a project. Moreover, once operations have started and, where necessary, throughout the life of the project, continuous monitoring of its effects on the environment shall be undertaken”.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 technological knowledge. It may also change in relation to the risks involved in the activity. As regards activities in the Area, it seems reasonable to state that prospecting is, generally speaking, less risky than exploration activities which, in turn, entail less risk than exploitation. Moreover, activities in the Area concerning different kinds of minerals, for example, polymetallic nodules on the one hand and polymetallic sulphides or cobalt rich ferromanganese crusts on the other, may require different standards of diligence. The standard of due diligence has to be more severe for the riskier activities.³⁴ ## 3. Vigilance and Prevention Due diligence includes vigilance and prevention as held by the ICJ with respect to the maintenance of ecological balance in the *Pulp Mills* case.\nThis vigilance and prevention is all the more important in the preservation of the ecological balance, since the negative impact of human activities on the waters of the river may affect other components of the ecosystem of the watercourse such as its flora, fauna, and soil. The obligation to co-ordinate, through the Commission, the adoption of the necessary measures, as well as their enforcement and observance, assumes, in this context, a central role in the overall system of protection of the River Uruguay established by the 1975 Statute. It is therefore of crucial importance that the Parties respect this obligation.³⁵ In this case, the Court concluded that under customary environmental law, due diligence calls for an environmental impact assessment, when industrial activities risk having a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource.³⁶ ## 4. Exchange of Information and Warning Due diligence with respect to the safeguarding of the rights of other States includes an exchange of information and warning, as the ICJ already stated in the *Corfu Channel* case.³⁷ ³⁴ ITLOS, *Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area* (note 16), para. 117.\n³⁵ ICJ, *Pulp Mills* (note 15), para. 188.\n³⁶ *Ibid.*, para. 204.\n³⁷ *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), 22.\nPOSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK 183 ## IV. Regulatory Approaches ### A. Layers of Responsibility #### 1. Private Actors Including Service Providers The responsibility of private actors which undertake cyber attacks has several dimensions which range from civil liability to criminal responsibility, e.g. under the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.³⁸ However, ‘Corporate cyber-responsibility’ of service providers will not be easy to establish, as requirements of reliable identification of e-mail account holders and of senders encounter political resistance and raise difficult legal issues.³⁹ #### 2. Responsibility of States of Origin of Cyber Threats De lege ferenda, the responsibility of States of origin of cyber threats can be established by treaty-based, institutional arrangements, e.g. for the exchange of risk relevant information. In addition, the establishment of an institutionalised supervision mechanism which monitors individual and corporate activities should be considered. A possible model is the National Contact Points for Corporate Social Responsibility system set out in the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development’s (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.⁴⁰ --- ³⁸ Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, CETS No. 185.\n³⁹ See Debra Wong Yang/Brian M.

Due Diligence of Corporate Targets Corporate targets of cyber attacks should also be deemed to have a duty of diligence to prevent and minimise damages. This is, however, primarily a matter of national policy and domestic regulation.\n## B. Form of Regulation While intergovernmental cooperation can be based on international agreements, an alternative might be ‘soft law’ instruments such as guiding principles or codes of conduct of international organisations such as the OECD.\n## C. Institutional Framework In the institutional design, an intergovernmental architecture may be constructed with a multi-stakeholder approach which integrates private bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force,⁴¹ non-governmental organisations, or hybrid organisations (ICANN) into fora for cooperation or for the development of technical standards.\nWhile the added value of a multi-stakeholder approach should not be over-estimated, it would enhance the pull to compliance with any international standards on due diligence and foster the effective protection of cyber-security.\n## V. Conclusion International law is still in a rather early stage in terms of responding to cyber-threats. States must apply due diligence in supervising threats to cyber-security which may affect other States and prevent substantial harm by transboundary activities, however the rules on State responsibility for attacs on cyber-security by private actors are rather rudimentary.

    "GERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n\n## I. Different Threats to Cyber Security\n\nIn the design of cyberspace and digital infrastructures unhampered access and free flow of data are key principles when determining function and utilisation. These functional criteria have so far trumped other objectives such as resilience to risks of abuse and security. This makes digital networks an easy and tempting target for attacks which aim at siphoning off data or at functional disruption by States, non-governmental entities, or individuals.\n\nThis contribution will not focus on the current debate on legitimate or illegitimate harvesting of data. Nor will it comment on the complex relationship between allied States which includes unilateral or mutual data fishing as well as sharing informations relevant to their national security interests.\n\nDiscussion in international law on cyberspace¹ has, until recently, focused on cyber attacks in context with armed conflicts. Only in recent years, has the debate in public international law extended to threats beyond a military context. It seems appropriate to distinguish between different kinds of threats to security and stability of cyber systems:\n\n1. Attacks directly against the integrity of cyber systems in terms of intentionally inflicted damage to computer systems or networks or digital information and\n2. Intrusions intended to abuse and exploit digital networks and other systems without affecting the integrity of the infrastructures as such, e.g. for purposes of cyber espionage (cyber trespassing, cyber exploitation).\n\nIn both cases, we must further distinguish between wrongful acts attributable to States and responsibility flowing from due diligence standards of monitoring and international cooperation.\n\n---\n\n¹ Catherine B.

    "POSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK 171\n\n## II. Responsibility for Wrongful Acts Attributable to States\n\n### A. Primary Norms Related to Cyber Security\n\nState responsibility, in principle, rests on the violation of a ‘primary’ norm of international law (Article 1 ILC Articles on State Responsibility²). There are a number of such primary norms related to cyber security in specific sectors of international law, especially with respect to treaties and security council resolutions against terrorism, the law of the sea, the law of air transport, and telecommunications law.\n\nFor present purposes, it seems more important to focus on the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs of other States and, possibly, human rights which prohibit States from threatening or damaging the life and property of persons abroad as well as civil and military assets of other States including clinical infrastructures. As far as these protected rights and goods are affected, customary international law taints attacks against the integrity of computer networks with illegality.\n\nThe legal situation is quite different with respect to other cross-border intrusions and abuses of digital infrastructures, especially for the purpose of military or industrial espionage. In this context, acts directed against cyber security, as a rule, do not appear on the regulatory screen of international law. The international perspective merely qualifies espionage as acts fraught with high risks for the perpetrators and defers to sanctions under national law.³ In both times of peace and war, espionage is not a regulatory theme of customary international law (which simply leaves the target State free to prosecute the spy or to declare him *persona non grata* if he is vested with diplomatic immunity). Therefore, protection of confidentiality and privacy of data flows can only be established on the basis of international treaties.\n\n---\n\n² International Law Commission (ILC) Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 43 et seq.

Actions of State Organs\n\nAs a rule, State responsibility for the violation of international law will be triggered by the acts of State organs (Article 2 ILC Articles on State Responsibility).\n\n### 2. Actions by Private Persons and Non-Governmental Entities: Control by the State\n\nActs of private persons and non-State entities establish State responsibility only where there is a certain degree of authority and control over the private activities, e.g. hackers instigated and sponsored by their home government. The ILC Articles on State Responsibility simply refer to actions “on the instructions of, or under the direction and control” of the State concerned.⁴ This necessary degree of “direction and control” is, however, a matter of controversy.\n\nAt least in the context of armed activities, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) clearly favours very narrow conditions for attribution, e.g. the establishment of ‘effective control’ that also extends to specific operations carried out by private persons or entities.⁵\n\nBy contrast, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia adopted a more lenient standard of attribution, the ‘overall control’ test.⁶ There is a growing tendency in international law to follow the more flexible ‘overall control’, which emerged in the context of the attribution of armed attacks to States ‘harbour-\n\n⁴ Art. 8 ILC Articles on State Responsibility: “The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of that State in carrying out the conduct”.\n\n⁵ International Court of Justice (ICJ), Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Otherwise the requisite evidence would amount to a kind of probatio diabolica.\n\nOf course, traceability is a most complex and contentious issue where concerns of privacy and free communication in an open society clash with interests of national and international security. Traceability vests democratic governments and authoritarian regimes alike with instruments of supervision, albeit for quite different purposes. In any case, traceability can realistically be conceptualised in an asymmetric way. The European debate on the processing of electronic communication and privacy8 amply demonstrates the controversial nature of the issue.\n\nIn the context of traceability, we must also consider preexisting imbalances in the non-negotiated access of certain governments to transatlantic glass fibre-cables and other communication facilities. The State in which a service provider is incorporated or has its seat of management has usually more leverage as to the disclosure of data by the provider. If a State siphons off electronic communication networks located on its own territory or glass fibre cables running through its territorial sea, it acts within its\n\n7 Johann-Christoph Woltag, Cyber Warfare, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), MPEPIL, Vol. II (2012), 988, para. 22; Alexander Kees, Responsibility of States for Private Actors, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), MPEPIL, Vol. VIII (2012), 959, para. 18; Stefan Talmon, The Various Control Tests in the Law of State Responsibility and the Responsibility of Outside powers for Acts of Secessionist Entities, International and Comparative Law Quarterly 58 (2009), 493; Shackelford/Andres (note 1), 988; Laurie R.

Due Diligence and Cyber Security\n\n## A. Prevention of Transboundary Harm – Conceptual Basis\n\nIn contemporary international law, a general principle has emerged which requires States to exercise due diligence to avoid transboundary harm to life and tangible assets of persons domiciled abroad and of foreign States. This principle can be inferred, by way of extrapolation, from a broad range of due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty and the possible control of private actors.\n\nThere are four interconnected conceptual bases for due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty\n\n1. Respect for international and domestic common goods, such as the environment in inter-State relations,\n2. Prevention of private actions directed against assets of foreign States or life and property of persons located in foreign territory,\n3. Freedom of communications, and\n4. Responsibility for resources shared with other States.\n\nDue diligence with respect to cyber security stands in close connection with all four rationales.\n\n## 1. Respect for the Environment of Other States and for International Common Goods\n\nBy now, due respect for the environment of other States and global public goods may be considered as part of customary international law.

In the Pulp Mills case,^[15] the Court held:\n\nThe Court considers that the obligation laid down in Article 36 [of the Statute on the Rio Uruguay agreed between Argentina and Uruguay] is addressed to both Parties and prescribes the specific conduct of co-ordinating the necessary measures through the Commission to avoid changes to the ecological balance. An obligation to adopt regulatory or administrative measures either individually or jointly and to enforce them is an obligation of conduct. Both Parties are therefore called upon, under Article 36, to exercise due diligence in acting through the Commission for the necessary measures to preserve the ecological balance of the river.\n\nThis vigilance and prevention is all the more important in the preservation of the ecological balance, since the negative impact of human activities on the waters of the river may affect other components of the ecosystem of the watercourse such as its flora, fauna, and soil. The obligation to co-ordinate, through the Commission, the adoption of the necessary measures, as well as their enforcement and observance, assumes, in this context, a central role in the overall system of protection of the River Uruguay established by the 1975 Statute [...]\n\nThe Court concluded:\n\nIt is the opinion of the Court that in order for the Parties properly to comply with their obligations under Article 41 (a) and (b) of the 1975 Statute, they must, for the purposes of protecting and preserving the aquatic environment with respect to activities which may be liable to cause transboundary harm, carry out an environmental impact assessment. [...] In this sense, the obligation to protect and preserve, under Article 41 (a) of the Statute, has to be interpreted in accordance with a practice, which in recent years has gained so much acceptance among States that it may now be considered a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource. Moreover, due diligence, and the duty of vigilance and prevention which it implies, would not be considered to have been exercised, if a party planning works liable to affect the regime of the river or the quality of its waters did not undertake an environmental impact assessment on the potential effects of such works.\n\n^[14] ICJ, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* (note 13), 226, para. 29.\n\n^[15] Id., *Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina v.

    "POSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n\nThe required standard for prevention is due diligence. In the context of environmental risks associated with deep seabed mining and exploration, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) adopted this standard in its advisory opinion on the Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area.¹⁶ The Tribunal applied the due diligence standard to the supervision of mining companies by their home State or another sponsoring State and related it to “reasonably appropriate measures” in terms of Article 153 (4) UNCLOS and Annex III Article 4 (4) UNCLOS.¹⁷\n\nCyberspace and the protection of cyber security stand in close analogy with the environment and environmental protection, at least to the extent that they constitute international public goods and global commons.\n\n¹⁶ International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, Advisory Opinion of 1 February 2011, para. 117, available at: https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no_17/17_adv_op_010211_en.pdf (accessed on 12 November 2015).\n\n¹⁷ Ibid., paras. 118 et seq.: “118. Article 153, paragraph 4, last sentence, of the Convention states that the obligation of the sponsoring State in accordance with article 139 of the Convention entails ‘taking all measures necessary to ensure’ compliance by the sponsored contractor. Annex III, article 4, paragraph 4, of the Convention makes it clear that sponsoring States’ ‘responsibility to ensure’ applies ‘within their legal systems’. With these indications [emphasis added] the Convention provides some elements concerning the content of the ‘due diligence’ obligation to ensure. Necessary measures are required and these must be adopted within the legal system of the sponsoring State.\n\n119. Further light on the expression ‘measures necessary to ensure’ is shed by the Convention if one considers article 139, paragraph 2, last sentence, and Annex III, article 4, paragraph 4, last sentence, of the Convention. The main purpose of these provisions is to exempt sponsoring States that have taken certain measures from liability for damage. The description of the measures to be taken by that State may also be used to clarify its ‘due diligence’ obligation. This description remains in general terms in article 139, paragraph 2, of the Convention which mentions ‘all necessary and appropriate measures to secure effective compliance under article 153, paragraph 4, and Annex III, article 4, paragraph 4’. The latter provision is more specific as it requires the sponsoring State to adopt ‘laws and regulations’ and to take ‘administrative measures which are, within the framework of its legal system, reasonably appropriate for securing compliance by persons under its jurisdiction’.\n\n120. More specific indications concerning the content of these measures, including aspects relating to their enforcement, with respect to the contents of these measures will be provided in the reply to Question 3. As regards Question 1, it has been established that the ‘due diligence’ obligation ‘to ensure’ requires the sponsoring State to take measures within its legal system and that the measures must be ‘reasonably appropriate’.",
    "GERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n\n## 2. Prevention of Acts Aimed at Transboundary Harm\n\nUnder customary international law, States have an obligation to prevent acts carried out within their territory which are designed to cause transboundary harm. The *locus classicus* is to be found in the judgment of the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case (Merits). The Court recognised that States have obligations as to the notification of the existence of a mine field in their territorial waters and to the warning of approaching warships. It based these obligations on\n\nelementary considerations of humanity, even more exacting in peace than in war; [...] and every State's obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.^[18]^\n\nThe *Corfu Channel* judgment made the obligation to prevent acts encroaching on the rights of other States dependent on knowledge of such use of its territory. The dissenting opinions of Judge *Winiarski*^[19]^ and *Krylov*^[20]^ focused on the standard of due diligence (\"ought to have seen or heard\"). In the context of the obligation to prevent cross-border armed traffic, the ICJ adopted the due diligence standard in the *Nicaragua Case*.^[21]^\n\nThe Draft Articles of the International Law Commission (ILC) on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities^[22]^ require the State of origin to \"take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimise the risk thereof\" (Article 3 Draft Articles). As a matter of consequential logic this standard, formulated in the context of high-risk activities not prohibited by international law (Article 1 Draft Articles) must apply to acts which purport to cause significant transboundary harm.\n\n^[18]^ ICJ, *The Corfu Channel Case* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v. Albania), Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 22.\n\n^[19]^ *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), Dissenting Opinion of Judge *Winiarski*, ICJ Reports 1949, 4, 51.\n\n^[20]^ *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), Dissenting Opinion of Judge *Krylov*, ICJ Reports 1949, 4, 71 et seq.\n\n^[21]^ *Id.*, *Nicaragua Case* (note 5), 14, para. 157.\n\n^[22]^ ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 148 et seq.",
    "POSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK 179\n\nNATO’s Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare²³ states in Rule 5 Tallinn Manual: “A State shall not knowingly allow the cyber instructions located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that aversely and unlawfully affect other States.”\n\nRule 5 is an echo of the *Corfu Channel* judgment. Under current international law, the narrow criterion of positive knowledge of harmful activities as condition for duties of prevention seems to be justified only in the context of activities which 1. affect other States within the territory, the territorial waters, or the exclusive economic zone of the State concerned or which 2. cause no significant physical harm. In cases of transboundary physical harm, the standard of due diligence applies.\n\n## 3. Freedom of Communication\n\nIn the *Corfu Channel* case, the ICJ based the duty of a State to avert damage from activities carried out within its territory (obligations of notification and warning) also on “the principle of the freedom of maritime communication”.²⁴\n\n## 4. Responsibility for Shared Resources\n\nFinally, obligations of States to avert or minimise the harmful effects from activities carried out within their territory can arise from the common responsibility for shared resources. In this context, cyberspace can be compared to shared resources such as water resources shared by two or more States. Article 7 (1) Draft Articles of the ILC on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses,²⁵ reads: “Watercourse States shall exercise due diligence to utilize an international water course in such a way as not to cause significant harm to other watercourse States.”\n\n---\n\n²³ *Michael N. Schmitt* (ed.), (note 7).\n\n²⁴ ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), 22.\n\n²⁵ ILC, *The law of the non-navigational uses of international watercourses*, Yearbook of the International Law Commission (YILC) 1994, Vol. II (Part Two), para. 222, 102.",
    "GERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n\nThe Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses (in force since 17 August 2014) no longer refers to due diligence but obliges watercourse States “to take all appropriate measures to prevent the causing of significant harm to other watercourse States.”\n\nIn the Pulp Mills case, the ICJ underlined the obligation of vigilance and prevention with respect to private activities which adversely affect a shared resource.²⁶ Cyberspace constitutes a physical and non-physical resource shared by the internet community (Article 1 Statute of the Internet Corporation for assigned Numbers and Names (ICANN)). The dispute settlement panel in ICM Registry v. ICANN classified ICANN’s functions as the administration of “an intrinsically international resource of immense importance to global communications and economies”.²⁷ It therefore seems appropriate to apply the due diligence standard broadly recognised in the context of other sources shared by several States to cyberspace.\n\n## B. Significance of Due Diligence\n\nUp to now, no precise criteria have been identified to define due diligence with respect to the prevention of cyber attacks and the maintenance of cyber security. Still, some elements can be distilled from international rulings in other contexts.\n\n## 1. Obligation to Take Appropriate Measures\n\nThe starting point for obligations to prevent and avert damage to other States and interference with their rights is the obligation to take appropriate measures. This standard is adopted in a number of international treaties on the protection of the environment,²⁸ the Draft Articles of the ILC on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities²⁹ (Article 3 Draft Articles), the ITLOS advisory opinion\n\n²⁶ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 204.\n\n²⁷ International Centre for Dispute Resolution, ICM Registry v.

Commensurability with the Risk to be Averted\n\nWith respect to obligations to prevent shipments of military equipment under the rules of neutrality, the award in the Alabama Arbitration (1872) held that the required measures must be commensurate with the risk to be averted.³² The same criterion appears in the Pulp Mills judgment of the ICJ.³³ In its advisory opinion on the Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, the ITLOS relates due diligence to the degree of risks associated with a particular activity:\n\nThe content of ‘due diligence’ obligations may not easily be described in precise terms. Among the factors that make such a description difficult is the fact that ‘due diligence’ is a variable concept. It may change over time as measures considered sufficiently diligent at a certain moment may become not diligent enough in light, for instance, of new scientific or\n\n³⁰ See supra, note 16.\n\n³¹ ICJ, United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States v. Iran), Judgment of 24 May 1980, ICJ Reports 1980, 3, para. 63.\n\n³² Geneva Arbitration Tribunal, Alabama claims of the United States of America against Great Britain, Arbitral Award of 14 September 1872, Reports of International Arbitral Awards XXIX, 125 et seq.\n\n³³ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 205: “The Court observes that neither the 1975 Statute nor general international law specify the scope and content of an environmental impact assessment. It points out moreover that Argentina and Uruguay are not parties to the Espoo Convention. Finally, the Court notes that the other instrument to which Argentina refers in support of its arguments, namely, the UNEP Goals and Principles, is not binding on the Parties, but, as guidelines issued by an international technical body, has to be taken into account by each Party in accordance with Article 41 (a) in adopting measures within its domestic regulatory framework. Moreover, this instrument provides only that the ‘environmental effects in an EIA should be assessed with a degree of detail commensurate with their likely environmental significance’ (Principle 5) without giving any indication of minimum core components of the assessment. Consequently, it is the view of the Court that it is for each State to determine in its domestic legislation or in the authorization process for the project, the specific content of the environmental impact assessment required in each case, having regard to the nature and magnitude of the proposed development and its likely adverse impact on the environment as well as to the need to exercise due diligence in conducting such an assessment. The Court also considers that an environmental impact assessment must be conducted prior to the implementation of a project. Moreover, once operations have started and, where necessary, throughout the life of the project, continuous monitoring of its effects on the environment shall be undertaken”.",

As regards activities in the Area, it seems reasonable to state that prospecting is, generally speaking, less risky than exploration activities which, in turn, entail less risk than exploitation. Moreover, activities in the Area concerning different kinds of minerals, for example, polymetallic nodules on the one hand and polymetallic sulphides or cobalt rich ferromanganese crusts on the other, may require different standards of diligence. The standard of due diligence has to be more severe for the riskier activities.³⁴\n\n## 3. Vigilance and Prevention\n\nDue diligence includes vigilance and prevention as held by the ICJ with respect to the maintenance of ecological balance in the *Pulp Mills* case.\n\nThis vigilance and prevention is all the more important in the preservation of the ecological balance, since the negative impact of human activities on the waters of the river may affect other components of the ecosystem of the watercourse such as its flora, fauna, and soil. The obligation to co-ordinate, through the Commission, the adoption of the necessary measures, as well as their enforcement and observance, assumes, in this context, a central role in the overall system of protection of the River Uruguay established by the 1975 Statute. It is therefore of crucial importance that the Parties respect this obligation.³⁵\n\nIn this case, the Court concluded that under customary environmental law, due diligence calls for an environmental impact assessment, when industrial activities risk having a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource.³⁶\n\n## 4. Exchange of Information and Warning\n\nDue diligence with respect to the safeguarding of the rights of other States includes an exchange of information and warning, as the ICJ already stated in the *Corfu Channel* case.³⁷\n\n³⁴ ITLOS, *Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area* (note 16), para. 117.\n\n³⁵ ICJ, *Pulp Mills* (note 15), para. 188.\n\n³⁶ *Ibid.*, para. 204.\n\n³⁷ *Id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 18), 22.",
    "POSSIBLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK 183\n\n## IV. Regulatory Approaches\n\n### A. Layers of Responsibility\n\n#### 1. Private Actors Including Service Providers\n\nThe responsibility of private actors which undertake cyber attacks has several dimensions which range from civil liability to criminal responsibility, e.g. under the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.³⁸ However, ‘Corporate cyber-responsibility’ of service providers will not be easy to establish, as requirements of reliable identification of e-mail account holders and of senders encounter political resistance and raise difficult legal issues.³⁹\n\n#### 2. Responsibility of States of Origin of Cyber Threats\n\nDe lege ferenda, the responsibility of States of origin of cyber threats can be established by treaty-based, institutional arrangements, e.g. for the exchange of risk relevant information. In addition, the establishment of an institutionalised supervision mechanism which monitors individual and corporate activities should be considered. A possible model is the National Contact Points for Corporate Social Responsibility system set out in the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development’s (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.⁴⁰\n\n---\n\n³⁸ Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, CETS No. 185.\n\n³⁹ See Debra Wong Yang/Brian M. Hoffstadt, Countering the Cyber-Crime Threat, American Criminal Law Review 43 (2006), 201; Oona A. Hathaway, The Law of Cyber-Attack, California Law Review 100 (2012), 817, 879 et seq.\n\n⁴⁰ See Herdegen (note 13), 111 et seq.",
    "GERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n\n## 3. Due Diligence of Corporate Targets\n\nCorporate targets of cyber attacks should also be deemed to have a duty of diligence to prevent and minimise damages. This is, however, primarily a matter of national policy and domestic regulation.\n\n## B. Form of Regulation\n\nWhile intergovernmental cooperation can be based on international agreements, an alternative might be ‘soft law’ instruments such as guiding principles or codes of conduct of international organisations such as the OECD.\n\n## C. Institutional Framework\n\nIn the institutional design, an intergovernmental architecture may be constructed with a multi-stakeholder approach which integrates private bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force,⁴¹ non-governmental organisations, or hybrid organisations (ICANN) into fora for cooperation or for the development of technical standards.\n\nWhile the added value of a multi-stakeholder approach should not be over-estimated, it would enhance the pull to compliance with any international standards on due diligence and foster the effective protection of cyber-security.\n\n## V. Conclusion\n\nInternational law is still in a rather early stage in terms of responding to cyber-threats. States must apply due diligence in supervising threats to cyber-security which may affect other States and prevent substantial harm by transboundary activities, however the rules on State responsibility for attacs on cyber-security by private actors are rather rudimentary. It is submitted that ‘overall control’ rather than ‘effective\n\n⁴¹ For further information see https://www.ietf.org/ (accessed on 12 November 2015).",

    "abstract": "Cyber security is exposed to different kinds of threats ranging from direct attacks against the integrity of cyber systems to intrusions in digital networks and other systems. Whilst some of these threats are linked to wrongful acts directly attributable to States, many attacks and intrusions are authored by private persons. These threats from non-State actors catalyse the call for due diligence standards for States in terms of prevention, monitoring, and international cooperation. Responsibility of States for acts by private persons should rest on 'overall control' rather than 'effective control'. Due diligence standards with respect to cyber security can draw on several interconnected conceptual bases for due diligence obligations flowing from territorial sovereignty: respect for international common goods, obligations to prevent private acts aiming at transboundary harm (as recognised in the Corfu Channel case), freedom of communication, and the responsibility for shared sources. Due diligence includes the obligation to take appropriate measures which are commensurate with the risk to be averted. It also encompasses vigilance and prevention as well as an exchange of information and warnings. Regulatory approaches must identify responsible actors (private persons, States of origin of cyber threats, and corporate targets). International cooperation can be based on international agreements or instruments of 'soft law'. For the design of the institutional framework, strong reasons suggest a multi-stakeholder approach which integrates private bodies, non-governmental organisations, or hybrid organisations.",
