Even though determining the machines that launched a malicious cyber incident is no longer an arduous task for the most developed states, identifying the individuals, organizations, or governments that are legally responsible for the attack continues to be extremely difficult. This study argues that, as it stands now, international law not only fails in effectively dealing with the attribution problem, but also is unlikely to be instrumental in providing both predictability and stability to cyberspace in the short and medium-terms. As a result, the cyber domain will continue to be an environment that offers the perfect conditions for the security dilemma to thrive and in which incidents – whether intended or not – can trigger off conflicts causing widespread harm to the whole international security system.\n\nKeywords: cyber-attribution, attribution problem, cybersecurity, security dilemma, international security, Tallinn Manual, non-state initiatives.",

Education, health, government, as well as sectors such as energy, communication, and transportation are inextricably linked to, if not dependent on, the cyber domain². As information technology becomes more widespread and integrated into our daily lives, the probability of compromise by malicious cyber activity increases³. According to the former Director of National Intelligence (DNI) of the United States, more than thirty countries are developing offensive cyber capabilities, which will rise the incidence of both standoff and remote operations⁴. To complicate matters further, these capabilities are progressively under criminal and other non-state actors’ control⁵. Therefore, cyberattacks⁶ that deeply affect international peace and the global economy are no longer “futuristic or far-fetched”, but rather the reality of cyberspace⁷.\n\n¹ “Cyberspace” is defined by the United States National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations as “a domain characterized by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructure” (United States Department of Defence (DoD), *The National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations*, December 2006,3). Therefore, cyberspace also includes all networked digital operations.\n\n² Pipyros et al. 2018, 371.\n\n³ Davis II et al. 2017, 1\n\n⁴ United States Senate 2017, 5.\n\n⁵ Owens, Dam, and Lin 2009, 27.\n\n⁶ By cyberattack, I refer to the definition applied by Oona Hathaway et al. as “any action taken to undermine the functions of a computer network for a political or national security purpose” (Hathaway et al. 2012, 826). This definition, however, differs from that used by the U.S. Cyber Command, which identifies cyberattacks as those “that cause physical damage to property or injury to persons.” (Ibid., 821 n.9). Hathaway et al.’s definition also differs from the one offered by the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, which describe cyberattack as “a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects” (Schmitt 2013, 92). It is important to bear in mind that both the Tallinn Manual and the Cyber Command definitions are under-inclusive, particularly considering the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack, which did not cause physical damage to property or persons, but involved the *domaine reservé* of the U.S., raising relevant national security concerns about democratic procedures and the violation of the prohibition of intervention. Hathaway et al.’s terminology, on the other hand, covers a broader set of cyberattacks, including attacks such as the DNC hack.\n\nIn addition, I use the term ‘cyberattack’ instead of ‘cyber warfare’ because the latter refers to a smaller subset of cyberattacks that “constitute armed attacks or that occur in the context of an ongoing armed conflict” (Hathaway et al. 2012, 821). By contrast, the term ‘cyberattack’ embraces a broad range of attacks, from cyber warfare to those attacks that fall short of armed conflict but still deserve some kind of sanction (Tran 2018, 380 n.13). Furthermore, Hathaway and her co-authors make a distinction between cyberattacks and cyberespionage; according to the they, “neither cyber-espionage nor cyber-exploitation constitutes a cyber-attack because these concepts do not involve altering computer networks in a way that affects their current or future ability to function” (Hathaway et al. 2012, 829).\n\n⁷ Schmitt and Watts 2016, 596.",

Taking into consideration that the small Baltic country is one of the most wired societies in Europe⁹, the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks¹⁰ were particularly harmful, resulting in a temporary interruption of service on many government and commercial websites¹¹ and, thus, profoundly affecting the functioning of the country’s economy¹². Initially, the attacks were attributed to Russia due to the political atmosphere at the time, as well as past Russian actions. This explanation, however, was questioned by technical experts, and even NATO officials were disinclined to assign blame to the Russian government. Because of disagreements over the links between the attackers and Russia, what at first appeared to be a pretty obvious case of aggression became a gridlock. Although it is highly probable that the Russian state launched the cyberattack¹³, its involvement has never been proven. Yet, the attack continues to be an example of Russia’s cyber capabilities that following cyberattacks will be judged by¹⁴.\n\nIn hindsight, the Estonian attacks were “fairly mild and simple”, far less damaging than the cyberattacks that have followed¹⁵. Even so, they brought cyberspace to the forefront of international relations discussions, raising awareness among states about the severe risk posed by the growing dependence on ICTs, as well as the possibility of conflict in this new and unique environment. Indeed, during the last decade, the international community has witnessed and experienced a considerable number of problematic episodes in cyberspace – the cyber intrusion at Sony Pictures Entertainment¹⁶, the attack on France’s TV5Monde¹⁷, the Democratic National\n\n⁸ Traynor 2007.\n⁹ By 2007, 98% of Estonian territory was covered with Internet access, and mobile phone penetration was almost 100% (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010, 17).\n¹⁰ According to Clark and Landau, DDoS attack is a concerted malevolent effort in which a large number of machines from all over the Internet attack a site or a set of sites in order to disrupt service by overloading a server or a link (Clark and Landau 2011, 6).\n¹¹ Dinniss 2014, 38-39.\n¹² Supra note 8, at 25.\n¹³ Schulzke 2018, 960.\n¹⁴ Ibid. It is necessary to recognize that this situation poses a threat to international peace since, according to Gomez, the “adversary’s past behaviour may motivate a disproportionate response to pre-empt any further threats” (Gomez 2019, 1-2).\n¹⁵ Schmitt 2017, xxiii.\n¹⁶ On November 2014, Sony Pictures’ computers were broken into, and sensitive information from the film studio and unreleased movies were published online, disrupting the company business operations (Davis II et al. 2017, 42). Considering that Sony had produced the movie The Interview, which depicts the assassination of Kim Jong-Un, speculations about North Korean participation were raised (Egloff 2019, 10). Through a press statement, North Korea denied responsibility for the cyberattack, but praised the attackers for their actions. As of yet, no one was able to prove North Korean involvement and the evidence implicating it was considered “flimsy” (Zetter 2014b).\n¹⁷ In April 2015, the French-language television network had its computer infrastructure and social media accounts hacked. Initially, the group called Cyber Caliphate, an Islamic State affiliate, claimed responsibility for the\n\n7",

Almost each of them has illustrated the new international status that Lucas Kello calls “unpeace” – a “mid-spectrum rivalry lying below the physically destructive threshold of interstate violence, but whose harmful effects far surpass the tolerable level of peacetime competition”¹⁹.\n\nAgainst this background, at the 2016 Defence Ministerial Meeting, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) defence ministers officially recognized cyberspace as a new frontier of warfare²⁰, and that decision was endorsed at the 2016 Warsaw Summit²¹. Now, the Allies “recognize cyberspace as a domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea”²². Certainly, the change comes as a response to the increasing number of cyberattacks against both the organization and its member states. The threat posed by these attacks even prompted former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security to declare that cyberattacks “now exceed the risk of physical attacks” in terms of breadth and range of possible outcomes²³. And such attacks show no sign of decreasing, as the aforementioned examples demonstrate.\n\nAlthough the persistence of cyberattacks might be due, in part, to the relative availability and fairly low cost of the technology needed to mount an attack²⁴, it might also largely result from the difficulty in identifying its perpetrators and attributing blame²⁵. The structure of the Internet, which “was not designed with the goal of deterrence in mind”²⁶, provides the perfect setting for state and non-state actors to take part in malicious activity unafraid of attribution or retaliation²⁷. Worse still, aggressors are able to conceal themselves and the full effects of their operations by using technical mechanisms and/or relying on non-state proxies that they rent or compromise²⁸. For example, the cyberattacks that hit Estonia originated from at least 177\n\nattacks, but as the investigations began, it became clear that the jihadist group was just a cover-up (Corera 2016). The private company FireEye ultimately attributed the attack to Russian hackers.\n\n¹⁸ In 2015, in the middle of the presidential election, the DNC suffered a cyberattack, resulting in the exfiltration of files and emails, many of which were published by WikiLeaks. In 2016, the DNC publicly attributed the attack to two distinct Russian espionage groups, APT28 and APT29 (Egloff 2019, 13). Although it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to assess the full damage of the cyber intrusion, it is understood to have played a major role in the 58th U.S. presidential election (Davis II et al. 2017, 34).\n¹⁹ Allison 2018; Banks 2019, 191.\n²⁰ Barnes, 2016.\n²¹ Ablon et al. 2019, 1.\n²² NATO, Warsaw Summit Communiqué (July 2016), n.70.\n²³ Nielsen 2018.\n²⁴ Payne and Finlay 2017, 556; Boerbert 2010, 43.\n²⁵ Tran 2018, 381.\n²⁶ Supra note 10, at 1.\n²⁷ Supra note 24.\n²⁸ Carlin 2016, 409; Carr 2010, 139-40.",

Evidence has been found that attackers also obscure their identities through the adoption of foreign languages and elements of malware previously associated with other actors³⁰, and they might even exploit existing animosities in order to mask their identity and thus hinder attribution efforts³¹. By way of one example, the escalating tension between Iran and the United States suggests that both countries would be unwilling to fully cooperate in the case of a cyberattack, making Iran the perfect cover-up for third-party states and non-state actors attempting to launch a cyberattack against the USA and vice versa. It is therefore understood that attributing cyberattacks is vastly time-consuming and an “inherently interdisciplinary”³² process, requiring great technical and non-technical expertise and input from a range of actors and sources³³. In this regard, taking into account the effort necessary for its fulfilment, cyber-attribution was considered to be “an art as much as a science”³⁴.\n\nThe Estonian attacks are a prime example of how challenging the attribution of cyberattacks can be; thirteen years have passed and one cannot affirm whether the attacks were officially sanctioned by the Russian government or whether they were perpetrated by rogue spies or even by independent nationalistic criminals³⁵. It is important to bear in mind that, in the cyber domain, attribution differs from punishment³⁶, and it is defined as “identifying the agent responsible for the action”³⁷. Since cyberattacks have proliferated and become commonplace, attribution has grown in relevance³⁸. As a result, states have been investing resources and political capital to develop accountable attribution mechanisms in order to deter potential cyberattackers.\n\nIn spite of the fact that determining the machines that launched a cyberattack is no longer an arduous task for the most developed countries, identifying the individuals, organizations, or governments that are legally responsible for the attack continues to be challenging³⁹.

On this matter, Schmitt and Vihul believe that even if agreement were to be reached on a multilateral binding cyber treaty, it would probably be undermined by states’ individual reservations⁴¹. Similarly, according to Mačák, there seems to be a resistance to the codification of international rules applicable to cyberspace⁴².\n\nIn addition, as cyber operations usually happen in secrecy⁴³, customary international law is not able to develop understandings or recognize state practice about attributing responsibility for cyberattacks⁴⁴. Further complicating the issue, governments have been unwilling to clearly express *opinio juris* on topics associated with the cyber domain⁴⁵. This attitude might be the result of a domestic political deadlock, a calculated waiting strategy⁴⁶, or even the product of the “cybersecurity knowledge gap”⁴⁷. Nevertheless, this state reticence contributes to the enduring ambiguity of international cyber law⁴⁸. It is also important to point out that no international organization, agency, or entity has the legal authority to attribute responsibility for a cyberattack. Due to this institutional legal vacuum, seldom do governments make official attribution claims, and, in the rare occasion that they do, their statements are normally perceived\n\n⁴⁰ Supra note 25, at 384.\n\n⁴¹ Schmitt and Vihul 2016, 39. As codified in Article 2(d) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), reservation is “a unilateral statement, however phrased or named, made by a State, when signing, ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to a treaty, whereby it purports to exclude or to modify the legal effect of certain provisions of the treaty in their application to that State” (United Nations, *Vienna Convention on the law of treaties*, 23 May 1969, vol. 1155,1-18232, art. 2(d)).\n\nIt is perhaps useful to point out that some scholars have indicated that a successful agreement might be almost impossible to achieve, at least in the near future. For instance, Waxman believes that “not only do certain features of cyber-activities make international legal regulation very difficult, but major actors also have divergent strategic interests that will pull their preferred doctrinal interpretations and aspirations in different directions, impeding formations of a stable international consensus” (Waxman 2011, 425-26). On this point, Goldsmith argues that “the fundamental clash of interests concerning the regulation of electronic communications, the deep constrains the United States would have to adopt to receive reciprocal benefits in a cybersecurity treaty, and the debilitating verification problems will combine to make it unfeasible to create a cybersecurity treaty that purports to constrain governments”. (Goldsmith 2011, 12).\n\n⁴² Mačák 2017, 5.\n\n⁴³ Mačák 2016, 130. About the high classified nature of state practice in cyberspace, Clarke and Knake state that “the entire phenomenon of cyber war is shrouded in such government secrecy that it makes the Cold War look like a time of openness and transparency” (Clarke and Knake 2010, xi). Also, Efrony and Shany try to explain the absence of transparency in cyberspace; for them, states believe that transparency may reveal “their vulnerabilities, adversely affect their offensive or defensive capabilities, and weaken their power of deterrence” (Efrony and Shany 2018, 631).\n\n⁴⁴ Supra note 38, at 194.\n\n⁴⁵ Among the notable exceptions, the USA stands out with its International Strategy for Cyberspace (United States, The White House, *International Strategy for Cyberspace: Property, Security, and Openness in a Networked World*, May 2011).\n\n⁴⁶ Schmitt and Watts 2015, 211.\n\n⁴⁷ Singer and Friedman 2014, 4-8.\n\n⁴⁸ Supra note 43, at 130.\n\n10",

The attribution problem⁵⁰, therefore, is critical because attribution is a, if not the, key prerequisite to any lawful response under public international law, including self-defence⁵¹. This creates a dangerous practical gap that both precludes state responsibility⁵² and encourages attackers by allowing them to strike with impunity⁵³. Indeed, without an operative legal regime, the cyber domain “is not so far from the lawless lacuna some hoped it would become”⁵⁴.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, scholars, cyber-experts, and international stakeholders have been attempting to bridge the gap with their views on how international law applies to cyberspace. These non-state-driven initiatives are trying to promote a safe international system and reduce the chances of conflict arising from cyberattacks by filling the void created by states’ reluctance to undertake the international law-making process⁵⁵. The most important and comprehensive of these attempts certainly is the Tallinn Manual project, which is under the auspices of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE). This project, however, is neither an international treaty on cyber law nor does it offer a new set of international rules nor represent the position of any country or organization⁵⁶. Rather, it is a restatement of international law as it is (lex lata)⁵⁷, establishing a comprehensive legal structure for the governance of cyber operations during both times of peace and conflict. Considering the Tallinn project’s non-state and non-binding nature, one is then left to question its actual relevance to public international law, which still is very much attached to state-centric assumptions and foundations of the early formative stage of the international legal regime.\n\nOn this basis, my main argument lies heavily on the idea that the current international legal framework is underdeveloped vis-à-vis cyber-attribution, as its norms and principles were designed to the physical world and still, at present, mainly govern the relationship between states. Cyberspace, on the other end of the spectrum, is predominantly inhabited by non-state\n\n⁴⁹ Supra note 2, at 19. It is interesting to highlight that attributing cyberattacks to states is a new phenomenon (Eichensehr 2019b ,7-8). For instance, the first official public accusation by the USA only came in 2014, when five Chinese military hackers were criminally charged for cyberespionage against U.S. corporations (The United States, Department of Justice, May 19 2014).\n\n⁵⁰ By attribution problem, I refer to the difficulty in discovering the identity or location of the responsible for a cyberattack or their intermediary.\n\n⁵¹ Supra note 25, at 384; Supra note 31, at 205.\n\n⁵² Supra note 32, at 1495.\n\n⁵³ Supra note 31, at 205.\n\n⁵⁴ Chircop 2018, 653.\n\n⁵⁵ Supra note 42, at 1.\n\n⁵⁶ Despite NATO’s sponsorship, the Tallinn Manuals do not reflect the official position of the Alliance.\n\n⁵⁷ Supra note 32, at 1494.",

As it stands now, international law fails in coping with contemporary challenges posed by cyberspace and the rapid development of ICTs, notably the attribution of cyberattacks. As will be developed below, this practical gap not only hinders the cyber-attribution process, but also threatens international security on an equivalent scale to traditional armed attacks⁶⁰.\n\nAlthough literature on cybersecurity normally perceives the attribution problem as a technical issue, due to the significant technological advancements experienced in the last decade, attribution is already “more nuanced, more common, and more political”⁶¹ than it is acknowledged. It is therefore understood that the solution to this dangerous situation lies within the legal and political domains, not in the technical realm⁶². Non-state initiatives have been trying to overcome this legal quagmire, but the international legal system still is inherently attached to a state-centric approach. Therefore, no set of international binding rules as far as cybersecurity is concerned will ever likely be achieved without the participation of states.\n\nConsidering that so many aspects of our lives are now bound up with cyberspace, the discussion about cyber-attribution is not only pertinent but also urgent. Such a delicate situation deserves to be taken most seriously and it would be unduly ambitious to try to provide a full answer in this study. My purpose, however, is to make a modest attempt at shedding some light on the issue. Ideally, this may contribute to a constructive debate about the problem of attributing blame for cyberattacks.\n\nThe following research question was articulated in order to function as the backbone of the work here presented: to what extent is international law underdeveloped vis-à-vis cyber-attribution? Also, as a means to enlighten the path of this study, the following sub-questions were established: why does cyber-attribution matter? What are the legal and political challenges imposed by the attribution problem? How the difficulty in attributing blame of a cyberattack affects international security?\n\nIn order to carry out the aforementioned study, a qualitative research of a doctrinal nature will be applied.

To that end, Chapter 2 provides a brief overview of the security dilemma concept, presenting its main characteristics. Chapter 3 reviews the problem of attribution, discussing its most oft-cited causes and explaining why this issue deserves attention from the international community. Also, it assesses how the difficulty in attributing blame for a cyberattack affects international security as a whole. Subsequently, Chapter 4 approaches the research question through the analysis of current international law, discussing grey areas, as well as international rules that are applicable to cyberspace. Moreover, it reviews leading non-state initiatives that have been contributing to the development of the international legal framework in the challenging domain of cyberspace, especially Microsoft's proposals and the Tallinn Manual project. In addition, Chapter 4 examines the value of soft law norms for the international legal framework, and briefly discuss the Antarctic and nuclear safety regimes as examples of the codification of nom-binding norms. Finally, Chapter 5 concludes by reflecting on the main ideas discussed throughout this study and opening the path for additional insights and hopefully avenues for further research.\n\n13",

Realists depict an anarchical, competitive and conflictual world, in which insecurity among states is inescapable⁶⁴. Note that ‘anarchical’ is used here in a technical sense, indicating the dearth of an overarching, political authority at the international level. Under anarchy, states are the main actors in the international arena and their primary responsibility is to secure their own interests, especially their survival⁶⁵. In order to do so, according to the realist theory, states will attempt to acquire power and engage in power-balancing⁶⁶, creating what Hoffman called “a state of war”⁶⁷.\n\nThe interstate political order is, therefore, a self-help system plagued by “uncertainty, weapons and fear”⁶⁸, and in which power plays the leading role in shaping the relation between states⁶⁹. As long as we accept the basic premises of the realist theory, this hostile and insecure environment not only leaves little room for international cooperation⁷⁰, but also encourages “behaviour that leaves all concerned worse off than they could be, even in the extreme case in\n\n⁶³ This study will not differentiate Realism into its various strands since this warrant a more extended discussion that I can here give it. It is perhaps useful to point out, however, that realism is normally contrasted with liberalism or idealism, which tend to focus on international cooperation. Compared to these theories, the realist perspective is undeniably pessimistic. As Keohane put it, realism is “the language of power and interests rather than of ideals or norms” (Keohane 1986, 9).\n\n⁶⁴ Wheeler and Booth 2007, 2.\n\n⁶⁵ Waltz 1979, 91. Waltz points out that, “internationally, the environment of states’ actions, or the structure of their system, is set by the fact that some states prefer survival over other ends obtainable in the short run and act with relative efficiency to achieve that end” (Waltz, 1979, 93). On this topic, Jervis identifies throughout his book, entitled *Perception and Misperception in International Politics*, some states that did not have survival as their primary goal. For instance, During Hitler’s government, Germany valued territorial expansion over security (Jervis 2017).\n\n⁶⁶ According to Andersen, balance of power is “a mechanism that ideally would make states intentionally or unintentionally join the weaker part against the strong, to equal out or balance the distribution of power amongst states in the international system” and states “would do this to assure their own survival” (Andersen 2018, 1).\n\n⁶⁷ Hoffmann defines ‘state of war’ as “a competition of units in the kind of state of nature that knows no restrains other than those which the changing necessities of the game and the shallow convenience of the players impose” (Hoffmann 1965, vii).\n\n⁶⁸ *Supra note* 65.\n\n⁶⁹ Korab-Karpowicz 2017. It is important to note that Wendt argues, through the lenses of Constructivism, that “self-help and power politics are institutions, and not essential features of anarchy. Anarchy is what states make of it” (Wendt 1992, 395).\n\n⁷⁰ Waltz points out two reasons why international cooperation is limited by anarchy: insecurity and unequal gains. In an anarchic international system, states are not certain about each other’s intentions and they fear that cooperation might favour one state in detriment of the others, creating some kind of dependence. He argues that “[s]tates do not willingly place themselves in situations of increased dependence. In a self-help system, considerations of security subordinate economic gain to political interest” (*Supra note* 66, at 107).\n\n14",

To put it differently, the uncertainties inherent in an anarchic world cause states to feel insecure, leading to counterproductive policies and suboptimal results, such as security dilemmas, crises, or even wars⁷². As Schweller explained, “insecurity and the use of force are enduring attributes of the self-help international system”⁷³.\n\n## 2.1 What is the security dilemma?\n\nAccording to Wheeler and Booth, the security dilemma is the quintessential dilemma in interstate politics⁷⁴. Coined by Herz (1950) and Butterfield (1951), the term has since become an integral part of any discourse on international security and has been expanded and employed to “address many of the most important questions of international relations theory and security policy”⁷⁵. Both authors describe the security dilemma as a situation where the increase of a state’s security simultaneously (and unintentionally) decreases the security of other states⁷⁶. The risk here is that misperceptions and conflict spirals dramatically increase the chances of unnecessary or avoidable armed conflicts.\n\nFor instance, a state might attempt to increase its own security and avert aggression by acquiring more weapons, bringing them to a higher state of readiness, or creating alliances. Under anarchy, an adversarial state will get the wrong impression about this behaviour, interpreting it as a preparatory action for future attacks. This state will thus fell threatened and will take action to enhance its own security. The first state will have confirmed its suspicions about its adversary’s belligerence, increasing tension and leading to an arms race or even war. In this scenario, conflict is not the product of the actual intentions and military capabilities of a specific actor. Rather, it is the result of mutual misperceptions and miscommunications that arise from the inability of states to understand each other’s intentions and motives with complete\n\n⁷¹ Jervis 1978, 167.\n⁷² Carlsnaes et al. 2002, 372; Montgomery 2006, 183.\n⁷³ Schweller 1996, 116. Note that, according to Mearsheimer, “the best way for a state to survive in anarchy is to take advantage of other states and gain power at their expenses” (Mearsheimer 2001, 36).\n⁷⁴ Supra note 65, at 29.\n⁷⁵ Glaser 1997, 172.\n⁷⁶ Jervis describes the security dilemma as a situation where “many of the means by which a state tries to increase its security decreases the security of others” (Supra note 71, at 169-70). Likewise, Glaser explains that the security dilemma exists when a “state’s effort to increase its security would have the unintended effect of reducing its adversary’s security” (Glaser 2010, 56). Montgomery, on the other hand, sees the security dilemma as primarily an issue of perception; he describes it as “the situation where one state’s attempt to increase its security appear threatening to others and provoke an unnecessary conflict” (Montgomery 2006, 151).",

In this sense, as Herz points out, “it is one of the tragic implications of the security dilemma that mutual fear of what initially may never have existed may subsequently bring about what is feared the most”⁷⁸. Note that this is a “fertile version” of the philosophical problem of Other Minds, that is, “how one mind can ever know what is in the mind of another”⁷⁹.\n\nThe difficulty in correctly perceiving other’s intentions is related to the fact that many of the methods by which a state attempts to enhance its security will certainly make other states feel less secure. Jervis notes that, at the domestic level, individuals can attempt to increase their safety in several ways without jeopardizing others; one can, for instance, put bars on the windows, move to a safer area, and avoid dark streets⁸⁰. At the international level, however, “one state’s gain in security often inadvertently threatens others”⁸¹. The Cold War is a prime example of this. Both the United States’ and the Soviet Union’s efforts to increase their security had the unintended consequence of decreasing the security of the other superpower⁸², leading to a spiral in which they accumulate more military capabilities without making themselves more secure⁸³.\n\nOn top of this, there is what Wheeler and Booth described as the “inherent ambiguity of weapons”⁸⁴. Since most weapons can be used for both defensive and offensive purposes, it is incredibly difficult for decision-makers to foresee with certainty when and how arms may be used by other states. On this topic, Jervis asserts that “[u]nless the requirement for offense and defence differ in kind or amount, a status quo power will desire a military posture that resembles that of an aggressor. For this reason, others cannot infer from its military forces and preparations whether the state is aggressive”⁸⁵. Armament, therefore, is the material reality that initiates the security dilemma⁸⁶.\n\n⁷⁷ Gunitskiy 2011, 595; Supra note 65, at 4. Mearsheimer argues that governments can never be sure of the intentions of other states and that “intentions are impossible to divine with 100 percent certainty”. He also highlights that “intentions can change quickly, so a state’s intentions can be benign one day and hostile the next. Uncertainty about intentions is unavoidable, which means that states can never be sure that other states do not have offensive intentions to go along with their offensive capabilities” (Supra note 74, 2001, at 31).\n\n⁷⁸ Herz 1959, 241.\n\n⁷⁹ Hollis and Smith 1990, 171-172.\n\n⁸⁰ Supra note 71, at 169-70.\n\n⁸¹ Ibid.\n\n⁸² Jervis 2017, xiii-xiv.\n\n⁸³ Tang 2009, 594.

First, arms race is the most distinct expression of the vicious circle of the dilemma, but it is not the only one. For instance, the competition among imperialist powers for colonies in the late nineteenth and at the beginning of the twentieth centuries is considered to have been fuelled by a security dilemma⁸⁷. Second, the security dilemma will never be real, it will always be apparent⁸⁸. The dilemma can only exist if both states have benign motives; if, however, one state (or even both of them) has malign intentions, thus the situation cannot be described as a security dilemma, but as a security problem⁸⁹. As Schweller aptly put it, “[i]f states are arming for something other than security; that is, if aggressors do in fact exist, then it is no longer a security dilemma”⁹⁰. Finally, according to Wheeler and Booth, the security dilemma can be mitigated via the development of international institutions and legal regimes⁹¹. Insecurity, however, cannot be completely eliminated.\n\nCertainly, Herz’s and Butterfield’s original formulations of the security dilemma were an interesting development from the realist school of thought⁹². In its classical form, however, the concept may be of limited use in analysing the modern international system, which has a well-establish legal framework regulating the use of force, and in which most states are no longer threatened whether by war or external aggression⁹³. But this does not mean that the security dilemma is irrelevant or even obsolete for international security studies. On the contrary, it remains an extremely important tool for both policymakers and scholars since it can and has been reconceptualized to address modern challenges, including cyber-security ones.\n\n⁸⁷ Supra note 83, at 66.\n⁸⁸ Supra note 74, at 117.\n⁸⁹ Supra note 75, at 31. “If the threat posed by one state to another [...] is accurately perceived [...] then the situation cannot be classified as a security ‘dilemma’.

The security dilemma has been broadly employed by liberals (see Doyle 1983; Oneal and Russett 1999; Cederman 2001), neoliberals (see Axelrod and Keohane 1985), constructivists (see Wendt 1995), to name a few.\n⁹³ Bluth 2011, 1375.",

At the most general level, ‘attribution’ refers to the identification of the responsible entity for a malicious cyberattack⁹⁴. What is understood by ‘responsible entity’, however, can vary. There are usually three types of answers: the specific computing device used to carry out an attack, the individual pressing the keys that launch an attack, and ultimately the party that supervised and controlled the attack⁹⁵. According to Lin, even though “these three types of attribution are conceptually distinct, they are often related in practice”⁹⁶. Particularly, identifying the machine from which an attack was launched might provide some clues that can assist unveil the human attacker’s identity, which in turn can help determine the individual or entity responsible for authorizing or acquiescing the cyber operation. Still, each of these types offer different challenges, increasing the difficulty of the attribution process.\n\nAlthough attributing cyberattacks is not a new challenge⁹⁷, the attribution debate is developing “surprisingly slowly”⁹⁸. Scholars and experts have been dwelling upon the subject and hold a full spectrum of views on it. At the positive end of the spectrum are those, like Rid and Buchanan, who argue that cyber-attribution is not only possible, but “it has been happening successfully for a long time”⁹⁹. Lindsay strikes a more restrained yet positive note, by characterizing attribution as difficult, but acknowledging that there are strong systems for identifying the source of intrusions and responding to attacks, with an increasingly amount of investments being devoted to investigations¹⁰⁰. At the other end of the spectrum, Singer and Friedman characterize attribution as “[p]erhaps the most difficult problem” in cyberspace¹⁰¹, and Eun and Aßmann argue that “determining the real aggressor is impossible unless the aggressor admits to it”¹⁰². Shackelford further echoes this idea by affirming that sophisticated cyberattacks are “nearly impossible to trace to their sources”¹⁰³.\n\n---\n\n⁹⁴ Ibid., 5.\n⁹⁵ Lin 2016, 5.\n⁹⁶ Ibid., 13.\n⁹⁷ Supra note 12, at 955.\n⁹⁸ Supra note 33, at 5.\n⁹⁹ Ibid., 31.\n¹⁰⁰ Supra note 36.\n¹⁰¹ Supra note 48, at 73.\n¹⁰² Eun and Aßmann 2016, 355.\n¹⁰³ Shackelford 2010, 200.

            "markdown": "3.1 Why is attribution so difficult?\n\nThere are a number of answers to this question. First, many academics and experts suggest that the difficulty in attributing blame for cyberattacks is mainly due to the intrinsic characteristics of the cyber domain¹⁰⁴. The structural anonymity, which has been one of the hallmarks and biggest strengths of the Internet, provides the perfect venue for state and non-state actors to undertake malicious operations without fearing attribution or retaliation. The Internet, as Lindsay points out, “was designed to make connections easy and reliable even when the true identity of the connector and the path of the connection were unknown; security did not figure strongly in its early design”¹⁰⁵. Lupovici, however, seems to disagree on the premise that cyberspace is an inherently anonymous domain. Even though he recognizes that some aspects of the Internet make harder to attribute an attack, he argues that anonymity is a socially attributed trait and, therefore, cyberspace could be structured in a way that does not uphold this characteristic¹⁰⁶. Along this line of thinking, McConnell suggests that the only solution for the attribution problem is redesigning the Internet so that attribution and geolocation are more feasible¹⁰⁷. Such a change, however, would be a massive undertaking and probably would not help to prevent the increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks that are being launched today¹⁰⁸. At the same time, reengineering the entire computer network would reduce its efficiency and dependability, and would bring into question characteristics of the current Internet, such as freedom of action and privacy, that are treasured by many, including intelligence agencies¹⁰⁹.\n\nSecond, cyber-attribution is further complicated by the fact that hackers have at their disposal a variety of programs, techniques and applications to conceal the identity of their own Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and thus to thwart detection. One common practice that attackers employ to hide their online trail is to break into poorly secured internet servers or even personal computers and use them as proxies through which they can launch a cyberattack¹¹⁰.\n\n¹⁰⁴ Lupovic 2016, 322; Supra note 25, at 387.\n¹⁰⁵ Lindsay 2013, 375-76.\n¹⁰⁶ Supra note 74, at 330. Lupovici further argues that the current assumption that anonymity is inherent to the cyber domain might affect states’ policies. “Defenders, discouraged from relying on cyber deterrence, may refuse to invest in efforts to establish it. This will decrease the efficiency of cyber deterrence and, as a result, reinforce the existing common knowledge that this strategy is doomed to fail”. (Supra note 104, at 331).\n¹⁰⁷ McConnell 2010.\n¹⁰⁸ Supra note 10, at 3. For instance, Rid argues that McConnell suggestion “is not only unrealistic, it would not even solve the problem at hand” (Rid 2013, 140-41). For Tran, “even if the Internet could arduously be redesigned to authenticate the source IP address of every bit of data sent over the Internet, these addresses would accomplish the goal of merely identifying the source machine of an attack, and not a person, thereby creating another degree of attenuation between an attack and the attacker” (Tran 2018, 390).\n¹⁰⁹ Ibid.\n¹¹⁰ Greenemeier 2011.",

The discovered server could be located in a neutral, friendly or even your own country\"¹¹¹. According to Lipson, \"an IP address is a poor surrogate on which to establish a basis for trustworthiness\"¹¹². The cyberattacks that hit Estonia, for instance, originated from at least 177 countries, such as the United States, Russia, Peru, Egypt, and Estonian itself¹¹³. As Brenner effectively observed, \"the Internet is one big masquerade ball. You can hide behind aliases, you can hide behind proxy servers, and you can surreptitiously enslave other computers without their owners' knowledge – and then use their computers to do your dirty work\"¹¹⁴. Another prime example of a technology available to obfuscate one's traces in cyberspace is the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) Marble Framework, which is capable of altering the language of the code from English to another foreign language, such as Chinese, Russian, Korean, Arabic and Farsi¹¹⁵.\n\nIn this regard, Dinstein argues that future technological improvements will probably overcome the challenges that prevent cyber-attribution¹¹⁶. Indeed, governments are more capable of attributing responsibility for cyberattacks than they were a decade ago, and these technological advancements and innovations have boosted states' confidence¹¹⁷. For example, in 2014, Canada indicated to possess robust systems in place that allow the detection of highly sophisticated attacks, even those launched by state-sponsored actors¹¹⁸ and, in 2015, the United Kingdom's Chancellor affirmed that \"we are increasingly confident in our ability to determine from where attacks come\"¹¹⁹.

That is to say, attribution can only be accomplished if the individual or organization who was operating the computing device can also be identified. With this in mind, it should be noted that rarely does the location of a computer provide precise conclusions vis-à-vis the machine operator’s identity¹²⁴. Therefore, knowing that a cyberattack was executed on the territory of a state, or from the governmental cyber framework of a state, is not enough to attribute said attack to that state¹²⁵.\n\nFourth, it may be quite difficult to determine the ultimately responsible entity as far as state responsibility is concerned. Even if it is possible to overcome all the technological challenges and identify the human attacker, there remains the question of whether or not there is a relationship between the individual pressing the keys and the state actor. Is the attacker an officially sanctioned government agent? Or is it a third party operating on their own? Deibert, Rohozinski, and Crete-Nishihata acknowledge that there is an increasing tendency towards privateering cyberattacks, and states are particularly interested in this market since it “allows them to execute their missions once removed and clandestinely, thus offering plausible deniability and avoiding responsibilities under international law or the laws of armed conflict”¹²⁶.\n\nMoving to the legal aspect of attribution, a state will only be held responsible for an internationally wrongful action that is attributable to the state under public international law or that constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the state¹²⁷. On this point, it is important to note that, traditionally, there has been an extremely high bar for establishing state responsibility for acts of non-state actors¹²⁸.

More problematic issues, however, arise in determining the concepts of 'direction' and 'control', for the commentary falls short and does not explain the difference between both of them. Rather, it only says that the terms are \"disjunctive\"¹³². International tribunals have also failed to make a distinction between the three concepts with any level of detail. Therefore, as Schmitt put it, \"the prevailing approach tends towards a binary distinction in which either a state tells a non-state actor to perform an act (instruction or direction) or the state exercises 'effective control' over the non-state actor with respect to the act in question\"¹³³.\n\nThe effective control test was coined by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in its Nicaragua v. United States of America judgement¹³⁴. Even though the Court does not provide a definition for the expression, it has asserted that a state's participation in the form of \"financing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping\" the non-state actor does not rise to the degree of effective control¹³⁵. In this sense, for example, supplying malware to a terrorist group would not result in state responsibility. In fact, even if the state plans the whole operation and selects the military targets, it still would not be enough to result in attribution¹³⁶. Furthermore, taking into considerations the technical challenges aforementioned, determining that a hacker was under the effective control of a nation-state at relevant time is probably impossible¹³⁷. For instance, the 2007 cyberattacks targeting Estonia were partially attributed to the pro-Kremlin youth group Nashi, but it is not clear whether Russia was involved in the incident¹³⁸.\n\nIn Prosecutor v.

In light of the latter, the overall control test seems inappropriate for cyberspace, where the activity is more decentralized and rarely follows a hierarchical form. According to the ICJ in *Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Servia and Montenegro*, the “overall control test is unsuitable, for it stretches too far, almost to breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State’s organs and its international responsibility”¹⁴⁰. One then is left to question the legal validity of this test.\n\nRegardless of whether effective control or overall control ultimately suits the cyber domain, the attribution bar continues to be extremely high. As a result, states are prevented from adopting any lawful response to a cyberattack, including their inherent right to self-defence, encouraging retaliatory operations outside the existing legal structure¹⁴¹. Against this background, some scholars have suggested that one possible solution to these legal challenges is to lower the attribution standard. Schmitt, for instance, defended an indirect responsibility approach by which a state might be held responsible for the consequences of non-state actors’ unlawful operations on its territory “when it fails to take reasonably available measures to stop such acts in breach of its obligations to other states”¹⁴². Lowering the attribution bar, however, increases the chances of misattribution and conflict escalation.\n\nFifth, another factor that contributes to the difficulty of attributing cyberattacks is the presence of dynamic and sophisticated non-state actors. Traditionally, states and non-state actors were distinguished by significant imbalances not only in legal status, but also in resources and capabilities. The cyber domain, however, seems to offer great opportunities for non-state actors to challenge and, in some situations, to overcome states’ hegemony¹⁴³. Indeed, today these entities need as much or more attention than other international player due to their ability to profoundly disturb international peace and security. Nevertheless, these actors “enjoy a relative degree of impunity” for the harmful effects of their actions¹⁴⁴ since international law does not offer a tailored framework based on which non-state actors can be held responsible for unlawful acts¹⁴⁵.

The investigation of cyberattacks is a complex process that requires detailed analysis of technical data, as well as a deep comprehension of political and economic motivations$^{147}$. Consequently, as Sheldon points out, “the forensics of attribution can rarely, if ever, give immediate results and can take days if not weeks to provide solid technical evidence”$^{148}$. Further, former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defence William Lynn III recognized the struggle to attribute cyberattacks, observing that “[t]he forensic work necessary to identify an attacker may take months, if identification is possible at all”$^{149}$. Cyber-attribution, however, is nearly useless if it takes too long and is not able to identify all the actors involved in the attack$^{150}$.\n\nThese are the numerous hurdles, both technological and legal, that have been oft-mentioned as a hindrance to the development of an effective legal framework for governing cyberattacks$^{151}$. In spite of the fact that previous literature on cybersecurity perceived the attribution problem as an insurmountable technical issue, recent scholars and experts have begun to acknowledge that actual attribution might not be rocket science after all$^{152}$. As Carlin aptly put it, “although attribution is difficult, it is far from impossible”$^{153}$.\n\n## 3.2 Why does cyber-attribution matter?\n\nConsidering the number of obstacles that significantly limit cyber-attribution, one is then left to question whether or not the matter is worth international society’s attention.

The duration of the investigation is relevant for cyber-attribution because if a targeted state takes too long to respond, any countermeasures adopted may be seen as punishment, forbidden under public international law. On the other hand, if a targeted state engages in countermeasures too early and has wrongfully attributed the cyberattack, it will have committed an internationally wrongful act itself.\n\n$^{151}$ According to Shackelford, “the international law doctrine of attribution is in fact an essential ground for regulating cyberattacks” (Shackelford 2008, 233).\n\n$^{152}$ “Actual attribution of cyber events is already more nuanced, more common, and more political than the literature has acknowledged so far” (Supra note 62).\n\n$^{153}$ Supra note 119.",

According to Article 22 of the ILC’s Draft Articles on State Responsibility, a state that has been the target of an internationally wrongful act may adopt countermeasures¹⁵⁵ – actions that would otherwise be unlawful¹⁵⁶. In order to do so, the victim state must identify the state actor which is responsible for the internationally wrongful act¹⁵⁷. Eichensehr argues that “[s]uch an attribution could be done privately, but if so, the victim state would risk other states viewing its countermeasures as an initial wrongful act, rather than a lawful response”¹⁵⁸. Tran adds to the discussion by explaining that even in situations where formal law is not the answer, states would still be required to attribute responsibility in order to implement any informal method of sanctioning the attacker¹⁵⁹. Thus, attribution is a crucial and necessary prerequisite to any further legal action, be it countermeasures, diplomatic responses or any other informal kind of response. Consequently, it is not unreasonable to assume that solving the attribution problem is the pivotal first step to establish any functioning system of law that regulates cyberattacks.\n\nAdditionally, publicly attributing the blame for a cyberattack, and consequently sharing specific aspects of it, may help network defenders identify possible vulnerabilities in the system and, thus, prevent future attacks¹⁶⁰. It is often cited that, in some cases, attribution may also lead to macro-level deterrence. By identifying the culprits of a cyberattack, states are able to publicly name and shame them. Potentially, this practice will cause the named actor, and even third parties, to refrain from future operations¹⁶¹. For instance, in 2014, the USA criminally charged five Chinese military hackers for cyberespionage against U.S. corporations and “[f]or a period of time following the indictments, there was a very significant decrease” in Chinese\n\n¹⁵⁴ Supra note 25, 386.\n¹⁵⁵ “The wrongfulness of an act of a State not in conformity with an international obligation towards another State is precluded if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State” (Supra note 96, art. 22).\n¹⁵⁶ According to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, “countermeasures are actions or omissions by an injured State directed against a responsible State that would violate an obligation owed by the former to the latter” (Supra note 15, 111, rule 20 (1)). Note that countermeasures cannot be taken by non-state actors since they are reserved to states. Similarly, such measures cannot be taken against non-state actors, except when their (cyber) actions are attributable to a state actor. “This is because only states commit, as a matter of law, internationally wrongful acts” (Supra note 7, at 606). Also, Banks argues that countermeasures were created to compel a state to desist in its unlawful actions, not as punishment (Supra note 33, at 1502).\n¹⁵⁷ Supra note 96, art. 49.\n¹⁵⁸ Supra note 63, at 29.\n¹⁵⁹ Supra note 25, at 383-84.\n¹⁶⁰ Supra note 3, at 3.\n¹⁶¹ Supra note 63, at 25",

Furthermore, publicly attributing responsibility for cyberattacks might create micro-level deterrence, which is related with the adoption of domestic legal procedures and economic sanctions¹⁶³. According to Goldsmith and Williams, the costs of these measures “are not nothing; would-be state-sponsored cyber-intruders and their principals surely take them into account”¹⁶⁴. Micro-level deterrence, therefore, could be more successful than its macro-level counterpart¹⁶⁵. According to Finnemore and Hollis, publicly attributing cyberattacks promote “interactions between the accuser, the accused, and third-party audiences that – over time – may result in the creation of a new norm”¹⁶⁶. Note, however, that public attribution alone may not be sufficient to deter malicious cyberactivity or produce cyber accountability, particularly if the responsible actor does not care if his/her identity and behaviour are made public.\n\nFrom an international relations perspective, states and international stakeholders should care about the attribution problem due to its capacity to deteriorate the international political environment. As noted earlier, attributing blame for a cyberattack is no easy task and thus the chances of a malicious cyber operation being framed wrongfully is extremely high. Indeed, misattribution is substantially more likely vis-à-vis cyberattacks than traditional kinetic warfare¹⁶⁷. With this in mind, one should be cognizant that there is a tendency to explain malicious cyber incidents in terms of geopolitical conditions and existing rivalries¹⁶⁸, particularly soon after a cyberattack when there is a haste to identify the culprits, to strengthen defences and to retaliate. The 2007 Estonian cyberattack provides one of the clearest examples of this tendency. Due to past Russian actions and the political atmosphere at the time, the attack was attributed to Russia and this explanation was later questioned by cyber experts. A yet more recently example is the 2015 Ukraine power grid cyberattack. Ukraine’s intelligence community was quick to blame Russia for the attack because it was perceived as an escalation of the conflict\n\n¹⁶² Nakashima 2015.\n¹⁶³ To build upon the previous example, in addition to the criminal charges, the Chinese hackers cannot travel to the United States or other country with which it has extradition treaty; if they do, they could be extradited to the USA and face trial. Nor can they engage in financial transactions that touches the U.S. or other sanctioning state financial system.\n¹⁶⁴ Goldsmith and Williams 2018.\n¹⁶⁵ Nevertheless, Eichensehr explains that the effectiveness of micro-level deterrence might vary according to the nationality of the hackers (“losing the ability to travel or to store money in Western Europe may be less of a blow to North Korean hackers than to Russians”), and depends on the level of coercion to which the cyber-attackers are subject (“[i]f their actions on behalf of their government are not voluntary, then the hackers will not alter their behaviour in response”) (Supra note 63, at 27).\n¹⁶⁶ Finnemore and Hollis 2019, 10-11.\n¹⁶⁷ Supra note 29, at 556\n¹⁶⁸ Supra note 13, at 960. Besides heightening the risk of misattribution, this tendency to blame the most obvious culprits prevents alternative explanations from being developed, as well as invites lesser rivals or non-state actors to provoke hostilities. Schulzke argues that “[a]s the risk of being caught diminishes, the costs of attack decrease and the potential benefits become even more attractive” (Supra note 13, at 961).\n\n26",

However, no proof was ever offered to support this allegation and it is believed that the power grid system had been compromised before the hostilities. Had Ukraine adopted any retaliatory measures, the tension would have heightened and the conflict could have spilt out of the cyber domain and into the physical world.\n\nIt is perhaps useful to underline that the most active participants in the cyber domain are also some of the world’s most powerful states, to wit: The United States, Russia and China. Taking into account that each of these states are equipped with a nuclear armoury, misattributing a cyberattacks could trigger off destructive conflicts with potential to threat the whole international system, putting a premium on a confident degree of cyber-attribution¹⁷⁰. On top of this, the relative availability and fairly low cost of the technology necessary to launch an attack¹⁷¹ in cyberspace “leaves the potential for mass destruction within the grasp of far less sophisticated non-state actors and organizations”¹⁷². So, it does not take much imagination to see the potential threats an unregulated cyber domain pose to international security, economy and also to states’ infrastructure.\n\nIn this regard, inspired by great theorists such as Thomas Schelling, Robert Jervis, and John Herz, among others, Buchanan took the basic foundation of the security dilemma theory and employed it to cyberspace. A ‘cybersecurity dilemma’ is said to exist when one country cannot increase the security of its digital infrastructure, either through the creation of offensive cyber capabilities, without decreasing other’s cybersecurity. According to Buchanan, the cybersecurity dilemma can be potentially more dangerous and escalatory than traditional kinetic conflicts because, in cyber domain, there is a “perception of offense-dominance”¹⁷³, making defensive measures to be perceived as offensive and threatening. With this in mind, cyberspace appears to be the perfect environment for the security dilemma to thrive. The lack of clarity vis-à-vis the intentions and capabilities of cyber warfare, therefore, have the potential to undermine trust¹⁷⁴, rise escalation fears, provoke an arms race or even an international armed conflict¹⁷⁵. “As cyberoperations become more potent and computer networks grow still more important, the dilemma’s dangers – already real – will only grow”¹⁷⁶.\n\n¹⁶⁹ Zetter 2016.\n¹⁷⁰ Supra note 39, at 192.\n¹⁷¹ Supra note 107, at 55.\n¹⁷² Payne 2016, 684-85.\n¹⁷³ Buchanan 2017, 108-09.\n¹⁷⁴ Ibid., 191.\n¹⁷⁵ Jinghua 2019.\n¹⁷⁶ Ibid., 194.",

In fact, some scholars even suggest that cyberspace seems “resistant to codification of the applicable rules in a comprehensive multilateral binding treaty”¹⁷⁷. Note, however, that the dearth of cyber-specific regulations is not for lack of trying by major international actors. Already in 1996, the French government pushed for the creation of the Charter for International Cooperation on the Internet, which would be “an accord comparable to the international law of the sea”¹⁷⁸. The proposal, however, was met with apathy by other international stakeholders.\n\nAfterwards, in January 2002, the UN General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to settle a group of governmental experts to conduct a study on “relevant international concepts aimed at strengthening the security of global information and telecommunications systems”¹⁷⁹. The United Nations’ Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications thus became the leading state-based initiative for the codification of international law vis-à-vis the cyber domain¹⁸⁰, but its success was limited. Between 2004 and 2015, the GGE submitted three reports which expressed the unanimous opinion of the state-participants¹⁸¹.\n\nThe 2010 report was welcomed with great enthusiasm by the international community even though it brought an array of “very rudimentary findings and recommendations”¹⁸² and did not present much legal clarity.

A final point to consider is that the Group claimed that “accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated”¹⁹⁴. A problem, however, is that at no time the report clarified what kind of or how much evidence would be necessary to ‘substantiate’ an accusation¹⁹⁵.\n\nIt is perhaps useful to point out that, since the 2015 report, the Russian Federation and China, along with several other states, have continued to advocate for the view that accusations ought to be substantiated¹⁹⁶. On the other end of the spectrum, the USA, France and the United Kingdom share the position that, under public international law, there is no evidentiary requirement for making accusations. In this regard, U.S. State Department Legal Adviser Brian J. Egan stated that:\n\n[D]espite the suggestion by some States to the contrary, there is no international legal obligation to reveal evidence on which attribution is based prior to taking appropriate action. There may, of course, be political pressure to do so, and States may choose to reveal such evidence to convince other States to join them in condemnation, for example.

The Group held promise for the clarification of cyber-related customary international law, but it left the global community with an unresolved legal conundrum in which opinions appear to be diverging and solidifying instead of converging²⁰². Yet, the GGE reports were a welcomed first step for the discussion on international cyber norms and remain extremely relevant²⁰³.\n\nOne encouraging conclusion is that, in spite of the lack of a specific legal framework, cyberspace is certainly not a lawless domain beyond the control of public international law. As it has been pointed out, it is well settled that general principles and rules of international law also apply to cyber operations²⁰⁴. Indeed, if international law is to be an effective governance arrangement, it should be flexible to new situations without the necessity to recreate a whole set of rules on each occasion²⁰⁵. The development of nuclear weapons is a prime example of this. When the UN Charter was being elaborated, its “framers could not be aware of the threat of nuclear weapons”²⁰⁶ and therefore the legal instrument did not include this type of armament in its provisions regarding the use of force. Yet, decades later, the ICJ provided an advisory opinion arguing that Articles 2(4) and 51 of the UN Charter, concerning the prohibition of the use of force and self-defence respectively, apply to “any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed”²⁰⁷. By this logic, the body of international law that governs the use of force should apply to cyber activities, too²⁰⁸. Despite these advances, however, many underlying questions remain virtually unanswered. Perhaps most importantly, how are international legal norms supposed to apply to the complex cyber domain?²⁰⁹\n\n²⁰¹ Ibid.\n\n²⁰² Korzak 2017.\n\n²⁰³ Supra note 55, at 648.\n\n²⁰⁴ According to Henriksen, the 2013 UN GGE report “reflected an emerging consensus that cyberspace is subject to the same general principles of international law that governs the more physical domains” (Henriksen 2019, 3).

This subject, however, warrant a more extended discussion than I can here give it. In this sense, this study focuses on the two leading non-state-driven initiatives that epitomize the phenomenon described above: the Tallinn Manual Project and Microsoft’s proposals.\n\nThe first non-state initiative that tried to address cyberattacks and increase international cybersecurity was the Tallinn Project, which brought together an international group of independent experts led by Professor Michael Schmitt. The project published two editions of the Manual, respectively in 2013²²⁶ and 2017²²⁷, under the auspices of the NATO CCD COE. Their texts, however, must not be seen as representing the views of NATO or sponsoring nations. Rather, the Manuals should be understood as a reflexion of the views of the experts, all acting in their own private capacity²²⁸. It should be noted that this project is neither an international treaty on cyber law nor does it set forth *lex ferenda*, but it is a restatement of international law as it is – *lex lata*²²⁹.\n\nThe 2013 edition, entitled the *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, pays particular attention to cyber activities that occur above the level of use of force and encompasses purported rules of customary international law, the larger part of which related to the *jus ad bellum* (the law governing the use of force)²³⁰ and the *jus in bello* (the law\n\n²²⁴ Finnemore and Hollis 2016, 446; According to Finnemore and Sikkink, norm entrepreneurs are “agents having strong notions about appropriate or desirable behaviour in their community” (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998, 896-97). Henry Dunant, the founder of the International Committee of the Red Cross, is a prime example of norm entrepreneurship.\n\n²²⁵ For instance, Chernenko et al. recommend the creation of an “independent, international cyber court or arbitrage method that deals only with government-level cyber conflicts” (Chernenko et al. 2018). RAND’s *Stateless Attribution* report, on the other hand, suggests an international organization for cyber-attribution, the *Global Cyber Attribution Consortium*, which would involve “a broad team of international experts to conduct independent investigations of major cyber incidents for the purpose of attribution” and would operate “without standing state participation” (*Supra* note 3, at 27-31).\n\n²²⁶ *Supra* note 178.\n\n²²⁷ Ibid.\n\n²²⁸ Tallinn Manual, 23; Tallinn Manual 2.0, 2.\n\n²²⁹ Tallinn Manual, 19; Tallinn Manual 2.0, 3.\n\n²³⁰ Tallinn Manual, rules 10-19.",

The Manual was considered to be a “remarkable achievement”²³² and, according to Banks, provided “much-needed confidence for states that international law applies in the cyber domain”²³³. Early reviews, nevertheless, criticized the project’s emphasis on cyber operations that amount to use of force since, in reality, the majority of, if not all, cyber activities fall below the use of force threshold²³⁴. Another major criticism of the Tallinn Manual is the dearth of geographic diversity among the group of experts, all of whom hail from Western Europe, Australia, and the USA. Consequently, the impartiality of the project is challenged, hindering its acceptability and application by states outside the Global North. China, for instance, has been very critical of the whole Tallinn initiative since it seems to be a North American attempt to “maintain US dominance in the information age”²³⁵. As noted by Eichensehr, the Manual is “channelling, even though not officially representing, a particular worldview with respect to the laws of armed conflict”²³⁶.\n\nIn the 2013 Tallinn Manual, no effort was made to establish legal criteria for attributing blame for cyberattacks²³⁷ and attribution is addressed as a problem, instead of “a realistic task having technical, political and legal aspects”²³⁸. Still, some provisions may shed light on the attribution problem. For example, Rule 5 asserts that “a state shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States”²³⁹.

Also, she points that “[e]ven if some of these attacks are conducted by states or may be attributable to states, most of them fall far below the threshold of ‘threat of use of force’ or ‘armed attack’.

In this regard, the experts agreed that, in specific circumstances, the acts of non-state actors might be attributable to a state and therefore cause that state’s international legal responsibility$^{245}$. The non-state actor, however, must be either acting “on the instructions of” or “under the direction or control” of that state$^{246}$.\n\nIn 2017, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations was published, expanding considerably the scope of the project. Now, it also includes the analysis of the international legal framework that applies to malicious cyberattacks that do not meet the use of force threshold. Furthermore, the new Manual addresses peacetime legal regimes, such as state responsibility, human rights law, and the laws of space, air, and the sea. On the whole, the Tallinn 2.0 “reflects a careful effort to move international law forward in the challenging domain of cyberspace”$^{247}$. Mačák further echoes this idea by arguing that the expansion and revision of the document will probably “further strengthen the project’s overall relevance as well as its claim to authority”$^{248}$. Banks, on the other hand, explains that the Tallinn 2.0’s provisions and commentaries are “necessarily general in nature, sometimes ambiguous, and do not necessarily reflect settled international law”$^{249}$.\n\nRegarding cyber-attribution, in spite of the expectations surrounding its publication, the 2017 Tallinn Manual did not go any further than the previous edition in providing an effective legal solution to the attribution problem$^{250}$. Rather, the experts limited their analysis of cyber-attribution to the well-established Articles on State Responsibility, codified by the ILC$^{251}$.

Even though the reliance on Western-centric approaches might handicap Tallinn’s acceptance in non-Western countries, such as China and the Russian Federation, the project still is an essential tool for scholars, international lawyers, policymakers, and international stakeholders²⁵³.\n\nIn 2014, Microsoft Corporation published a white paper entitled *International Cybersecurity Norms: Reducing Conflict in an Internet-Dependent World*²⁵⁴. It was the first thorough proposal to seek the definition of acceptable and unacceptable state conducts online, with the purpose of decreasing risks and bringing predictability and stability to the international scenario²⁵⁵. In short, Microsoft proposed six cybersecurity norms to limit conflict and improve cyber defences²⁵⁶. These norms are intended to “reduce the possibility that ICT products and services could be used, abused, or exploited by nation states as part of offensive operations”²⁵⁷. Note that, like both editions of the Tallinn Manual, Microsoft’s white paper suggests guidelines of state conduct and is openly state-centric in its approach²⁵⁸.\n\nThe project was widely criticized for emphasizing the role of states and thus overlooking the relevance of the private sector, in particular the global ICT industry, for the promotion of international cybersecurity²⁵⁹. In response to these claims, Microsoft released another white paper, *From Articulation to Implementation: Enabling Progress on Cybersecurity Norms*, in which the Corporation outlines six further cybersecurity norms. This time, however, the norms were directed at ICT companies²⁶⁰.

Furthermore, in 2017, the President of Microsoft, Brad Smith, proposed the adoption of a “Digital Geneva Convention” to protect civilians from nation-state cyberattacks²⁶². Such a convention would include an independent attribution organization that could “address cyber threats in a manner like the role played by the International Atomic Energy Agency in the field of nuclear non-proliferation”²⁶³. This organization would also facilitate cooperation between academia, governments, technology companies, and civil society in the sphere of cyber-attribution.\n\nNote that, while the rules brought by the Tallinn Manuals articulate purported customary international obligations that by themselves are binding on all states, except persistent objectors²⁶⁴, the norms put forward by Microsoft’s proposals are only broad suggestions that do not create any right or legal obligation. In other words, Microsoft’s norms are “more aspirational than realistic” and require states to translate them into legally binding rules, which takes time and commitment²⁶⁵. Despite this difference, both initiatives have in common the fact that they are non-state-driven, quasi-legal instruments which do not have any legally binding force²⁶⁶. In other words, they are soft law rules²⁶⁷. In fact, the Tallinn Manuals and Microsoft’s white papers could hardly amount to anything but a non-binding document²⁶⁸ since states still are “the legislators of the international legal system”²⁶⁹. That said, one may call into question the importance of these initiatives for the development of international law. Is soft law an authentic law? Is soft law effective to produce norms despite its non-binding nature?\n\n38",

Certainly, the Tallinn Manual project and Microsoft’s papers have a lower degree of legal normativity than binding international rules²⁷². Indeed, as stated by the ILC on its study on the Identification of Customary International Law, the “conduct of other actors [than states] is not practice that contributes to the formation, or expression, of rules of customary international law”²⁷³. This, however, does not imply that these initiatives are utterly irrelevant for the law-making process or even to the development of cyber law. Quite the opposite, considering the normative plurality in international law, non-state-driven initiatives of this kind might be valuable both in quantity and quality²⁷⁴. For Thirlway, “soft law is a vital intermediate stage towards a more rigorously binding system, permitting experiment and rapid modification”²⁷⁵.\n\nMoreover, even though these intermediary legal products are not “valid legal norms”, they might possess a certain evidentiary importance in the next stages of the development of rules of international law²⁷⁶. Put differently, non-binding documents, such as UN resolutions, might evince the existence of both *opinio juris* and state practice which could later support the formation of customary norms²⁷⁷. By this logic, hard and soft laws are not mutually exclusive and should be seen as “tools provided with a different degree of normativity along a *continuum*”²⁷⁸. It also should be noted that soft law-making processes normally involve non-state actors and thus are more “multicultural and inclusive” than others²⁷⁹.\n\n---\n\n²⁷⁰ By ‘normativity’, I mean “the law’s claim to authority, that is, its claim to provide its legal subjects with exclusionary albeit *prima facie* reasons for action through binding legal norms or in other words its claim to create obligations to obey the law that in principle preclude some countervailing reasons for action” (Besson, 2010, 173).\n\n²⁷¹ Ibid., 174.\n\n²⁷² *Supra note* 42, at 19.\n\n²⁷³ International Law Commission, *Draft Conclusions on Identification of Customary International Law*, with Commentaries, 2018, A/73/10, conclusion 4 (3), 130.\n\n²⁷⁴ *Supra note* 240, at 170.\n\n²⁷⁵ Thirlway 2019, 186-87.\n\n²⁷⁶ *Supra note* 240, at 170.\n\n²⁷⁷ Ibid.

Hence, it seems fair to conclude that the aforementioned initiatives are not only highly pertinent, but also “likely to prove especially influential”²⁸¹. Nevertheless, this situation is by no means ideal since states, and only states, hold the formal authority to create international law²⁸². As Judge Higgins aptly put it, “[s]tates are, at this moment of history, still at the heart of the international legal system”²⁸³. However, it is important to bear in mind that the norms proposed by both the Tallinn Manual Project and Microsoft’s papers might “mature through codification into treaty law or crystallise into customary law”, so that they delineate the exact limits of activities in cyberspace²⁸⁴.\n\nThis dynamic is certainly not without precedent. The Antarctic legal regime is the epitome of this. In the 1960s and 1970s, many non-legally binding norms were brought in with high hopes of conserving both living and non-living resources of Antarctica²⁸⁵. Joyner argues that the adoption of these non-binding instruments laid the international legal foundation for the treaty that was yet to come²⁸⁶. Ultimately, the majority of these norms were codified into the 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, a binding agreement that has been ratified by all major international actors, including the USA, China, and Russia²⁸⁷.\n\nAnother prime example is the international nuclear safety regime. Even though proposals to establish a legally-binding international treaty were put forward since the 1960s, states were generally “disinclined to go beyond the recommendatory nature of the safety standards” issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)²⁸⁸.

Perhaps the most notable difference is that, while the lawmaking process vis-à-vis cyberspace has been spearheaded by non-state-driven initiatives, the development of binding rules for international nuclear safety and the conservation of Antarctica had been led mainly by state actors. Yet, these two regimes are valuable examples that illustrate the codification of soft law norms²⁹¹. With this in mind, the current status of cyber international law should be seen as an early stage towards the codification or crystallisation of cyber hard law²⁹².

Given the ever-growing reliance on ICTs and the increasing frequency, intensity, and complexity of cyberattacks, a solution for the attribution problem is crucial for both promoting a (relatively) stable world order and reducing the chances of conflict stemming from cyberoperations²⁹³. Note, however, that this solution does not lie in the technical domains, as previously thought²⁹⁴. Pragmatically, the most relevant hurdles for cyber deterrence nowadays are not poor technical capabilities since, from a technical standpoint, tools for attribution have matured significantly in recent years²⁹⁵, increasing states’ confidence vis-à-vis assigning blame for malicious cyberattacks²⁹⁶. Rather, the solution for this issue lies in the realm of international law and cooperation.\n\nAs transnational terrorism, migration crises, and other security challenges that plague the international community, the attribution problem cannot be appropriately tackled by any single international entity, regardless of how strong and influential that entity might be²⁹⁷. Instead, these modern phenomena require a framework for active global collaboration. It is international law that “affords [such] a framework, a pattern, a fabric for international society”²⁹⁸. Nevertheless, in the context of the computer network, it seems that international law fails to deliver. Even though states have agreed that public international law applies to cyberactivity, there is no broad multilateral agreement on how to govern cyberspace²⁹⁹ and, therefore, it is as yet uncertain how the international legal framework applies to this new, complex domain.\n\nThis difficulty in the application of traditional rules and principles of international law, in order to properly address cyber challenges, results from a number of reasons³⁰⁰. Perhaps the most relevant of them is the attachment of this body of law to state-centric assumptions and foundations of the early formative stage of the international legal system³⁰¹.

By way of an example, the USA has declared that it has the ability to identify and hold their cyber opponents accountable (Fryer-Biggs 2012). Indeed, in the last few years, the U.S. government has attributed high-profile cyberattacks, such as the 2014 intrusion at Sony Pictures Entertainment and the 2016 DNC hack, respectively, to North Korean and Russia (Supra note 42, at 23-24).\n²⁹⁷ Supra note 42, at 2.\n²⁹⁸ Henkin 1978, 5.\n²⁹⁹ Moynihan 2019, 4.\n³⁰⁰ Supra note 2, at 375.\n³⁰¹ Supra note 7, at 610-11.",

In an environment where non-state actors are as powerful, if not more so, than states, it seems fair to conclude that this legal system grounded in the traditional state-centric perspective of international law is not suitable or even adequate to address challenges posed by cyberspace and the rapid development of ICTs³⁰³. In this sense, as long as states refuse to recognize the existence and the importance of other international players, any effort to govern cyberspace and to establish legal mechanisms for cyber-attribution will fall short.\n\nAs it stands now, international law not only fails in effectively dealing with the attribution problem, but also is unlikely to be instrumental in providing both predictability and stability to cyberspace in the short and medium-terms. Besides the lack of clarity of the law in this area, governments have been unwilling to clearly express their existing norms and practices in relation to the cyber domain, impeding the formation of customary international law and increasing unpredictability of state behaviour³⁰⁴. Note that, in spite of the constructive contribution made by non-state initiatives, public international law is lagging far behind in many respects and thus continues to be underdeveloped vis-à-vis cyber-attribution.\n\nBefore proceeding, two points still need to be considered. First, by filling the void created by states’ reluctance to undertake the international law-making process, non-state-driven initiatives, especially the Tallinn Manuals and Microsoft’s proposals, have been providing much-needed clarity to some grey areas of international cyber law³⁰⁵. These initiatives, however, are constrained by their state-centric approaches, non-binding character, and interpretative methods, which usually lack the necessary legal safety³⁰⁶. Therefore, non-state initiatives represent a relevant but primitive point in the discussion about the application of international law to the cyber domain³⁰⁷. They should be seen as a means to an end, not an end in itself³⁰⁸.\n\n³⁰² Ibid.\n\n³⁰³ According to Schmitt and Watts, the cyber domain and cyberactivity have bridged “a number of formerly significant gaps between states’ and non-state actors’ abilities to compromise international peace and security. in fact, some non-state actors now match, if not exceed, the cyber capabilities of many states in this respect” (Supra note 7, at 595).\n\n³⁰⁴ Supra note 33, at 1509.\n\n³⁰⁵ Supra note 42, at 1.\n\n³⁰⁶ Supra note 2, at 381. For instance, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 limited its analysis of cyber-attribution to the basic principles of State Responsibility, as codified by the ILC. However, as its name suggests, this body of law can only be applied when there is a state nexus.\n\n³⁰⁷ Supra note 33, at 1513.\n\n³⁰⁸ In this regard, Mačák points out that non-state initiatives might serve “as norm-making laboratories”, permitting states to identify and assess advantages and disadvantages of a number of proposals (Supra note 42, at 30-31).\n\n43",

After all, states are still at the heart of the international legal framework³⁰⁹ and are the only ones to hold the formal authority to create international rules³¹⁰. This argument generates an obvious puzzle, however: why then do they not solve this conundrum? The answer to this question lies on the fact that some countries may benefit from the current state of affairs, characterized by uncertainties and the lack of express cyber norms³¹¹. States that possess the most advanced cyber capabilities – such as the United States, Russia, China, and likely North Korea – may take advantage of the cyber domain in order to fulfil their national interests in the physical world³¹². For instance, the USA has allegedly used an extremely sophisticated computer worm, called Stuxnet, to destroy numerous centrifuges in an Iranian nuclear facility³¹³, thwarting the prospects of Iran developing nuclear weapons and thus securing American geopolitical interests in the Middle East.\n\nBy this logic, if states believe that by acting in unregulated cyberspace their gains offset their losses, there will be no incentive for them to promote the regulation of this domain or to solve the attribution problem. This might help to explain why state actors have been so reluctant to engage in the cyber law-making process, as well as to express clear *opinio juris* with respect to cyberspace. Considering the ever-increasing costs of insecurity and uncertainty related to an ungoverned cyber domain, states may soon come to realize the necessity of an international legal framework capable of addressing cyberattacks³¹⁴. As Professor Koh aptly put it, “compliance with international law frees us to do more, and do more legitimately, in cyberspace, in a way that more fully promotes our national interests”³¹⁵.

With this in mind, international stakeholders and policymakers should strive to increase transparency, so as to bridge the existing trust gaps inside the international community. Overall, greater transparency reduces misperceptions and conflict spirals and, consequently, leads to cooperation and better cybersecurity.\n\nIt is important to point out that, due to time constraints, this thesis was not able to assess the role played by the private sector in attributing blame for cyberattacks or to analyse non-Western approaches to the international rule of law in the cyber domain.

Even though determining the machines that launched a malicious cyber incident is no longer an arduous task for the most developed states, identifying the individuals, organizations, or governments that are legally responsible for the attack continues to be extremely difficult. This study argues that, as it stands now, international law not only fails in effectively dealing with the attribution problem, but also is unlikely to be instrumental in providing both predictability and stability to cyberspace in the short and medium-terms. As a result, the cyber domain will continue to be an environment that offers the perfect conditions for the security dilemma to thrive and in which incidents – whether intended or not – can trigger off conflicts causing widespread harm to the whole international security system.\nKeywords: cyber-attribution, attribution problem, cybersecurity, security dilemma, international security, Tallinn Manual, non-state initiatives.\n4\n# Table of Contents\nAbbreviations ... 5\nChapter 1 – Introduction ... 6\nChapter 2 – Realism and the Security Dilemma ... 14\n2.1 What is the security dilemma? ... 15\nChapter 3 – The Attribution Problem ... 18\n3.1 Why is attribution so difficult? ... 19\n3.2 Why does cyber-attribution matter? ... 24\nChapter 4 – International Law and Cybersecurity ... 29\n4.1 Leading non-state initiatives ... 34\n4.2 The value of soft law ... 39\nChapter 5 – Conclusion ... 42\nBibliography ... 46\nArticles, Reports and Books ... 46\nLegal Sources and Official Documents ... 53\nWebsites ... 56\n5\n# Abbreviations\nACTMs Antarctic Treaty Consultative Party Meetings\nCCD COE Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence\nCIA Central Intelligence Agency\nDDOS Distributed Denial of Service\nDNC Democratic National Committee\nDNI Director of National Intelligence\nGGE Group of Governmental Experts\nIAEA International Atomic Energy Agency\nICJ International Court of Justice\nICTs Information and Communication Technologies\nICTY International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia\nIHL International Humanitarian Law\nILC International Law Commission\nIP Internet Protocol\nNATO North Atlantic Treaty Organization\nUK United Kingdom\nUSA United States of America\nVCLT Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties\n# Chapter 1 – Introduction\nBy providing people across the globe with instant access to information, to communication, and to novel economic opportunities, cyberspace¹ and the rapid development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have essentially transformed not only the world economy, but also the way of life. Education, health, government, as well as sectors such as energy, communication, and transportation are inextricably linked to, if not dependent on, the cyber domain². As information technology becomes more widespread and integrated into our daily lives, the probability of compromise by malicious cyber activity increases³. According to the former Director of National Intelligence (DNI) of the United States, more than thirty countries are developing offensive cyber capabilities, which will rise the incidence of both standoff and remote operations⁴. To complicate matters further, these capabilities are progressively under criminal and other non-state actors’ control⁵. Therefore, cyberattacks⁶ that deeply affect international peace and the global economy are no longer “futuristic or far-fetched”, but rather the reality of cyberspace⁷.\n¹ “Cyberspace” is defined by the United States National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations as “a domain characterized by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructure” (United States Department of Defence (DoD), *The National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations*, December 2006,3). Therefore, cyberspace also includes all networked digital operations.\n² Pipyros et al. 2018, 371.\n³ Davis II et al. 2017, 1\n⁴ United States Senate 2017, 5.\n⁵ Owens, Dam, and Lin 2009, 27.\n⁶ By cyberattack, I refer to the definition applied by Oona Hathaway et al. as “any action taken to undermine the functions of a computer network for a political or national security purpose” (Hathaway et al. 2012, 826). This definition, however, differs from that used by the U.S. Cyber Command, which identifies cyberattacks as those “that cause physical damage to property or injury to persons.” (Ibid., 821 n.9). Hathaway et al.’s definition also differs from the one offered by the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, which describe cyberattack as “a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects” (Schmitt 2013, 92). It is important to bear in mind that both the Tallinn Manual and the Cyber Command definitions are under-inclusive, particularly considering the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack, which did not cause physical damage to property or persons, but involved the *domaine reservé* of the U.S., raising relevant national security concerns about democratic procedures and the violation of the prohibition of intervention. Hathaway et al.’s terminology, on the other hand, covers a broader set of cyberattacks, including attacks such as the DNC hack.\nIn addition, I use the term ‘cyberattack’ instead of ‘cyber warfare’ because the latter refers to a smaller subset of cyberattacks that “constitute armed attacks or that occur in the context of an ongoing armed conflict” (Hathaway et al. 2012, 821). By contrast, the term ‘cyberattack’ embraces a broad range of attacks, from cyber warfare to those attacks that fall short of armed conflict but still deserve some kind of sanction (Tran 2018, 380 n.13). Furthermore, Hathaway and her co-authors make a distinction between cyberattacks and cyberespionage; according to the they, “neither cyber-espionage nor cyber-exploitation constitutes a cyber-attack because these concepts do not involve altering computer networks in a way that affects their current or future ability to function” (Hathaway et al. 2012, 829).\n⁷ Schmitt and Watts 2016, 596.\nFollowing the relocation of a Soviet war memorial in 2007, Estonia was hit by a series of massive cyberattacks lasting three weeks⁸. Taking into consideration that the small Baltic country is one of the most wired societies in Europe⁹, the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks¹⁰ were particularly harmful, resulting in a temporary interruption of service on many government and commercial websites¹¹ and, thus, profoundly affecting the functioning of the country’s economy¹². Initially, the attacks were attributed to Russia due to the political atmosphere at the time, as well as past Russian actions. This explanation, however, was questioned by technical experts, and even NATO officials were disinclined to assign blame to the Russian government. Because of disagreements over the links between the attackers and Russia, what at first appeared to be a pretty obvious case of aggression became a gridlock. Although it is highly probable that the Russian state launched the cyberattack¹³, its involvement has never been proven. Yet, the attack continues to be an example of Russia’s cyber capabilities that following cyberattacks will be judged by¹⁴.\nIn hindsight, the Estonian attacks were “fairly mild and simple”, far less damaging than the cyberattacks that have followed¹⁵. Even so, they brought cyberspace to the forefront of international relations discussions, raising awareness among states about the severe risk posed by the growing dependence on ICTs, as well as the possibility of conflict in this new and unique environment. Indeed, during the last decade, the international community has witnessed and experienced a considerable number of problematic episodes in cyberspace – the cyber intrusion at Sony Pictures Entertainment¹⁶, the attack on France’s TV5Monde¹⁷, the Democratic National\n⁸ Traynor 2007.\n⁹ By 2007, 98% of Estonian territory was covered with Internet access, and mobile phone penetration was almost 100% (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010, 17).\n¹⁰ According to Clark and Landau, DDoS attack is a concerted malevolent effort in which a large number of machines from all over the Internet attack a site or a set of sites in order to disrupt service by overloading a server or a link (Clark and Landau 2011, 6).\n¹¹ Dinniss 2014, 38-39.\n¹² Supra note 8, at 25.\n¹³ Schulzke 2018, 960.\n¹⁴ Ibid. It is necessary to recognize that this situation poses a threat to international peace since, according to Gomez, the “adversary’s past behaviour may motivate a disproportionate response to pre-empt any further threats” (Gomez 2019, 1-2).\n¹⁵ Schmitt 2017, xxiii.\n¹⁶ On November 2014, Sony Pictures’ computers were broken into, and sensitive information from the film studio and unreleased movies were published online, disrupting the company business operations (Davis II et al. 2017, 42). Considering that Sony had produced the movie The Interview, which depicts the assassination of Kim Jong-Un, speculations about North Korean participation were raised (Egloff 2019, 10). Through a press statement, North Korea denied responsibility for the cyberattack, but praised the attackers for their actions. As of yet, no one was able to prove North Korean involvement and the evidence implicating it was considered “flimsy” (Zetter 2014b).\n¹⁷ In April 2015, the French-language television network had its computer infrastructure and social media accounts hacked. Initially, the group called Cyber Caliphate, an Islamic State affiliate, claimed responsibility for the\n7\nCommittee (DNC) hack¹⁸, to name a few. Almost each of them has illustrated the new international status that Lucas Kello calls “unpeace” – a “mid-spectrum rivalry lying below the physically destructive threshold of interstate violence, but whose harmful effects far surpass the tolerable level of peacetime competition”¹⁹.\nAgainst this background, at the 2016 Defence Ministerial Meeting, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) defence ministers officially recognized cyberspace as a new frontier of warfare²⁰, and that decision was endorsed at the 2016 Warsaw Summit²¹. Now, the Allies “recognize cyberspace as a domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea”²². Certainly, the change comes as a response to the increasing number of cyberattacks against both the organization and its member states. The threat posed by these attacks even prompted former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security to declare that cyberattacks “now exceed the risk of physical attacks” in terms of breadth and range of possible outcomes²³. And such attacks show no sign of decreasing, as the aforementioned examples demonstrate.\nAlthough the persistence of cyberattacks might be due, in part, to the relative availability and fairly low cost of the technology needed to mount an attack²⁴, it might also largely result from the difficulty in identifying its perpetrators and attributing blame²⁵. The structure of the Internet, which “was not designed with the goal of deterrence in mind”²⁶, provides the perfect setting for state and non-state actors to take part in malicious activity unafraid of attribution or retaliation²⁷. Worse still, aggressors are able to conceal themselves and the full effects of their operations by using technical mechanisms and/or relying on non-state proxies that they rent or compromise²⁸. For example, the cyberattacks that hit Estonia originated from at least 177\nattacks, but as the investigations began, it became clear that the jihadist group was just a cover-up (Corera 2016). The private company FireEye ultimately attributed the attack to Russian hackers.\n¹⁸ In 2015, in the middle of the presidential election, the DNC suffered a cyberattack, resulting in the exfiltration of files and emails, many of which were published by WikiLeaks. In 2016, the DNC publicly attributed the attack to two distinct Russian espionage groups, APT28 and APT29 (Egloff 2019, 13). Although it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to assess the full damage of the cyber intrusion, it is understood to have played a major role in the 58th U.S. presidential election (Davis II et al. 2017, 34).\n¹⁹ Allison 2018; Banks 2019, 191.\n²⁰ Barnes, 2016.\n²¹ Ablon et al. 2019, 1.\n²² NATO, Warsaw Summit Communiqué (July 2016), n.70.\n²³ Nielsen 2018.\n²⁴ Payne and Finlay 2017, 556; Boerbert 2010, 43.\n²⁵ Tran 2018, 381.\n²⁶ Supra note 10, at 1.\n²⁷ Supra note 24.\n²⁸ Carlin 2016, 409; Carr 2010, 139-40.\ncountries, including from within the Estonian territory²⁹. Evidence has been found that attackers also obscure their identities through the adoption of foreign languages and elements of malware previously associated with other actors³⁰, and they might even exploit existing animosities in order to mask their identity and thus hinder attribution efforts³¹. By way of one example, the escalating tension between Iran and the United States suggests that both countries would be unwilling to fully cooperate in the case of a cyberattack, making Iran the perfect cover-up for third-party states and non-state actors attempting to launch a cyberattack against the USA and vice versa. It is therefore understood that attributing cyberattacks is vastly time-consuming and an “inherently interdisciplinary”³² process, requiring great technical and non-technical expertise and input from a range of actors and sources³³. In this regard, taking into account the effort necessary for its fulfilment, cyber-attribution was considered to be “an art as much as a science”³⁴.\nThe Estonian attacks are a prime example of how challenging the attribution of cyberattacks can be; thirteen years have passed and one cannot affirm whether the attacks were officially sanctioned by the Russian government or whether they were perpetrated by rogue spies or even by independent nationalistic criminals³⁵. It is important to bear in mind that, in the cyber domain, attribution differs from punishment³⁶, and it is defined as “identifying the agent responsible for the action”³⁷. Since cyberattacks have proliferated and become commonplace, attribution has grown in relevance³⁸. As a result, states have been investing resources and political capital to develop accountable attribution mechanisms in order to deter potential cyberattackers.\nIn spite of the fact that determining the machines that launched a cyberattack is no longer an arduous task for the most developed countries, identifying the individuals, organizations, or governments that are legally responsible for the attack continues to be challenging³⁹. The attribution of cyberattacks presents unique legal challenges because states were not able to reach a broad international agreement on how to govern the cyber domain and the current\n²⁹ Payne and Finlay 2017, 560.\n³⁰ Supra note 12.\n³¹ Ibid; Payne and Finlay 2019, 203.\n³² Egloff and Wenger 2019, 3\n³³ Banks 2017, 1503.\n³⁴ Rid and Buchanan 2015, 7.\n³⁵ Supra note 12.\n³⁶ Lindsay 2015, 57.\n³⁷ Supra note 10.\n³⁸ Banks 2019, 191.\n³⁹ Supra note 38, at 192.\ninternational legal framework does little to control cyber operations⁴⁰. On this matter, Schmitt and Vihul believe that even if agreement were to be reached on a multilateral binding cyber treaty, it would probably be undermined by states’ individual reservations⁴¹. Similarly, according to Mačák, there seems to be a resistance to the codification of international rules applicable to cyberspace⁴².\nIn addition, as cyber operations usually happen in secrecy⁴³, customary international law is not able to develop understandings or recognize state practice about attributing responsibility for cyberattacks⁴⁴. Further complicating the issue, governments have been unwilling to clearly express *opinio juris* on topics associated with the cyber domain⁴⁵. This attitude might be the result of a domestic political deadlock, a calculated waiting strategy⁴⁶, or even the product of the “cybersecurity knowledge gap”⁴⁷. Nevertheless, this state reticence contributes to the enduring ambiguity of international cyber law⁴⁸. It is also important to point out that no international organization, agency, or entity has the legal authority to attribute responsibility for a cyberattack. Due to this institutional legal vacuum, seldom do governments make official attribution claims, and, in the rare occasion that they do, their statements are normally perceived\n⁴⁰ Supra note 25, at 384.\n⁴¹ Schmitt and Vihul 2016, 39. As codified in Article 2(d) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), reservation is “a unilateral statement, however phrased or named, made by a State, when signing, ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to a treaty, whereby it purports to exclude or to modify the legal effect of certain provisions of the treaty in their application to that State” (United Nations, *Vienna Convention on the law of treaties*, 23 May 1969, vol. 1155,1-18232, art. 2(d)).\nIt is perhaps useful to point out that some scholars have indicated that a successful agreement might be almost impossible to achieve, at least in the near future. For instance, Waxman believes that “not only do certain features of cyber-activities make international legal regulation very difficult, but major actors also have divergent strategic interests that will pull their preferred doctrinal interpretations and aspirations in different directions, impeding formations of a stable international consensus” (Waxman 2011, 425-26). On this point, Goldsmith argues that “the fundamental clash of interests concerning the regulation of electronic communications, the deep constrains the United States would have to adopt to receive reciprocal benefits in a cybersecurity treaty, and the debilitating verification problems will combine to make it unfeasible to create a cybersecurity treaty that purports to constrain governments”. (Goldsmith 2011, 12).\n⁴² Mačák 2017, 5.\n⁴³ Mačák 2016, 130. About the high classified nature of state practice in cyberspace, Clarke and Knake state that “the entire phenomenon of cyber war is shrouded in such government secrecy that it makes the Cold War look like a time of openness and transparency” (Clarke and Knake 2010, xi). Also, Efrony and Shany try to explain the absence of transparency in cyberspace; for them, states believe that transparency may reveal “their vulnerabilities, adversely affect their offensive or defensive capabilities, and weaken their power of deterrence” (Efrony and Shany 2018, 631).\n⁴⁴ Supra note 38, at 194.\n⁴⁵ Among the notable exceptions, the USA stands out with its International Strategy for Cyberspace (United States, The White House, *International Strategy for Cyberspace: Property, Security, and Openness in a Networked World*, May 2011).\n⁴⁶ Schmitt and Watts 2015, 211.\n⁴⁷ Singer and Friedman 2014, 4-8.\n⁴⁸ Supra note 43, at 130.\n10\nto be entirely political and shrouded in secrecy, which can raise questions about the veracity of the facts⁴⁹. The attribution problem⁵⁰, therefore, is critical because attribution is a, if not the, key prerequisite to any lawful response under public international law, including self-defence⁵¹. This creates a dangerous practical gap that both precludes state responsibility⁵² and encourages attackers by allowing them to strike with impunity⁵³. Indeed, without an operative legal regime, the cyber domain “is not so far from the lawless lacuna some hoped it would become”⁵⁴.\nAgainst this backdrop, scholars, cyber-experts, and international stakeholders have been attempting to bridge the gap with their views on how international law applies to cyberspace. These non-state-driven initiatives are trying to promote a safe international system and reduce the chances of conflict arising from cyberattacks by filling the void created by states’ reluctance to undertake the international law-making process⁵⁵. The most important and comprehensive of these attempts certainly is the Tallinn Manual project, which is under the auspices of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE). This project, however, is neither an international treaty on cyber law nor does it offer a new set of international rules nor represent the position of any country or organization⁵⁶. Rather, it is a restatement of international law as it is (lex lata)⁵⁷, establishing a comprehensive legal structure for the governance of cyber operations during both times of peace and conflict. Considering the Tallinn project’s non-state and non-binding nature, one is then left to question its actual relevance to public international law, which still is very much attached to state-centric assumptions and foundations of the early formative stage of the international legal regime.\nOn this basis, my main argument lies heavily on the idea that the current international legal framework is underdeveloped vis-à-vis cyber-attribution, as its norms and principles were designed to the physical world and still, at present, mainly govern the relationship between states. Cyberspace, on the other end of the spectrum, is predominantly inhabited by non-state\n⁴⁹ Supra note 2, at 19. It is interesting to highlight that attributing cyberattacks to states is a new phenomenon (Eichensehr 2019b ,7-8). For instance, the first official public accusation by the USA only came in 2014, when five Chinese military hackers were criminally charged for cyberespionage against U.S. corporations (The United States, Department of Justice, May 19 2014).\n⁵⁰ By attribution problem, I refer to the difficulty in discovering the identity or location of the responsible for a cyberattack or their intermediary.\n⁵¹ Supra note 25, at 384; Supra note 31, at 205.\n⁵² Supra note 32, at 1495.\n⁵³ Supra note 31, at 205.\n⁵⁴ Chircop 2018, 653.\n⁵⁵ Supra note 42, at 1.\n⁵⁶ Despite NATO’s sponsorship, the Tallinn Manuals do not reflect the official position of the Alliance.\n⁵⁷ Supra note 32, at 1494.\nactors⁵⁸ and, as Libicki aptly put it, is divided between the physical, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic layers⁵⁹. As it stands now, international law fails in coping with contemporary challenges posed by cyberspace and the rapid development of ICTs, notably the attribution of cyberattacks. As will be developed below, this practical gap not only hinders the cyber-attribution process, but also threatens international security on an equivalent scale to traditional armed attacks⁶⁰.\nAlthough literature on cybersecurity normally perceives the attribution problem as a technical issue, due to the significant technological advancements experienced in the last decade, attribution is already “more nuanced, more common, and more political”⁶¹ than it is acknowledged. It is therefore understood that the solution to this dangerous situation lies within the legal and political domains, not in the technical realm⁶². Non-state initiatives have been trying to overcome this legal quagmire, but the international legal system still is inherently attached to a state-centric approach. Therefore, no set of international binding rules as far as cybersecurity is concerned will ever likely be achieved without the participation of states.\nConsidering that so many aspects of our lives are now bound up with cyberspace, the discussion about cyber-attribution is not only pertinent but also urgent. Such a delicate situation deserves to be taken most seriously and it would be unduly ambitious to try to provide a full answer in this study. My purpose, however, is to make a modest attempt at shedding some light on the issue. Ideally, this may contribute to a constructive debate about the problem of attributing blame for cyberattacks.\nThe following research question was articulated in order to function as the backbone of the work here presented: to what extent is international law underdeveloped vis-à-vis cyber-attribution? Also, as a means to enlighten the path of this study, the following sub-questions were established: why does cyber-attribution matter? What are the legal and political challenges imposed by the attribution problem? How the difficulty in attributing blame of a cyberattack affects international security?\nIn order to carry out the aforementioned study, a qualitative research of a doctrinal nature will be applied. Mainly, this will be a legal work based on primary and secondary legal sources. Parallel to the legal background, this study will also endeavour to apply the International Relations’ concept of security dilemma to cyberspace. By bringing this concept to the\n⁵⁸ Supra note 42, at 14.\n⁵⁹ Libicki 2007, 236-37.\n⁶⁰ Supra note 54, at 652.\n⁶¹ Supra note 33, at 6.\n⁶² Eichensehr 2019b, 2.\n12\nstudy, I hope to achieve a better understanding of how the unconventional characteristics of the cyber domain can lead to misperceptions, fear, and conflict spirals. To that end, Chapter 2 provides a brief overview of the security dilemma concept, presenting its main characteristics. Chapter 3 reviews the problem of attribution, discussing its most oft-cited causes and explaining why this issue deserves attention from the international community. Also, it assesses how the difficulty in attributing blame for a cyberattack affects international security as a whole. Subsequently, Chapter 4 approaches the research question through the analysis of current international law, discussing grey areas, as well as international rules that are applicable to cyberspace. Moreover, it reviews leading non-state initiatives that have been contributing to the development of the international legal framework in the challenging domain of cyberspace, especially Microsoft's proposals and the Tallinn Manual project. In addition, Chapter 4 examines the value of soft law norms for the international legal framework, and briefly discuss the Antarctic and nuclear safety regimes as examples of the codification of nom-binding norms. Finally, Chapter 5 concludes by reflecting on the main ideas discussed throughout this study and opening the path for additional insights and hopefully avenues for further research.\n13\n# Chapter 2 – Realism and the Security Dilemma\nIn international relations theory, Realism, also known as political realism, is one of the dominants schools of thought⁶³. Realists depict an anarchical, competitive and conflictual world, in which insecurity among states is inescapable⁶⁴. Note that ‘anarchical’ is used here in a technical sense, indicating the dearth of an overarching, political authority at the international level. Under anarchy, states are the main actors in the international arena and their primary responsibility is to secure their own interests, especially their survival⁶⁵. In order to do so, according to the realist theory, states will attempt to acquire power and engage in power-balancing⁶⁶, creating what Hoffman called “a state of war”⁶⁷.\nThe interstate political order is, therefore, a self-help system plagued by “uncertainty, weapons and fear”⁶⁸, and in which power plays the leading role in shaping the relation between states⁶⁹. As long as we accept the basic premises of the realist theory, this hostile and insecure environment not only leaves little room for international cooperation⁷⁰, but also encourages “behaviour that leaves all concerned worse off than they could be, even in the extreme case in\n⁶³ This study will not differentiate Realism into its various strands since this warrant a more extended discussion that I can here give it. It is perhaps useful to point out, however, that realism is normally contrasted with liberalism or idealism, which tend to focus on international cooperation. Compared to these theories, the realist perspective is undeniably pessimistic. As Keohane put it, realism is “the language of power and interests rather than of ideals or norms” (Keohane 1986, 9).\n⁶⁴ Wheeler and Booth 2007, 2.\n⁶⁵ Waltz 1979, 91. Waltz points out that, “internationally, the environment of states’ actions, or the structure of their system, is set by the fact that some states prefer survival over other ends obtainable in the short run and act with relative efficiency to achieve that end” (Waltz, 1979, 93). On this topic, Jervis identifies throughout his book, entitled *Perception and Misperception in International Politics*, some states that did not have survival as their primary goal. For instance, During Hitler’s government, Germany valued territorial expansion over security (Jervis 2017).\n⁶⁶ According to Andersen, balance of power is “a mechanism that ideally would make states intentionally or unintentionally join the weaker part against the strong, to equal out or balance the distribution of power amongst states in the international system” and states “would do this to assure their own survival” (Andersen 2018, 1).\n⁶⁷ Hoffmann defines ‘state of war’ as “a competition of units in the kind of state of nature that knows no restrains other than those which the changing necessities of the game and the shallow convenience of the players impose” (Hoffmann 1965, vii).\n⁶⁸ *Supra note* 65.\n⁶⁹ Korab-Karpowicz 2017. It is important to note that Wendt argues, through the lenses of Constructivism, that “self-help and power politics are institutions, and not essential features of anarchy. Anarchy is what states make of it” (Wendt 1992, 395).\n⁷⁰ Waltz points out two reasons why international cooperation is limited by anarchy: insecurity and unequal gains. In an anarchic international system, states are not certain about each other’s intentions and they fear that cooperation might favour one state in detriment of the others, creating some kind of dependence. He argues that “[s]tates do not willingly place themselves in situations of increased dependence. In a self-help system, considerations of security subordinate economic gain to political interest” (*Supra note* 66, at 107).\n14\nwhich all states would like to freeze the status quo”⁷¹. To put it differently, the uncertainties inherent in an anarchic world cause states to feel insecure, leading to counterproductive policies and suboptimal results, such as security dilemmas, crises, or even wars⁷². As Schweller explained, “insecurity and the use of force are enduring attributes of the self-help international system”⁷³.\n## 2.1 What is the security dilemma?\nAccording to Wheeler and Booth, the security dilemma is the quintessential dilemma in interstate politics⁷⁴. Coined by Herz (1950) and Butterfield (1951), the term has since become an integral part of any discourse on international security and has been expanded and employed to “address many of the most important questions of international relations theory and security policy”⁷⁵. Both authors describe the security dilemma as a situation where the increase of a state’s security simultaneously (and unintentionally) decreases the security of other states⁷⁶. The risk here is that misperceptions and conflict spirals dramatically increase the chances of unnecessary or avoidable armed conflicts.\nFor instance, a state might attempt to increase its own security and avert aggression by acquiring more weapons, bringing them to a higher state of readiness, or creating alliances. Under anarchy, an adversarial state will get the wrong impression about this behaviour, interpreting it as a preparatory action for future attacks. This state will thus fell threatened and will take action to enhance its own security. The first state will have confirmed its suspicions about its adversary’s belligerence, increasing tension and leading to an arms race or even war. In this scenario, conflict is not the product of the actual intentions and military capabilities of a specific actor. Rather, it is the result of mutual misperceptions and miscommunications that arise from the inability of states to understand each other’s intentions and motives with complete\n⁷¹ Jervis 1978, 167.\n⁷² Carlsnaes et al. 2002, 372; Montgomery 2006, 183.\n⁷³ Schweller 1996, 116. Note that, according to Mearsheimer, “the best way for a state to survive in anarchy is to take advantage of other states and gain power at their expenses” (Mearsheimer 2001, 36).\n⁷⁴ Supra note 65, at 29.\n⁷⁵ Glaser 1997, 172.\n⁷⁶ Jervis describes the security dilemma as a situation where “many of the means by which a state tries to increase its security decreases the security of others” (Supra note 71, at 169-70). Likewise, Glaser explains that the security dilemma exists when a “state’s effort to increase its security would have the unintended effect of reducing its adversary’s security” (Glaser 2010, 56). Montgomery, on the other hand, sees the security dilemma as primarily an issue of perception; he describes it as “the situation where one state’s attempt to increase its security appear threatening to others and provoke an unnecessary conflict” (Montgomery 2006, 151).\nconfidence⁷⁷. In this sense, as Herz points out, “it is one of the tragic implications of the security dilemma that mutual fear of what initially may never have existed may subsequently bring about what is feared the most”⁷⁸. Note that this is a “fertile version” of the philosophical problem of Other Minds, that is, “how one mind can ever know what is in the mind of another”⁷⁹.\nThe difficulty in correctly perceiving other’s intentions is related to the fact that many of the methods by which a state attempts to enhance its security will certainly make other states feel less secure. Jervis notes that, at the domestic level, individuals can attempt to increase their safety in several ways without jeopardizing others; one can, for instance, put bars on the windows, move to a safer area, and avoid dark streets⁸⁰. At the international level, however, “one state’s gain in security often inadvertently threatens others”⁸¹. The Cold War is a prime example of this. Both the United States’ and the Soviet Union’s efforts to increase their security had the unintended consequence of decreasing the security of the other superpower⁸², leading to a spiral in which they accumulate more military capabilities without making themselves more secure⁸³.\nOn top of this, there is what Wheeler and Booth described as the “inherent ambiguity of weapons”⁸⁴. Since most weapons can be used for both defensive and offensive purposes, it is incredibly difficult for decision-makers to foresee with certainty when and how arms may be used by other states. On this topic, Jervis asserts that “[u]nless the requirement for offense and defence differ in kind or amount, a status quo power will desire a military posture that resembles that of an aggressor. For this reason, others cannot infer from its military forces and preparations whether the state is aggressive”⁸⁵. Armament, therefore, is the material reality that initiates the security dilemma⁸⁶.\n⁷⁷ Gunitskiy 2011, 595; Supra note 65, at 4. Mearsheimer argues that governments can never be sure of the intentions of other states and that “intentions are impossible to divine with 100 percent certainty”. He also highlights that “intentions can change quickly, so a state’s intentions can be benign one day and hostile the next. Uncertainty about intentions is unavoidable, which means that states can never be sure that other states do not have offensive intentions to go along with their offensive capabilities” (Supra note 74, 2001, at 31).\n⁷⁸ Herz 1959, 241.\n⁷⁹ Hollis and Smith 1990, 171-172.\n⁸⁰ Supra note 71, at 169-70.\n⁸¹ Ibid.\n⁸² Jervis 2017, xiii-xiv.\n⁸³ Tang 2009, 594. On this topic, Libicki explains that “[d]uring the Cold War, when deterrence was the only feasible response to threat posed by the other side’s nuclear weapons, any attempt to build more weapons of bring them to a higher state of readiness [...] would alarm the other side who would feel impelled to do likewise” (Libicki 2016, 129).\n⁸⁴ Supra note 65, at 4.\n⁸⁵ Supra note 83, at 64. Therefore, even benign, security-seeking actors can be dragged into an arms race.\n⁸⁶ Supra note 65, at 1.\n16\nBefore proceeding, a few points still need to be considered and further clarified vis-à-vis the security dilemma concept. First, arms race is the most distinct expression of the vicious circle of the dilemma, but it is not the only one. For instance, the competition among imperialist powers for colonies in the late nineteenth and at the beginning of the twentieth centuries is considered to have been fuelled by a security dilemma⁸⁷. Second, the security dilemma will never be real, it will always be apparent⁸⁸. The dilemma can only exist if both states have benign motives; if, however, one state (or even both of them) has malign intentions, thus the situation cannot be described as a security dilemma, but as a security problem⁸⁹. As Schweller aptly put it, “[i]f states are arming for something other than security; that is, if aggressors do in fact exist, then it is no longer a security dilemma”⁹⁰. Finally, according to Wheeler and Booth, the security dilemma can be mitigated via the development of international institutions and legal regimes⁹¹. Insecurity, however, cannot be completely eliminated.\nCertainly, Herz’s and Butterfield’s original formulations of the security dilemma were an interesting development from the realist school of thought⁹². In its classical form, however, the concept may be of limited use in analysing the modern international system, which has a well-establish legal framework regulating the use of force, and in which most states are no longer threatened whether by war or external aggression⁹³. But this does not mean that the security dilemma is irrelevant or even obsolete for international security studies. On the contrary, it remains an extremely important tool for both policymakers and scholars since it can and has been reconceptualized to address modern challenges, including cyber-security ones.\n⁸⁷ Supra note 83, at 66.\n⁸⁸ Supra note 74, at 117.\n⁸⁹ Supra note 75, at 31. “If the threat posed by one state to another [...] is accurately perceived [...] then the situation cannot be classified as a security ‘dilemma’. It is simply a security ‘problem’, albeit perhaps a difficult one”.\n⁹⁰ Supra note 74, at 117. This argument generates an obvious puzzle, however: how can one know if threats are real or just apparent?\n⁹¹ Supra note 65.\n⁹² Note that realism is hardly the only school of thought to use the concept. The security dilemma has been broadly employed by liberals (see Doyle 1983; Oneal and Russett 1999; Cederman 2001), neoliberals (see Axelrod and Keohane 1985), constructivists (see Wendt 1995), to name a few.\n⁹³ Bluth 2011, 1375.\n# Chapter 3 – The Attribution Problem\nOne threshold issue in discussing cyber-attribution involves the definition of attribution itself, a question that certainly pervades all literature about this topic. At the most general level, ‘attribution’ refers to the identification of the responsible entity for a malicious cyberattack⁹⁴. What is understood by ‘responsible entity’, however, can vary. There are usually three types of answers: the specific computing device used to carry out an attack, the individual pressing the keys that launch an attack, and ultimately the party that supervised and controlled the attack⁹⁵. According to Lin, even though “these three types of attribution are conceptually distinct, they are often related in practice”⁹⁶. Particularly, identifying the machine from which an attack was launched might provide some clues that can assist unveil the human attacker’s identity, which in turn can help determine the individual or entity responsible for authorizing or acquiescing the cyber operation. Still, each of these types offer different challenges, increasing the difficulty of the attribution process.\nAlthough attributing cyberattacks is not a new challenge⁹⁷, the attribution debate is developing “surprisingly slowly”⁹⁸. Scholars and experts have been dwelling upon the subject and hold a full spectrum of views on it. At the positive end of the spectrum are those, like Rid and Buchanan, who argue that cyber-attribution is not only possible, but “it has been happening successfully for a long time”⁹⁹. Lindsay strikes a more restrained yet positive note, by characterizing attribution as difficult, but acknowledging that there are strong systems for identifying the source of intrusions and responding to attacks, with an increasingly amount of investments being devoted to investigations¹⁰⁰. At the other end of the spectrum, Singer and Friedman characterize attribution as “[p]erhaps the most difficult problem” in cyberspace¹⁰¹, and Eun and Aßmann argue that “determining the real aggressor is impossible unless the aggressor admits to it”¹⁰². Shackelford further echoes this idea by affirming that sophisticated cyberattacks are “nearly impossible to trace to their sources”¹⁰³.\n---\n⁹⁴ Ibid., 5.\n⁹⁵ Lin 2016, 5.\n⁹⁶ Ibid., 13.\n⁹⁷ Supra note 12, at 955.\n⁹⁸ Supra note 33, at 5.\n⁹⁹ Ibid., 31.\n¹⁰⁰ Supra note 36.\n¹⁰¹ Supra note 48, at 73.\n¹⁰² Eun and Aßmann 2016, 355.\n¹⁰³ Shackelford 2010, 200. Brecher share the same idea that cyberattacks “can be nearly impossible to attribute definitively to their sources” (Brecher 2012, 423).\n3.1 Why is attribution so difficult?\nThere are a number of answers to this question. First, many academics and experts suggest that the difficulty in attributing blame for cyberattacks is mainly due to the intrinsic characteristics of the cyber domain¹⁰⁴. The structural anonymity, which has been one of the hallmarks and biggest strengths of the Internet, provides the perfect venue for state and non-state actors to undertake malicious operations without fearing attribution or retaliation. The Internet, as Lindsay points out, “was designed to make connections easy and reliable even when the true identity of the connector and the path of the connection were unknown; security did not figure strongly in its early design”¹⁰⁵. Lupovici, however, seems to disagree on the premise that cyberspace is an inherently anonymous domain. Even though he recognizes that some aspects of the Internet make harder to attribute an attack, he argues that anonymity is a socially attributed trait and, therefore, cyberspace could be structured in a way that does not uphold this characteristic¹⁰⁶. Along this line of thinking, McConnell suggests that the only solution for the attribution problem is redesigning the Internet so that attribution and geolocation are more feasible¹⁰⁷. Such a change, however, would be a massive undertaking and probably would not help to prevent the increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks that are being launched today¹⁰⁸. At the same time, reengineering the entire computer network would reduce its efficiency and dependability, and would bring into question characteristics of the current Internet, such as freedom of action and privacy, that are treasured by many, including intelligence agencies¹⁰⁹.\nSecond, cyber-attribution is further complicated by the fact that hackers have at their disposal a variety of programs, techniques and applications to conceal the identity of their own Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and thus to thwart detection. One common practice that attackers employ to hide their online trail is to break into poorly secured internet servers or even personal computers and use them as proxies through which they can launch a cyberattack¹¹⁰.\n¹⁰⁴ Lupovic 2016, 322; Supra note 25, at 387.\n¹⁰⁵ Lindsay 2013, 375-76.\n¹⁰⁶ Supra note 74, at 330. Lupovici further argues that the current assumption that anonymity is inherent to the cyber domain might affect states’ policies. “Defenders, discouraged from relying on cyber deterrence, may refuse to invest in efforts to establish it. This will decrease the efficiency of cyber deterrence and, as a result, reinforce the existing common knowledge that this strategy is doomed to fail”. (Supra note 104, at 331).\n¹⁰⁷ McConnell 2010.\n¹⁰⁸ Supra note 10, at 3. For instance, Rid argues that McConnell suggestion “is not only unrealistic, it would not even solve the problem at hand” (Rid 2013, 140-41). For Tran, “even if the Internet could arduously be redesigned to authenticate the source IP address of every bit of data sent over the Internet, these addresses would accomplish the goal of merely identifying the source machine of an attack, and not a person, thereby creating another degree of attenuation between an attack and the attacker” (Tran 2018, 390).\n¹⁰⁹ Ibid.\n¹¹⁰ Greenemeier 2011.\n\"The IP address therefore does not present the attacked state with a physical location to blame or even attack in response. The discovered server could be located in a neutral, friendly or even your own country\"¹¹¹. According to Lipson, \"an IP address is a poor surrogate on which to establish a basis for trustworthiness\"¹¹². The cyberattacks that hit Estonia, for instance, originated from at least 177 countries, such as the United States, Russia, Peru, Egypt, and Estonian itself¹¹³. As Brenner effectively observed, \"the Internet is one big masquerade ball. You can hide behind aliases, you can hide behind proxy servers, and you can surreptitiously enslave other computers without their owners' knowledge – and then use their computers to do your dirty work\"¹¹⁴. Another prime example of a technology available to obfuscate one's traces in cyberspace is the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) Marble Framework, which is capable of altering the language of the code from English to another foreign language, such as Chinese, Russian, Korean, Arabic and Farsi¹¹⁵.\nIn this regard, Dinstein argues that future technological improvements will probably overcome the challenges that prevent cyber-attribution¹¹⁶. Indeed, governments are more capable of attributing responsibility for cyberattacks than they were a decade ago, and these technological advancements and innovations have boosted states' confidence¹¹⁷. For example, in 2014, Canada indicated to possess robust systems in place that allow the detection of highly sophisticated attacks, even those launched by state-sponsored actors¹¹⁸ and, in 2015, the United Kingdom's Chancellor affirmed that \"we are increasingly confident in our ability to determine from where attacks come\"¹¹⁹. It is important to bear in mind, however, that the technical realm is so \"dynamic\" that new technologies both enhance and hinder states' ability to attribute malicious attacks¹²⁰, generating \"a cycle of escalating offensive and defensive capabilities\"¹²¹.\nThird, even if it is possible to overcome all the technological issues mentioned above and identify the machine used to carry out a cyberoperation with sufficient certainty, cyber-\n¹¹¹ Supra note 102.\n¹¹² Lipson 2002, 56.\n¹¹³ Roscini 2010, 97; Supra note 28.\n¹¹⁴ Brenner 2011, 13.\n¹¹⁵ Mueller et al. 2019, 110; Leyden 2017.\n¹¹⁶ Dinstein 2002, 112. Similarly, Roscini argues that \"further developments in computer technology and Internet regulations might also make it easier to identify the source of the cyberattack\" (Roscini 2010, 97)\n¹¹⁷ Supra note 42, at 23\n¹¹⁸ Canada, Statement by the Chief Information Officer for the Government of Canada (July 29, 2014).\n¹¹⁹ United Kingdom, Chancellor's speech to GCHQ on cybersecurity (November 17, 2015).\n¹²⁰ Supra note 33, 1510.\n¹²¹ The improvements in technical attribution might be matched over time by developments in attackers' abilities to conceal their identities, and this \"cat-and-mouse game\" will continue to cyber-attribution difficult. Supra note 93, at 9.\nattribution remains challenging due to what has been called the “human machine gap”¹²² or “entry-point anonymity”¹²³. That is to say, attribution can only be accomplished if the individual or organization who was operating the computing device can also be identified. With this in mind, it should be noted that rarely does the location of a computer provide precise conclusions vis-à-vis the machine operator’s identity¹²⁴. Therefore, knowing that a cyberattack was executed on the territory of a state, or from the governmental cyber framework of a state, is not enough to attribute said attack to that state¹²⁵.\nFourth, it may be quite difficult to determine the ultimately responsible entity as far as state responsibility is concerned. Even if it is possible to overcome all the technological challenges and identify the human attacker, there remains the question of whether or not there is a relationship between the individual pressing the keys and the state actor. Is the attacker an officially sanctioned government agent? Or is it a third party operating on their own? Deibert, Rohozinski, and Crete-Nishihata acknowledge that there is an increasing tendency towards privateering cyberattacks, and states are particularly interested in this market since it “allows them to execute their missions once removed and clandestinely, thus offering plausible deniability and avoiding responsibilities under international law or the laws of armed conflict”¹²⁶.\nMoving to the legal aspect of attribution, a state will only be held responsible for an internationally wrongful action that is attributable to the state under public international law or that constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the state¹²⁷. On this point, it is important to note that, traditionally, there has been an extremely high bar for establishing state responsibility for acts of non-state actors¹²⁸. Drawing from the International Law Commission’s (ILC) Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, a state can be held liable for the conduct of a non-state actor if the latter is “acting on the instruction of, or under the direction or control of” the state¹²⁹. Note that, sadly, the concepts of ‘instructions’,\n¹²² Geiß and Lahmann 2009, 625\n¹²³ Supra note 111.\n¹²⁴ Supra note 120.\n¹²⁵ Supra note 55, at 646.\n¹²⁶ Deibert, Rohozinski, and Crete-Nishihata 2012, 17.\n¹²⁷ International Law Commission, Draft Articles of Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, November 2001, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), art. 2. It is important to note that the ILC’s rules are not a treaty and therefore they are not binding on any state. Yet, these rules were commended by the UN General Assembly in 2012 (UN Doc. A/RES/56/83) and have been mentioned 154 times by international courts, tribunals, and other bodies. (United Nations Legislative Series, Materials on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, 2012, ST/LEG/SER.B/25, viii).\n¹²⁸ Supra note 31, at 204.\n¹²⁹ Ibid., art. 8.\n'direct', and 'control' all need further explanation¹³⁰. According to the commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility, 'instruction' comprises private individuals or groups acting as an auxiliary of the state¹³¹. More problematic issues, however, arise in determining the concepts of 'direction' and 'control', for the commentary falls short and does not explain the difference between both of them. Rather, it only says that the terms are \"disjunctive\"¹³². International tribunals have also failed to make a distinction between the three concepts with any level of detail. Therefore, as Schmitt put it, \"the prevailing approach tends towards a binary distinction in which either a state tells a non-state actor to perform an act (instruction or direction) or the state exercises 'effective control' over the non-state actor with respect to the act in question\"¹³³.\nThe effective control test was coined by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in its Nicaragua v. United States of America judgement¹³⁴. Even though the Court does not provide a definition for the expression, it has asserted that a state's participation in the form of \"financing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping\" the non-state actor does not rise to the degree of effective control¹³⁵. In this sense, for example, supplying malware to a terrorist group would not result in state responsibility. In fact, even if the state plans the whole operation and selects the military targets, it still would not be enough to result in attribution¹³⁶. Furthermore, taking into considerations the technical challenges aforementioned, determining that a hacker was under the effective control of a nation-state at relevant time is probably impossible¹³⁷. For instance, the 2007 cyberattacks targeting Estonia were partially attributed to the pro-Kremlin youth group Nashi, but it is not clear whether Russia was involved in the incident¹³⁸.\nIn Prosecutor v. Tadic, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) lowered the threshold by adopting the much less restrictive overall control test, which\n¹³⁰ Schmitt 2017b, 9.\n¹³¹ International Law Commission, Draft Article of Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with Commentaries, November 2001, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), art. 8, para. 2.\n¹³² Ibid., para. 7.\n¹³³ Supra note 99.\n¹³⁴ International Court of Justice, Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

On this topic, Schmitt and Vihul note that care should be taken when assuming state sponsorship of non-state cyberoperations because non-state actors can launch cyberattacks at a \"fairly low cost and without access to the technical wherewithal of states\" (Schmitt and Vihul 2014, 56).\n22\napplies to an “organized and hierarchically structured group”¹³⁹. In light of the latter, the overall control test seems inappropriate for cyberspace, where the activity is more decentralized and rarely follows a hierarchical form. According to the ICJ in *Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Servia and Montenegro*, the “overall control test is unsuitable, for it stretches too far, almost to breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State’s organs and its international responsibility”¹⁴⁰. One then is left to question the legal validity of this test.\nRegardless of whether effective control or overall control ultimately suits the cyber domain, the attribution bar continues to be extremely high. As a result, states are prevented from adopting any lawful response to a cyberattack, including their inherent right to self-defence, encouraging retaliatory operations outside the existing legal structure¹⁴¹. Against this background, some scholars have suggested that one possible solution to these legal challenges is to lower the attribution standard. Schmitt, for instance, defended an indirect responsibility approach by which a state might be held responsible for the consequences of non-state actors’ unlawful operations on its territory “when it fails to take reasonably available measures to stop such acts in breach of its obligations to other states”¹⁴². Lowering the attribution bar, however, increases the chances of misattribution and conflict escalation.\nFifth, another factor that contributes to the difficulty of attributing cyberattacks is the presence of dynamic and sophisticated non-state actors. Traditionally, states and non-state actors were distinguished by significant imbalances not only in legal status, but also in resources and capabilities. The cyber domain, however, seems to offer great opportunities for non-state actors to challenge and, in some situations, to overcome states’ hegemony¹⁴³. Indeed, today these entities need as much or more attention than other international player due to their ability to profoundly disturb international peace and security. Nevertheless, these actors “enjoy a relative degree of impunity” for the harmful effects of their actions¹⁴⁴ since international law does not offer a tailored framework based on which non-state actors can be held responsible for unlawful acts¹⁴⁵. In this sense, an adequate legal response to the attribution problem should\n¹³⁹ United Nations, International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, *Prosecutor v.

The investigation of cyberattacks is a complex process that requires detailed analysis of technical data, as well as a deep comprehension of political and economic motivations$^{147}$. Consequently, as Sheldon points out, “the forensics of attribution can rarely, if ever, give immediate results and can take days if not weeks to provide solid technical evidence”$^{148}$. Further, former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defence William Lynn III recognized the struggle to attribute cyberattacks, observing that “[t]he forensic work necessary to identify an attacker may take months, if identification is possible at all”$^{149}$. Cyber-attribution, however, is nearly useless if it takes too long and is not able to identify all the actors involved in the attack$^{150}$.\nThese are the numerous hurdles, both technological and legal, that have been oft-mentioned as a hindrance to the development of an effective legal framework for governing cyberattacks$^{151}$. In spite of the fact that previous literature on cybersecurity perceived the attribution problem as an insurmountable technical issue, recent scholars and experts have begun to acknowledge that actual attribution might not be rocket science after all$^{152}$. As Carlin aptly put it, “although attribution is difficult, it is far from impossible”$^{153}$.\n## 3.2 Why does cyber-attribution matter?\nConsidering the number of obstacles that significantly limit cyber-attribution, one is then left to question whether or not the matter is worth international society’s attention. What are the purposes of attributing blame for a cyberattack? Why should states and international stakeholders endeavour to solve the attribution problem?\n$^{146}$ Supra note 13, at 956.\n$^{147}$ Supra note 3, at 2.\n$^{148}$ Sheldon 2014, 289-90\n$^{149}$ Lynn III 2010, 99.\n$^{150}$ Carlin 2016, 409. The duration of the investigation is relevant for cyber-attribution because if a targeted state takes too long to respond, any countermeasures adopted may be seen as punishment, forbidden under public international law. On the other hand, if a targeted state engages in countermeasures too early and has wrongfully attributed the cyberattack, it will have committed an internationally wrongful act itself.\n$^{151}$ According to Shackelford, “the international law doctrine of attribution is in fact an essential ground for regulating cyberattacks” (Shackelford 2008, 233).\n$^{152}$ “Actual attribution of cyber events is already more nuanced, more common, and more political than the literature has acknowledged so far” (Supra note 62).\n$^{153}$ Supra note 119.\nTo start with, cyber-attribution function goes well beyond the mere identification of the responsible entity for a malicious cyberattack; it also serves as a legitimizing tool to justify both formal and informal sanctioning behaviour to other international actors¹⁵⁴. According to Article 22 of the ILC’s Draft Articles on State Responsibility, a state that has been the target of an internationally wrongful act may adopt countermeasures¹⁵⁵ – actions that would otherwise be unlawful¹⁵⁶. In order to do so, the victim state must identify the state actor which is responsible for the internationally wrongful act¹⁵⁷. Eichensehr argues that “[s]uch an attribution could be done privately, but if so, the victim state would risk other states viewing its countermeasures as an initial wrongful act, rather than a lawful response”¹⁵⁸. Tran adds to the discussion by explaining that even in situations where formal law is not the answer, states would still be required to attribute responsibility in order to implement any informal method of sanctioning the attacker¹⁵⁹. Thus, attribution is a crucial and necessary prerequisite to any further legal action, be it countermeasures, diplomatic responses or any other informal kind of response. Consequently, it is not unreasonable to assume that solving the attribution problem is the pivotal first step to establish any functioning system of law that regulates cyberattacks.\nAdditionally, publicly attributing the blame for a cyberattack, and consequently sharing specific aspects of it, may help network defenders identify possible vulnerabilities in the system and, thus, prevent future attacks¹⁶⁰. It is often cited that, in some cases, attribution may also lead to macro-level deterrence. By identifying the culprits of a cyberattack, states are able to publicly name and shame them. Potentially, this practice will cause the named actor, and even third parties, to refrain from future operations¹⁶¹. For instance, in 2014, the USA criminally charged five Chinese military hackers for cyberespionage against U.S. corporations and “[f]or a period of time following the indictments, there was a very significant decrease” in Chinese\n¹⁵⁴ Supra note 25, 386.\n¹⁵⁵ “The wrongfulness of an act of a State not in conformity with an international obligation towards another State is precluded if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State” (Supra note 96, art. 22).\n¹⁵⁶ According to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, “countermeasures are actions or omissions by an injured State directed against a responsible State that would violate an obligation owed by the former to the latter” (Supra note 15, 111, rule 20 (1)). Note that countermeasures cannot be taken by non-state actors since they are reserved to states. Similarly, such measures cannot be taken against non-state actors, except when their (cyber) actions are attributable to a state actor. “This is because only states commit, as a matter of law, internationally wrongful acts” (Supra note 7, at 606). Also, Banks argues that countermeasures were created to compel a state to desist in its unlawful actions, not as punishment (Supra note 33, at 1502).\n¹⁵⁷ Supra note 96, art. 49.\n¹⁵⁸ Supra note 63, at 29.\n¹⁵⁹ Supra note 25, at 383-84.\n¹⁶⁰ Supra note 3, at 3.\n¹⁶¹ Supra note 63, at 25\ncyberactivity¹⁶². Furthermore, publicly attributing responsibility for cyberattacks might create micro-level deterrence, which is related with the adoption of domestic legal procedures and economic sanctions¹⁶³. According to Goldsmith and Williams, the costs of these measures “are not nothing; would-be state-sponsored cyber-intruders and their principals surely take them into account”¹⁶⁴. Micro-level deterrence, therefore, could be more successful than its macro-level counterpart¹⁶⁵. According to Finnemore and Hollis, publicly attributing cyberattacks promote “interactions between the accuser, the accused, and third-party audiences that – over time – may result in the creation of a new norm”¹⁶⁶. Note, however, that public attribution alone may not be sufficient to deter malicious cyberactivity or produce cyber accountability, particularly if the responsible actor does not care if his/her identity and behaviour are made public.\nFrom an international relations perspective, states and international stakeholders should care about the attribution problem due to its capacity to deteriorate the international political environment. As noted earlier, attributing blame for a cyberattack is no easy task and thus the chances of a malicious cyber operation being framed wrongfully is extremely high. Indeed, misattribution is substantially more likely vis-à-vis cyberattacks than traditional kinetic warfare¹⁶⁷. With this in mind, one should be cognizant that there is a tendency to explain malicious cyber incidents in terms of geopolitical conditions and existing rivalries¹⁶⁸, particularly soon after a cyberattack when there is a haste to identify the culprits, to strengthen defences and to retaliate. The 2007 Estonian cyberattack provides one of the clearest examples of this tendency. Due to past Russian actions and the political atmosphere at the time, the attack was attributed to Russia and this explanation was later questioned by cyber experts. A yet more recently example is the 2015 Ukraine power grid cyberattack. Ukraine’s intelligence community was quick to blame Russia for the attack because it was perceived as an escalation of the conflict\n¹⁶² Nakashima 2015.\n¹⁶³ To build upon the previous example, in addition to the criminal charges, the Chinese hackers cannot travel to the United States or other country with which it has extradition treaty; if they do, they could be extradited to the USA and face trial. Nor can they engage in financial transactions that touches the U.S. or other sanctioning state financial system.\n¹⁶⁴ Goldsmith and Williams 2018.\n¹⁶⁵ Nevertheless, Eichensehr explains that the effectiveness of micro-level deterrence might vary according to the nationality of the hackers (“losing the ability to travel or to store money in Western Europe may be less of a blow to North Korean hackers than to Russians”), and depends on the level of coercion to which the cyber-attackers are subject (“[i]f their actions on behalf of their government are not voluntary, then the hackers will not alter their behaviour in response”) (Supra note 63, at 27).\n¹⁶⁶ Finnemore and Hollis 2019, 10-11.\n¹⁶⁷ Supra note 29, at 556\n¹⁶⁸ Supra note 13, at 960. Besides heightening the risk of misattribution, this tendency to blame the most obvious culprits prevents alternative explanations from being developed, as well as invites lesser rivals or non-state actors to provoke hostilities. Schulzke argues that “[a]s the risk of being caught diminishes, the costs of attack decrease and the potential benefits become even more attractive” (Supra note 13, at 961).\n26\nbetween both countries¹⁶⁹. However, no proof was ever offered to support this allegation and it is believed that the power grid system had been compromised before the hostilities. Had Ukraine adopted any retaliatory measures, the tension would have heightened and the conflict could have spilt out of the cyber domain and into the physical world.\nIt is perhaps useful to underline that the most active participants in the cyber domain are also some of the world’s most powerful states, to wit: The United States, Russia and China. Taking into account that each of these states are equipped with a nuclear armoury, misattributing a cyberattacks could trigger off destructive conflicts with potential to threat the whole international system, putting a premium on a confident degree of cyber-attribution¹⁷⁰. On top of this, the relative availability and fairly low cost of the technology necessary to launch an attack¹⁷¹ in cyberspace “leaves the potential for mass destruction within the grasp of far less sophisticated non-state actors and organizations”¹⁷². So, it does not take much imagination to see the potential threats an unregulated cyber domain pose to international security, economy and also to states’ infrastructure.\nIn this regard, inspired by great theorists such as Thomas Schelling, Robert Jervis, and John Herz, among others, Buchanan took the basic foundation of the security dilemma theory and employed it to cyberspace. A ‘cybersecurity dilemma’ is said to exist when one country cannot increase the security of its digital infrastructure, either through the creation of offensive cyber capabilities, without decreasing other’s cybersecurity. According to Buchanan, the cybersecurity dilemma can be potentially more dangerous and escalatory than traditional kinetic conflicts because, in cyber domain, there is a “perception of offense-dominance”¹⁷³, making defensive measures to be perceived as offensive and threatening. With this in mind, cyberspace appears to be the perfect environment for the security dilemma to thrive. The lack of clarity vis-à-vis the intentions and capabilities of cyber warfare, therefore, have the potential to undermine trust¹⁷⁴, rise escalation fears, provoke an arms race or even an international armed conflict¹⁷⁵. “As cyberoperations become more potent and computer networks grow still more important, the dilemma’s dangers – already real – will only grow”¹⁷⁶.\n¹⁶⁹ Zetter 2016.\n¹⁷⁰ Supra note 39, at 192.\n¹⁷¹ Supra note 107, at 55.\n¹⁷² Payne 2016, 684-85.\n¹⁷³ Buchanan 2017, 108-09.\n¹⁷⁴ Ibid., 191.\n¹⁷⁵ Jinghua 2019.\n¹⁷⁶ Ibid., 194.\nIt is well settled that cyberspace is a phenomenon of international relevance. As a result, the uses and abuses of this borderless virtual domain encroach on states concerns in the physical world, such as national security, economic development and public order and safety. Cybersecurity, like other global challenges faced by the existing international community, extends far beyond the domain of a single state and, therefore, cannot be appropriately addressed by any single international actor, regardless of how influential it might be. Given the increasing costs of insecurity and uncertainty associated with an unregulated cyberspace, international actors may soon come to realize the necessity of an international legal framework capable of addressing cyberattacks.\n28\n# Chapter 4 – International Law and Cybersecurity\nIn spite of the fact that the principal building blocks of the World Wide Web were laid more than two decades ago, the community of states was not able to reach a broad international agreement on how to govern the cyber domain. In fact, some scholars even suggest that cyberspace seems “resistant to codification of the applicable rules in a comprehensive multilateral binding treaty”¹⁷⁷. Note, however, that the dearth of cyber-specific regulations is not for lack of trying by major international actors. Already in 1996, the French government pushed for the creation of the Charter for International Cooperation on the Internet, which would be “an accord comparable to the international law of the sea”¹⁷⁸. The proposal, however, was met with apathy by other international stakeholders.\nAfterwards, in January 2002, the UN General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to settle a group of governmental experts to conduct a study on “relevant international concepts aimed at strengthening the security of global information and telecommunications systems”¹⁷⁹. The United Nations’ Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications thus became the leading state-based initiative for the codification of international law vis-à-vis the cyber domain¹⁸⁰, but its success was limited. Between 2004 and 2015, the GGE submitted three reports which expressed the unanimous opinion of the state-participants¹⁸¹.\nThe 2010 report was welcomed with great enthusiasm by the international community even though it brought an array of “very rudimentary findings and recommendations”¹⁸² and did not present much legal clarity. However, it highlighted that state actors are developing ICTs\n---\n¹⁷⁷ Supra note 43.\n¹⁷⁸ Wu 1997, 660.\n¹⁷⁹ United Nations General Assembly, Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security, A/RES/56/19, 7 January 2002.\n¹⁸⁰ Supra note 55, at 647. Another worthwhile example of a state-based initiative is the Code of Conduct for Information Security, put forward by China, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The proposal was submitted to the UN General Assembly twice, in 2011 and 2015, but it was not met with enthusiasm by the international community. Note that the 2015 proposal was also co-sponsored by Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.

More substantially, it recognized that “[i]nternational law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment”¹⁸⁵. The Group also claimed that the principles of sovereignty and state responsibility apply to cyberspace¹⁸⁶. Note that, in order to guarantee unanimity, a draft provision supporting the applicability of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) was excluded from the report¹⁸⁷. Even so, many states have publicly endorsed the application of the laws of armed conflict to the cyber domain. The USA, for instance, is of the view that “[l]ong-standing international norms guiding state behaviour – in times of peace and conflict – also apply in cyberspace”¹⁸⁸. Similarly, Japan stated that “existing international law, including the UN Charter and international humanitarian law, naturally applies to acts in cyberspace”¹⁸⁹.\nFinally, despite the absence of several important issues and the difficulty in reaching consensus, the 2015 report was considered a “breakthrough”¹⁹⁰. It explicitly mentioned the General Assembly resolutions on the right to privacy in the digital age¹⁹¹ and noted the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction¹⁹², but it did not specifically affirm that IHL applies to activities in the cyber environment. The GGE further suggested that “[v]oluntary, non-binding norms of responsible State behaviour” may prevent conflict in cyberspace\n¹⁸³ United Nations General Assembly, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunication in the Context of International Security, UN Doc.

A final point to consider is that the Group claimed that “accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated”¹⁹⁴. A problem, however, is that at no time the report clarified what kind of or how much evidence would be necessary to ‘substantiate’ an accusation¹⁹⁵.\nIt is perhaps useful to point out that, since the 2015 report, the Russian Federation and China, along with several other states, have continued to advocate for the view that accusations ought to be substantiated¹⁹⁶. On the other end of the spectrum, the USA, France and the United Kingdom share the position that, under public international law, there is no evidentiary requirement for making accusations. In this regard, U.S. State Department Legal Adviser Brian J. Egan stated that:\n[D]espite the suggestion by some States to the contrary, there is no international legal obligation to reveal evidence on which attribution is based prior to taking appropriate action. There may, of course, be political pressure to do so, and States may choose to reveal such evidence to convince other States to join them in condemnation, for example. But that is a policy choice – it is not compelled by international law¹⁹⁷.\nThis position was reiterated by the U.K. former Attorney General Jeremy Wright, who explained that “[t]here is no legal obligation requiring a state to publicly disclose the underlying information on which its decision to attribute hostile activity is based”¹⁹⁸. More recently, France echoed the same opinion¹⁹⁹.\nIn 2017, the GGE was supposed to submit another report to the UN General Assembly, but the experts failed to reach consensus due to disagreements over controversial areas of international law, such as the right of self-defence, countermeasures, and IHL. According to Herinksen, the collapse of the UN GGE initiative was “fairly predictable”²⁰⁰ because the debate vis-à-vis the regulation of cyberspace is “as much about strategy, politics and ideological\n¹⁹³ Ibid., para. 10.\n¹⁹⁴ Ibid., para. 28(f).\n¹⁹⁵ Supra note 63, at 19.\n¹⁹⁶ For instance, they formally presented a draft UN General Assembly resolution in 2018, asserting that “[s]tates should note that accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated”.

The Group held promise for the clarification of cyber-related customary international law, but it left the global community with an unresolved legal conundrum in which opinions appear to be diverging and solidifying instead of converging²⁰². Yet, the GGE reports were a welcomed first step for the discussion on international cyber norms and remain extremely relevant²⁰³.\nOne encouraging conclusion is that, in spite of the lack of a specific legal framework, cyberspace is certainly not a lawless domain beyond the control of public international law. As it has been pointed out, it is well settled that general principles and rules of international law also apply to cyber operations²⁰⁴. Indeed, if international law is to be an effective governance arrangement, it should be flexible to new situations without the necessity to recreate a whole set of rules on each occasion²⁰⁵. The development of nuclear weapons is a prime example of this. When the UN Charter was being elaborated, its “framers could not be aware of the threat of nuclear weapons”²⁰⁶ and therefore the legal instrument did not include this type of armament in its provisions regarding the use of force. Yet, decades later, the ICJ provided an advisory opinion arguing that Articles 2(4) and 51 of the UN Charter, concerning the prohibition of the use of force and self-defence respectively, apply to “any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed”²⁰⁷. By this logic, the body of international law that governs the use of force should apply to cyber activities, too²⁰⁸. Despite these advances, however, many underlying questions remain virtually unanswered. Perhaps most importantly, how are international legal norms supposed to apply to the complex cyber domain?²⁰⁹\n²⁰¹ Ibid.\n²⁰² Korzak 2017.\n²⁰³ Supra note 55, at 648.\n²⁰⁴ According to Henriksen, the 2013 UN GGE report “reflected an emerging consensus that cyberspace is subject to the same general principles of international law that governs the more physical domains” (Henriksen 2019, 3). The remaining question, therefore, is which international law?\n²⁰⁵ Supra note 42, at 9. On this point, the United States claims that “[t]he development of norms for state conduct in cyberspace does not require a reinvention of customary international law, nor does it render existing international norms obsolete” (United States of America, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World, May 2011, 9).\n²⁰⁶ International Court of Justice, Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict (Request for Advisory Opinion Submitted by the World Health Organization) and Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Request for Advisory Opinion Submitted by the General Assembly of the United Nations), CR 95/25, 1995, para. 46.\n²⁰⁷ International Court of Justice, Reports of Judgements, Advisory Opinions and Orders, Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, para. 39.\n²⁰⁸ “[T]he mere fact that a computer (rather than a more traditional weapon, weapon system, or platform) is used during an operation has no bearing on whether that operation amounts to a ‘use of force’”.

See section 4.1 infra for a detailed debate on the Tallinn initiative.\n²⁰⁹ Osula and Rõigas 2016, 14.\n32\nNote that, besides the general principles and rules of international law, there are some regional and sectorial legal regimes that are not precisely focused on cybersecurity but nevertheless provide tools that may be used to address specific forms of malicious cyberattacks²¹⁰. These include, principally, the 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation²¹¹, the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)²¹², the 1992 Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union²¹³, the 2001 Convention on Cybercrime²¹⁴ and its Additional Protocol²¹⁵, the 2009 Information Security Agreement of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization²¹⁶, and the 2014 African Union Convention on Cybersecurity and Personal Data Protection²¹⁷. This “patchwork of regulations”²¹⁸, however, only govern a small portion of the activities in cyberspace or have a very limited number of members²¹⁹. Therefore, they do not offer a comprehensive or effective framework for dealing with all forms of cyber operations.\nWith this in mind, one should be cognizant that, even though cybersecurity has certainly drawn huge attention in recent years, short-term prospects for the establishment of a far-reaching international treaty or the formation of new customary international law have been described as “not encouraging”²²⁰, “doubtful”²²¹, and even “unfeasible”²²². Given this gloomy picture, scholars, cyber-experts, and international stakeholders have been attempting to fill the normative void with their views on how international law applies to the cyber domain. Note that these non-state-driven initiatives were only possible because of the “power vacuum” created by states’ reluctance to undertake the international law-making process²²³.

This subject, however, warrant a more extended discussion than I can here give it. In this sense, this study focuses on the two leading non-state-driven initiatives that epitomize the phenomenon described above: the Tallinn Manual Project and Microsoft’s proposals.\nThe first non-state initiative that tried to address cyberattacks and increase international cybersecurity was the Tallinn Project, which brought together an international group of independent experts led by Professor Michael Schmitt. The project published two editions of the Manual, respectively in 2013²²⁶ and 2017²²⁷, under the auspices of the NATO CCD COE. Their texts, however, must not be seen as representing the views of NATO or sponsoring nations. Rather, the Manuals should be understood as a reflexion of the views of the experts, all acting in their own private capacity²²⁸. It should be noted that this project is neither an international treaty on cyber law nor does it set forth *lex ferenda*, but it is a restatement of international law as it is – *lex lata*²²⁹.\nThe 2013 edition, entitled the *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, pays particular attention to cyber activities that occur above the level of use of force and encompasses purported rules of customary international law, the larger part of which related to the *jus ad bellum* (the law governing the use of force)²³⁰ and the *jus in bello* (the law\n²²⁴ Finnemore and Hollis 2016, 446; According to Finnemore and Sikkink, norm entrepreneurs are “agents having strong notions about appropriate or desirable behaviour in their community” (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998, 896-97). Henry Dunant, the founder of the International Committee of the Red Cross, is a prime example of norm entrepreneurship.\n²²⁵ For instance, Chernenko et al. recommend the creation of an “independent, international cyber court or arbitrage method that deals only with government-level cyber conflicts” (Chernenko et al. 2018). RAND’s *Stateless Attribution* report, on the other hand, suggests an international organization for cyber-attribution, the *Global Cyber Attribution Consortium*, which would involve “a broad team of international experts to conduct independent investigations of major cyber incidents for the purpose of attribution” and would operate “without standing state participation” (*Supra* note 3, at 27-31).\n²²⁶ *Supra* note 178.\n²²⁷ Ibid.\n²²⁸ Tallinn Manual, 23; Tallinn Manual 2.0, 2.\n²²⁹ Tallinn Manual, 19; Tallinn Manual 2.0, 3.\n²³⁰ Tallinn Manual, rules 10-19.\nof armed conflict)²³¹. The Manual was considered to be a “remarkable achievement”²³² and, according to Banks, provided “much-needed confidence for states that international law applies in the cyber domain”²³³. Early reviews, nevertheless, criticized the project’s emphasis on cyber operations that amount to use of force since, in reality, the majority of, if not all, cyber activities fall below the use of force threshold²³⁴. Another major criticism of the Tallinn Manual is the dearth of geographic diversity among the group of experts, all of whom hail from Western Europe, Australia, and the USA. Consequently, the impartiality of the project is challenged, hindering its acceptability and application by states outside the Global North. China, for instance, has been very critical of the whole Tallinn initiative since it seems to be a North American attempt to “maintain US dominance in the information age”²³⁵. As noted by Eichensehr, the Manual is “channelling, even though not officially representing, a particular worldview with respect to the laws of armed conflict”²³⁶.\nIn the 2013 Tallinn Manual, no effort was made to establish legal criteria for attributing blame for cyberattacks²³⁷ and attribution is addressed as a problem, instead of “a realistic task having technical, political and legal aspects”²³⁸. Still, some provisions may shed light on the attribution problem. For example, Rule 5 asserts that “a state shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States”²³⁹. Note that this provision restates in cyber terms the principle put forward in the ICJ’s Corfu Channel Judgement²⁴⁰. The experts were able to reach consensus on the scope of application of Rule 5²⁴¹, but they could\n²³¹ Tallinn Manual, rules 20-95.\n²³² Ingber 2017, 1531.\n²³³ Supra note 33, at 1494.\n²³⁴ Supra note 42, at 16. On this topic, Xinmin explains that the majority of cyberattacks are perpetrated by non-state actors, which are generally seen as cybercrime or infringement of cyber rights that should be governed by domestic criminal law or the law of torts. Also, she points that “[e]ven if some of these attacks are conducted by states or may be attributable to states, most of them fall far below the threshold of ‘threat of use of force’ or ‘armed attack’. Instead, they are only cyber-attacks of minimal levels of intensity, which are comparable to other internationally wrongful acts such as interference with internal affairs of other states” (Xinmin 2016, 189-29).\n²³⁵ Supra note 152, at 4.\n²³⁶ Eichensehr 2014, 588.\n²³⁷ Fleck 2013, 338.\n²³⁸ Ibid., 334-35.\n²³⁹ It is important to point out that this rule has since been included in the 2015 UN GGE report: “[s]tates should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs” (Supra note 161, para. 13 (c)).\n²⁴⁰ “Such obligations are based [...] on certain general and well-recognized principles, namely: [...] every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”. International Court of Justice, The Corfu Channel Case, Merits, 9 April 1949, 22.\n²⁴¹ “As to scope of application, this Rule covers all acts that are unlawful and that have detrimental effects on another state. (Tallinn Manual, Rule 5, para. 5, 33).\n35\nnot agree whether this rule applies (1) to states through which cyberattacks are routed$^{242}$, (2) to states that only have constructive knowledge$^{243}$, and (3) to situations in which the relevant acts are purely prospective$^{244}$.\nOther noteworthy provision in the Manual is Rule 6, which affirms that “a State bears international legal responsibility for a cyber operation attributable to it and which constitutes a breach of an international obligation”. In this regard, the experts agreed that, in specific circumstances, the acts of non-state actors might be attributable to a state and therefore cause that state’s international legal responsibility$^{245}$. The non-state actor, however, must be either acting “on the instructions of” or “under the direction or control” of that state$^{246}$.\nIn 2017, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations was published, expanding considerably the scope of the project. Now, it also includes the analysis of the international legal framework that applies to malicious cyberattacks that do not meet the use of force threshold. Furthermore, the new Manual addresses peacetime legal regimes, such as state responsibility, human rights law, and the laws of space, air, and the sea. On the whole, the Tallinn 2.0 “reflects a careful effort to move international law forward in the challenging domain of cyberspace”$^{247}$. Mačák further echoes this idea by arguing that the expansion and revision of the document will probably “further strengthen the project’s overall relevance as well as its claim to authority”$^{248}$. Banks, on the other hand, explains that the Tallinn 2.0’s provisions and commentaries are “necessarily general in nature, sometimes ambiguous, and do not necessarily reflect settled international law”$^{249}$.\nRegarding cyber-attribution, in spite of the expectations surrounding its publication, the 2017 Tallinn Manual did not go any further than the previous edition in providing an effective legal solution to the attribution problem$^{250}$. Rather, the experts limited their analysis of cyber-attribution to the well-established Articles on State Responsibility, codified by the ILC$^{251}$. This body of law, as its name suggests, only offers prescriptive norms when there is a state nexus\n36\nand, therefore, provides no legal understanding vis-à-vis the attribution of cyberattacks to non-state actors operating on their own²⁵².\nDespite criticism, the Tallinn initiative provides a comprehensive and attentive analysis of how the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* applies to the cyber environment, along with valuable commentaries on controversial issues that need to be further discussed. Even though the reliance on Western-centric approaches might handicap Tallinn’s acceptance in non-Western countries, such as China and the Russian Federation, the project still is an essential tool for scholars, international lawyers, policymakers, and international stakeholders²⁵³.\nIn 2014, Microsoft Corporation published a white paper entitled *International Cybersecurity Norms: Reducing Conflict in an Internet-Dependent World*²⁵⁴. It was the first thorough proposal to seek the definition of acceptable and unacceptable state conducts online, with the purpose of decreasing risks and bringing predictability and stability to the international scenario²⁵⁵. In short, Microsoft proposed six cybersecurity norms to limit conflict and improve cyber defences²⁵⁶. These norms are intended to “reduce the possibility that ICT products and services could be used, abused, or exploited by nation states as part of offensive operations”²⁵⁷. Note that, like both editions of the Tallinn Manual, Microsoft’s white paper suggests guidelines of state conduct and is openly state-centric in its approach²⁵⁸.\nThe project was widely criticized for emphasizing the role of states and thus overlooking the relevance of the private sector, in particular the global ICT industry, for the promotion of international cybersecurity²⁵⁹. In response to these claims, Microsoft released another white paper, *From Articulation to Implementation: Enabling Progress on Cybersecurity Norms*, in which the Corporation outlines six further cybersecurity norms. This time, however, the norms were directed at ICT companies²⁶⁰. For instance, the paper calls upon the ICT industry to “assist public sector efforts to identify, prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from events in\n²⁵² Supra note 33, at 1495.\n²⁵³ Supra note 209, at 585.\n²⁵⁴ Note that Microsoft’s proposal was not the first time a private company put forward an initiative of this kind. Already in 1999, the CEO of AOL, Steve Case, strongly recommended states to “revis[e] outdated and ‘country-centric’ laws on telecommunications and taxes that could thwart the growth of the medium” and instead support “international standards – from security, to privacy, to taxation”. (Case, Steve, Remarks Prepared for Delivery (via satellite) Israel ‘99 Business Conference’, 13 December 1999, cited in Goldsmith and Wu 2006, 26)\n²⁵⁵ McKay 2014, 2.\n²⁵⁶ For the complete list of the proposed cybersecurity norms, see McKay 2014, 20.\n²⁵⁷ Ibid., 11.\n²⁵⁸ Supra note 42, at 17.\n²⁵⁹ Charney et al. 2016, 3.\n²⁶⁰ Ibid.\n37\ncyberspace”²⁶¹. Furthermore, in 2017, the President of Microsoft, Brad Smith, proposed the adoption of a “Digital Geneva Convention” to protect civilians from nation-state cyberattacks²⁶². Such a convention would include an independent attribution organization that could “address cyber threats in a manner like the role played by the International Atomic Energy Agency in the field of nuclear non-proliferation”²⁶³. This organization would also facilitate cooperation between academia, governments, technology companies, and civil society in the sphere of cyber-attribution.\nNote that, while the rules brought by the Tallinn Manuals articulate purported customary international obligations that by themselves are binding on all states, except persistent objectors²⁶⁴, the norms put forward by Microsoft’s proposals are only broad suggestions that do not create any right or legal obligation. In other words, Microsoft’s norms are “more aspirational than realistic” and require states to translate them into legally binding rules, which takes time and commitment²⁶⁵. Despite this difference, both initiatives have in common the fact that they are non-state-driven, quasi-legal instruments which do not have any legally binding force²⁶⁶. In other words, they are soft law rules²⁶⁷. In fact, the Tallinn Manuals and Microsoft’s white papers could hardly amount to anything but a non-binding document²⁶⁸ since states still are “the legislators of the international legal system”²⁶⁹. That said, one may call into question the importance of these initiatives for the development of international law. Is soft law an authentic law? Is soft law effective to produce norms despite its non-binding nature?\n38\n39\n## 4.2 The value of soft law\nAccording to Besson, international legal norms might have different levels of normativity²⁷⁰, ranging from “being low (or soft) as with legal norms in the making to being imperative as with norms of *jus cogens*”²⁷¹. Certainly, the Tallinn Manual project and Microsoft’s papers have a lower degree of legal normativity than binding international rules²⁷². Indeed, as stated by the ILC on its study on the Identification of Customary International Law, the “conduct of other actors [than states] is not practice that contributes to the formation, or expression, of rules of customary international law”²⁷³. This, however, does not imply that these initiatives are utterly irrelevant for the law-making process or even to the development of cyber law. Quite the opposite, considering the normative plurality in international law, non-state-driven initiatives of this kind might be valuable both in quantity and quality²⁷⁴. For Thirlway, “soft law is a vital intermediate stage towards a more rigorously binding system, permitting experiment and rapid modification”²⁷⁵.\nMoreover, even though these intermediary legal products are not “valid legal norms”, they might possess a certain evidentiary importance in the next stages of the development of rules of international law²⁷⁶. Put differently, non-binding documents, such as UN resolutions, might evince the existence of both *opinio juris* and state practice which could later support the formation of customary norms²⁷⁷. By this logic, hard and soft laws are not mutually exclusive and should be seen as “tools provided with a different degree of normativity along a *continuum*”²⁷⁸. It also should be noted that soft law-making processes normally involve non-state actors and thus are more “multicultural and inclusive” than others²⁷⁹.\n---\n²⁷⁰ By ‘normativity’, I mean “the law’s claim to authority, that is, its claim to provide its legal subjects with exclusionary albeit *prima facie* reasons for action through binding legal norms or in other words its claim to create obligations to obey the law that in principle preclude some countervailing reasons for action” (Besson, 2010, 173).\n²⁷¹ Ibid., 174.\n²⁷² *Supra note* 42, at 19.\n²⁷³ International Law Commission, *Draft Conclusions on Identification of Customary International Law*, with Commentaries, 2018, A/73/10, conclusion 4 (3), 130.\n²⁷⁴ *Supra note* 240, at 170.\n²⁷⁵ Thirlway 2019, 186-87.\n²⁷⁶ *Supra note* 240, at 170.\n²⁷⁷ Ibid. As pointed by the ILC, non-state practice “may be relevant” when assessing the practice of states (*Supra note* 243).\n²⁷⁸ Zerilli 2010, 11.\n²⁷⁹ *Supra note* 240, at 170-171. Regarding soft law, Joyner has interesting points that are worthwhile looking at. For instance, he notes that states are usually “more willing to be innovative when the adopted instrument is not legally binding” (Joyner 1998, 414).\nAccording to Article 38(1) of the Statute of the ICJ, scholarly works are a secondary source of public international law that informs the application of primary sources²⁸⁰. Hence, it seems fair to conclude that the aforementioned initiatives are not only highly pertinent, but also “likely to prove especially influential”²⁸¹. Nevertheless, this situation is by no means ideal since states, and only states, hold the formal authority to create international law²⁸². As Judge Higgins aptly put it, “[s]tates are, at this moment of history, still at the heart of the international legal system”²⁸³. However, it is important to bear in mind that the norms proposed by both the Tallinn Manual Project and Microsoft’s papers might “mature through codification into treaty law or crystallise into customary law”, so that they delineate the exact limits of activities in cyberspace²⁸⁴.\nThis dynamic is certainly not without precedent. The Antarctic legal regime is the epitome of this. In the 1960s and 1970s, many non-legally binding norms were brought in with high hopes of conserving both living and non-living resources of Antarctica²⁸⁵. Joyner argues that the adoption of these non-binding instruments laid the international legal foundation for the treaty that was yet to come²⁸⁶. Ultimately, the majority of these norms were codified into the 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, a binding agreement that has been ratified by all major international actors, including the USA, China, and Russia²⁸⁷.\nAnother prime example is the international nuclear safety regime. Even though proposals to establish a legally-binding international treaty were put forward since the 1960s, states were generally “disinclined to go beyond the recommendatory nature of the safety standards” issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)²⁸⁸. This situation, however,\n²⁸⁰ “The Court, whose function is to decide in accordance with international law such disputes as are submitted to it, shall apply:\n(a) international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting states;\n(b) international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law;\n(c) the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations;\n(d) subject to the provisions of Article 59, judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicist of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law”. United Nations, Statute of the International Court of Justice, 18 April 1946, Article 38 (1).\n²⁸¹ Schmitt and Vihul 2016, 47.\n²⁸² Supra note 42, at 19.\n²⁸³ Higgins 1994, 39.\n²⁸⁴ Supra note 250.\n²⁸⁵ Joyner 1998, 420. In the 1960s, more than seventy recommended measures were adopted by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Party Meetings (ACTMs); and in 1970s, more than fifty were adopted.\n²⁸⁶ Ibid.\n²⁸⁷ Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, October 1991, United Nations Treaty Series, vol. 2941, A-5778.\n²⁸⁸ Nuclear Energy Agency and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Joint Report on International Law in the Post-Chernobyl Period, 2006, NEA No. 6146, 13.\nchanged rapidly after the Chernobyl accident, which exposed the costly transboundary consequences of unsafe nuclear activity²⁸⁹. The 1986 disaster gave rise to an international legally-binding regime for the safe development of nuclear energy, which slowly transformed the safety standards and other relevant non-binding norms into hard law rules²⁹⁰.\nOne must be aware, however, that the cyber domain differs in important ways from the Antarctic and the nuclear regimes. Perhaps the most notable difference is that, while the lawmaking process vis-à-vis cyberspace has been spearheaded by non-state-driven initiatives, the development of binding rules for international nuclear safety and the conservation of Antarctica had been led mainly by state actors. Yet, these two regimes are valuable examples that illustrate the codification of soft law norms²⁹¹. With this in mind, the current status of cyber international law should be seen as an early stage towards the codification or crystallisation of cyber hard law²⁹². The question that needs to be addressed, therefore, is whether states will finally rise to the challenge.\n²⁸⁹ Shull 2008, 4.\n²⁹⁰ To wit: Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, 1986, INFCIRC/335; Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency, 1986, INFCIRC/336; Convention on Nuclear Safety, 1994, INFCIRC/449; Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on The Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, 1997, INFCIRC/546.\n²⁹¹ Supra note 42, at 21.\n²⁹² Ibid.\n41\n# Chapter 5 – Conclusion\nThe 2007 Estonian attacks, as well as other cyberattacks mentioned in this study, illustrate the severity of the threats facing states’ cybersecurity, and the equally important challenge of implementing a legal framework for attributing blame for cyber activities. Given the ever-growing reliance on ICTs and the increasing frequency, intensity, and complexity of cyberattacks, a solution for the attribution problem is crucial for both promoting a (relatively) stable world order and reducing the chances of conflict stemming from cyberoperations²⁹³. Note, however, that this solution does not lie in the technical domains, as previously thought²⁹⁴. Pragmatically, the most relevant hurdles for cyber deterrence nowadays are not poor technical capabilities since, from a technical standpoint, tools for attribution have matured significantly in recent years²⁹⁵, increasing states’ confidence vis-à-vis assigning blame for malicious cyberattacks²⁹⁶. Rather, the solution for this issue lies in the realm of international law and cooperation.\nAs transnational terrorism, migration crises, and other security challenges that plague the international community, the attribution problem cannot be appropriately tackled by any single international entity, regardless of how strong and influential that entity might be²⁹⁷. Instead, these modern phenomena require a framework for active global collaboration. It is international law that “affords [such] a framework, a pattern, a fabric for international society”²⁹⁸. Nevertheless, in the context of the computer network, it seems that international law fails to deliver. Even though states have agreed that public international law applies to cyberactivity, there is no broad multilateral agreement on how to govern cyberspace²⁹⁹ and, therefore, it is as yet uncertain how the international legal framework applies to this new, complex domain.\nThis difficulty in the application of traditional rules and principles of international law, in order to properly address cyber challenges, results from a number of reasons³⁰⁰. Perhaps the most relevant of them is the attachment of this body of law to state-centric assumptions and foundations of the early formative stage of the international legal system³⁰¹. By placing state\n²⁹³ Supra note 3.\n²⁹⁴ Supra note 10, at 28.\n²⁹⁵ Supra note 33, at 1502.\n²⁹⁶ Supra note 43, at 137. By way of an example, the USA has declared that it has the ability to identify and hold their cyber opponents accountable (Fryer-Biggs 2012). Indeed, in the last few years, the U.S. government has attributed high-profile cyberattacks, such as the 2014 intrusion at Sony Pictures Entertainment and the 2016 DNC hack, respectively, to North Korean and Russia (Supra note 42, at 23-24).\n²⁹⁷ Supra note 42, at 2.\n²⁹⁸ Henkin 1978, 5.\n²⁹⁹ Moynihan 2019, 4.\n³⁰⁰ Supra note 2, at 375.\n³⁰¹ Supra note 7, at 610-11.\nactors at the heart of its legal regimes, public international law requires in almost all situations a state link so as to determine either an international legal obligation or an internationally wrongful act³⁰². In an environment where non-state actors are as powerful, if not more so, than states, it seems fair to conclude that this legal system grounded in the traditional state-centric perspective of international law is not suitable or even adequate to address challenges posed by cyberspace and the rapid development of ICTs³⁰³. In this sense, as long as states refuse to recognize the existence and the importance of other international players, any effort to govern cyberspace and to establish legal mechanisms for cyber-attribution will fall short.\nAs it stands now, international law not only fails in effectively dealing with the attribution problem, but also is unlikely to be instrumental in providing both predictability and stability to cyberspace in the short and medium-terms. Besides the lack of clarity of the law in this area, governments have been unwilling to clearly express their existing norms and practices in relation to the cyber domain, impeding the formation of customary international law and increasing unpredictability of state behaviour³⁰⁴. Note that, in spite of the constructive contribution made by non-state initiatives, public international law is lagging far behind in many respects and thus continues to be underdeveloped vis-à-vis cyber-attribution.\nBefore proceeding, two points still need to be considered. First, by filling the void created by states’ reluctance to undertake the international law-making process, non-state-driven initiatives, especially the Tallinn Manuals and Microsoft’s proposals, have been providing much-needed clarity to some grey areas of international cyber law³⁰⁵. These initiatives, however, are constrained by their state-centric approaches, non-binding character, and interpretative methods, which usually lack the necessary legal safety³⁰⁶. Therefore, non-state initiatives represent a relevant but primitive point in the discussion about the application of international law to the cyber domain³⁰⁷. They should be seen as a means to an end, not an end in itself³⁰⁸.\n³⁰² Ibid.\n³⁰³ According to Schmitt and Watts, the cyber domain and cyberactivity have bridged “a number of formerly significant gaps between states’ and non-state actors’ abilities to compromise international peace and security. in fact, some non-state actors now match, if not exceed, the cyber capabilities of many states in this respect” (Supra note 7, at 595).\n³⁰⁴ Supra note 33, at 1509.\n³⁰⁵ Supra note 42, at 1.\n³⁰⁶ Supra note 2, at 381. For instance, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 limited its analysis of cyber-attribution to the basic principles of State Responsibility, as codified by the ILC. However, as its name suggests, this body of law can only be applied when there is a state nexus.\n³⁰⁷ Supra note 33, at 1513.\n³⁰⁸ In this regard, Mačák points out that non-state initiatives might serve “as norm-making laboratories”, permitting states to identify and assess advantages and disadvantages of a number of proposals (Supra note 42, at 30-31).\n43\nTo put it differently, this situation marks an early stage towards the formation of cyber hard law, for the non-binding norms presented by these initiatives might, over time, mature through either codification or crystallisation.\nSecond, if states genuinely wish to address the problem of cyber-attribution, they can do so; they have the technological capabilities and all the necessary legal power. After all, states are still at the heart of the international legal framework³⁰⁹ and are the only ones to hold the formal authority to create international rules³¹⁰. This argument generates an obvious puzzle, however: why then do they not solve this conundrum? The answer to this question lies on the fact that some countries may benefit from the current state of affairs, characterized by uncertainties and the lack of express cyber norms³¹¹. States that possess the most advanced cyber capabilities – such as the United States, Russia, China, and likely North Korea – may take advantage of the cyber domain in order to fulfil their national interests in the physical world³¹². For instance, the USA has allegedly used an extremely sophisticated computer worm, called Stuxnet, to destroy numerous centrifuges in an Iranian nuclear facility³¹³, thwarting the prospects of Iran developing nuclear weapons and thus securing American geopolitical interests in the Middle East.\nBy this logic, if states believe that by acting in unregulated cyberspace their gains offset their losses, there will be no incentive for them to promote the regulation of this domain or to solve the attribution problem. This might help to explain why state actors have been so reluctant to engage in the cyber law-making process, as well as to express clear *opinio juris* with respect to cyberspace. Considering the ever-increasing costs of insecurity and uncertainty related to an ungoverned cyber domain, states may soon come to realize the necessity of an international legal framework capable of addressing cyberattacks³¹⁴. As Professor Koh aptly put it, “compliance with international law frees us to do more, and do more legitimately, in cyberspace, in a way that more fully promotes our national interests”³¹⁵. Therefore, one can only hope that\n³⁰⁹ Supra note 283.\n³¹⁰ Supra note 42, at 19.\n³¹¹ Supra note 33, at 1511.\n³¹² It should be noted that the former U.S. Secretary of Defence Leon Panetta stated that the American government was “developing the plans that needed to be developed to ensure the United States would remain one of the strongest players in the cyber arena” (Stone 2019).\n³¹³ Zetter 2014a.\n³¹⁴ Note, however, that this process might already be in motion, as illustrated by the 2015 cyber agreement between the United States and China (Harold 2016; Supra note 42, at 27).\n³¹⁵ Koh 2012, 10.\nstates do not wait for the occurrence of a “cyber 9/11” $^{316}$ or a “cyber Pearl Harbour” $^{317}$ to overcome their aversion to engaging in the development of international cyber law.\nIn the meantime, cyberspace will continue to be an environment that offers the perfect conditions for the security dilemma to thrive and in which the activities of both state and non-state actors can trigger off conflicts causing widespread harm to societies, the global economy, and the international security system. With this in mind, international stakeholders and policymakers should strive to increase transparency, so as to bridge the existing trust gaps inside the international community. Overall, greater transparency reduces misperceptions and conflict spirals and, consequently, leads to cooperation and better cybersecurity.\nIt is important to point out that, due to time constraints, this thesis was not able to assess the role played by the private sector in attributing blame for cyberattacks or to analyse non-Western approaches to the international rule of law in the cyber domain. Future researches, therefore, should attempt to explore these topics.\n316 Fazzini 2018.\n317 Supra note 312.\n45",

Even though determining the machines that launched a malicious cyber incident is no longer an arduous task for the most developed states, identifying the individuals, organizations, or governments that are legally responsible for the attack continues to be extremely difficult. This study argues that, as it stands now, international law not only fails in effectively dealing with the attribution problem, but also is unlikely to be instrumental in providing both predictability and stability to cyberspace in the short and medium-terms. As a result, the cyber domain will continue to be an environment that offers the perfect conditions for the security dilemma to thrive and in which incidents – whether intended or not – can trigger off conflicts causing widespread harm to the whole international security system.\nKeywords: cyber-attribution, attribution problem, cybersecurity, security dilemma, international security, Tallinn Manual, non-state initiatives.\n\nAbbreviations ... 5\nChapter 1 – Introduction ... 6\nChapter 2 – Realism and the Security Dilemma ... 14\n2.1 What is the security dilemma? ... 15\nChapter 3 – The Attribution Problem ... 18\n3.1 Why is attribution so difficult? ... 19\n3.2 Why does cyber-attribution matter? ... 24\nChapter 4 – International Law and Cybersecurity ... 29\n4.1 Leading non-state initiatives ... 34\n4.2 The value of soft law ... 39\nChapter 5 – Conclusion ... 42\nBibliography ... 46\nArticles, Reports and Books ... 46\nLegal Sources and Official Documents ... 53\nWebsites ... 56\n\nACTMs Antarctic Treaty Consultative Party Meetings\nCCD COE Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence\nCIA Central Intelligence Agency\nDDOS Distributed Denial of Service\nDNC Democratic National Committee\nDNI Director of National Intelligence\nGGE Group of Governmental Experts\nIAEA International Atomic Energy Agency\nICJ International Court of Justice\nICTs Information and Communication Technologies\nICTY International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia\nIHL International Humanitarian Law\nILC International Law Commission\nIP Internet Protocol\nNATO North Atlantic Treaty Organization\nUK United Kingdom\nUSA United States of America\nVCLT Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties\n# Chapter 1 – Introduction\nBy providing people across the globe with instant access to information, to communication, and to novel economic opportunities, cyberspace and the rapid development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have essentially transformed not only the world economy, but also the way of life. Education, health, government, as well as sectors such as energy, communication, and transportation are inextricably linked to, if not dependent on, the cyber domain. As information technology becomes more widespread and integrated into our daily lives, the probability of compromise by malicious cyber activity increases. According to the former Director of National Intelligence (DNI) of the United States, more than thirty countries are developing offensive cyber capabilities, which will rise the incidence of both standoff and remote operations. To complicate matters further, these capabilities are progressively under criminal and other non-state actors’ control. Therefore, cyberattacks that deeply affect international peace and the global economy are no longer “futuristic or far-fetched”, but rather the reality of cyberspace.\n “Cyberspace” is defined by the United States National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations as “a domain characterized by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructure” (United States Department of Defence (DoD), *The National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations*, December 2006,3). Therefore, cyberspace also includes all networked digital operations.\n Pipyros et al. 2018, 371.\n Davis II et al. 2017, 1\n United States Senate 2017, 5.\n Owens, Dam, and Lin 2009, 27.\n By cyberattack, I refer to the definition applied by Oona Hathaway et al. as “any action taken to undermine the functions of a computer network for a political or national security purpose” (Hathaway et al. 2012, 826). This definition, however, differs from that used by the U.S. Cyber Command, which identifies cyberattacks as those “that cause physical damage to property or injury to persons.” (Ibid., 821 n.9). Hathaway et al.’s definition also differs from the one offered by the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, which describe cyberattack as “a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects” (Schmitt 2013, 92). It is important to bear in mind that both the Tallinn Manual and the Cyber Command definitions are under-inclusive, particularly considering the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack, which did not cause physical damage to property or persons, but involved the *domaine reservé* of the U.S., raising relevant national security concerns about democratic procedures and the violation of the prohibition of intervention. Hathaway et al.’s terminology, on the other hand, covers a broader set of cyberattacks, including attacks such as the DNC hack.\nIn addition, I use the term ‘cyberattack’ instead of ‘cyber warfare’ because the latter refers to a smaller subset of cyberattacks that “constitute armed attacks or that occur in the context of an ongoing armed conflict” (Hathaway et al. 2012, 821). By contrast, the term ‘cyberattack’ embraces a broad range of attacks, from cyber warfare to those attacks that fall short of armed conflict but still deserve some kind of sanction (Tran 2018, 380 n.13). Furthermore, Hathaway and her co-authors make a distinction between cyberattacks and cyberespionage; according to the they, “neither cyber-espionage nor cyber-exploitation constitutes a cyber-attack because these concepts do not involve altering computer networks in a way that affects their current or future ability to function” (Hathaway et al. 2012, 829).\n Schmitt and Watts 2016, 596.\nFollowing the relocation of a Soviet war memorial in 2007, Estonia was hit by a series of massive cyberattacks lasting three weeks. Taking into consideration that the small Baltic country is one of the most wired societies in Europe, the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks were particularly harmful, resulting in a temporary interruption of service on many government and commercial websites and, thus, profoundly affecting the functioning of the country’s economy. Initially, the attacks were attributed to Russia due to the political atmosphere at the time, as well as past Russian actions. This explanation, however, was questioned by technical experts, and even NATO officials were disinclined to assign blame to the Russian government. Because of disagreements over the links between the attackers and Russia, what at first appeared to be a pretty obvious case of aggression became a gridlock. Although it is highly probable that the Russian state launched the cyberattack, its involvement has never been proven. Yet, the attack continues to be an example of Russia’s cyber capabilities that following cyberattacks will be judged by.\nIn hindsight, the Estonian attacks were “fairly mild and simple”, far less damaging than the cyberattacks that have followed. Even so, they brought cyberspace to the forefront of international relations discussions, raising awareness among states about the severe risk posed by the growing dependence on ICTs, as well as the possibility of conflict in this new and unique environment. Indeed, during the last decade, the international community has witnessed and experienced a considerable number of problematic episodes in cyberspace – the cyber intrusion at Sony Pictures Entertainment, the attack on France’s TV5Monde, the Democratic National\n Traynor 2007.\n By 2007, 98% of Estonian territory was covered with Internet access, and mobile phone penetration was almost 100% (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010, 17).\n According to Clark and Landau, DDoS attack is a concerted malevolent effort in which a large number of machines from all over the Internet attack a site or a set of sites in order to disrupt service by overloading a server or a link (Clark and Landau 2011, 6).\n Dinniss 2014, 38-39.\n Supra note 8, at 25.\n Schulzke 2018, 960.\n Ibid. It is necessary to recognize that this situation poses a threat to international peace since, according to Gomez, the “adversary’s past behaviour may motivate a disproportionate response to pre-empt any further threats” (Gomez 2019, 1-2).\n Schmitt 2017, xxiii.\n On November 2014, Sony Pictures’ computers were broken into, and sensitive information from the film studio and unreleased movies were published online, disrupting the company business operations (Davis II et al. 2017, 42). Considering that Sony had produced the movie The Interview, which depicts the assassination of Kim Jong-Un, speculations about North Korean participation were raised (Egloff 2019, 10). Through a press statement, North Korea denied responsibility for the cyberattack, but praised the attackers for their actions. As of yet, no one was able to prove North Korean involvement and the evidence implicating it was considered “flimsy” (Zetter 2014b).\n In April 2015, the French-language television network had its computer infrastructure and social media accounts hacked. Initially, the group called Cyber Caliphate, an Islamic State affiliate, claimed responsibility for the\n\nAgainst this background, at the 2016 Defence Ministerial Meeting, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) defence ministers officially recognized cyberspace as a new frontier of warfare, and that decision was endorsed at the 2016 Warsaw Summit. Now, the Allies “recognize cyberspace as a domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea”. Certainly, the change comes as a response to the increasing number of cyberattacks against both the organization and its member states. The threat posed by these attacks even prompted former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security to declare that cyberattacks “now exceed the risk of physical attacks” in terms of breadth and range of possible outcomes. And such attacks show no sign of decreasing, as the aforementioned examples demonstrate.\nAlthough the persistence of cyberattacks might be due, in part, to the relative availability and fairly low cost of the technology needed to mount an attack, it might also largely result from the difficulty in identifying its perpetrators and attributing blame. The structure of the Internet, which “was not designed with the goal of deterrence in mind”, provides the perfect setting for state and non-state actors to take part in malicious activity unafraid of attribution or retaliation. Worse still, aggressors are able to conceal themselves and the full effects of their operations by using technical mechanisms and/or relying on non-state proxies that they rent or compromise. For example, the cyberattacks that hit Estonia originated from at least 177\nattacks, but as the investigations began, it became clear that the jihadist group was just a cover-up (Corera 2016). The private company FireEye ultimately attributed the attack to Russian hackers.\n In 2015, in the middle of the presidential election, the DNC suffered a cyberattack, resulting in the exfiltration of files and emails, many of which were published by WikiLeaks. In 2016, the DNC publicly attributed the attack to two distinct Russian espionage groups, APT28 and APT29 (Egloff 2019, 13). Although it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to assess the full damage of the cyber intrusion, it is understood to have played a major role in the 58th U.S. presidential election (Davis II et al. 2017, 34).\n Allison 2018; Banks 2019, 191.\n Barnes, 2016.\n Ablon et al. 2019, 1.\n NATO, Warsaw Summit Communiqué (July 2016), n.70.\n Nielsen 2018.\n Payne and Finlay 2017, 556; Boerbert 2010, 43.\n Tran 2018, 381.\n Supra note 10, at 1.\n Supra note 24.\n Carlin 2016, 409; Carr 2010, 139-40.\ncountries, including from within the Estonian territory. Evidence has been found that attackers also obscure their identities through the adoption of foreign languages and elements of malware previously associated with other actors, and they might even exploit existing animosities in order to mask their identity and thus hinder attribution efforts. By way of one example, the escalating tension between Iran and the United States suggests that both countries would be unwilling to fully cooperate in the case of a cyberattack, making Iran the perfect cover-up for third-party states and non-state actors attempting to launch a cyberattack against the USA and vice versa. It is therefore understood that attributing cyberattacks is vastly time-consuming and an “inherently interdisciplinary” process, requiring great technical and non-technical expertise and input from a range of actors and sources. In this regard, taking into account the effort necessary for its fulfilment, cyber-attribution was considered to be “an art as much as a science”.\nThe Estonian attacks are a prime example of how challenging the attribution of cyberattacks can be; thirteen years have passed and one cannot affirm whether the attacks were officially sanctioned by the Russian government or whether they were perpetrated by rogue spies or even by independent nationalistic criminals. It is important to bear in mind that, in the cyber domain, attribution differs from punishment, and it is defined as “identifying the agent responsible for the action”. Since cyberattacks have proliferated and become commonplace, attribution has grown in relevance. As a result, states have been investing resources and political capital to develop accountable attribution mechanisms in order to deter potential cyberattackers.\nIn spite of the fact that determining the machines that launched a cyberattack is no longer an arduous task for the most developed countries, identifying the individuals, organizations, or governments that are legally responsible for the attack continues to be challenging. The attribution of cyberattacks presents unique legal challenges because states were not able to reach a broad international agreement on how to govern the cyber domain and the current\n Payne and Finlay 2017, 560.\n Supra note 12.\n Ibid; Payne and Finlay 2019, 203.\n Egloff and Wenger 2019, 3\n Banks 2017, 1503.\n Rid and Buchanan 2015, 7.\n Supra note 12.\n Lindsay 2015, 57.\n Supra note 10.\n Banks 2019, 191.\n Supra note 38, at 192.\ninternational legal framework does little to control cyber operations. On this matter, Schmitt and Vihul believe that even if agreement were to be reached on a multilateral binding cyber treaty, it would probably be undermined by states’ individual reservations. Similarly, according to Mačák, there seems to be a resistance to the codification of international rules applicable to cyberspace.\nIn addition, as cyber operations usually happen in secrecy, customary international law is not able to develop understandings or recognize state practice about attributing responsibility for cyberattacks. Further complicating the issue, governments have been unwilling to clearly express *opinio juris* on topics associated with the cyber domain. This attitude might be the result of a domestic political deadlock, a calculated waiting strategy, or even the product of the “cybersecurity knowledge gap”. Nevertheless, this state reticence contributes to the enduring ambiguity of international cyber law. It is also important to point out that no international organization, agency, or entity has the legal authority to attribute responsibility for a cyberattack. Due to this institutional legal vacuum, seldom do governments make official attribution claims, and, in the rare occasion that they do, their statements are normally perceived\n Supra note 25, at 384.\n Schmitt and Vihul 2016, 39. As codified in Article 2(d) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), reservation is “a unilateral statement, however phrased or named, made by a State, when signing, ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to a treaty, whereby it purports to exclude or to modify the legal effect of certain provisions of the treaty in their application to that State” (United Nations, *Vienna Convention on the law of treaties*, 23 May 1969, vol. 1155,1-18232, art. 2(d)).\nIt is perhaps useful to point out that some scholars have indicated that a successful agreement might be almost impossible to achieve, at least in the near future. For instance, Waxman believes that “not only do certain features of cyber-activities make international legal regulation very difficult, but major actors also have divergent strategic interests that will pull their preferred doctrinal interpretations and aspirations in different directions, impeding formations of a stable international consensus” (Waxman 2011, 425-26). On this point, Goldsmith argues that “the fundamental clash of interests concerning the regulation of electronic communications, the deep constrains the United States would have to adopt to receive reciprocal benefits in a cybersecurity treaty, and the debilitating verification problems will combine to make it unfeasible to create a cybersecurity treaty that purports to constrain governments”. (Goldsmith 2011, 12).\n Mačák 2017, 5.\n Mačák 2016, 130. About the high classified nature of state practice in cyberspace, Clarke and Knake state that “the entire phenomenon of cyber war is shrouded in such government secrecy that it makes the Cold War look like a time of openness and transparency” (Clarke and Knake 2010, xi). Also, Efrony and Shany try to explain the absence of transparency in cyberspace; for them, states believe that transparency may reveal “their vulnerabilities, adversely affect their offensive or defensive capabilities, and weaken their power of deterrence” (Efrony and Shany 2018, 631).\n Supra note 38, at 194.\n Among the notable exceptions, the USA stands out with its International Strategy for Cyberspace (United States, The White House, *International Strategy for Cyberspace: Property, Security, and Openness in a Networked World*, May 2011).\n Schmitt and Watts 2015, 211.\n Singer and Friedman 2014, 4-8.\n Supra note 43, at 130.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, scholars, cyber-experts, and international stakeholders have been attempting to bridge the gap with their views on how international law applies to cyberspace. These non-state-driven initiatives are trying to promote a safe international system and reduce the chances of conflict arising from cyberattacks by filling the void created by states’ reluctance to undertake the international law-making process. The most important and comprehensive of these attempts certainly is the Tallinn Manual project, which is under the auspices of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE). This project, however, is neither an international treaty on cyber law nor does it offer a new set of international rules nor represent the position of any country or organization. Rather, it is a restatement of international law as it is (lex lata), establishing a comprehensive legal structure for the governance of cyber operations during both times of peace and conflict. Considering the Tallinn project’s non-state and non-binding nature, one is then left to question its actual relevance to public international law, which still is very much attached to state-centric assumptions and foundations of the early formative stage of the international legal regime.\nOn this basis, my main argument lies heavily on the idea that the current international legal framework is underdeveloped vis-à-vis cyber-attribution, as its norms and principles were designed to the physical world and still, at present, mainly govern the relationship between states. Cyberspace, on the other end of the spectrum, is predominantly inhabited by non-state\n Supra note 2, at 19. It is interesting to highlight that attributing cyberattacks to states is a new phenomenon (Eichensehr 2019b ,7-8). For instance, the first official public accusation by the USA only came in 2014, when five Chinese military hackers were criminally charged for cyberespionage against U.S. corporations (The United States, Department of Justice, May 19 2014).\n By attribution problem, I refer to the difficulty in discovering the identity or location of the responsible for a cyberattack or their intermediary.\n Supra note 25, at 384; Supra note 31, at 205.\n Supra note 32, at 1495.\n Supra note 31, at 205.\n Chircop 2018, 653.\n Supra note 42, at 1.\n Despite NATO’s sponsorship, the Tallinn Manuals do not reflect the official position of the Alliance.\n Supra note 32, at 1494.\nactors and, as Libicki aptly put it, is divided between the physical, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic layers. As it stands now, international law fails in coping with contemporary challenges posed by cyberspace and the rapid development of ICTs, notably the attribution of cyberattacks. As will be developed below, this practical gap not only hinders the cyber-attribution process, but also threatens international security on an equivalent scale to traditional armed attacks.\nAlthough literature on cybersecurity normally perceives the attribution problem as a technical issue, due to the significant technological advancements experienced in the last decade, attribution is already “more nuanced, more common, and more political” than it is acknowledged. It is therefore understood that the solution to this dangerous situation lies within the legal and political domains, not in the technical realm. Non-state initiatives have been trying to overcome this legal quagmire, but the international legal system still is inherently attached to a state-centric approach. Therefore, no set of international binding rules as far as cybersecurity is concerned will ever likely be achieved without the participation of states.\nConsidering that so many aspects of our lives are now bound up with cyberspace, the discussion about cyber-attribution is not only pertinent but also urgent. Such a delicate situation deserves to be taken most seriously and it would be unduly ambitious to try to provide a full answer in this study. My purpose, however, is to make a modest attempt at shedding some light on the issue. Ideally, this may contribute to a constructive debate about the problem of attributing blame for cyberattacks.\nThe following research question was articulated in order to function as the backbone of the work here presented: to what extent is international law underdeveloped vis-à-vis cyber-attribution? Also, as a means to enlighten the path of this study, the following sub-questions were established: why does cyber-attribution matter? What are the legal and political challenges imposed by the attribution problem? How the difficulty in attributing blame of a cyberattack affects international security?\nIn order to carry out the aforementioned study, a qualitative research of a doctrinal nature will be applied. Mainly, this will be a legal work based on primary and secondary legal sources. Parallel to the legal background, this study will also endeavour to apply the International Relations’ concept of security dilemma to cyberspace. By bringing this concept to the\n Supra note 42, at 14.\n Libicki 2007, 236-37.\n Supra note 54, at 652.\n Supra note 33, at 6.\n Eichensehr 2019b, 2.\n\nIn international relations theory, Realism, also known as political realism, is one of the dominants schools of thought. Realists depict an anarchical, competitive and conflictual world, in which insecurity among states is inescapable. Note that ‘anarchical’ is used here in a technical sense, indicating the dearth of an overarching, political authority at the international level. Under anarchy, states are the main actors in the international arena and their primary responsibility is to secure their own interests, especially their survival. In order to do so, according to the realist theory, states will attempt to acquire power and engage in power-balancing, creating what Hoffman called “a state of war”.\nThe interstate political order is, therefore, a self-help system plagued by “uncertainty, weapons and fear”, and in which power plays the leading role in shaping the relation between states. As long as we accept the basic premises of the realist theory, this hostile and insecure environment not only leaves little room for international cooperation, but also encourages “behaviour that leaves all concerned worse off than they could be, even in the extreme case in\n This study will not differentiate Realism into its various strands since this warrant a more extended discussion that I can here give it. It is perhaps useful to point out, however, that realism is normally contrasted with liberalism or idealism, which tend to focus on international cooperation. Compared to these theories, the realist perspective is undeniably pessimistic. As Keohane put it, realism is “the language of power and interests rather than of ideals or norms” (Keohane 1986, 9).\n Wheeler and Booth 2007, 2.\n Waltz 1979, 91. Waltz points out that, “internationally, the environment of states’ actions, or the structure of their system, is set by the fact that some states prefer survival over other ends obtainable in the short run and act with relative efficiency to achieve that end” (Waltz, 1979, 93). On this topic, Jervis identifies throughout his book, entitled *Perception and Misperception in International Politics*, some states that did not have survival as their primary goal. For instance, During Hitler’s government, Germany valued territorial expansion over security (Jervis 2017).\n According to Andersen, balance of power is “a mechanism that ideally would make states intentionally or unintentionally join the weaker part against the strong, to equal out or balance the distribution of power amongst states in the international system” and states “would do this to assure their own survival” (Andersen 2018, 1).\n Hoffmann defines ‘state of war’ as “a competition of units in the kind of state of nature that knows no restrains other than those which the changing necessities of the game and the shallow convenience of the players impose” (Hoffmann 1965, vii).\n *Supra note* 65.\n Korab-Karpowicz 2017. It is important to note that Wendt argues, through the lenses of Constructivism, that “self-help and power politics are institutions, and not essential features of anarchy. Anarchy is what states make of it” (Wendt 1992, 395).\n Waltz points out two reasons why international cooperation is limited by anarchy: insecurity and unequal gains. In an anarchic international system, states are not certain about each other’s intentions and they fear that cooperation might favour one state in detriment of the others, creating some kind of dependence. He argues that “[s]tates do not willingly place themselves in situations of increased dependence. In a self-help system, considerations of security subordinate economic gain to political interest” (*Supra note* 66, at 107).\n\n## 2.1 What is the security dilemma?\nAccording to Wheeler and Booth, the security dilemma is the quintessential dilemma in interstate politics. Coined by Herz (1950) and Butterfield (1951), the term has since become an integral part of any discourse on international security and has been expanded and employed to “address many of the most important questions of international relations theory and security policy”. Both authors describe the security dilemma as a situation where the increase of a state’s security simultaneously (and unintentionally) decreases the security of other states. The risk here is that misperceptions and conflict spirals dramatically increase the chances of unnecessary or avoidable armed conflicts.\nFor instance, a state might attempt to increase its own security and avert aggression by acquiring more weapons, bringing them to a higher state of readiness, or creating alliances. Under anarchy, an adversarial state will get the wrong impression about this behaviour, interpreting it as a preparatory action for future attacks. This state will thus fell threatened and will take action to enhance its own security. The first state will have confirmed its suspicions about its adversary’s belligerence, increasing tension and leading to an arms race or even war. In this scenario, conflict is not the product of the actual intentions and military capabilities of a specific actor. Rather, it is the result of mutual misperceptions and miscommunications that arise from the inability of states to understand each other’s intentions and motives with complete\n Jervis 1978, 167.\n Carlsnaes et al. 2002, 372; Montgomery 2006, 183.\n Schweller 1996, 116. Note that, according to Mearsheimer, “the best way for a state to survive in anarchy is to take advantage of other states and gain power at their expenses” (Mearsheimer 2001, 36).\n Supra note 65, at 29.\n Glaser 1997, 172.\n Jervis describes the security dilemma as a situation where “many of the means by which a state tries to increase its security decreases the security of others” (Supra note 71, at 169-70). Likewise, Glaser explains that the security dilemma exists when a “state’s effort to increase its security would have the unintended effect of reducing its adversary’s security” (Glaser 2010, 56). Montgomery, on the other hand, sees the security dilemma as primarily an issue of perception; he describes it as “the situation where one state’s attempt to increase its security appear threatening to others and provoke an unnecessary conflict” (Montgomery 2006, 151).\nconfidence. In this sense, as Herz points out, “it is one of the tragic implications of the security dilemma that mutual fear of what initially may never have existed may subsequently bring about what is feared the most”. Note that this is a “fertile version” of the philosophical problem of Other Minds, that is, “how one mind can ever know what is in the mind of another”.\nThe difficulty in correctly perceiving other’s intentions is related to the fact that many of the methods by which a state attempts to enhance its security will certainly make other states feel less secure. Jervis notes that, at the domestic level, individuals can attempt to increase their safety in several ways without jeopardizing others; one can, for instance, put bars on the windows, move to a safer area, and avoid dark streets. At the international level, however, “one state’s gain in security often inadvertently threatens others”. The Cold War is a prime example of this. Both the United States’ and the Soviet Union’s efforts to increase their security had the unintended consequence of decreasing the security of the other superpower, leading to a spiral in which they accumulate more military capabilities without making themselves more secure.\nOn top of this, there is what Wheeler and Booth described as the “inherent ambiguity of weapons”. Since most weapons can be used for both defensive and offensive purposes, it is incredibly difficult for decision-makers to foresee with certainty when and how arms may be used by other states. On this topic, Jervis asserts that “[u]nless the requirement for offense and defence differ in kind or amount, a status quo power will desire a military posture that resembles that of an aggressor. For this reason, others cannot infer from its military forces and preparations whether the state is aggressive”. Armament, therefore, is the material reality that initiates the security dilemma.\n Gunitskiy 2011, 595; Supra note 65, at 4. Mearsheimer argues that governments can never be sure of the intentions of other states and that “intentions are impossible to divine with 100 percent certainty”. He also highlights that “intentions can change quickly, so a state’s intentions can be benign one day and hostile the next. Uncertainty about intentions is unavoidable, which means that states can never be sure that other states do not have offensive intentions to go along with their offensive capabilities” (Supra note 74, 2001, at 31).\n Herz 1959, 241.\n Hollis and Smith 1990, 171-172.\n Supra note 71, at 169-70.\n Ibid.\n Jervis 2017, xiii-xiv.\n Tang 2009, 594. On this topic, Libicki explains that “[d]uring the Cold War, when deterrence was the only feasible response to threat posed by the other side’s nuclear weapons, any attempt to build more weapons of bring them to a higher state of readiness [...] would alarm the other side who would feel impelled to do likewise” (Libicki 2016, 129).\n Supra note 65, at 4.\n Supra note 83, at 64. Therefore, even benign, security-seeking actors can be dragged into an arms race.\n Supra note 65, at 1.\n\nCertainly, Herz’s and Butterfield’s original formulations of the security dilemma were an interesting development from the realist school of thought. In its classical form, however, the concept may be of limited use in analysing the modern international system, which has a well-establish legal framework regulating the use of force, and in which most states are no longer threatened whether by war or external aggression. But this does not mean that the security dilemma is irrelevant or even obsolete for international security studies. On the contrary, it remains an extremely important tool for both policymakers and scholars since it can and has been reconceptualized to address modern challenges, including cyber-security ones.\n Supra note 83, at 66.\n Supra note 74, at 117.\n Supra note 75, at 31. “If the threat posed by one state to another [...] is accurately perceived [...] then the situation cannot be classified as a security ‘dilemma’. It is simply a security ‘problem’, albeit perhaps a difficult one”.\n Supra note 74, at 117. This argument generates an obvious puzzle, however: how can one know if threats are real or just apparent?\n Supra note 65.\n Note that realism is hardly the only school of thought to use the concept. The security dilemma has been broadly employed by liberals (see Doyle 1983; Oneal and Russett 1999; Cederman 2001), neoliberals (see Axelrod and Keohane 1985), constructivists (see Wendt 1995), to name a few.\n Bluth 2011, 1375.\n# Chapter 3 – The Attribution Problem\nOne threshold issue in discussing cyber-attribution involves the definition of attribution itself, a question that certainly pervades all literature about this topic. At the most general level, ‘attribution’ refers to the identification of the responsible entity for a malicious cyberattack. What is understood by ‘responsible entity’, however, can vary. There are usually three types of answers: the specific computing device used to carry out an attack, the individual pressing the keys that launch an attack, and ultimately the party that supervised and controlled the attack. According to Lin, even though “these three types of attribution are conceptually distinct, they are often related in practice”. Particularly, identifying the machine from which an attack was launched might provide some clues that can assist unveil the human attacker’s identity, which in turn can help determine the individual or entity responsible for authorizing or acquiescing the cyber operation. Still, each of these types offer different challenges, increasing the difficulty of the attribution process.\nAlthough attributing cyberattacks is not a new challenge, the attribution debate is developing “surprisingly slowly”. Scholars and experts have been dwelling upon the subject and hold a full spectrum of views on it. At the positive end of the spectrum are those, like Rid and Buchanan, who argue that cyber-attribution is not only possible, but “it has been happening successfully for a long time”. Lindsay strikes a more restrained yet positive note, by characterizing attribution as difficult, but acknowledging that there are strong systems for identifying the source of intrusions and responding to attacks, with an increasingly amount of investments being devoted to investigations. At the other end of the spectrum, Singer and Friedman characterize attribution as “[p]erhaps the most difficult problem” in cyberspace, and Eun and Aßmann argue that “determining the real aggressor is impossible unless the aggressor admits to it”. Shackelford further echoes this idea by affirming that sophisticated cyberattacks are “nearly impossible to trace to their sources”.\n---\n Ibid., 5.\n Lin 2016, 5.\n Ibid., 13.\n Supra note 12, at 955.\n Supra note 33, at 5.\n Ibid., 31.\n Supra note 36.\n Supra note 48, at 73.\n Eun and Aßmann 2016, 355.\n Shackelford 2010, 200. Brecher share the same idea that cyberattacks “can be nearly impossible to attribute definitively to their sources” (Brecher 2012, 423).\n3.1 Why is attribution so difficult?\nThere are a number of answers to this question. First, many academics and experts suggest that the difficulty in attributing blame for cyberattacks is mainly due to the intrinsic characteristics of the cyber domain. The structural anonymity, which has been one of the hallmarks and biggest strengths of the Internet, provides the perfect venue for state and non-state actors to undertake malicious operations without fearing attribution or retaliation. The Internet, as Lindsay points out, “was designed to make connections easy and reliable even when the true identity of the connector and the path of the connection were unknown; security did not figure strongly in its early design”. Lupovici, however, seems to disagree on the premise that cyberspace is an inherently anonymous domain. Even though he recognizes that some aspects of the Internet make harder to attribute an attack, he argues that anonymity is a socially attributed trait and, therefore, cyberspace could be structured in a way that does not uphold this characteristic. Along this line of thinking, McConnell suggests that the only solution for the attribution problem is redesigning the Internet so that attribution and geolocation are more feasible. Such a change, however, would be a massive undertaking and probably would not help to prevent the increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks that are being launched today. At the same time, reengineering the entire computer network would reduce its efficiency and dependability, and would bring into question characteristics of the current Internet, such as freedom of action and privacy, that are treasured by many, including intelligence agencies.\nSecond, cyber-attribution is further complicated by the fact that hackers have at their disposal a variety of programs, techniques and applications to conceal the identity of their own Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and thus to thwart detection. One common practice that attackers employ to hide their online trail is to break into poorly secured internet servers or even personal computers and use them as proxies through which they can launch a cyberattack.\n Lupovic 2016, 322; Supra note 25, at 387.\n Lindsay 2013, 375-76.\n Supra note 74, at 330. Lupovici further argues that the current assumption that anonymity is inherent to the cyber domain might affect states’ policies. “Defenders, discouraged from relying on cyber deterrence, may refuse to invest in efforts to establish it. This will decrease the efficiency of cyber deterrence and, as a result, reinforce the existing common knowledge that this strategy is doomed to fail”. (Supra note 104, at 331).\n McConnell 2010.\n Supra note 10, at 3. For instance, Rid argues that McConnell suggestion “is not only unrealistic, it would not even solve the problem at hand” (Rid 2013, 140-41). For Tran, “even if the Internet could arduously be redesigned to authenticate the source IP address of every bit of data sent over the Internet, these addresses would accomplish the goal of merely identifying the source machine of an attack, and not a person, thereby creating another degree of attenuation between an attack and the attacker” (Tran 2018, 390).\n Ibid.\n Greenemeier 2011.\n\"The IP address therefore does not present the attacked state with a physical location to blame or even attack in response. The discovered server could be located in a neutral, friendly or even your own country\". According to Lipson, \"an IP address is a poor surrogate on which to establish a basis for trustworthiness\". The cyberattacks that hit Estonia, for instance, originated from at least 177 countries, such as the United States, Russia, Peru, Egypt, and Estonian itself. As Brenner effectively observed, \"the Internet is one big masquerade ball. You can hide behind aliases, you can hide behind proxy servers, and you can surreptitiously enslave other computers without their owners' knowledge – and then use their computers to do your dirty work\". Another prime example of a technology available to obfuscate one's traces in cyberspace is the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) Marble Framework, which is capable of altering the language of the code from English to another foreign language, such as Chinese, Russian, Korean, Arabic and Farsi.\nIn this regard, Dinstein argues that future technological improvements will probably overcome the challenges that prevent cyber-attribution. Indeed, governments are more capable of attributing responsibility for cyberattacks than they were a decade ago, and these technological advancements and innovations have boosted states' confidence. For example, in 2014, Canada indicated to possess robust systems in place that allow the detection of highly sophisticated attacks, even those launched by state-sponsored actors and, in 2015, the United Kingdom's Chancellor affirmed that \"we are increasingly confident in our ability to determine from where attacks come\". It is important to bear in mind, however, that the technical realm is so \"dynamic\" that new technologies both enhance and hinder states' ability to attribute malicious attacks, generating \"a cycle of escalating offensive and defensive capabilities\".\nThird, even if it is possible to overcome all the technological issues mentioned above and identify the machine used to carry out a cyberoperation with sufficient certainty, cyber-\n Supra note 102.\n Lipson 2002, 56.\n Roscini 2010, 97; Supra note 28.\n Brenner 2011, 13.\n Mueller et al. 2019, 110; Leyden 2017.\n Dinstein 2002, 112. Similarly, Roscini argues that \"further developments in computer technology and Internet regulations might also make it easier to identify the source of the cyberattack\" (Roscini 2010, 97)\n Supra note 42, at 23\n Canada, Statement by the Chief Information Officer for the Government of Canada (July 29, 2014).\n United Kingdom, Chancellor's speech to GCHQ on cybersecurity (November 17, 2015).\n Supra note 33, 1510.\n The improvements in technical attribution might be matched over time by developments in attackers' abilities to conceal their identities, and this \"cat-and-mouse game\" will continue to cyber-attribution difficult. Supra note 93, at 9.\nattribution remains challenging due to what has been called the “human machine gap” or “entry-point anonymity”. That is to say, attribution can only be accomplished if the individual or organization who was operating the computing device can also be identified. With this in mind, it should be noted that rarely does the location of a computer provide precise conclusions vis-à-vis the machine operator’s identity. Therefore, knowing that a cyberattack was executed on the territory of a state, or from the governmental cyber framework of a state, is not enough to attribute said attack to that state.\nFourth, it may be quite difficult to determine the ultimately responsible entity as far as state responsibility is concerned. Even if it is possible to overcome all the technological challenges and identify the human attacker, there remains the question of whether or not there is a relationship between the individual pressing the keys and the state actor. Is the attacker an officially sanctioned government agent? Or is it a third party operating on their own? Deibert, Rohozinski, and Crete-Nishihata acknowledge that there is an increasing tendency towards privateering cyberattacks, and states are particularly interested in this market since it “allows them to execute their missions once removed and clandestinely, thus offering plausible deniability and avoiding responsibilities under international law or the laws of armed conflict”.\nMoving to the legal aspect of attribution, a state will only be held responsible for an internationally wrongful action that is attributable to the state under public international law or that constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the state. On this point, it is important to note that, traditionally, there has been an extremely high bar for establishing state responsibility for acts of non-state actors. Drawing from the International Law Commission’s (ILC) Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, a state can be held liable for the conduct of a non-state actor if the latter is “acting on the instruction of, or under the direction or control of” the state. Note that, sadly, the concepts of ‘instructions’,\n Geiß and Lahmann 2009, 625\n Supra note 111.\n Supra note 120.\n Supra note 55, at 646.\n Deibert, Rohozinski, and Crete-Nishihata 2012, 17.\n International Law Commission, Draft Articles of Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, November 2001, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), art. 2. It is important to note that the ILC’s rules are not a treaty and therefore they are not binding on any state. Yet, these rules were commended by the UN General Assembly in 2012 (UN Doc. A/RES/56/83) and have been mentioned 154 times by international courts, tribunals, and other bodies. (United Nations Legislative Series, Materials on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, 2012, ST/LEG/SER.B/25, viii).\n Supra note 31, at 204.\n Ibid., art. 8.\n'direct', and 'control' all need further explanation. According to the commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility, 'instruction' comprises private individuals or groups acting as an auxiliary of the state. More problematic issues, however, arise in determining the concepts of 'direction' and 'control', for the commentary falls short and does not explain the difference between both of them. Rather, it only says that the terms are \"disjunctive\". International tribunals have also failed to make a distinction between the three concepts with any level of detail. Therefore, as Schmitt put it, \"the prevailing approach tends towards a binary distinction in which either a state tells a non-state actor to perform an act (instruction or direction) or the state exercises 'effective control' over the non-state actor with respect to the act in question\".\nThe effective control test was coined by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in its Nicaragua v. United States of America judgement. Even though the Court does not provide a definition for the expression, it has asserted that a state's participation in the form of \"financing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping\" the non-state actor does not rise to the degree of effective control. In this sense, for example, supplying malware to a terrorist group would not result in state responsibility. In fact, even if the state plans the whole operation and selects the military targets, it still would not be enough to result in attribution. Furthermore, taking into considerations the technical challenges aforementioned, determining that a hacker was under the effective control of a nation-state at relevant time is probably impossible. For instance, the 2007 cyberattacks targeting Estonia were partially attributed to the pro-Kremlin youth group Nashi, but it is not clear whether Russia was involved in the incident.\nIn Prosecutor v. Tadic, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) lowered the threshold by adopting the much less restrictive overall control test, which\n Schmitt 2017b, 9.\n International Law Commission, Draft Article of Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with Commentaries, November 2001, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), art. 8, para. 2.\n Ibid., para. 7.\n Supra note 99.\n International Court of Justice, Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, 27 June 1986, para. 115.\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n Supra note 29, at 563.\n Supra note 9, at 23-24. On this topic, Schmitt and Vihul note that care should be taken when assuming state sponsorship of non-state cyberoperations because non-state actors can launch cyberattacks at a \"fairly low cost and without access to the technical wherewithal of states\" (Schmitt and Vihul 2014, 56).\n\nRegardless of whether effective control or overall control ultimately suits the cyber domain, the attribution bar continues to be extremely high. As a result, states are prevented from adopting any lawful response to a cyberattack, including their inherent right to self-defence, encouraging retaliatory operations outside the existing legal structure. Against this background, some scholars have suggested that one possible solution to these legal challenges is to lower the attribution standard. Schmitt, for instance, defended an indirect responsibility approach by which a state might be held responsible for the consequences of non-state actors’ unlawful operations on its territory “when it fails to take reasonably available measures to stop such acts in breach of its obligations to other states”. Lowering the attribution bar, however, increases the chances of misattribution and conflict escalation.\nFifth, another factor that contributes to the difficulty of attributing cyberattacks is the presence of dynamic and sophisticated non-state actors. Traditionally, states and non-state actors were distinguished by significant imbalances not only in legal status, but also in resources and capabilities. The cyber domain, however, seems to offer great opportunities for non-state actors to challenge and, in some situations, to overcome states’ hegemony. Indeed, today these entities need as much or more attention than other international player due to their ability to profoundly disturb international peace and security. Nevertheless, these actors “enjoy a relative degree of impunity” for the harmful effects of their actions since international law does not offer a tailored framework based on which non-state actors can be held responsible for unlawful acts. In this sense, an adequate legal response to the attribution problem should\n United Nations, International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, *Prosecutor v.

The investigation of cyberattacks is a complex process that requires detailed analysis of technical data, as well as a deep comprehension of political and economic motivations$^{147}$. Consequently, as Sheldon points out, “the forensics of attribution can rarely, if ever, give immediate results and can take days if not weeks to provide solid technical evidence”$^{148}$. Further, former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defence William Lynn III recognized the struggle to attribute cyberattacks, observing that “[t]he forensic work necessary to identify an attacker may take months, if identification is possible at all”$^{149}$. Cyber-attribution, however, is nearly useless if it takes too long and is not able to identify all the actors involved in the attack$^{150}$.\nThese are the numerous hurdles, both technological and legal, that have been oft-mentioned as a hindrance to the development of an effective legal framework for governing cyberattacks$^{151}$. In spite of the fact that previous literature on cybersecurity perceived the attribution problem as an insurmountable technical issue, recent scholars and experts have begun to acknowledge that actual attribution might not be rocket science after all$^{152}$. As Carlin aptly put it, “although attribution is difficult, it is far from impossible”$^{153}$.\n## 3.2 Why does cyber-attribution matter?\nConsidering the number of obstacles that significantly limit cyber-attribution, one is then left to question whether or not the matter is worth international society’s attention. What are the purposes of attributing blame for a cyberattack? Why should states and international stakeholders endeavour to solve the attribution problem?\n$^{146}$ Supra note 13, at 956.\n$^{147}$ Supra note 3, at 2.\n$^{148}$ Sheldon 2014, 289-90\n$^{149}$ Lynn III 2010, 99.\n$^{150}$ Carlin 2016, 409. The duration of the investigation is relevant for cyber-attribution because if a targeted state takes too long to respond, any countermeasures adopted may be seen as punishment, forbidden under public international law. On the other hand, if a targeted state engages in countermeasures too early and has wrongfully attributed the cyberattack, it will have committed an internationally wrongful act itself.\n$^{151}$ According to Shackelford, “the international law doctrine of attribution is in fact an essential ground for regulating cyberattacks” (Shackelford 2008, 233).\n$^{152}$ “Actual attribution of cyber events is already more nuanced, more common, and more political than the literature has acknowledged so far” (Supra note 62).\n$^{153}$ Supra note 119.\nTo start with, cyber-attribution function goes well beyond the mere identification of the responsible entity for a malicious cyberattack; it also serves as a legitimizing tool to justify both formal and informal sanctioning behaviour to other international actors. According to Article 22 of the ILC’s Draft Articles on State Responsibility, a state that has been the target of an internationally wrongful act may adopt countermeasures – actions that would otherwise be unlawful. In order to do so, the victim state must identify the state actor which is responsible for the internationally wrongful act. Eichensehr argues that “[s]uch an attribution could be done privately, but if so, the victim state would risk other states viewing its countermeasures as an initial wrongful act, rather than a lawful response”. Tran adds to the discussion by explaining that even in situations where formal law is not the answer, states would still be required to attribute responsibility in order to implement any informal method of sanctioning the attacker. Thus, attribution is a crucial and necessary prerequisite to any further legal action, be it countermeasures, diplomatic responses or any other informal kind of response. Consequently, it is not unreasonable to assume that solving the attribution problem is the pivotal first step to establish any functioning system of law that regulates cyberattacks.\nAdditionally, publicly attributing the blame for a cyberattack, and consequently sharing specific aspects of it, may help network defenders identify possible vulnerabilities in the system and, thus, prevent future attacks. It is often cited that, in some cases, attribution may also lead to macro-level deterrence. By identifying the culprits of a cyberattack, states are able to publicly name and shame them. Potentially, this practice will cause the named actor, and even third parties, to refrain from future operations. For instance, in 2014, the USA criminally charged five Chinese military hackers for cyberespionage against U.S. corporations and “[f]or a period of time following the indictments, there was a very significant decrease” in Chinese\n Supra note 25, 386.\n “The wrongfulness of an act of a State not in conformity with an international obligation towards another State is precluded if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State” (Supra note 96, art. 22).\n According to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, “countermeasures are actions or omissions by an injured State directed against a responsible State that would violate an obligation owed by the former to the latter” (Supra note 15, 111, rule 20 (1)). Note that countermeasures cannot be taken by non-state actors since they are reserved to states. Similarly, such measures cannot be taken against non-state actors, except when their (cyber) actions are attributable to a state actor. “This is because only states commit, as a matter of law, internationally wrongful acts” (Supra note 7, at 606). Also, Banks argues that countermeasures were created to compel a state to desist in its unlawful actions, not as punishment (Supra note 33, at 1502).\n Supra note 96, art. 49.\n Supra note 63, at 29.\n Supra note 25, at 383-84.\n Supra note 3, at 3.\n Supra note 63, at 25\ncyberactivity. Furthermore, publicly attributing responsibility for cyberattacks might create micro-level deterrence, which is related with the adoption of domestic legal procedures and economic sanctions. According to Goldsmith and Williams, the costs of these measures “are not nothing; would-be state-sponsored cyber-intruders and their principals surely take them into account”. Micro-level deterrence, therefore, could be more successful than its macro-level counterpart. According to Finnemore and Hollis, publicly attributing cyberattacks promote “interactions between the accuser, the accused, and third-party audiences that – over time – may result in the creation of a new norm”. Note, however, that public attribution alone may not be sufficient to deter malicious cyberactivity or produce cyber accountability, particularly if the responsible actor does not care if his/her identity and behaviour are made public.\nFrom an international relations perspective, states and international stakeholders should care about the attribution problem due to its capacity to deteriorate the international political environment. As noted earlier, attributing blame for a cyberattack is no easy task and thus the chances of a malicious cyber operation being framed wrongfully is extremely high. Indeed, misattribution is substantially more likely vis-à-vis cyberattacks than traditional kinetic warfare. With this in mind, one should be cognizant that there is a tendency to explain malicious cyber incidents in terms of geopolitical conditions and existing rivalries, particularly soon after a cyberattack when there is a haste to identify the culprits, to strengthen defences and to retaliate. The 2007 Estonian cyberattack provides one of the clearest examples of this tendency. Due to past Russian actions and the political atmosphere at the time, the attack was attributed to Russia and this explanation was later questioned by cyber experts. A yet more recently example is the 2015 Ukraine power grid cyberattack. Ukraine’s intelligence community was quick to blame Russia for the attack because it was perceived as an escalation of the conflict\n Nakashima 2015.\n To build upon the previous example, in addition to the criminal charges, the Chinese hackers cannot travel to the United States or other country with which it has extradition treaty; if they do, they could be extradited to the USA and face trial. Nor can they engage in financial transactions that touches the U.S. or other sanctioning state financial system.\n Goldsmith and Williams 2018.\n Nevertheless, Eichensehr explains that the effectiveness of micro-level deterrence might vary according to the nationality of the hackers (“losing the ability to travel or to store money in Western Europe may be less of a blow to North Korean hackers than to Russians”), and depends on the level of coercion to which the cyber-attackers are subject (“[i]f their actions on behalf of their government are not voluntary, then the hackers will not alter their behaviour in response”) (Supra note 63, at 27).\n Finnemore and Hollis 2019, 10-11.\n Supra note 29, at 556\n Supra note 13, at 960. Besides heightening the risk of misattribution, this tendency to blame the most obvious culprits prevents alternative explanations from being developed, as well as invites lesser rivals or non-state actors to provoke hostilities. Schulzke argues that “[a]s the risk of being caught diminishes, the costs of attack decrease and the potential benefits become even more attractive” (Supra note 13, at 961).\n\nIt is perhaps useful to underline that the most active participants in the cyber domain are also some of the world’s most powerful states, to wit: The United States, Russia and China. Taking into account that each of these states are equipped with a nuclear armoury, misattributing a cyberattacks could trigger off destructive conflicts with potential to threat the whole international system, putting a premium on a confident degree of cyber-attribution. On top of this, the relative availability and fairly low cost of the technology necessary to launch an attack in cyberspace “leaves the potential for mass destruction within the grasp of far less sophisticated non-state actors and organizations”. So, it does not take much imagination to see the potential threats an unregulated cyber domain pose to international security, economy and also to states’ infrastructure.\nIn this regard, inspired by great theorists such as Thomas Schelling, Robert Jervis, and John Herz, among others, Buchanan took the basic foundation of the security dilemma theory and employed it to cyberspace. A ‘cybersecurity dilemma’ is said to exist when one country cannot increase the security of its digital infrastructure, either through the creation of offensive cyber capabilities, without decreasing other’s cybersecurity. According to Buchanan, the cybersecurity dilemma can be potentially more dangerous and escalatory than traditional kinetic conflicts because, in cyber domain, there is a “perception of offense-dominance”, making defensive measures to be perceived as offensive and threatening. With this in mind, cyberspace appears to be the perfect environment for the security dilemma to thrive. The lack of clarity vis-à-vis the intentions and capabilities of cyber warfare, therefore, have the potential to undermine trust, rise escalation fears, provoke an arms race or even an international armed conflict. “As cyberoperations become more potent and computer networks grow still more important, the dilemma’s dangers – already real – will only grow”.\n Zetter 2016.\n Supra note 39, at 192.\n Supra note 107, at 55.\n Payne 2016, 684-85.\n Buchanan 2017, 108-09.\n Ibid., 191.\n Jinghua 2019.\n Ibid., 194.\nIt is well settled that cyberspace is a phenomenon of international relevance. As a result, the uses and abuses of this borderless virtual domain encroach on states concerns in the physical world, such as national security, economic development and public order and safety. Cybersecurity, like other global challenges faced by the existing international community, extends far beyond the domain of a single state and, therefore, cannot be appropriately addressed by any single international actor, regardless of how influential it might be. Given the increasing costs of insecurity and uncertainty associated with an unregulated cyberspace, international actors may soon come to realize the necessity of an international legal framework capable of addressing cyberattacks.\n\nIn spite of the fact that the principal building blocks of the World Wide Web were laid more than two decades ago, the community of states was not able to reach a broad international agreement on how to govern the cyber domain. In fact, some scholars even suggest that cyberspace seems “resistant to codification of the applicable rules in a comprehensive multilateral binding treaty”. Note, however, that the dearth of cyber-specific regulations is not for lack of trying by major international actors. Already in 1996, the French government pushed for the creation of the Charter for International Cooperation on the Internet, which would be “an accord comparable to the international law of the sea”. The proposal, however, was met with apathy by other international stakeholders.\nAfterwards, in January 2002, the UN General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to settle a group of governmental experts to conduct a study on “relevant international concepts aimed at strengthening the security of global information and telecommunications systems”. The United Nations’ Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications thus became the leading state-based initiative for the codification of international law vis-à-vis the cyber domain, but its success was limited. Between 2004 and 2015, the GGE submitted three reports which expressed the unanimous opinion of the state-participants.\nThe 2010 report was welcomed with great enthusiasm by the international community even though it brought an array of “very rudimentary findings and recommendations” and did not present much legal clarity. However, it highlighted that state actors are developing ICTs\n---\n Supra note 43.\n Wu 1997, 660.\n United Nations General Assembly, Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security, A/RES/56/19, 7 January 2002.\n Supra note 55, at 647. Another worthwhile example of a state-based initiative is the Code of Conduct for Information Security, put forward by China, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The proposal was submitted to the UN General Assembly twice, in 2011 and 2015, but it was not met with enthusiasm by the international community. Note that the 2015 proposal was also co-sponsored by Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.

More substantially, it recognized that “[i]nternational law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment”. The Group also claimed that the principles of sovereignty and state responsibility apply to cyberspace. Note that, in order to guarantee unanimity, a draft provision supporting the applicability of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) was excluded from the report. Even so, many states have publicly endorsed the application of the laws of armed conflict to the cyber domain. The USA, for instance, is of the view that “[l]ong-standing international norms guiding state behaviour – in times of peace and conflict – also apply in cyberspace”. Similarly, Japan stated that “existing international law, including the UN Charter and international humanitarian law, naturally applies to acts in cyberspace”.\nFinally, despite the absence of several important issues and the difficulty in reaching consensus, the 2015 report was considered a “breakthrough”. It explicitly mentioned the General Assembly resolutions on the right to privacy in the digital age and noted the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction, but it did not specifically affirm that IHL applies to activities in the cyber environment. The GGE further suggested that “[v]oluntary, non-binding norms of responsible State behaviour” may prevent conflict in cyberspace\n United Nations General Assembly, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunication in the Context of International Security, UN Doc.

On the other end of the spectrum, the USA, France and the United Kingdom share the position that, under public international law, there is no evidentiary requirement for making accusations. In this regard, U.S. State Department Legal Adviser Brian J. Egan stated that:\n[D]espite the suggestion by some States to the contrary, there is no international legal obligation to reveal evidence on which attribution is based prior to taking appropriate action. There may, of course, be political pressure to do so, and States may choose to reveal such evidence to convince other States to join them in condemnation, for example. But that is a policy choice – it is not compelled by international law.\nThis position was reiterated by the U.K. former Attorney General Jeremy Wright, who explained that “[t]here is no legal obligation requiring a state to publicly disclose the underlying information on which its decision to attribute hostile activity is based”. More recently, France echoed the same opinion.\nIn 2017, the GGE was supposed to submit another report to the UN General Assembly, but the experts failed to reach consensus due to disagreements over controversial areas of international law, such as the right of self-defence, countermeasures, and IHL. According to Herinksen, the collapse of the UN GGE initiative was “fairly predictable” because the debate vis-à-vis the regulation of cyberspace is “as much about strategy, politics and ideological\n Ibid., para. 10.\n Ibid., para. 28(f).\n Supra note 63, at 19.\n For instance, they formally presented a draft UN General Assembly resolution in 2018, asserting that “[s]tates should note that accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated”.

The Group held promise for the clarification of cyber-related customary international law, but it left the global community with an unresolved legal conundrum in which opinions appear to be diverging and solidifying instead of converging. Yet, the GGE reports were a welcomed first step for the discussion on international cyber norms and remain extremely relevant.\nOne encouraging conclusion is that, in spite of the lack of a specific legal framework, cyberspace is certainly not a lawless domain beyond the control of public international law. As it has been pointed out, it is well settled that general principles and rules of international law also apply to cyber operations. Indeed, if international law is to be an effective governance arrangement, it should be flexible to new situations without the necessity to recreate a whole set of rules on each occasion. The development of nuclear weapons is a prime example of this. When the UN Charter was being elaborated, its “framers could not be aware of the threat of nuclear weapons” and therefore the legal instrument did not include this type of armament in its provisions regarding the use of force. Yet, decades later, the ICJ provided an advisory opinion arguing that Articles 2(4) and 51 of the UN Charter, concerning the prohibition of the use of force and self-defence respectively, apply to “any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed”. By this logic, the body of international law that governs the use of force should apply to cyber activities, too. Despite these advances, however, many underlying questions remain virtually unanswered. Perhaps most importantly, how are international legal norms supposed to apply to the complex cyber domain?\n Ibid.\n Korzak 2017.\n Supra note 55, at 648.\n According to Henriksen, the 2013 UN GGE report “reflected an emerging consensus that cyberspace is subject to the same general principles of international law that governs the more physical domains” (Henriksen 2019, 3). The remaining question, therefore, is which international law?\n Supra note 42, at 9. On this point, the United States claims that “[t]he development of norms for state conduct in cyberspace does not require a reinvention of customary international law, nor does it render existing international norms obsolete” (United States of America, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World, May 2011, 9).\n International Court of Justice, Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict (Request for Advisory Opinion Submitted by the World Health Organization) and Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Request for Advisory Opinion Submitted by the General Assembly of the United Nations), CR 95/25, 1995, para. 46.\n International Court of Justice, Reports of Judgements, Advisory Opinions and Orders, Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, para. 39.\n “[T]he mere fact that a computer (rather than a more traditional weapon, weapon system, or platform) is used during an operation has no bearing on whether that operation amounts to a ‘use of force’”.

Given this gloomy picture, scholars, cyber-experts, and international stakeholders have been attempting to fill the normative void with their views on how international law applies to the cyber domain. Note that these non-state-driven initiatives were only possible because of the “power vacuum” created by states’ reluctance to undertake the international law-making process.

This subject, however, warrant a more extended discussion than I can here give it. In this sense, this study focuses on the two leading non-state-driven initiatives that epitomize the phenomenon described above: the Tallinn Manual Project and Microsoft’s proposals.\nThe first non-state initiative that tried to address cyberattacks and increase international cybersecurity was the Tallinn Project, which brought together an international group of independent experts led by Professor Michael Schmitt. The project published two editions of the Manual, respectively in 2013 and 2017, under the auspices of the NATO CCD COE. Their texts, however, must not be seen as representing the views of NATO or sponsoring nations. Rather, the Manuals should be understood as a reflexion of the views of the experts, all acting in their own private capacity. It should be noted that this project is neither an international treaty on cyber law nor does it set forth *lex ferenda*, but it is a restatement of international law as it is – *lex lata*.\nThe 2013 edition, entitled the *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, pays particular attention to cyber activities that occur above the level of use of force and encompasses purported rules of customary international law, the larger part of which related to the *jus ad bellum* (the law governing the use of force) and the *jus in bello* (the law\n Finnemore and Hollis 2016, 446; According to Finnemore and Sikkink, norm entrepreneurs are “agents having strong notions about appropriate or desirable behaviour in their community” (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998, 896-97). Henry Dunant, the founder of the International Committee of the Red Cross, is a prime example of norm entrepreneurship.\n For instance, Chernenko et al. recommend the creation of an “independent, international cyber court or arbitrage method that deals only with government-level cyber conflicts” (Chernenko et al. 2018). RAND’s *Stateless Attribution* report, on the other hand, suggests an international organization for cyber-attribution, the *Global Cyber Attribution Consortium*, which would involve “a broad team of international experts to conduct independent investigations of major cyber incidents for the purpose of attribution” and would operate “without standing state participation” (*Supra* note 3, at 27-31).\n *Supra* note 178.\n Ibid.\n Tallinn Manual, 23; Tallinn Manual 2.0, 2.\n Tallinn Manual, 19; Tallinn Manual 2.0, 3.\n Tallinn Manual, rules 10-19.\nof armed conflict). The Manual was considered to be a “remarkable achievement” and, according to Banks, provided “much-needed confidence for states that international law applies in the cyber domain”. Early reviews, nevertheless, criticized the project’s emphasis on cyber operations that amount to use of force since, in reality, the majority of, if not all, cyber activities fall below the use of force threshold. Another major criticism of the Tallinn Manual is the dearth of geographic diversity among the group of experts, all of whom hail from Western Europe, Australia, and the USA. Consequently, the impartiality of the project is challenged, hindering its acceptability and application by states outside the Global North. China, for instance, has been very critical of the whole Tallinn initiative since it seems to be a North American attempt to “maintain US dominance in the information age”. As noted by Eichensehr, the Manual is “channelling, even though not officially representing, a particular worldview with respect to the laws of armed conflict”.\nIn the 2013 Tallinn Manual, no effort was made to establish legal criteria for attributing blame for cyberattacks and attribution is addressed as a problem, instead of “a realistic task having technical, political and legal aspects”. Still, some provisions may shed light on the attribution problem. For example, Rule 5 asserts that “a state shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States”. Note that this provision restates in cyber terms the principle put forward in the ICJ’s Corfu Channel Judgement. The experts were able to reach consensus on the scope of application of Rule 5, but they could\n Tallinn Manual, rules 20-95.\n Ingber 2017, 1531.\n Supra note 33, at 1494.\n Supra note 42, at 16. On this topic, Xinmin explains that the majority of cyberattacks are perpetrated by non-state actors, which are generally seen as cybercrime or infringement of cyber rights that should be governed by domestic criminal law or the law of torts. Also, she points that “[e]ven if some of these attacks are conducted by states or may be attributable to states, most of them fall far below the threshold of ‘threat of use of force’ or ‘armed attack’. Instead, they are only cyber-attacks of minimal levels of intensity, which are comparable to other internationally wrongful acts such as interference with internal affairs of other states” (Xinmin 2016, 189-29).\n Supra note 152, at 4.\n Eichensehr 2014, 588.\n Fleck 2013, 338.\n Ibid., 334-35.\n It is important to point out that this rule has since been included in the 2015 UN GGE report: “[s]tates should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs” (Supra note 161, para. 13 (c)).\n “Such obligations are based [...] on certain general and well-recognized principles, namely: [...] every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”. International Court of Justice, The Corfu Channel Case, Merits, 9 April 1949, 22.\n “As to scope of application, this Rule covers all acts that are unlawful and that have detrimental effects on another state. (Tallinn Manual, Rule 5, para. 5, 33).\n\nOther noteworthy provision in the Manual is Rule 6, which affirms that “a State bears international legal responsibility for a cyber operation attributable to it and which constitutes a breach of an international obligation”. In this regard, the experts agreed that, in specific circumstances, the acts of non-state actors might be attributable to a state and therefore cause that state’s international legal responsibility$^{245}$. The non-state actor, however, must be either acting “on the instructions of” or “under the direction or control” of that state$^{246}$.\nIn 2017, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations was published, expanding considerably the scope of the project. Now, it also includes the analysis of the international legal framework that applies to malicious cyberattacks that do not meet the use of force threshold. Furthermore, the new Manual addresses peacetime legal regimes, such as state responsibility, human rights law, and the laws of space, air, and the sea. On the whole, the Tallinn 2.0 “reflects a careful effort to move international law forward in the challenging domain of cyberspace”$^{247}$. Mačák further echoes this idea by arguing that the expansion and revision of the document will probably “further strengthen the project’s overall relevance as well as its claim to authority”$^{248}$. Banks, on the other hand, explains that the Tallinn 2.0’s provisions and commentaries are “necessarily general in nature, sometimes ambiguous, and do not necessarily reflect settled international law”$^{249}$.\nRegarding cyber-attribution, in spite of the expectations surrounding its publication, the 2017 Tallinn Manual did not go any further than the previous edition in providing an effective legal solution to the attribution problem$^{250}$. Rather, the experts limited their analysis of cyber-attribution to the well-established Articles on State Responsibility, codified by the ILC$^{251}$. This body of law, as its name suggests, only offers prescriptive norms when there is a state nexus\n\nDespite criticism, the Tallinn initiative provides a comprehensive and attentive analysis of how the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* applies to the cyber environment, along with valuable commentaries on controversial issues that need to be further discussed. Even though the reliance on Western-centric approaches might handicap Tallinn’s acceptance in non-Western countries, such as China and the Russian Federation, the project still is an essential tool for scholars, international lawyers, policymakers, and international stakeholders.\nIn 2014, Microsoft Corporation published a white paper entitled *International Cybersecurity Norms: Reducing Conflict in an Internet-Dependent World*. It was the first thorough proposal to seek the definition of acceptable and unacceptable state conducts online, with the purpose of decreasing risks and bringing predictability and stability to the international scenario. In short, Microsoft proposed six cybersecurity norms to limit conflict and improve cyber defences. These norms are intended to “reduce the possibility that ICT products and services could be used, abused, or exploited by nation states as part of offensive operations”. Note that, like both editions of the Tallinn Manual, Microsoft’s white paper suggests guidelines of state conduct and is openly state-centric in its approach.\nThe project was widely criticized for emphasizing the role of states and thus overlooking the relevance of the private sector, in particular the global ICT industry, for the promotion of international cybersecurity. In response to these claims, Microsoft released another white paper, *From Articulation to Implementation: Enabling Progress on Cybersecurity Norms*, in which the Corporation outlines six further cybersecurity norms. This time, however, the norms were directed at ICT companies. For instance, the paper calls upon the ICT industry to “assist public sector efforts to identify, prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from events in\n Supra note 33, at 1495.\n Supra note 209, at 585.\n Note that Microsoft’s proposal was not the first time a private company put forward an initiative of this kind. Already in 1999, the CEO of AOL, Steve Case, strongly recommended states to “revis[e] outdated and ‘country-centric’ laws on telecommunications and taxes that could thwart the growth of the medium” and instead support “international standards – from security, to privacy, to taxation”. (Case, Steve, Remarks Prepared for Delivery (via satellite) Israel ‘99 Business Conference’, 13 December 1999, cited in Goldsmith and Wu 2006, 26)\n McKay 2014, 2.\n For the complete list of the proposed cybersecurity norms, see McKay 2014, 20.\n Ibid., 11.\n Supra note 42, at 17.\n Charney et al. 2016, 3.\n Ibid.\n\nNote that, while the rules brought by the Tallinn Manuals articulate purported customary international obligations that by themselves are binding on all states, except persistent objectors, the norms put forward by Microsoft’s proposals are only broad suggestions that do not create any right or legal obligation. In other words, Microsoft’s norms are “more aspirational than realistic” and require states to translate them into legally binding rules, which takes time and commitment. Despite this difference, both initiatives have in common the fact that they are non-state-driven, quasi-legal instruments which do not have any legally binding force. In other words, they are soft law rules. In fact, the Tallinn Manuals and Microsoft’s white papers could hardly amount to anything but a non-binding document since states still are “the legislators of the international legal system”. That said, one may call into question the importance of these initiatives for the development of international law. Is soft law an authentic law? Is soft law effective to produce norms despite its non-binding nature?\n\n## 4.2 The value of soft law\nAccording to Besson, international legal norms might have different levels of normativity, ranging from “being low (or soft) as with legal norms in the making to being imperative as with norms of *jus cogens*”. Certainly, the Tallinn Manual project and Microsoft’s papers have a lower degree of legal normativity than binding international rules. Indeed, as stated by the ILC on its study on the Identification of Customary International Law, the “conduct of other actors [than states] is not practice that contributes to the formation, or expression, of rules of customary international law”. This, however, does not imply that these initiatives are utterly irrelevant for the law-making process or even to the development of cyber law. Quite the opposite, considering the normative plurality in international law, non-state-driven initiatives of this kind might be valuable both in quantity and quality. For Thirlway, “soft law is a vital intermediate stage towards a more rigorously binding system, permitting experiment and rapid modification”.\nMoreover, even though these intermediary legal products are not “valid legal norms”, they might possess a certain evidentiary importance in the next stages of the development of rules of international law. Put differently, non-binding documents, such as UN resolutions, might evince the existence of both *opinio juris* and state practice which could later support the formation of customary norms. By this logic, hard and soft laws are not mutually exclusive and should be seen as “tools provided with a different degree of normativity along a *continuum*”. It also should be noted that soft law-making processes normally involve non-state actors and thus are more “multicultural and inclusive” than others.\n---\n By ‘normativity’, I mean “the law’s claim to authority, that is, its claim to provide its legal subjects with exclusionary albeit *prima facie* reasons for action through binding legal norms or in other words its claim to create obligations to obey the law that in principle preclude some countervailing reasons for action” (Besson, 2010, 173).\n Ibid., 174.\n *Supra note* 42, at 19.\n International Law Commission, *Draft Conclusions on Identification of Customary International Law*, with Commentaries, 2018, A/73/10, conclusion 4 (3), 130.\n *Supra note* 240, at 170.\n Thirlway 2019, 186-87.\n *Supra note* 240, at 170.\n Ibid. As pointed by the ILC, non-state practice “may be relevant” when assessing the practice of states (*Supra note* 243).\n Zerilli 2010, 11.\n *Supra note* 240, at 170-171. Regarding soft law, Joyner has interesting points that are worthwhile looking at. For instance, he notes that states are usually “more willing to be innovative when the adopted instrument is not legally binding” (Joyner 1998, 414).\nAccording to Article 38(1) of the Statute of the ICJ, scholarly works are a secondary source of public international law that informs the application of primary sources. Hence, it seems fair to conclude that the aforementioned initiatives are not only highly pertinent, but also “likely to prove especially influential”. Nevertheless, this situation is by no means ideal since states, and only states, hold the formal authority to create international law. As Judge Higgins aptly put it, “[s]tates are, at this moment of history, still at the heart of the international legal system”. However, it is important to bear in mind that the norms proposed by both the Tallinn Manual Project and Microsoft’s papers might “mature through codification into treaty law or crystallise into customary law”, so that they delineate the exact limits of activities in cyberspace.\nThis dynamic is certainly not without precedent. The Antarctic legal regime is the epitome of this. In the 1960s and 1970s, many non-legally binding norms were brought in with high hopes of conserving both living and non-living resources of Antarctica. Joyner argues that the adoption of these non-binding instruments laid the international legal foundation for the treaty that was yet to come. Ultimately, the majority of these norms were codified into the 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, a binding agreement that has been ratified by all major international actors, including the USA, China, and Russia.\nAnother prime example is the international nuclear safety regime. Even though proposals to establish a legally-binding international treaty were put forward since the 1960s, states were generally “disinclined to go beyond the recommendatory nature of the safety standards” issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This situation, however,\n “The Court, whose function is to decide in accordance with international law such disputes as are submitted to it, shall apply:\n(a) international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting states;\n(b) international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law;\n(c) the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations;\n(d) subject to the provisions of Article 59, judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicist of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law”. United Nations, Statute of the International Court of Justice, 18 April 1946, Article 38 (1).\n Schmitt and Vihul 2016, 47.\n Supra note 42, at 19.\n Higgins 1994, 39.\n Supra note 250.\n Joyner 1998, 420. In the 1960s, more than seventy recommended measures were adopted by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Party Meetings (ACTMs); and in 1970s, more than fifty were adopted.\n Ibid.\n Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, October 1991, United Nations Treaty Series, vol. 2941, A-5778.\n Nuclear Energy Agency and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Joint Report on International Law in the Post-Chernobyl Period, 2006, NEA No. 6146, 13.\nchanged rapidly after the Chernobyl accident, which exposed the costly transboundary consequences of unsafe nuclear activity. The 1986 disaster gave rise to an international legally-binding regime for the safe development of nuclear energy, which slowly transformed the safety standards and other relevant non-binding norms into hard law rules.\nOne must be aware, however, that the cyber domain differs in important ways from the Antarctic and the nuclear regimes. Perhaps the most notable difference is that, while the lawmaking process vis-à-vis cyberspace has been spearheaded by non-state-driven initiatives, the development of binding rules for international nuclear safety and the conservation of Antarctica had been led mainly by state actors. Yet, these two regimes are valuable examples that illustrate the codification of soft law norms. With this in mind, the current status of cyber international law should be seen as an early stage towards the codification or crystallisation of cyber hard law. The question that needs to be addressed, therefore, is whether states will finally rise to the challenge.\n Shull 2008, 4.\n To wit: Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, 1986, INFCIRC/335; Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency, 1986, INFCIRC/336; Convention on Nuclear Safety, 1994, INFCIRC/449; Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on The Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, 1997, INFCIRC/546.\n Supra note 42, at 21.\n Ibid.\n\nThe 2007 Estonian attacks, as well as other cyberattacks mentioned in this study, illustrate the severity of the threats facing states’ cybersecurity, and the equally important challenge of implementing a legal framework for attributing blame for cyber activities. Given the ever-growing reliance on ICTs and the increasing frequency, intensity, and complexity of cyberattacks, a solution for the attribution problem is crucial for both promoting a (relatively) stable world order and reducing the chances of conflict stemming from cyberoperations. Note, however, that this solution does not lie in the technical domains, as previously thought. Pragmatically, the most relevant hurdles for cyber deterrence nowadays are not poor technical capabilities since, from a technical standpoint, tools for attribution have matured significantly in recent years, increasing states’ confidence vis-à-vis assigning blame for malicious cyberattacks. Rather, the solution for this issue lies in the realm of international law and cooperation.\nAs transnational terrorism, migration crises, and other security challenges that plague the international community, the attribution problem cannot be appropriately tackled by any single international entity, regardless of how strong and influential that entity might be. Instead, these modern phenomena require a framework for active global collaboration. It is international law that “affords [such] a framework, a pattern, a fabric for international society”. Nevertheless, in the context of the computer network, it seems that international law fails to deliver. Even though states have agreed that public international law applies to cyberactivity, there is no broad multilateral agreement on how to govern cyberspace and, therefore, it is as yet uncertain how the international legal framework applies to this new, complex domain.\nThis difficulty in the application of traditional rules and principles of international law, in order to properly address cyber challenges, results from a number of reasons. Perhaps the most relevant of them is the attachment of this body of law to state-centric assumptions and foundations of the early formative stage of the international legal system. By placing state\n Supra note 3.\n Supra note 10, at 28.\n Supra note 33, at 1502.\n Supra note 43, at 137. By way of an example, the USA has declared that it has the ability to identify and hold their cyber opponents accountable (Fryer-Biggs 2012). Indeed, in the last few years, the U.S. government has attributed high-profile cyberattacks, such as the 2014 intrusion at Sony Pictures Entertainment and the 2016 DNC hack, respectively, to North Korean and Russia (Supra note 42, at 23-24).\n Supra note 42, at 2.\n Henkin 1978, 5.\n Moynihan 2019, 4.\n Supra note 2, at 375.\n Supra note 7, at 610-11.\nactors at the heart of its legal regimes, public international law requires in almost all situations a state link so as to determine either an international legal obligation or an internationally wrongful act. In an environment where non-state actors are as powerful, if not more so, than states, it seems fair to conclude that this legal system grounded in the traditional state-centric perspective of international law is not suitable or even adequate to address challenges posed by cyberspace and the rapid development of ICTs. In this sense, as long as states refuse to recognize the existence and the importance of other international players, any effort to govern cyberspace and to establish legal mechanisms for cyber-attribution will fall short.\nAs it stands now, international law not only fails in effectively dealing with the attribution problem, but also is unlikely to be instrumental in providing both predictability and stability to cyberspace in the short and medium-terms. Besides the lack of clarity of the law in this area, governments have been unwilling to clearly express their existing norms and practices in relation to the cyber domain, impeding the formation of customary international law and increasing unpredictability of state behaviour. Note that, in spite of the constructive contribution made by non-state initiatives, public international law is lagging far behind in many respects and thus continues to be underdeveloped vis-à-vis cyber-attribution.\nBefore proceeding, two points still need to be considered. First, by filling the void created by states’ reluctance to undertake the international law-making process, non-state-driven initiatives, especially the Tallinn Manuals and Microsoft’s proposals, have been providing much-needed clarity to some grey areas of international cyber law. These initiatives, however, are constrained by their state-centric approaches, non-binding character, and interpretative methods, which usually lack the necessary legal safety. Therefore, non-state initiatives represent a relevant but primitive point in the discussion about the application of international law to the cyber domain. They should be seen as a means to an end, not an end in itself.\n Ibid.\n According to Schmitt and Watts, the cyber domain and cyberactivity have bridged “a number of formerly significant gaps between states’ and non-state actors’ abilities to compromise international peace and security. in fact, some non-state actors now match, if not exceed, the cyber capabilities of many states in this respect” (Supra note 7, at 595).\n Supra note 33, at 1509.\n Supra note 42, at 1.\n Supra note 2, at 381. For instance, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 limited its analysis of cyber-attribution to the basic principles of State Responsibility, as codified by the ILC. However, as its name suggests, this body of law can only be applied when there is a state nexus.\n Supra note 33, at 1513.\n In this regard, Mačák points out that non-state initiatives might serve “as norm-making laboratories”, permitting states to identify and assess advantages and disadvantages of a number of proposals (Supra note 42, at 30-31).\n\nSecond, if states genuinely wish to address the problem of cyber-attribution, they can do so; they have the technological capabilities and all the necessary legal power. After all, states are still at the heart of the international legal framework and are the only ones to hold the formal authority to create international rules. This argument generates an obvious puzzle, however: why then do they not solve this conundrum? The answer to this question lies on the fact that some countries may benefit from the current state of affairs, characterized by uncertainties and the lack of express cyber norms. States that possess the most advanced cyber capabilities – such as the United States, Russia, China, and likely North Korea – may take advantage of the cyber domain in order to fulfil their national interests in the physical world. For instance, the USA has allegedly used an extremely sophisticated computer worm, called Stuxnet, to destroy numerous centrifuges in an Iranian nuclear facility, thwarting the prospects of Iran developing nuclear weapons and thus securing American geopolitical interests in the Middle East.\nBy this logic, if states believe that by acting in unregulated cyberspace their gains offset their losses, there will be no incentive for them to promote the regulation of this domain or to solve the attribution problem. This might help to explain why state actors have been so reluctant to engage in the cyber law-making process, as well as to express clear *opinio juris* with respect to cyberspace. Considering the ever-increasing costs of insecurity and uncertainty related to an ungoverned cyber domain, states may soon come to realize the necessity of an international legal framework capable of addressing cyberattacks. As Professor Koh aptly put it, “compliance with international law frees us to do more, and do more legitimately, in cyberspace, in a way that more fully promotes our national interests”. Therefore, one can only hope that\n Supra note 283.\n Supra note 42, at 19.\n Supra note 33, at 1511.\n It should be noted that the former U.S. Secretary of Defence Leon Panetta stated that the American government was “developing the plans that needed to be developed to ensure the United States would remain one of the strongest players in the cyber arena” (Stone 2019).\n Zetter 2014a.\n Note, however, that this process might already be in motion, as illustrated by the 2015 cyber agreement between the United States and China (Harold 2016; Supra note 42, at 27).\n Koh 2012, 10.\nstates do not wait for the occurrence of a “cyber 9/11” $^{316}$ or a “cyber Pearl Harbour” $^{317}$ to overcome their aversion to engaging in the development of international cyber law.\nIn the meantime, cyberspace will continue to be an environment that offers the perfect conditions for the security dilemma to thrive and in which the activities of both state and non-state actors can trigger off conflicts causing widespread harm to societies, the global economy, and the international security system. With this in mind, international stakeholders and policymakers should strive to increase transparency, so as to bridge the existing trust gaps inside the international community. Overall, greater transparency reduces misperceptions and conflict spirals and, consequently, leads to cooperation and better cybersecurity.\nIt is important to point out that, due to time constraints, this thesis was not able to assess the role played by the private sector in attributing blame for cyberattacks or to analyse non-Western approaches to the international rule of law in the cyber domain. Future researches, therefore, should attempt to explore these topics.\n\n45",

Education, health, government, as well as sectors such as energy, communication, and transportation are inextricably linked to, if not dependent on, the cyber domain. As information technology becomes more widespread and integrated into our daily lives, the probability of compromise by malicious cyber activity increases. According to the former Director of National Intelligence (DNI) of the United States, more than thirty countries are developing offensive cyber capabilities, which will rise the incidence of both standoff and remote operations. To complicate matters further, these capabilities are progressively under criminal and other non-state actors’ control. Therefore, cyberattacks that deeply affect international peace and the global economy are no longer “futuristic or far-fetched”, but rather the reality of cyberspace.\n “Cyberspace” is defined by the United States National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations as “a domain characterized by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructure” (United States Department of Defence (DoD), *The National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations*, December 2006,3). Therefore, cyberspace also includes all networked digital operations.\n Pipyros et al. 2018, 371.\n Davis II et al. 2017, 1\n United States Senate 2017, 5.\n Owens, Dam, and Lin 2009, 27.\n By cyberattack, I refer to the definition applied by Oona Hathaway et al. as “any action taken to undermine the functions of a computer network for a political or national security purpose” (Hathaway et al. 2012, 826). This definition, however, differs from that used by the U.S. Cyber Command, which identifies cyberattacks as those “that cause physical damage to property or injury to persons.” (Ibid., 821 n.9). Hathaway et al.’s definition also differs from the one offered by the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, which describe cyberattack as “a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects” (Schmitt 2013, 92). It is important to bear in mind that both the Tallinn Manual and the Cyber Command definitions are under-inclusive, particularly considering the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack, which did not cause physical damage to property or persons, but involved the *domaine reservé* of the U.S., raising relevant national security concerns about democratic procedures and the violation of the prohibition of intervention. Hathaway et al.’s terminology, on the other hand, covers a broader set of cyberattacks, including attacks such as the DNC hack.\nIn addition, I use the term ‘cyberattack’ instead of ‘cyber warfare’ because the latter refers to a smaller subset of cyberattacks that “constitute armed attacks or that occur in the context of an ongoing armed conflict” (Hathaway et al. 2012, 821). By contrast, the term ‘cyberattack’ embraces a broad range of attacks, from cyber warfare to those attacks that fall short of armed conflict but still deserve some kind of sanction (Tran 2018, 380 n.13). Furthermore, Hathaway and her co-authors make a distinction between cyberattacks and cyberespionage; according to the they, “neither cyber-espionage nor cyber-exploitation constitutes a cyber-attack because these concepts do not involve altering computer networks in a way that affects their current or future ability to function” (Hathaway et al. 2012, 829).\n Schmitt and Watts 2016, 596.\nFollowing the relocation of a Soviet war memorial in 2007, Estonia was hit by a series of massive cyberattacks lasting three weeks. Taking into consideration that the small Baltic country is one of the most wired societies in Europe, the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks were particularly harmful, resulting in a temporary interruption of service on many government and commercial websites and, thus, profoundly affecting the functioning of the country’s economy. Initially, the attacks were attributed to Russia due to the political atmosphere at the time, as well as past Russian actions. This explanation, however, was questioned by technical experts, and even NATO officials were disinclined to assign blame to the Russian government. Because of disagreements over the links between the attackers and Russia, what at first appeared to be a pretty obvious case of aggression became a gridlock. Although it is highly probable that the Russian state launched the cyberattack, its involvement has never been proven. Yet, the attack continues to be an example of Russia’s cyber capabilities that following cyberattacks will be judged by.\nIn hindsight, the Estonian attacks were “fairly mild and simple”, far less damaging than the cyberattacks that have followed. Even so, they brought cyberspace to the forefront of international relations discussions, raising awareness among states about the severe risk posed by the growing dependence on ICTs, as well as the possibility of conflict in this new and unique environment. Indeed, during the last decade, the international community has witnessed and experienced a considerable number of problematic episodes in cyberspace – the cyber intrusion at Sony Pictures Entertainment, the attack on France’s TV5Monde, the Democratic National\n Traynor 2007.\n By 2007, 98% of Estonian territory was covered with Internet access, and mobile phone penetration was almost 100% (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010, 17).\n According to Clark and Landau, DDoS attack is a concerted malevolent effort in which a large number of machines from all over the Internet attack a site or a set of sites in order to disrupt service by overloading a server or a link (Clark and Landau 2011, 6).\n Dinniss 2014, 38-39.\n Supra note 8, at 25.\n Schulzke 2018, 960.\n Ibid. It is necessary to recognize that this situation poses a threat to international peace since, according to Gomez, the “adversary’s past behaviour may motivate a disproportionate response to pre-empt any further threats” (Gomez 2019, 1-2).\n Schmitt 2017, xxiii.\n On November 2014, Sony Pictures’ computers were broken into, and sensitive information from the film studio and unreleased movies were published online, disrupting the company business operations (Davis II et al. 2017, 42). Considering that Sony had produced the movie The Interview, which depicts the assassination of Kim Jong-Un, speculations about North Korean participation were raised (Egloff 2019, 10). Through a press statement, North Korea denied responsibility for the cyberattack, but praised the attackers for their actions. As of yet, no one was able to prove North Korean involvement and the evidence implicating it was considered “flimsy” (Zetter 2014b).\n In April 2015, the French-language television network had its computer infrastructure and social media accounts hacked. Initially, the group called Cyber Caliphate, an Islamic State affiliate, claimed responsibility for the\n\nAgainst this background, at the 2016 Defence Ministerial Meeting, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) defence ministers officially recognized cyberspace as a new frontier of warfare, and that decision was endorsed at the 2016 Warsaw Summit. Now, the Allies “recognize cyberspace as a domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea”. Certainly, the change comes as a response to the increasing number of cyberattacks against both the organization and its member states. The threat posed by these attacks even prompted former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security to declare that cyberattacks “now exceed the risk of physical attacks” in terms of breadth and range of possible outcomes. And such attacks show no sign of decreasing, as the aforementioned examples demonstrate.\nAlthough the persistence of cyberattacks might be due, in part, to the relative availability and fairly low cost of the technology needed to mount an attack, it might also largely result from the difficulty in identifying its perpetrators and attributing blame. The structure of the Internet, which “was not designed with the goal of deterrence in mind”, provides the perfect setting for state and non-state actors to take part in malicious activity unafraid of attribution or retaliation. Worse still, aggressors are able to conceal themselves and the full effects of their operations by using technical mechanisms and/or relying on non-state proxies that they rent or compromise. For example, the cyberattacks that hit Estonia originated from at least 177\nattacks, but as the investigations began, it became clear that the jihadist group was just a cover-up (Corera 2016). The private company FireEye ultimately attributed the attack to Russian hackers.\n In 2015, in the middle of the presidential election, the DNC suffered a cyberattack, resulting in the exfiltration of files and emails, many of which were published by WikiLeaks. In 2016, the DNC publicly attributed the attack to two distinct Russian espionage groups, APT28 and APT29 (Egloff 2019, 13). Although it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to assess the full damage of the cyber intrusion, it is understood to have played a major role in the 58th U.S. presidential election (Davis II et al. 2017, 34).\n Allison 2018; Banks 2019, 191.\n Barnes, 2016.\n Ablon et al. 2019, 1.\n NATO, Warsaw Summit Communiqué (July 2016), n.70.\n Nielsen 2018.\n Payne and Finlay 2017, 556; Boerbert 2010, 43.\n Tran 2018, 381.\n Supra note 10, at 1.\n Supra note 24.\n Carlin 2016, 409; Carr 2010, 139-40.\ncountries, including from within the Estonian territory. Evidence has been found that attackers also obscure their identities through the adoption of foreign languages and elements of malware previously associated with other actors, and they might even exploit existing animosities in order to mask their identity and thus hinder attribution efforts. By way of one example, the escalating tension between Iran and the United States suggests that both countries would be unwilling to fully cooperate in the case of a cyberattack, making Iran the perfect cover-up for third-party states and non-state actors attempting to launch a cyberattack against the USA and vice versa. It is therefore understood that attributing cyberattacks is vastly time-consuming and an “inherently interdisciplinary” process, requiring great technical and non-technical expertise and input from a range of actors and sources. In this regard, taking into account the effort necessary for its fulfilment, cyber-attribution was considered to be “an art as much as a science”.\nThe Estonian attacks are a prime example of how challenging the attribution of cyberattacks can be; thirteen years have passed and one cannot affirm whether the attacks were officially sanctioned by the Russian government or whether they were perpetrated by rogue spies or even by independent nationalistic criminals. It is important to bear in mind that, in the cyber domain, attribution differs from punishment, and it is defined as “identifying the agent responsible for the action”. Since cyberattacks have proliferated and become commonplace, attribution has grown in relevance. As a result, states have been investing resources and political capital to develop accountable attribution mechanisms in order to deter potential cyberattackers.\nIn spite of the fact that determining the machines that launched a cyberattack is no longer an arduous task for the most developed countries, identifying the individuals, organizations, or governments that are legally responsible for the attack continues to be challenging. The attribution of cyberattacks presents unique legal challenges because states were not able to reach a broad international agreement on how to govern the cyber domain and the current\n Payne and Finlay 2017, 560.\n Supra note 12.\n Ibid; Payne and Finlay 2019, 203.\n Egloff and Wenger 2019, 3\n Banks 2017, 1503.\n Rid and Buchanan 2015, 7.\n Supra note 12.\n Lindsay 2015, 57.\n Supra note 10.\n Banks 2019, 191.\n Supra note 38, at 192.\ninternational legal framework does little to control cyber operations. On this matter, Schmitt and Vihul believe that even if agreement were to be reached on a multilateral binding cyber treaty, it would probably be undermined by states’ individual reservations. Similarly, according to Mačák, there seems to be a resistance to the codification of international rules applicable to cyberspace.\nIn addition, as cyber operations usually happen in secrecy, customary international law is not able to develop understandings or recognize state practice about attributing responsibility for cyberattacks. Further complicating the issue, governments have been unwilling to clearly express *opinio juris* on topics associated with the cyber domain. This attitude might be the result of a domestic political deadlock, a calculated waiting strategy, or even the product of the “cybersecurity knowledge gap”. Nevertheless, this state reticence contributes to the enduring ambiguity of international cyber law. It is also important to point out that no international organization, agency, or entity has the legal authority to attribute responsibility for a cyberattack. Due to this institutional legal vacuum, seldom do governments make official attribution claims, and, in the rare occasion that they do, their statements are normally perceived\n Supra note 25, at 384.\n Schmitt and Vihul 2016, 39. As codified in Article 2(d) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), reservation is “a unilateral statement, however phrased or named, made by a State, when signing, ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to a treaty, whereby it purports to exclude or to modify the legal effect of certain provisions of the treaty in their application to that State” (United Nations, *Vienna Convention on the law of treaties*, 23 May 1969, vol. 1155,1-18232, art. 2(d)).\nIt is perhaps useful to point out that some scholars have indicated that a successful agreement might be almost impossible to achieve, at least in the near future. For instance, Waxman believes that “not only do certain features of cyber-activities make international legal regulation very difficult, but major actors also have divergent strategic interests that will pull their preferred doctrinal interpretations and aspirations in different directions, impeding formations of a stable international consensus” (Waxman 2011, 425-26). On this point, Goldsmith argues that “the fundamental clash of interests concerning the regulation of electronic communications, the deep constrains the United States would have to adopt to receive reciprocal benefits in a cybersecurity treaty, and the debilitating verification problems will combine to make it unfeasible to create a cybersecurity treaty that purports to constrain governments”. (Goldsmith 2011, 12).\n Mačák 2017, 5.\n Mačák 2016, 130. About the high classified nature of state practice in cyberspace, Clarke and Knake state that “the entire phenomenon of cyber war is shrouded in such government secrecy that it makes the Cold War look like a time of openness and transparency” (Clarke and Knake 2010, xi). Also, Efrony and Shany try to explain the absence of transparency in cyberspace; for them, states believe that transparency may reveal “their vulnerabilities, adversely affect their offensive or defensive capabilities, and weaken their power of deterrence” (Efrony and Shany 2018, 631).\n Supra note 38, at 194.\n Among the notable exceptions, the USA stands out with its International Strategy for Cyberspace (United States, The White House, *International Strategy for Cyberspace: Property, Security, and Openness in a Networked World*, May 2011).\n Schmitt and Watts 2015, 211.\n Singer and Friedman 2014, 4-8.\n Supra note 43, at 130.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, scholars, cyber-experts, and international stakeholders have been attempting to bridge the gap with their views on how international law applies to cyberspace. These non-state-driven initiatives are trying to promote a safe international system and reduce the chances of conflict arising from cyberattacks by filling the void created by states’ reluctance to undertake the international law-making process. The most important and comprehensive of these attempts certainly is the Tallinn Manual project, which is under the auspices of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE). This project, however, is neither an international treaty on cyber law nor does it offer a new set of international rules nor represent the position of any country or organization. Rather, it is a restatement of international law as it is (lex lata), establishing a comprehensive legal structure for the governance of cyber operations during both times of peace and conflict. Considering the Tallinn project’s non-state and non-binding nature, one is then left to question its actual relevance to public international law, which still is very much attached to state-centric assumptions and foundations of the early formative stage of the international legal regime.\nOn this basis, my main argument lies heavily on the idea that the current international legal framework is underdeveloped vis-à-vis cyber-attribution, as its norms and principles were designed to the physical world and still, at present, mainly govern the relationship between states. Cyberspace, on the other end of the spectrum, is predominantly inhabited by non-state\n Supra note 2, at 19. It is interesting to highlight that attributing cyberattacks to states is a new phenomenon (Eichensehr 2019b ,7-8). For instance, the first official public accusation by the USA only came in 2014, when five Chinese military hackers were criminally charged for cyberespionage against U.S. corporations (The United States, Department of Justice, May 19 2014).\n By attribution problem, I refer to the difficulty in discovering the identity or location of the responsible for a cyberattack or their intermediary.\n Supra note 25, at 384; Supra note 31, at 205.\n Supra note 32, at 1495.\n Supra note 31, at 205.\n Chircop 2018, 653.\n Supra note 42, at 1.\n Despite NATO’s sponsorship, the Tallinn Manuals do not reflect the official position of the Alliance.\n Supra note 32, at 1494.\nactors and, as Libicki aptly put it, is divided between the physical, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic layers. As it stands now, international law fails in coping with contemporary challenges posed by cyberspace and the rapid development of ICTs, notably the attribution of cyberattacks. As will be developed below, this practical gap not only hinders the cyber-attribution process, but also threatens international security on an equivalent scale to traditional armed attacks.\nAlthough literature on cybersecurity normally perceives the attribution problem as a technical issue, due to the significant technological advancements experienced in the last decade, attribution is already “more nuanced, more common, and more political” than it is acknowledged. It is therefore understood that the solution to this dangerous situation lies within the legal and political domains, not in the technical realm. Non-state initiatives have been trying to overcome this legal quagmire, but the international legal system still is inherently attached to a state-centric approach. Therefore, no set of international binding rules as far as cybersecurity is concerned will ever likely be achieved without the participation of states.\nConsidering that so many aspects of our lives are now bound up with cyberspace, the discussion about cyber-attribution is not only pertinent but also urgent. Such a delicate situation deserves to be taken most seriously and it would be unduly ambitious to try to provide a full answer in this study. My purpose, however, is to make a modest attempt at shedding some light on the issue. Ideally, this may contribute to a constructive debate about the problem of attributing blame for cyberattacks.\nThe following research question was articulated in order to function as the backbone of the work here presented: to what extent is international law underdeveloped vis-à-vis cyber-attribution? Also, as a means to enlighten the path of this study, the following sub-questions were established: why does cyber-attribution matter? What are the legal and political challenges imposed by the attribution problem? How the difficulty in attributing blame of a cyberattack affects international security?\nIn order to carry out the aforementioned study, a qualitative research of a doctrinal nature will be applied. Mainly, this will be a legal work based on primary and secondary legal sources. Parallel to the legal background, this study will also endeavour to apply the International Relations’ concept of security dilemma to cyberspace. By bringing this concept to the\n Supra note 42, at 14.\n Libicki 2007, 236-37.\n Supra note 54, at 652.\n Supra note 33, at 6.\n Eichensehr 2019b, 2.\n\nIn international relations theory, Realism, also known as political realism, is one of the dominants schools of thought. Realists depict an anarchical, competitive and conflictual world, in which insecurity among states is inescapable. Note that ‘anarchical’ is used here in a technical sense, indicating the dearth of an overarching, political authority at the international level. Under anarchy, states are the main actors in the international arena and their primary responsibility is to secure their own interests, especially their survival. In order to do so, according to the realist theory, states will attempt to acquire power and engage in power-balancing, creating what Hoffman called “a state of war”.\nThe interstate political order is, therefore, a self-help system plagued by “uncertainty, weapons and fear”, and in which power plays the leading role in shaping the relation between states. As long as we accept the basic premises of the realist theory, this hostile and insecure environment not only leaves little room for international cooperation, but also encourages “behaviour that leaves all concerned worse off than they could be, even in the extreme case in\n This study will not differentiate Realism into its various strands since this warrant a more extended discussion that I can here give it. It is perhaps useful to point out, however, that realism is normally contrasted with liberalism or idealism, which tend to focus on international cooperation. Compared to these theories, the realist perspective is undeniably pessimistic. As Keohane put it, realism is “the language of power and interests rather than of ideals or norms” (Keohane 1986, 9).\n Wheeler and Booth 2007, 2.\n Waltz 1979, 91. Waltz points out that, “internationally, the environment of states’ actions, or the structure of their system, is set by the fact that some states prefer survival over other ends obtainable in the short run and act with relative efficiency to achieve that end” (Waltz, 1979, 93). On this topic, Jervis identifies throughout his book, entitled *Perception and Misperception in International Politics*, some states that did not have survival as their primary goal. For instance, During Hitler’s government, Germany valued territorial expansion over security (Jervis 2017).\n According to Andersen, balance of power is “a mechanism that ideally would make states intentionally or unintentionally join the weaker part against the strong, to equal out or balance the distribution of power amongst states in the international system” and states “would do this to assure their own survival” (Andersen 2018, 1).\n Hoffmann defines ‘state of war’ as “a competition of units in the kind of state of nature that knows no restrains other than those which the changing necessities of the game and the shallow convenience of the players impose” (Hoffmann 1965, vii).\n *Supra note* 65.\n Korab-Karpowicz 2017. It is important to note that Wendt argues, through the lenses of Constructivism, that “self-help and power politics are institutions, and not essential features of anarchy. Anarchy is what states make of it” (Wendt 1992, 395).\n Waltz points out two reasons why international cooperation is limited by anarchy: insecurity and unequal gains. In an anarchic international system, states are not certain about each other’s intentions and they fear that cooperation might favour one state in detriment of the others, creating some kind of dependence. He argues that “[s]tates do not willingly place themselves in situations of increased dependence. In a self-help system, considerations of security subordinate economic gain to political interest” (*Supra note* 66, at 107).\n\n## 2.1 What is the security dilemma?\nAccording to Wheeler and Booth, the security dilemma is the quintessential dilemma in interstate politics. Coined by Herz (1950) and Butterfield (1951), the term has since become an integral part of any discourse on international security and has been expanded and employed to “address many of the most important questions of international relations theory and security policy”. Both authors describe the security dilemma as a situation where the increase of a state’s security simultaneously (and unintentionally) decreases the security of other states. The risk here is that misperceptions and conflict spirals dramatically increase the chances of unnecessary or avoidable armed conflicts.\nFor instance, a state might attempt to increase its own security and avert aggression by acquiring more weapons, bringing them to a higher state of readiness, or creating alliances. Under anarchy, an adversarial state will get the wrong impression about this behaviour, interpreting it as a preparatory action for future attacks. This state will thus fell threatened and will take action to enhance its own security. The first state will have confirmed its suspicions about its adversary’s belligerence, increasing tension and leading to an arms race or even war. In this scenario, conflict is not the product of the actual intentions and military capabilities of a specific actor. Rather, it is the result of mutual misperceptions and miscommunications that arise from the inability of states to understand each other’s intentions and motives with complete\n Jervis 1978, 167.\n Carlsnaes et al. 2002, 372; Montgomery 2006, 183.\n Schweller 1996, 116. Note that, according to Mearsheimer, “the best way for a state to survive in anarchy is to take advantage of other states and gain power at their expenses” (Mearsheimer 2001, 36).\n Supra note 65, at 29.\n Glaser 1997, 172.\n Jervis describes the security dilemma as a situation where “many of the means by which a state tries to increase its security decreases the security of others” (Supra note 71, at 169-70). Likewise, Glaser explains that the security dilemma exists when a “state’s effort to increase its security would have the unintended effect of reducing its adversary’s security” (Glaser 2010, 56). Montgomery, on the other hand, sees the security dilemma as primarily an issue of perception; he describes it as “the situation where one state’s attempt to increase its security appear threatening to others and provoke an unnecessary conflict” (Montgomery 2006, 151).\nconfidence. In this sense, as Herz points out, “it is one of the tragic implications of the security dilemma that mutual fear of what initially may never have existed may subsequently bring about what is feared the most”. Note that this is a “fertile version” of the philosophical problem of Other Minds, that is, “how one mind can ever know what is in the mind of another”.\nThe difficulty in correctly perceiving other’s intentions is related to the fact that many of the methods by which a state attempts to enhance its security will certainly make other states feel less secure. Jervis notes that, at the domestic level, individuals can attempt to increase their safety in several ways without jeopardizing others; one can, for instance, put bars on the windows, move to a safer area, and avoid dark streets. At the international level, however, “one state’s gain in security often inadvertently threatens others”. The Cold War is a prime example of this. Both the United States’ and the Soviet Union’s efforts to increase their security had the unintended consequence of decreasing the security of the other superpower, leading to a spiral in which they accumulate more military capabilities without making themselves more secure.\nOn top of this, there is what Wheeler and Booth described as the “inherent ambiguity of weapons”. Since most weapons can be used for both defensive and offensive purposes, it is incredibly difficult for decision-makers to foresee with certainty when and how arms may be used by other states. On this topic, Jervis asserts that “[u]nless the requirement for offense and defence differ in kind or amount, a status quo power will desire a military posture that resembles that of an aggressor. For this reason, others cannot infer from its military forces and preparations whether the state is aggressive”. Armament, therefore, is the material reality that initiates the security dilemma.\n Gunitskiy 2011, 595; Supra note 65, at 4. Mearsheimer argues that governments can never be sure of the intentions of other states and that “intentions are impossible to divine with 100 percent certainty”. He also highlights that “intentions can change quickly, so a state’s intentions can be benign one day and hostile the next. Uncertainty about intentions is unavoidable, which means that states can never be sure that other states do not have offensive intentions to go along with their offensive capabilities” (Supra note 74, 2001, at 31).\n Herz 1959, 241.\n Hollis and Smith 1990, 171-172.\n Supra note 71, at 169-70.\n Ibid.\n Jervis 2017, xiii-xiv.\n Tang 2009, 594. On this topic, Libicki explains that “[d]uring the Cold War, when deterrence was the only feasible response to threat posed by the other side’s nuclear weapons, any attempt to build more weapons of bring them to a higher state of readiness [...] would alarm the other side who would feel impelled to do likewise” (Libicki 2016, 129).\n Supra note 65, at 4.\n Supra note 83, at 64. Therefore, even benign, security-seeking actors can be dragged into an arms race.\n Supra note 65, at 1.\n\nCertainly, Herz’s and Butterfield’s original formulations of the security dilemma were an interesting development from the realist school of thought. In its classical form, however, the concept may be of limited use in analysing the modern international system, which has a well-establish legal framework regulating the use of force, and in which most states are no longer threatened whether by war or external aggression. But this does not mean that the security dilemma is irrelevant or even obsolete for international security studies. On the contrary, it remains an extremely important tool for both policymakers and scholars since it can and has been reconceptualized to address modern challenges, including cyber-security ones.\n Supra note 83, at 66.\n Supra note 74, at 117.\n Supra note 75, at 31. “If the threat posed by one state to another [...] is accurately perceived [...] then the situation cannot be classified as a security ‘dilemma’. It is simply a security ‘problem’, albeit perhaps a difficult one”.\n Supra note 74, at 117. This argument generates an obvious puzzle, however: how can one know if threats are real or just apparent?\n Supra note 65.\n Note that realism is hardly the only school of thought to use the concept. The security dilemma has been broadly employed by liberals (see Doyle 1983; Oneal and Russett 1999; Cederman 2001), neoliberals (see Axelrod and Keohane 1985), constructivists (see Wendt 1995), to name a few.\n Bluth 2011, 1375.\n# Chapter 3 – The Attribution Problem\nOne threshold issue in discussing cyber-attribution involves the definition of attribution itself, a question that certainly pervades all literature about this topic. At the most general level, ‘attribution’ refers to the identification of the responsible entity for a malicious cyberattack. What is understood by ‘responsible entity’, however, can vary. There are usually three types of answers: the specific computing device used to carry out an attack, the individual pressing the keys that launch an attack, and ultimately the party that supervised and controlled the attack. According to Lin, even though “these three types of attribution are conceptually distinct, they are often related in practice”. Particularly, identifying the machine from which an attack was launched might provide some clues that can assist unveil the human attacker’s identity, which in turn can help determine the individual or entity responsible for authorizing or acquiescing the cyber operation. Still, each of these types offer different challenges, increasing the difficulty of the attribution process.\nAlthough attributing cyberattacks is not a new challenge, the attribution debate is developing “surprisingly slowly”. Scholars and experts have been dwelling upon the subject and hold a full spectrum of views on it. At the positive end of the spectrum are those, like Rid and Buchanan, who argue that cyber-attribution is not only possible, but “it has been happening successfully for a long time”. Lindsay strikes a more restrained yet positive note, by characterizing attribution as difficult, but acknowledging that there are strong systems for identifying the source of intrusions and responding to attacks, with an increasingly amount of investments being devoted to investigations. At the other end of the spectrum, Singer and Friedman characterize attribution as “[p]erhaps the most difficult problem” in cyberspace, and Eun and Aßmann argue that “determining the real aggressor is impossible unless the aggressor admits to it”. Shackelford further echoes this idea by affirming that sophisticated cyberattacks are “nearly impossible to trace to their sources”.\n---\n Ibid., 5.\n Lin 2016, 5.\n Ibid., 13.\n Supra note 12, at 955.\n Supra note 33, at 5.\n Ibid., 31.\n Supra note 36.\n Supra note 48, at 73.\n Eun and Aßmann 2016, 355.\n Shackelford 2010, 200. Brecher share the same idea that cyberattacks “can be nearly impossible to attribute definitively to their sources” (Brecher 2012, 423).\n3.1 Why is attribution so difficult?\nThere are a number of answers to this question. First, many academics and experts suggest that the difficulty in attributing blame for cyberattacks is mainly due to the intrinsic characteristics of the cyber domain. The structural anonymity, which has been one of the hallmarks and biggest strengths of the Internet, provides the perfect venue for state and non-state actors to undertake malicious operations without fearing attribution or retaliation. The Internet, as Lindsay points out, “was designed to make connections easy and reliable even when the true identity of the connector and the path of the connection were unknown; security did not figure strongly in its early design”. Lupovici, however, seems to disagree on the premise that cyberspace is an inherently anonymous domain. Even though he recognizes that some aspects of the Internet make harder to attribute an attack, he argues that anonymity is a socially attributed trait and, therefore, cyberspace could be structured in a way that does not uphold this characteristic. Along this line of thinking, McConnell suggests that the only solution for the attribution problem is redesigning the Internet so that attribution and geolocation are more feasible. Such a change, however, would be a massive undertaking and probably would not help to prevent the increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks that are being launched today. At the same time, reengineering the entire computer network would reduce its efficiency and dependability, and would bring into question characteristics of the current Internet, such as freedom of action and privacy, that are treasured by many, including intelligence agencies.\nSecond, cyber-attribution is further complicated by the fact that hackers have at their disposal a variety of programs, techniques and applications to conceal the identity of their own Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and thus to thwart detection. One common practice that attackers employ to hide their online trail is to break into poorly secured internet servers or even personal computers and use them as proxies through which they can launch a cyberattack.\n Lupovic 2016, 322; Supra note 25, at 387.\n Lindsay 2013, 375-76.\n Supra note 74, at 330. Lupovici further argues that the current assumption that anonymity is inherent to the cyber domain might affect states’ policies. “Defenders, discouraged from relying on cyber deterrence, may refuse to invest in efforts to establish it. This will decrease the efficiency of cyber deterrence and, as a result, reinforce the existing common knowledge that this strategy is doomed to fail”. (Supra note 104, at 331).\n McConnell 2010.\n Supra note 10, at 3. For instance, Rid argues that McConnell suggestion “is not only unrealistic, it would not even solve the problem at hand” (Rid 2013, 140-41). For Tran, “even if the Internet could arduously be redesigned to authenticate the source IP address of every bit of data sent over the Internet, these addresses would accomplish the goal of merely identifying the source machine of an attack, and not a person, thereby creating another degree of attenuation between an attack and the attacker” (Tran 2018, 390).\n Ibid.\n Greenemeier 2011.\n\"The IP address therefore does not present the attacked state with a physical location to blame or even attack in response. The discovered server could be located in a neutral, friendly or even your own country\". According to Lipson, \"an IP address is a poor surrogate on which to establish a basis for trustworthiness\". The cyberattacks that hit Estonia, for instance, originated from at least 177 countries, such as the United States, Russia, Peru, Egypt, and Estonian itself. As Brenner effectively observed, \"the Internet is one big masquerade ball. You can hide behind aliases, you can hide behind proxy servers, and you can surreptitiously enslave other computers without their owners' knowledge – and then use their computers to do your dirty work\". Another prime example of a technology available to obfuscate one's traces in cyberspace is the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) Marble Framework, which is capable of altering the language of the code from English to another foreign language, such as Chinese, Russian, Korean, Arabic and Farsi.\nIn this regard, Dinstein argues that future technological improvements will probably overcome the challenges that prevent cyber-attribution. Indeed, governments are more capable of attributing responsibility for cyberattacks than they were a decade ago, and these technological advancements and innovations have boosted states' confidence. For example, in 2014, Canada indicated to possess robust systems in place that allow the detection of highly sophisticated attacks, even those launched by state-sponsored actors and, in 2015, the United Kingdom's Chancellor affirmed that \"we are increasingly confident in our ability to determine from where attacks come\". It is important to bear in mind, however, that the technical realm is so \"dynamic\" that new technologies both enhance and hinder states' ability to attribute malicious attacks, generating \"a cycle of escalating offensive and defensive capabilities\".\nThird, even if it is possible to overcome all the technological issues mentioned above and identify the machine used to carry out a cyberoperation with sufficient certainty, cyber-\n Supra note 102.\n Lipson 2002, 56.\n Roscini 2010, 97; Supra note 28.\n Brenner 2011, 13.\n Mueller et al. 2019, 110; Leyden 2017.\n Dinstein 2002, 112. Similarly, Roscini argues that \"further developments in computer technology and Internet regulations might also make it easier to identify the source of the cyberattack\" (Roscini 2010, 97)\n Supra note 42, at 23\n Canada, Statement by the Chief Information Officer for the Government of Canada (July 29, 2014).\n United Kingdom, Chancellor's speech to GCHQ on cybersecurity (November 17, 2015).\n Supra note 33, 1510.\n The improvements in technical attribution might be matched over time by developments in attackers' abilities to conceal their identities, and this \"cat-and-mouse game\" will continue to cyber-attribution difficult. Supra note 93, at 9.\nattribution remains challenging due to what has been called the “human machine gap” or “entry-point anonymity”. That is to say, attribution can only be accomplished if the individual or organization who was operating the computing device can also be identified. With this in mind, it should be noted that rarely does the location of a computer provide precise conclusions vis-à-vis the machine operator’s identity. Therefore, knowing that a cyberattack was executed on the territory of a state, or from the governmental cyber framework of a state, is not enough to attribute said attack to that state.\nFourth, it may be quite difficult to determine the ultimately responsible entity as far as state responsibility is concerned. Even if it is possible to overcome all the technological challenges and identify the human attacker, there remains the question of whether or not there is a relationship between the individual pressing the keys and the state actor. Is the attacker an officially sanctioned government agent? Or is it a third party operating on their own? Deibert, Rohozinski, and Crete-Nishihata acknowledge that there is an increasing tendency towards privateering cyberattacks, and states are particularly interested in this market since it “allows them to execute their missions once removed and clandestinely, thus offering plausible deniability and avoiding responsibilities under international law or the laws of armed conflict”.\nMoving to the legal aspect of attribution, a state will only be held responsible for an internationally wrongful action that is attributable to the state under public international law or that constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the state. On this point, it is important to note that, traditionally, there has been an extremely high bar for establishing state responsibility for acts of non-state actors. Drawing from the International Law Commission’s (ILC) Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, a state can be held liable for the conduct of a non-state actor if the latter is “acting on the instruction of, or under the direction or control of” the state. Note that, sadly, the concepts of ‘instructions’,\n Geiß and Lahmann 2009, 625\n Supra note 111.\n Supra note 120.\n Supra note 55, at 646.\n Deibert, Rohozinski, and Crete-Nishihata 2012, 17.\n International Law Commission, Draft Articles of Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, November 2001, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), art. 2. It is important to note that the ILC’s rules are not a treaty and therefore they are not binding on any state. Yet, these rules were commended by the UN General Assembly in 2012 (UN Doc. A/RES/56/83) and have been mentioned 154 times by international courts, tribunals, and other bodies. (United Nations Legislative Series, Materials on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, 2012, ST/LEG/SER.B/25, viii).\n Supra note 31, at 204.\n Ibid., art. 8.\n'direct', and 'control' all need further explanation. According to the commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility, 'instruction' comprises private individuals or groups acting as an auxiliary of the state. More problematic issues, however, arise in determining the concepts of 'direction' and 'control', for the commentary falls short and does not explain the difference between both of them. Rather, it only says that the terms are \"disjunctive\". International tribunals have also failed to make a distinction between the three concepts with any level of detail. Therefore, as Schmitt put it, \"the prevailing approach tends towards a binary distinction in which either a state tells a non-state actor to perform an act (instruction or direction) or the state exercises 'effective control' over the non-state actor with respect to the act in question\".\nThe effective control test was coined by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in its Nicaragua v. United States of America judgement. Even though the Court does not provide a definition for the expression, it has asserted that a state's participation in the form of \"financing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping\" the non-state actor does not rise to the degree of effective control. In this sense, for example, supplying malware to a terrorist group would not result in state responsibility. In fact, even if the state plans the whole operation and selects the military targets, it still would not be enough to result in attribution. Furthermore, taking into considerations the technical challenges aforementioned, determining that a hacker was under the effective control of a nation-state at relevant time is probably impossible. For instance, the 2007 cyberattacks targeting Estonia were partially attributed to the pro-Kremlin youth group Nashi, but it is not clear whether Russia was involved in the incident.\nIn Prosecutor v. Tadic, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) lowered the threshold by adopting the much less restrictive overall control test, which\n Schmitt 2017b, 9.\n International Law Commission, Draft Article of Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with Commentaries, November 2001, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), art. 8, para. 2.\n Ibid., para. 7.\n Supra note 99.\n International Court of Justice, Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, 27 June 1986, para. 115.\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n Supra note 29, at 563.\n Supra note 9, at 23-24. On this topic, Schmitt and Vihul note that care should be taken when assuming state sponsorship of non-state cyberoperations because non-state actors can launch cyberattacks at a \"fairly low cost and without access to the technical wherewithal of states\" (Schmitt and Vihul 2014, 56).\n\nRegardless of whether effective control or overall control ultimately suits the cyber domain, the attribution bar continues to be extremely high. As a result, states are prevented from adopting any lawful response to a cyberattack, including their inherent right to self-defence, encouraging retaliatory operations outside the existing legal structure. Against this background, some scholars have suggested that one possible solution to these legal challenges is to lower the attribution standard. Schmitt, for instance, defended an indirect responsibility approach by which a state might be held responsible for the consequences of non-state actors’ unlawful operations on its territory “when it fails to take reasonably available measures to stop such acts in breach of its obligations to other states”. Lowering the attribution bar, however, increases the chances of misattribution and conflict escalation.\nFifth, another factor that contributes to the difficulty of attributing cyberattacks is the presence of dynamic and sophisticated non-state actors. Traditionally, states and non-state actors were distinguished by significant imbalances not only in legal status, but also in resources and capabilities. The cyber domain, however, seems to offer great opportunities for non-state actors to challenge and, in some situations, to overcome states’ hegemony. Indeed, today these entities need as much or more attention than other international player due to their ability to profoundly disturb international peace and security. Nevertheless, these actors “enjoy a relative degree of impunity” for the harmful effects of their actions since international law does not offer a tailored framework based on which non-state actors can be held responsible for unlawful acts. In this sense, an adequate legal response to the attribution problem should\n United Nations, International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, *Prosecutor v.

The investigation of cyberattacks is a complex process that requires detailed analysis of technical data, as well as a deep comprehension of political and economic motivations$^{147}$. Consequently, as Sheldon points out, “the forensics of attribution can rarely, if ever, give immediate results and can take days if not weeks to provide solid technical evidence”$^{148}$. Further, former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defence William Lynn III recognized the struggle to attribute cyberattacks, observing that “[t]he forensic work necessary to identify an attacker may take months, if identification is possible at all”$^{149}$. Cyber-attribution, however, is nearly useless if it takes too long and is not able to identify all the actors involved in the attack$^{150}$.\nThese are the numerous hurdles, both technological and legal, that have been oft-mentioned as a hindrance to the development of an effective legal framework for governing cyberattacks$^{151}$. In spite of the fact that previous literature on cybersecurity perceived the attribution problem as an insurmountable technical issue, recent scholars and experts have begun to acknowledge that actual attribution might not be rocket science after all$^{152}$. As Carlin aptly put it, “although attribution is difficult, it is far from impossible”$^{153}$.\n## 3.2 Why does cyber-attribution matter?\nConsidering the number of obstacles that significantly limit cyber-attribution, one is then left to question whether or not the matter is worth international society’s attention. What are the purposes of attributing blame for a cyberattack? Why should states and international stakeholders endeavour to solve the attribution problem?\n$^{146}$ Supra note 13, at 956.\n$^{147}$ Supra note 3, at 2.\n$^{148}$ Sheldon 2014, 289-90\n$^{149}$ Lynn III 2010, 99.\n$^{150}$ Carlin 2016, 409. The duration of the investigation is relevant for cyber-attribution because if a targeted state takes too long to respond, any countermeasures adopted may be seen as punishment, forbidden under public international law. On the other hand, if a targeted state engages in countermeasures too early and has wrongfully attributed the cyberattack, it will have committed an internationally wrongful act itself.\n$^{151}$ According to Shackelford, “the international law doctrine of attribution is in fact an essential ground for regulating cyberattacks” (Shackelford 2008, 233).\n$^{152}$ “Actual attribution of cyber events is already more nuanced, more common, and more political than the literature has acknowledged so far” (Supra note 62).\n$^{153}$ Supra note 119.\nTo start with, cyber-attribution function goes well beyond the mere identification of the responsible entity for a malicious cyberattack; it also serves as a legitimizing tool to justify both formal and informal sanctioning behaviour to other international actors. According to Article 22 of the ILC’s Draft Articles on State Responsibility, a state that has been the target of an internationally wrongful act may adopt countermeasures – actions that would otherwise be unlawful. In order to do so, the victim state must identify the state actor which is responsible for the internationally wrongful act. Eichensehr argues that “[s]uch an attribution could be done privately, but if so, the victim state would risk other states viewing its countermeasures as an initial wrongful act, rather than a lawful response”. Tran adds to the discussion by explaining that even in situations where formal law is not the answer, states would still be required to attribute responsibility in order to implement any informal method of sanctioning the attacker. Thus, attribution is a crucial and necessary prerequisite to any further legal action, be it countermeasures, diplomatic responses or any other informal kind of response. Consequently, it is not unreasonable to assume that solving the attribution problem is the pivotal first step to establish any functioning system of law that regulates cyberattacks.\nAdditionally, publicly attributing the blame for a cyberattack, and consequently sharing specific aspects of it, may help network defenders identify possible vulnerabilities in the system and, thus, prevent future attacks. It is often cited that, in some cases, attribution may also lead to macro-level deterrence. By identifying the culprits of a cyberattack, states are able to publicly name and shame them. Potentially, this practice will cause the named actor, and even third parties, to refrain from future operations. For instance, in 2014, the USA criminally charged five Chinese military hackers for cyberespionage against U.S. corporations and “[f]or a period of time following the indictments, there was a very significant decrease” in Chinese\n Supra note 25, 386.\n “The wrongfulness of an act of a State not in conformity with an international obligation towards another State is precluded if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State” (Supra note 96, art. 22).\n According to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, “countermeasures are actions or omissions by an injured State directed against a responsible State that would violate an obligation owed by the former to the latter” (Supra note 15, 111, rule 20 (1)). Note that countermeasures cannot be taken by non-state actors since they are reserved to states. Similarly, such measures cannot be taken against non-state actors, except when their (cyber) actions are attributable to a state actor. “This is because only states commit, as a matter of law, internationally wrongful acts” (Supra note 7, at 606). Also, Banks argues that countermeasures were created to compel a state to desist in its unlawful actions, not as punishment (Supra note 33, at 1502).\n Supra note 96, art. 49.\n Supra note 63, at 29.\n Supra note 25, at 383-84.\n Supra note 3, at 3.\n Supra note 63, at 25\ncyberactivity. Furthermore, publicly attributing responsibility for cyberattacks might create micro-level deterrence, which is related with the adoption of domestic legal procedures and economic sanctions. According to Goldsmith and Williams, the costs of these measures “are not nothing; would-be state-sponsored cyber-intruders and their principals surely take them into account”. Micro-level deterrence, therefore, could be more successful than its macro-level counterpart. According to Finnemore and Hollis, publicly attributing cyberattacks promote “interactions between the accuser, the accused, and third-party audiences that – over time – may result in the creation of a new norm”. Note, however, that public attribution alone may not be sufficient to deter malicious cyberactivity or produce cyber accountability, particularly if the responsible actor does not care if his/her identity and behaviour are made public.\nFrom an international relations perspective, states and international stakeholders should care about the attribution problem due to its capacity to deteriorate the international political environment. As noted earlier, attributing blame for a cyberattack is no easy task and thus the chances of a malicious cyber operation being framed wrongfully is extremely high. Indeed, misattribution is substantially more likely vis-à-vis cyberattacks than traditional kinetic warfare. With this in mind, one should be cognizant that there is a tendency to explain malicious cyber incidents in terms of geopolitical conditions and existing rivalries, particularly soon after a cyberattack when there is a haste to identify the culprits, to strengthen defences and to retaliate. The 2007 Estonian cyberattack provides one of the clearest examples of this tendency. Due to past Russian actions and the political atmosphere at the time, the attack was attributed to Russia and this explanation was later questioned by cyber experts. A yet more recently example is the 2015 Ukraine power grid cyberattack. Ukraine’s intelligence community was quick to blame Russia for the attack because it was perceived as an escalation of the conflict\n Nakashima 2015.\n To build upon the previous example, in addition to the criminal charges, the Chinese hackers cannot travel to the United States or other country with which it has extradition treaty; if they do, they could be extradited to the USA and face trial. Nor can they engage in financial transactions that touches the U.S. or other sanctioning state financial system.\n Goldsmith and Williams 2018.\n Nevertheless, Eichensehr explains that the effectiveness of micro-level deterrence might vary according to the nationality of the hackers (“losing the ability to travel or to store money in Western Europe may be less of a blow to North Korean hackers than to Russians”), and depends on the level of coercion to which the cyber-attackers are subject (“[i]f their actions on behalf of their government are not voluntary, then the hackers will not alter their behaviour in response”) (Supra note 63, at 27).\n Finnemore and Hollis 2019, 10-11.\n Supra note 29, at 556\n Supra note 13, at 960. Besides heightening the risk of misattribution, this tendency to blame the most obvious culprits prevents alternative explanations from being developed, as well as invites lesser rivals or non-state actors to provoke hostilities. Schulzke argues that “[a]s the risk of being caught diminishes, the costs of attack decrease and the potential benefits become even more attractive” (Supra note 13, at 961).\n\nIt is perhaps useful to underline that the most active participants in the cyber domain are also some of the world’s most powerful states, to wit: The United States, Russia and China. Taking into account that each of these states are equipped with a nuclear armoury, misattributing a cyberattacks could trigger off destructive conflicts with potential to threat the whole international system, putting a premium on a confident degree of cyber-attribution. On top of this, the relative availability and fairly low cost of the technology necessary to launch an attack in cyberspace “leaves the potential for mass destruction within the grasp of far less sophisticated non-state actors and organizations”. So, it does not take much imagination to see the potential threats an unregulated cyber domain pose to international security, economy and also to states’ infrastructure.\nIn this regard, inspired by great theorists such as Thomas Schelling, Robert Jervis, and John Herz, among others, Buchanan took the basic foundation of the security dilemma theory and employed it to cyberspace. A ‘cybersecurity dilemma’ is said to exist when one country cannot increase the security of its digital infrastructure, either through the creation of offensive cyber capabilities, without decreasing other’s cybersecurity. According to Buchanan, the cybersecurity dilemma can be potentially more dangerous and escalatory than traditional kinetic conflicts because, in cyber domain, there is a “perception of offense-dominance”, making defensive measures to be perceived as offensive and threatening. With this in mind, cyberspace appears to be the perfect environment for the security dilemma to thrive. The lack of clarity vis-à-vis the intentions and capabilities of cyber warfare, therefore, have the potential to undermine trust, rise escalation fears, provoke an arms race or even an international armed conflict. “As cyberoperations become more potent and computer networks grow still more important, the dilemma’s dangers – already real – will only grow”.\n Zetter 2016.\n Supra note 39, at 192.\n Supra note 107, at 55.\n Payne 2016, 684-85.\n Buchanan 2017, 108-09.\n Ibid., 191.\n Jinghua 2019.\n Ibid., 194.\nIt is well settled that cyberspace is a phenomenon of international relevance. As a result, the uses and abuses of this borderless virtual domain encroach on states concerns in the physical world, such as national security, economic development and public order and safety. Cybersecurity, like other global challenges faced by the existing international community, extends far beyond the domain of a single state and, therefore, cannot be appropriately addressed by any single international actor, regardless of how influential it might be. Given the increasing costs of insecurity and uncertainty associated with an unregulated cyberspace, international actors may soon come to realize the necessity of an international legal framework capable of addressing cyberattacks.\n\nIn spite of the fact that the principal building blocks of the World Wide Web were laid more than two decades ago, the community of states was not able to reach a broad international agreement on how to govern the cyber domain. In fact, some scholars even suggest that cyberspace seems “resistant to codification of the applicable rules in a comprehensive multilateral binding treaty”. Note, however, that the dearth of cyber-specific regulations is not for lack of trying by major international actors. Already in 1996, the French government pushed for the creation of the Charter for International Cooperation on the Internet, which would be “an accord comparable to the international law of the sea”. The proposal, however, was met with apathy by other international stakeholders.\nAfterwards, in January 2002, the UN General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to settle a group of governmental experts to conduct a study on “relevant international concepts aimed at strengthening the security of global information and telecommunications systems”. The United Nations’ Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications thus became the leading state-based initiative for the codification of international law vis-à-vis the cyber domain, but its success was limited. Between 2004 and 2015, the GGE submitted three reports which expressed the unanimous opinion of the state-participants.\nThe 2010 report was welcomed with great enthusiasm by the international community even though it brought an array of “very rudimentary findings and recommendations” and did not present much legal clarity. However, it highlighted that state actors are developing ICTs\n---\n Supra note 43.\n Wu 1997, 660.\n United Nations General Assembly, Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security, A/RES/56/19, 7 January 2002.\n Supra note 55, at 647. Another worthwhile example of a state-based initiative is the Code of Conduct for Information Security, put forward by China, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The proposal was submitted to the UN General Assembly twice, in 2011 and 2015, but it was not met with enthusiasm by the international community. Note that the 2015 proposal was also co-sponsored by Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.

More substantially, it recognized that “[i]nternational law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment”. The Group also claimed that the principles of sovereignty and state responsibility apply to cyberspace. Note that, in order to guarantee unanimity, a draft provision supporting the applicability of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) was excluded from the report. Even so, many states have publicly endorsed the application of the laws of armed conflict to the cyber domain. The USA, for instance, is of the view that “[l]ong-standing international norms guiding state behaviour – in times of peace and conflict – also apply in cyberspace”. Similarly, Japan stated that “existing international law, including the UN Charter and international humanitarian law, naturally applies to acts in cyberspace”.\nFinally, despite the absence of several important issues and the difficulty in reaching consensus, the 2015 report was considered a “breakthrough”. It explicitly mentioned the General Assembly resolutions on the right to privacy in the digital age and noted the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction, but it did not specifically affirm that IHL applies to activities in the cyber environment. The GGE further suggested that “[v]oluntary, non-binding norms of responsible State behaviour” may prevent conflict in cyberspace\n United Nations General Assembly, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunication in the Context of International Security, UN Doc.

On the other end of the spectrum, the USA, France and the United Kingdom share the position that, under public international law, there is no evidentiary requirement for making accusations. In this regard, U.S. State Department Legal Adviser Brian J. Egan stated that:\n[D]espite the suggestion by some States to the contrary, there is no international legal obligation to reveal evidence on which attribution is based prior to taking appropriate action. There may, of course, be political pressure to do so, and States may choose to reveal such evidence to convince other States to join them in condemnation, for example. But that is a policy choice – it is not compelled by international law.\nThis position was reiterated by the U.K. former Attorney General Jeremy Wright, who explained that “[t]here is no legal obligation requiring a state to publicly disclose the underlying information on which its decision to attribute hostile activity is based”. More recently, France echoed the same opinion.\nIn 2017, the GGE was supposed to submit another report to the UN General Assembly, but the experts failed to reach consensus due to disagreements over controversial areas of international law, such as the right of self-defence, countermeasures, and IHL. According to Herinksen, the collapse of the UN GGE initiative was “fairly predictable” because the debate vis-à-vis the regulation of cyberspace is “as much about strategy, politics and ideological\n Ibid., para. 10.\n Ibid., para. 28(f).\n Supra note 63, at 19.\n For instance, they formally presented a draft UN General Assembly resolution in 2018, asserting that “[s]tates should note that accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated”.

The Group held promise for the clarification of cyber-related customary international law, but it left the global community with an unresolved legal conundrum in which opinions appear to be diverging and solidifying instead of converging. Yet, the GGE reports were a welcomed first step for the discussion on international cyber norms and remain extremely relevant.\nOne encouraging conclusion is that, in spite of the lack of a specific legal framework, cyberspace is certainly not a lawless domain beyond the control of public international law. As it has been pointed out, it is well settled that general principles and rules of international law also apply to cyber operations. Indeed, if international law is to be an effective governance arrangement, it should be flexible to new situations without the necessity to recreate a whole set of rules on each occasion. The development of nuclear weapons is a prime example of this. When the UN Charter was being elaborated, its “framers could not be aware of the threat of nuclear weapons” and therefore the legal instrument did not include this type of armament in its provisions regarding the use of force. Yet, decades later, the ICJ provided an advisory opinion arguing that Articles 2(4) and 51 of the UN Charter, concerning the prohibition of the use of force and self-defence respectively, apply to “any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed”. By this logic, the body of international law that governs the use of force should apply to cyber activities, too. Despite these advances, however, many underlying questions remain virtually unanswered. Perhaps most importantly, how are international legal norms supposed to apply to the complex cyber domain?\n Ibid.\n Korzak 2017.\n Supra note 55, at 648.\n According to Henriksen, the 2013 UN GGE report “reflected an emerging consensus that cyberspace is subject to the same general principles of international law that governs the more physical domains” (Henriksen 2019, 3). The remaining question, therefore, is which international law?\n Supra note 42, at 9. On this point, the United States claims that “[t]he development of norms for state conduct in cyberspace does not require a reinvention of customary international law, nor does it render existing international norms obsolete” (United States of America, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World, May 2011, 9).\n International Court of Justice, Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict (Request for Advisory Opinion Submitted by the World Health Organization) and Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Request for Advisory Opinion Submitted by the General Assembly of the United Nations), CR 95/25, 1995, para. 46.\n International Court of Justice, Reports of Judgements, Advisory Opinions and Orders, Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, para. 39.\n “[T]he mere fact that a computer (rather than a more traditional weapon, weapon system, or platform) is used during an operation has no bearing on whether that operation amounts to a ‘use of force’”.

Given this gloomy picture, scholars, cyber-experts, and international stakeholders have been attempting to fill the normative void with their views on how international law applies to the cyber domain.

This subject, however, warrant a more extended discussion than I can here give it. In this sense, this study focuses on the two leading non-state-driven initiatives that epitomize the phenomenon described above: the Tallinn Manual Project and Microsoft’s proposals.\nThe first non-state initiative that tried to address cyberattacks and increase international cybersecurity was the Tallinn Project, which brought together an international group of independent experts led by Professor Michael Schmitt. The project published two editions of the Manual, respectively in 2013 and 2017, under the auspices of the NATO CCD COE. Their texts, however, must not be seen as representing the views of NATO or sponsoring nations. Rather, the Manuals should be understood as a reflexion of the views of the experts, all acting in their own private capacity. It should be noted that this project is neither an international treaty on cyber law nor does it set forth *lex ferenda*, but it is a restatement of international law as it is – *lex lata*.\nThe 2013 edition, entitled the *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, pays particular attention to cyber activities that occur above the level of use of force and encompasses purported rules of customary international law, the larger part of which related to the *jus ad bellum* (the law governing the use of force) and the *jus in bello* (the law\n Finnemore and Hollis 2016, 446; According to Finnemore and Sikkink, norm entrepreneurs are “agents having strong notions about appropriate or desirable behaviour in their community” (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998, 896-97). Henry Dunant, the founder of the International Committee of the Red Cross, is a prime example of norm entrepreneurship.\n For instance, Chernenko et al. recommend the creation of an “independent, international cyber court or arbitrage method that deals only with government-level cyber conflicts” (Chernenko et al. 2018). RAND’s *Stateless Attribution* report, on the other hand, suggests an international organization for cyber-attribution, the *Global Cyber Attribution Consortium*, which would involve “a broad team of international experts to conduct independent investigations of major cyber incidents for the purpose of attribution” and would operate “without standing state participation” (*Supra* note 3, at 27-31).\n *Supra* note 178.\n Ibid.\n Tallinn Manual, 23; Tallinn Manual 2.0, 2.\n Tallinn Manual, 19; Tallinn Manual 2.0, 3.\n Tallinn Manual, rules 10-19.\nof armed conflict). The Manual was considered to be a “remarkable achievement” and, according to Banks, provided “much-needed confidence for states that international law applies in the cyber domain”. Early reviews, nevertheless, criticized the project’s emphasis on cyber operations that amount to use of force since, in reality, the majority of, if not all, cyber activities fall below the use of force threshold. Another major criticism of the Tallinn Manual is the dearth of geographic diversity among the group of experts, all of whom hail from Western Europe, Australia, and the USA. Consequently, the impartiality of the project is challenged, hindering its acceptability and application by states outside the Global North. China, for instance, has been very critical of the whole Tallinn initiative since it seems to be a North American attempt to “maintain US dominance in the information age”. As noted by Eichensehr, the Manual is “channelling, even though not officially representing, a particular worldview with respect to the laws of armed conflict”.\nIn the 2013 Tallinn Manual, no effort was made to establish legal criteria for attributing blame for cyberattacks and attribution is addressed as a problem, instead of “a realistic task having technical, political and legal aspects”. Still, some provisions may shed light on the attribution problem. For example, Rule 5 asserts that “a state shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States”. Note that this provision restates in cyber terms the principle put forward in the ICJ’s Corfu Channel Judgement. The experts were able to reach consensus on the scope of application of Rule 5, but they could\n Tallinn Manual, rules 20-95.\n Ingber 2017, 1531.\n Supra note 33, at 1494.\n Supra note 42, at 16. On this topic, Xinmin explains that the majority of cyberattacks are perpetrated by non-state actors, which are generally seen as cybercrime or infringement of cyber rights that should be governed by domestic criminal law or the law of torts. Also, she points that “[e]ven if some of these attacks are conducted by states or may be attributable to states, most of them fall far below the threshold of ‘threat of use of force’ or ‘armed attack’. Instead, they are only cyber-attacks of minimal levels of intensity, which are comparable to other internationally wrongful acts such as interference with internal affairs of other states” (Xinmin 2016, 189-29).\n Supra note 152, at 4.\n Eichensehr 2014, 588.\n Fleck 2013, 338.\n Ibid., 334-35.\n It is important to point out that this rule has since been included in the 2015 UN GGE report: “[s]tates should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs” (Supra note 161, para. 13 (c)).\n “Such obligations are based [...] on certain general and well-recognized principles, namely: [...] every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”. International Court of Justice, The Corfu Channel Case, Merits, 9 April 1949, 22.\n “As to scope of application, this Rule covers all acts that are unlawful and that have detrimental effects on another state. (Tallinn Manual, Rule 5, para. 5, 33).\n\nOther noteworthy provision in the Manual is Rule 6, which affirms that “a State bears international legal responsibility for a cyber operation attributable to it and which constitutes a breach of an international obligation”. In this regard, the experts agreed that, in specific circumstances, the acts of non-state actors might be attributable to a state and therefore cause that state’s international legal responsibility$^{245}$. The non-state actor, however, must be either acting “on the instructions of” or “under the direction or control” of that state$^{246}$.\nIn 2017, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations was published, expanding considerably the scope of the project. Now, it also includes the analysis of the international legal framework that applies to malicious cyberattacks that do not meet the use of force threshold. Furthermore, the new Manual addresses peacetime legal regimes, such as state responsibility, human rights law, and the laws of space, air, and the sea. On the whole, the Tallinn 2.0 “reflects a careful effort to move international law forward in the challenging domain of cyberspace”$^{247}$. Mačák further echoes this idea by arguing that the expansion and revision of the document will probably “further strengthen the project’s overall relevance as well as its claim to authority”$^{248}$. Banks, on the other hand, explains that the Tallinn 2.0’s provisions and commentaries are “necessarily general in nature, sometimes ambiguous, and do not necessarily reflect settled international law”$^{249}$.\nRegarding cyber-attribution, in spite of the expectations surrounding its publication, the 2017 Tallinn Manual did not go any further than the previous edition in providing an effective legal solution to the attribution problem$^{250}$. Rather, the experts limited their analysis of cyber-attribution to the well-established Articles on State Responsibility, codified by the ILC$^{251}$. This body of law, as its name suggests, only offers prescriptive norms when there is a state nexus\n\nDespite criticism, the Tallinn initiative provides a comprehensive and attentive analysis of how the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* applies to the cyber environment, along with valuable commentaries on controversial issues that need to be further discussed. Even though the reliance on Western-centric approaches might handicap Tallinn’s acceptance in non-Western countries, such as China and the Russian Federation, the project still is an essential tool for scholars, international lawyers, policymakers, and international stakeholders.\nIn 2014, Microsoft Corporation published a white paper entitled *International Cybersecurity Norms: Reducing Conflict in an Internet-Dependent World*. It was the first thorough proposal to seek the definition of acceptable and unacceptable state conducts online, with the purpose of decreasing risks and bringing predictability and stability to the international scenario. In short, Microsoft proposed six cybersecurity norms to limit conflict and improve cyber defences. These norms are intended to “reduce the possibility that ICT products and services could be used, abused, or exploited by nation states as part of offensive operations”. Note that, like both editions of the Tallinn Manual, Microsoft’s white paper suggests guidelines of state conduct and is openly state-centric in its approach.\nThe project was widely criticized for emphasizing the role of states and thus overlooking the relevance of the private sector, in particular the global ICT industry, for the promotion of international cybersecurity. In response to these claims, Microsoft released another white paper, *From Articulation to Implementation: Enabling Progress on Cybersecurity Norms*, in which the Corporation outlines six further cybersecurity norms. This time, however, the norms were directed at ICT companies. For instance, the paper calls upon the ICT industry to “assist public sector efforts to identify, prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from events in\n Supra note 33, at 1495.\n Supra note 209, at 585.\n Note that Microsoft’s proposal was not the first time a private company put forward an initiative of this kind. Already in 1999, the CEO of AOL, Steve Case, strongly recommended states to “revis[e] outdated and ‘country-centric’ laws on telecommunications and taxes that could thwart the growth of the medium” and instead support “international standards – from security, to privacy, to taxation”. (Case, Steve, Remarks Prepared for Delivery (via satellite) Israel ‘99 Business Conference’, 13 December 1999, cited in Goldsmith and Wu 2006, 26)\n McKay 2014, 2.\n For the complete list of the proposed cybersecurity norms, see McKay 2014, 20.\n Ibid., 11.\n Supra note 42, at 17.\n Charney et al. 2016, 3.\n Ibid.\n\nNote that, while the rules brought by the Tallinn Manuals articulate purported customary international obligations that by themselves are binding on all states, except persistent objectors, the norms put forward by Microsoft’s proposals are only broad suggestions that do not create any right or legal obligation. In other words, Microsoft’s norms are “more aspirational than realistic” and require states to translate them into legally binding rules, which takes time and commitment. Despite this difference, both initiatives have in common the fact that they are non-state-driven, quasi-legal instruments which do not have any legally binding force. In other words, they are soft law rules. In fact, the Tallinn Manuals and Microsoft’s white papers could hardly amount to anything but a non-binding document since states still are “the legislators of the international legal system”. That said, one may call into question the importance of these initiatives for the development of international law. Is soft law an authentic law? Is soft law effective to produce norms despite its non-binding nature?\n\n## 4.2 The value of soft law\nAccording to Besson, international legal norms might have different levels of normativity, ranging from “being low (or soft) as with legal norms in the making to being imperative as with norms of *jus cogens*”. Certainly, the Tallinn Manual project and Microsoft’s papers have a lower degree of legal normativity than binding international rules. Indeed, as stated by the ILC on its study on the Identification of Customary International Law, the “conduct of other actors [than states] is not practice that contributes to the formation, or expression, of rules of customary international law”. This, however, does not imply that these initiatives are utterly irrelevant for the law-making process or even to the development of cyber law. Quite the opposite, considering the normative plurality in international law, non-state-driven initiatives of this kind might be valuable both in quantity and quality. For Thirlway, “soft law is a vital intermediate stage towards a more rigorously binding system, permitting experiment and rapid modification”.\nMoreover, even though these intermediary legal products are not “valid legal norms”, they might possess a certain evidentiary importance in the next stages of the development of rules of international law. Put differently, non-binding documents, such as UN resolutions, might evince the existence of both *opinio juris* and state practice which could later support the formation of customary norms. By this logic, hard and soft laws are not mutually exclusive and should be seen as “tools provided with a different degree of normativity along a *continuum*”. It also should be noted that soft law-making processes normally involve non-state actors and thus are more “multicultural and inclusive” than others.\n---\n By ‘normativity’, I mean “the law’s claim to authority, that is, its claim to provide its legal subjects with exclusionary albeit *prima facie* reasons for action through binding legal norms or in other words its claim to create obligations to obey the law that in principle preclude some countervailing reasons for action” (Besson, 2010, 173).\n Ibid., 174.\n *Supra note* 42, at 19.\n International Law Commission, *Draft Conclusions on Identification of Customary International Law*, with Commentaries, 2018, A/73/10, conclusion 4 (3), 130.\n *Supra note* 240, at 170.\n Thirlway 2019, 186-87.\n *Supra note* 240, at 170.\n Ibid. As pointed by the ILC, non-state practice “may be relevant” when assessing the practice of states (*Supra note* 243).\n Zerilli 2010, 11.\n *Supra note* 240, at 170-171. Regarding soft law, Joyner has interesting points that are worthwhile looking at. For instance, he notes that states are usually “more willing to be innovative when the adopted instrument is not legally binding” (Joyner 1998, 414).\nAccording to Article 38(1) of the Statute of the ICJ, scholarly works are a secondary source of public international law that informs the application of primary sources. Hence, it seems fair to conclude that the aforementioned initiatives are not only highly pertinent, but also “likely to prove especially influential”. Nevertheless, this situation is by no means ideal since states, and only states, hold the formal authority to create international law. As Judge Higgins aptly put it, “[s]tates are, at this moment of history, still at the heart of the international legal system”. However, it is important to bear in mind that the norms proposed by both the Tallinn Manual Project and Microsoft’s papers might “mature through codification into treaty law or crystallise into customary law”, so that they delineate the exact limits of activities in cyberspace.\nThis dynamic is certainly not without precedent. The Antarctic legal regime is the epitome of this. In the 1960s and 1970s, many non-legally binding norms were brought in with high hopes of conserving both living and non-living resources of Antarctica. Joyner argues that the adoption of these non-binding instruments laid the international legal foundation for the treaty that was yet to come. Ultimately, the majority of these norms were codified into the 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, a binding agreement that has been ratified by all major international actors, including the USA, China, and Russia.\nAnother prime example is the international nuclear safety regime. Even though proposals to establish a legally-binding international treaty were put forward since the 1960s, states were generally “disinclined to go beyond the recommendatory nature of the safety standards” issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This situation, however,\n “The Court, whose function is to decide in accordance with international law such disputes as are submitted to it, shall apply:\n(a) international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting states;\n(b) international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law;\n(c) the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations;\n(d) subject to the provisions of Article 59, judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicist of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law”. United Nations, Statute of the International Court of Justice, 18 April 1946, Article 38 (1).\n Schmitt and Vihul 2016, 47.\n Supra note 42, at 19.\n Higgins 1994, 39.\n Supra note 250.\n Joyner 1998, 420. In the 1960s, more than seventy recommended measures were adopted by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Party Meetings (ACTMs); and in 1970s, more than fifty were adopted.\n Ibid.\n Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, October 1991, United Nations Treaty Series, vol. 2941, A-5778.\n Nuclear Energy Agency and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Joint Report on International Law in the Post-Chernobyl Period, 2006, NEA No. 6146, 13.\nchanged rapidly after the Chernobyl accident, which exposed the costly transboundary consequences of unsafe nuclear activity. The 1986 disaster gave rise to an international legally-binding regime for the safe development of nuclear energy, which slowly transformed the safety standards and other relevant non-binding norms into hard law rules.\nOne must be aware, however, that the cyber domain differs in important ways from the Antarctic and the nuclear regimes. Perhaps the most notable difference is that, while the lawmaking process vis-à-vis cyberspace has been spearheaded by non-state-driven initiatives, the development of binding rules for international nuclear safety and the conservation of Antarctica had been led mainly by state actors. Yet, these two regimes are valuable examples that illustrate the codification of soft law norms. With this in mind, the current status of cyber international law should be seen as an early stage towards the codification or crystallisation of cyber hard law. The question that needs to be addressed, therefore, is whether states will finally rise to the challenge.\n Shull 2008, 4.\n To wit: Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, 1986, INFCIRC/335; Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency, 1986, INFCIRC/336; Convention on Nuclear Safety, 1994, INFCIRC/449; Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on The Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, 1997, INFCIRC/546.\n Supra note 42, at 21.\n Ibid.\n\nThe 2007 Estonian attacks, as well as other cyberattacks mentioned in this study, illustrate the severity of the threats facing states’ cybersecurity, and the equally important challenge of implementing a legal framework for attributing blame for cyber activities. Given the ever-growing reliance on ICTs and the increasing frequency, intensity, and complexity of cyberattacks, a solution for the attribution problem is crucial for both promoting a (relatively) stable world order and reducing the chances of conflict stemming from cyberoperations. Note, however, that this solution does not lie in the technical domains, as previously thought. Pragmatically, the most relevant hurdles for cyber deterrence nowadays are not poor technical capabilities since, from a technical standpoint, tools for attribution have matured significantly in recent years, increasing states’ confidence vis-à-vis assigning blame for malicious cyberattacks. Rather, the solution for this issue lies in the realm of international law and cooperation.\nAs transnational terrorism, migration crises, and other security challenges that plague the international community, the attribution problem cannot be appropriately tackled by any single international entity, regardless of how strong and influential that entity might be. Instead, these modern phenomena require a framework for active global collaboration. It is international law that “affords [such] a framework, a pattern, a fabric for international society”. Nevertheless, in the context of the computer network, it seems that international law fails to deliver. Even though states have agreed that public international law applies to cyberactivity, there is no broad multilateral agreement on how to govern cyberspace and, therefore, it is as yet uncertain how the international legal framework applies to this new, complex domain.\nThis difficulty in the application of traditional rules and principles of international law, in order to properly address cyber challenges, results from a number of reasons. Perhaps the most relevant of them is the attachment of this body of law to state-centric assumptions and foundations of the early formative stage of the international legal system. By placing state\n Supra note 3.\n Supra note 10, at 28.\n Supra note 33, at 1502.\n Supra note 43, at 137. By way of an example, the USA has declared that it has the ability to identify and hold their cyber opponents accountable (Fryer-Biggs 2012). Indeed, in the last few years, the U.S. government has attributed high-profile cyberattacks, such as the 2014 intrusion at Sony Pictures Entertainment and the 2016 DNC hack, respectively, to North Korean and Russia (Supra note 42, at 23-24).\n Supra note 42, at 2.\n Henkin 1978, 5.\n Moynihan 2019, 4.\n Supra note 2, at 375.\n Supra note 7, at 610-11.\nactors at the heart of its legal regimes, public international law requires in almost all situations a state link so as to determine either an international legal obligation or an internationally wrongful act. In an environment where non-state actors are as powerful, if not more so, than states, it seems fair to conclude that this legal system grounded in the traditional state-centric perspective of international law is not suitable or even adequate to address challenges posed by cyberspace and the rapid development of ICTs. In this sense, as long as states refuse to recognize the existence and the importance of other international players, any effort to govern cyberspace and to establish legal mechanisms for cyber-attribution will fall short.\nAs it stands now, international law not only fails in effectively dealing with the attribution problem, but also is unlikely to be instrumental in providing both predictability and stability to cyberspace in the short and medium-terms. Besides the lack of clarity of the law in this area, governments have been unwilling to clearly express their existing norms and practices in relation to the cyber domain, impeding the formation of customary international law and increasing unpredictability of state behaviour. Note that, in spite of the constructive contribution made by non-state initiatives, public international law is lagging far behind in many respects and thus continues to be underdeveloped vis-à-vis cyber-attribution.\nBefore proceeding, two points still need to be considered. First, by filling the void created by states’ reluctance to undertake the international law-making process, non-state-driven initiatives, especially the Tallinn Manuals and Microsoft’s proposals, have been providing much-needed clarity to some grey areas of international cyber law. These initiatives, however, are constrained by their state-centric approaches, non-binding character, and interpretative methods, which usually lack the necessary legal safety. Therefore, non-state initiatives represent a relevant but primitive point in the discussion about the application of international law to the cyber domain. They should be seen as a means to an end, not an end in itself.\n Ibid.\n According to Schmitt and Watts, the cyber domain and cyberactivity have bridged “a number of formerly significant gaps between states’ and non-state actors’ abilities to compromise international peace and security. in fact, some non-state actors now match, if not exceed, the cyber capabilities of many states in this respect” (Supra note 7, at 595).\n Supra note 33, at 1509.\n Supra note 42, at 1.\n Supra note 2, at 381. For instance, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 limited its analysis of cyber-attribution to the basic principles of State Responsibility, as codified by the ILC. However, as its name suggests, this body of law can only be applied when there is a state nexus.\n Supra note 33, at 1513.\n In this regard, Mačák points out that non-state initiatives might serve “as norm-making laboratories”, permitting states to identify and assess advantages and disadvantages of a number of proposals (Supra note 42, at 30-31).\n\nSecond, if states genuinely wish to address the problem of cyber-attribution, they can do so; they have the technological capabilities and all the necessary legal power. After all, states are still at the heart of the international legal framework and are the only ones to hold the formal authority to create international rules. This argument generates an obvious puzzle, however: why then do they not solve this conundrum? The answer to this question lies on the fact that some countries may benefit from the current state of affairs, characterized by uncertainties and the lack of express cyber norms. States that possess the most advanced cyber capabilities – such as the United States, Russia, China, and likely North Korea – may take advantage of the cyber domain in order to fulfil their national interests in the physical world. For instance, the USA has allegedly used an extremely sophisticated computer worm, called Stuxnet, to destroy numerous centrifuges in an Iranian nuclear facility, thwarting the prospects of Iran developing nuclear weapons and thus securing American geopolitical interests in the Middle East.\nBy this logic, if states believe that by acting in unregulated cyberspace their gains offset their losses, there will be no incentive for them to promote the regulation of this domain or to solve the attribution problem. This might help to explain why state actors have been so reluctant to engage in the cyber law-making process, as well as to express clear *opinio juris* with respect to cyberspace. Considering the ever-increasing costs of insecurity and uncertainty related to an ungoverned cyber domain, states may soon come to realize the necessity of an international legal framework capable of addressing cyberattacks. As Professor Koh aptly put it, “compliance with international law frees us to do more, and do more legitimately, in cyberspace, in a way that more fully promotes our national interests”. Therefore, one can only hope that\n Supra note 283.\n Supra note 42, at 19.\n Supra note 33, at 1511.\n It should be noted that the former U.S. Secretary of Defence Leon Panetta stated that the American government was “developing the plans that needed to be developed to ensure the United States would remain one of the strongest players in the cyber arena” (Stone 2019).\n Zetter 2014a.\n Note, however, that this process might already be in motion, as illustrated by the 2015 cyber agreement between the United States and China (Harold 2016; Supra note 42, at 27).\n Koh 2012, 10.\nstates do not wait for the occurrence of a “cyber 9/11” $^{316}$ or a “cyber Pearl Harbour” $^{317}$ to overcome their aversion to engaging in the development of international cyber law.\nIn the meantime, cyberspace will continue to be an environment that offers the perfect conditions for the security dilemma to thrive and in which the activities of both state and non-state actors can trigger off conflicts causing widespread harm to societies, the global economy, and the international security system. With this in mind, international stakeholders and policymakers should strive to increase transparency, so as to bridge the existing trust gaps inside the international community. Overall, greater transparency reduces misperceptions and conflict spirals and, consequently, leads to cooperation and better cybersecurity.\nIt is important to point out that, due to time constraints, this thesis was not able to assess the role played by the private sector in attributing blame for cyberattacks or to analyse non-Western approaches to the international rule of law in the cyber domain. Future researches, therefore, should attempt to explore these topics.\n\n45",

Montgomery, on the other hand, sees the security dilemma as primarily an issue of perception; he describes it as “the situation where one state’s attempt to increase its security appear threatening to others and provoke an unnecessary conflict” (Montgomery 2006, 151).",

Grover\nWord count: 11.950\n\n# Abstract\nThe 2007 Estonian attacks illustrate the severity of the threats facing states' cybersecurity, and the equally important challenge of attributing blame for cyberattacks. Even though determining the machines that launched a malicious cyber incident is no longer an arduous task for the most developed states, identifying the individuals, organizations, or governments that are legally responsible for the attack continues to be extremely difficult. This study argues that, as it stands now, international law not only fails in effectively dealing with the attribution problem, but also is unlikely to be instrumental in providing both predictability and stability to cyberspace in the short and medium-terms. As a result, the cyber domain will continue to be an environment that offers the perfect conditions for the security dilemma to thrive and in which incidents – whether intended or not – can trigger off conflicts causing widespread harm to the whole international security system.\nKeywords: cyber-attribution, attribution problem, cybersecurity, security dilemma, international security, Tallinn Manual, non-state initiatives.\n\nAbbreviations ... 5\nChapter 1 – Introduction ... 6\nChapter 2 – Realism and the Security Dilemma ... 14\n2.1 What is the security dilemma? ... 15\nChapter 3 – The Attribution Problem ... 18\n3.1 Why is attribution so difficult? ... 19\n3.2 Why does cyber-attribution matter? ... 24\nChapter 4 – International Law and Cybersecurity ... 29\n4.1 Leading non-state initiatives ... 34\n4.2 The value of soft law ... 39\nChapter 5 – Conclusion ... 42\nBibliography ... 46\nArticles, Reports and Books ... 46\nLegal Sources and Official Documents ... 53\nWebsites ... 56\n\nACTMs Antarctic Treaty Consultative Party Meetings\nCCD COE Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence\nCIA Central Intelligence Agency\nDDOS Distributed Denial of Service\nDNC Democratic National Committee\nDNI Director of National Intelligence\nGGE Group of Governmental Experts\nIAEA International Atomic Energy Agency\nICJ International Court of Justice\nICTs Information and Communication Technologies\nICTY International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia\nIHL International Humanitarian Law\nILC International Law Commission\nIP Internet Protocol\nNATO North Atlantic Treaty Organization\nUK United Kingdom\nUSA United States of America\nVCLT Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties\n# Chapter 1 – Introduction\nBy providing people across the globe with instant access to information, to communication, and to novel economic opportunities, cyberspace and the rapid development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have essentially transformed not only the world economy, but also the way of life. Education, health, government, as well as sectors such as energy, communication, and transportation are inextricably linked to, if not dependent on, the cyber domain. As information technology becomes more widespread and integrated into our daily lives, the probability of compromise by malicious cyber activity increases. According to the former Director of National Intelligence (DNI) of the United States, more than thirty countries are developing offensive cyber capabilities, which will rise the incidence of both standoff and remote operations. To complicate matters further, these capabilities are progressively under criminal and other non-state actors’ control. Therefore, cyberattacks that deeply affect international peace and the global economy are no longer “futuristic or far-fetched”, but rather the reality of cyberspace.\n “Cyberspace” is defined by the United States National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations as “a domain characterized by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructure” (United States Department of Defence (DoD), *The National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations*, December 2006,3). Therefore, cyberspace also includes all networked digital operations.\n Pipyros et al. 2018, 371.\n Davis II et al. 2017, 1\n United States Senate 2017, 5.\n Owens, Dam, and Lin 2009, 27.\n By cyberattack, I refer to the definition applied by Oona Hathaway et al. as “any action taken to undermine the functions of a computer network for a political or national security purpose” (Hathaway et al. 2012, 826). This definition, however, differs from that used by the U.S. Cyber Command, which identifies cyberattacks as those “that cause physical damage to property or injury to persons.” (Ibid., 821 n.9). Hathaway et al.’s definition also differs from the one offered by the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, which describe cyberattack as “a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects” (Schmitt 2013, 92). It is important to bear in mind that both the Tallinn Manual and the Cyber Command definitions are under-inclusive, particularly considering the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack, which did not cause physical damage to property or persons, but involved the *domaine reservé* of the U.S., raising relevant national security concerns about democratic procedures and the violation of the prohibition of intervention. Hathaway et al.’s terminology, on the other hand, covers a broader set of cyberattacks, including attacks such as the DNC hack.\nIn addition, I use the term ‘cyberattack’ instead of ‘cyber warfare’ because the latter refers to a smaller subset of cyberattacks that “constitute armed attacks or that occur in the context of an ongoing armed conflict” (Hathaway et al. 2012, 821). By contrast, the term ‘cyberattack’ embraces a broad range of attacks, from cyber warfare to those attacks that fall short of armed conflict but still deserve some kind of sanction (Tran 2018, 380 n.13). Furthermore, Hathaway and her co-authors make a distinction between cyberattacks and cyberespionage; according to the they, “neither cyber-espionage nor cyber-exploitation constitutes a cyber-attack because these concepts do not involve altering computer networks in a way that affects their current or future ability to function” (Hathaway et al. 2012, 829).\n Schmitt and Watts 2016, 596.\nFollowing the relocation of a Soviet war memorial in 2007, Estonia was hit by a series of massive cyberattacks lasting three weeks. Taking into consideration that the small Baltic country is one of the most wired societies in Europe, the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks were particularly harmful, resulting in a temporary interruption of service on many government and commercial websites and, thus, profoundly affecting the functioning of the country’s economy. Initially, the attacks were attributed to Russia due to the political atmosphere at the time, as well as past Russian actions. This explanation, however, was questioned by technical experts, and even NATO officials were disinclined to assign blame to the Russian government. Because of disagreements over the links between the attackers and Russia, what at first appeared to be a pretty obvious case of aggression became a gridlock. Although it is highly probable that the Russian state launched the cyberattack, its involvement has never been proven. Yet, the attack continues to be an example of Russia’s cyber capabilities that following cyberattacks will be judged by.\nIn hindsight, the Estonian attacks were “fairly mild and simple”, far less damaging than the cyberattacks that have followed. Even so, they brought cyberspace to the forefront of international relations discussions, raising awareness among states about the severe risk posed by the growing dependence on ICTs, as well as the possibility of conflict in this new and unique environment. Indeed, during the last decade, the international community has witnessed and experienced a considerable number of problematic episodes in cyberspace – the cyber intrusion at Sony Pictures Entertainment, the attack on France’s TV5Monde, the Democratic National\n Traynor 2007.\n By 2007, 98% of Estonian territory was covered with Internet access, and mobile phone penetration was almost 100% (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010, 17).\n According to Clark and Landau, DDoS attack is a concerted malevolent effort in which a large number of machines from all over the Internet attack a site or a set of sites in order to disrupt service by overloading a server or a link (Clark and Landau 2011, 6).\n Dinniss 2014, 38-39.\n Supra note 8, at 25.\n Schulzke 2018, 960.\n Ibid. It is necessary to recognize that this situation poses a threat to international peace since, according to Gomez, the “adversary’s past behaviour may motivate a disproportionate response to pre-empt any further threats” (Gomez 2019, 1-2).\n Schmitt 2017, xxiii.\n On November 2014, Sony Pictures’ computers were broken into, and sensitive information from the film studio and unreleased movies were published online, disrupting the company business operations (Davis II et al. 2017, 42). Considering that Sony had produced the movie The Interview, which depicts the assassination of Kim Jong-Un, speculations about North Korean participation were raised (Egloff 2019, 10). Through a press statement, North Korea denied responsibility for the cyberattack, but praised the attackers for their actions. As of yet, no one was able to prove North Korean involvement and the evidence implicating it was considered “flimsy” (Zetter 2014b).\n In April 2015, the French-language television network had its computer infrastructure and social media accounts hacked. Initially, the group called Cyber Caliphate, an Islamic State affiliate, claimed responsibility for the\n\nAgainst this background, at the 2016 Defence Ministerial Meeting, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) defence ministers officially recognized cyberspace as a new frontier of warfare, and that decision was endorsed at the 2016 Warsaw Summit. Now, the Allies “recognize cyberspace as a domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea”. Certainly, the change comes as a response to the increasing number of cyberattacks against both the organization and its member states. The threat posed by these attacks even prompted former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security to declare that cyberattacks “now exceed the risk of physical attacks” in terms of breadth and range of possible outcomes. And such attacks show no sign of decreasing, as the aforementioned examples demonstrate.\nAlthough the persistence of cyberattacks might be due, in part, to the relative availability and fairly low cost of the technology needed to mount an attack, it might also largely result from the difficulty in identifying its perpetrators and attributing blame. The structure of the Internet, which “was not designed with the goal of deterrence in mind”, provides the perfect setting for state and non-state actors to take part in malicious activity unafraid of attribution or retaliation. Worse still, aggressors are able to conceal themselves and the full effects of their operations by using technical mechanisms and/or relying on non-state proxies that they rent or compromise. For example, the cyberattacks that hit Estonia originated from at least 177\nattacks, but as the investigations began, it became clear that the jihadist group was just a cover-up (Corera 2016). The private company FireEye ultimately attributed the attack to Russian hackers.\n In 2015, in the middle of the presidential election, the DNC suffered a cyberattack, resulting in the exfiltration of files and emails, many of which were published by WikiLeaks. In 2016, the DNC publicly attributed the attack to two distinct Russian espionage groups, APT28 and APT29 (Egloff 2019, 13). Although it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to assess the full damage of the cyber intrusion, it is understood to have played a major role in the 58th U.S. presidential election (Davis II et al. 2017, 34).\n Allison 2018; Banks 2019, 191.\n Barnes, 2016.\n Ablon et al. 2019, 1.\n NATO, Warsaw Summit Communiqué (July 2016), n.70.\n Nielsen 2018.\n Payne and Finlay 2017, 556; Boerbert 2010, 43.\n Tran 2018, 381.\n Supra note 10, at 1.\n Supra note 24.\n Carlin 2016, 409; Carr 2010, 139-40.\ncountries, including from within the Estonian territory. Evidence has been found that attackers also obscure their identities through the adoption of foreign languages and elements of malware previously associated with other actors, and they might even exploit existing animosities in order to mask their identity and thus hinder attribution efforts. By way of one example, the escalating tension between Iran and the United States suggests that both countries would be unwilling to fully cooperate in the case of a cyberattack, making Iran the perfect cover-up for third-party states and non-state actors attempting to launch a cyberattack against the USA and vice versa. It is therefore understood that attributing cyberattacks is vastly time-consuming and an “inherently interdisciplinary” process, requiring great technical and non-technical expertise and input from a range of actors and sources. In this regard, taking into account the effort necessary for its fulfilment, cyber-attribution was considered to be “an art as much as a science”.\nThe Estonian attacks are a prime example of how challenging the attribution of cyberattacks can be; thirteen years have passed and one cannot affirm whether the attacks were officially sanctioned by the Russian government or whether they were perpetrated by rogue spies or even by independent nationalistic criminals. It is important to bear in mind that, in the cyber domain, attribution differs from punishment, and it is defined as “identifying the agent responsible for the action”. Since cyberattacks have proliferated and become commonplace, attribution has grown in relevance. As a result, states have been investing resources and political capital to develop accountable attribution mechanisms in order to deter potential cyberattackers.\nIn spite of the fact that determining the machines that launched a cyberattack is no longer an arduous task for the most developed countries, identifying the individuals, organizations, or governments that are legally responsible for the attack continues to be challenging. The attribution of cyberattacks presents unique legal challenges because states were not able to reach a broad international agreement on how to govern the cyber domain and the current\n Payne and Finlay 2017, 560.\n Supra note 12.\n Ibid; Payne and Finlay 2019, 203.\n Egloff and Wenger 2019, 3\n Banks 2017, 1503.\n Rid and Buchanan 2015, 7.\n Supra note 12.\n Lindsay 2015, 57.\n Supra note 10.\n Banks 2019, 191.\n Supra note 38, at 192.\ninternational legal framework does little to control cyber operations. On this matter, Schmitt and Vihul believe that even if agreement were to be reached on a multilateral binding cyber treaty, it would probably be undermined by states’ individual reservations. Similarly, according to Mačák, there seems to be a resistance to the codification of international rules applicable to cyberspace.\nIn addition, as cyber operations usually happen in secrecy, customary international law is not able to develop understandings or recognize state practice about attributing responsibility for cyberattacks. Further complicating the issue, governments have been unwilling to clearly express *opinio juris* on topics associated with the cyber domain. This attitude might be the result of a domestic political deadlock, a calculated waiting strategy, or even the product of the “cybersecurity knowledge gap”. Nevertheless, this state reticence contributes to the enduring ambiguity of international cyber law. It is also important to point out that no international organization, agency, or entity has the legal authority to attribute responsibility for a cyberattack. Due to this institutional legal vacuum, seldom do governments make official attribution claims, and, in the rare occasion that they do, their statements are normally perceived\n Supra note 25, at 384.\n Schmitt and Vihul 2016, 39. As codified in Article 2(d) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), reservation is “a unilateral statement, however phrased or named, made by a State, when signing, ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to a treaty, whereby it purports to exclude or to modify the legal effect of certain provisions of the treaty in their application to that State” (United Nations, *Vienna Convention on the law of treaties*, 23 May 1969, vol. 1155,1-18232, art. 2(d)).\nIt is perhaps useful to point out that some scholars have indicated that a successful agreement might be almost impossible to achieve, at least in the near future. For instance, Waxman believes that “not only do certain features of cyber-activities make international legal regulation very difficult, but major actors also have divergent strategic interests that will pull their preferred doctrinal interpretations and aspirations in different directions, impeding formations of a stable international consensus” (Waxman 2011, 425-26). On this point, Goldsmith argues that “the fundamental clash of interests concerning the regulation of electronic communications, the deep constrains the United States would have to adopt to receive reciprocal benefits in a cybersecurity treaty, and the debilitating verification problems will combine to make it unfeasible to create a cybersecurity treaty that purports to constrain governments”. (Goldsmith 2011, 12).\n Mačák 2017, 5.\n Mačák 2016, 130. About the high classified nature of state practice in cyberspace, Clarke and Knake state that “the entire phenomenon of cyber war is shrouded in such government secrecy that it makes the Cold War look like a time of openness and transparency” (Clarke and Knake 2010, xi). Also, Efrony and Shany try to explain the absence of transparency in cyberspace; for them, states believe that transparency may reveal “their vulnerabilities, adversely affect their offensive or defensive capabilities, and weaken their power of deterrence” (Efrony and Shany 2018, 631).\n Supra note 38, at 194.\n Among the notable exceptions, the USA stands out with its International Strategy for Cyberspace (United States, The White House, *International Strategy for Cyberspace: Property, Security, and Openness in a Networked World*, May 2011).\n Schmitt and Watts 2015, 211.\n Singer and Friedman 2014, 4-8.\n Supra note 43, at 130.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, scholars, cyber-experts, and international stakeholders have been attempting to bridge the gap with their views on how international law applies to cyberspace. These non-state-driven initiatives are trying to promote a safe international system and reduce the chances of conflict arising from cyberattacks by filling the void created by states’ reluctance to undertake the international law-making process. The most important and comprehensive of these attempts certainly is the Tallinn Manual project, which is under the auspices of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE). This project, however, is neither an international treaty on cyber law nor does it offer a new set of international rules nor represent the position of any country or organization. Rather, it is a restatement of international law as it is (lex lata), establishing a comprehensive legal structure for the governance of cyber operations during both times of peace and conflict. Considering the Tallinn project’s non-state and non-binding nature, one is then left to question its actual relevance to public international law, which still is very much attached to state-centric assumptions and foundations of the early formative stage of the international legal regime.\nOn this basis, my main argument lies heavily on the idea that the current international legal framework is underdeveloped vis-à-vis cyber-attribution, as its norms and principles were designed to the physical world and still, at present, mainly govern the relationship between states. Cyberspace, on the other end of the spectrum, is predominantly inhabited by non-state\n Supra note 2, at 19. It is interesting to highlight that attributing cyberattacks to states is a new phenomenon (Eichensehr 2019b ,7-8). For instance, the first official public accusation by the USA only came in 2014, when five Chinese military hackers were criminally charged for cyberespionage against U.S. corporations (The United States, Department of Justice, May 19 2014).\n By attribution problem, I refer to the difficulty in discovering the identity or location of the responsible for a cyberattack or their intermediary.\n Supra note 25, at 384; Supra note 31, at 205.\n Supra note 32, at 1495.\n Supra note 31, at 205.\n Chircop 2018, 653.\n Supra note 42, at 1.\n Despite NATO’s sponsorship, the Tallinn Manuals do not reflect the official position of the Alliance.\n Supra note 32, at 1494.\nactors and, as Libicki aptly put it, is divided between the physical, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic layers. As it stands now, international law fails in coping with contemporary challenges posed by cyberspace and the rapid development of ICTs, notably the attribution of cyberattacks. As will be developed below, this practical gap not only hinders the cyber-attribution process, but also threatens international security on an equivalent scale to traditional armed attacks.\nAlthough literature on cybersecurity normally perceives the attribution problem as a technical issue, due to the significant technological advancements experienced in the last decade, attribution is already “more nuanced, more common, and more political” than it is acknowledged. It is therefore understood that the solution to this dangerous situation lies within the legal and political domains, not in the technical realm. Non-state initiatives have been trying to overcome this legal quagmire, but the international legal system still is inherently attached to a state-centric approach. Therefore, no set of international binding rules as far as cybersecurity is concerned will ever likely be achieved without the participation of states.\nConsidering that so many aspects of our lives are now bound up with cyberspace, the discussion about cyber-attribution is not only pertinent but also urgent. Such a delicate situation deserves to be taken most seriously and it would be unduly ambitious to try to provide a full answer in this study. My purpose, however, is to make a modest attempt at shedding some light on the issue. Ideally, this may contribute to a constructive debate about the problem of attributing blame for cyberattacks.\nThe following research question was articulated in order to function as the backbone of the work here presented: to what extent is international law underdeveloped vis-à-vis cyber-attribution? Also, as a means to enlighten the path of this study, the following sub-questions were established: why does cyber-attribution matter? What are the legal and political challenges imposed by the attribution problem? How the difficulty in attributing blame of a cyberattack affects international security?\nIn order to carry out the aforementioned study, a qualitative research of a doctrinal nature will be applied. Mainly, this will be a legal work based on primary and secondary legal sources. Parallel to the legal background, this study will also endeavour to apply the International Relations’ concept of security dilemma to cyberspace. By bringing this concept to the\n Supra note 42, at 14.\n Libicki 2007, 236-37.\n Supra note 54, at 652.\n Supra note 33, at 6.\n Eichensehr 2019b, 2.\n\nIn international relations theory, Realism, also known as political realism, is one of the dominants schools of thought. Realists depict an anarchical, competitive and conflictual world, in which insecurity among states is inescapable. Note that ‘anarchical’ is used here in a technical sense, indicating the dearth of an overarching, political authority at the international level. Under anarchy, states are the main actors in the international arena and their primary responsibility is to secure their own interests, especially their survival. In order to do so, according to the realist theory, states will attempt to acquire power and engage in power-balancing, creating what Hoffman called “a state of war”.\nThe interstate political order is, therefore, a self-help system plagued by “uncertainty, weapons and fear”, and in which power plays the leading role in shaping the relation between states. As long as we accept the basic premises of the realist theory, this hostile and insecure environment not only leaves little room for international cooperation, but also encourages “behaviour that leaves all concerned worse off than they could be, even in the extreme case in\n This study will not differentiate Realism into its various strands since this warrant a more extended discussion that I can here give it. It is perhaps useful to point out, however, that realism is normally contrasted with liberalism or idealism, which tend to focus on international cooperation. Compared to these theories, the realist perspective is undeniably pessimistic. As Keohane put it, realism is “the language of power and interests rather than of ideals or norms” (Keohane 1986, 9).\n Wheeler and Booth 2007, 2.\n Waltz 1979, 91. Waltz points out that, “internationally, the environment of states’ actions, or the structure of their system, is set by the fact that some states prefer survival over other ends obtainable in the short run and act with relative efficiency to achieve that end” (Waltz, 1979, 93). On this topic, Jervis identifies throughout his book, entitled *Perception and Misperception in International Politics*, some states that did not have survival as their primary goal. For instance, During Hitler’s government, Germany valued territorial expansion over security (Jervis 2017).\n According to Andersen, balance of power is “a mechanism that ideally would make states intentionally or unintentionally join the weaker part against the strong, to equal out or balance the distribution of power amongst states in the international system” and states “would do this to assure their own survival” (Andersen 2018, 1).\n Hoffmann defines ‘state of war’ as “a competition of units in the kind of state of nature that knows no restrains other than those which the changing necessities of the game and the shallow convenience of the players impose” (Hoffmann 1965, vii).\n *Supra note* 65.\n Korab-Karpowicz 2017. It is important to note that Wendt argues, through the lenses of Constructivism, that “self-help and power politics are institutions, and not essential features of anarchy. Anarchy is what states make of it” (Wendt 1992, 395).\n Waltz points out two reasons why international cooperation is limited by anarchy: insecurity and unequal gains. In an anarchic international system, states are not certain about each other’s intentions and they fear that cooperation might favour one state in detriment of the others, creating some kind of dependence. He argues that “[s]tates do not willingly place themselves in situations of increased dependence. In a self-help system, considerations of security subordinate economic gain to political interest” (*Supra note* 66, at 107).\n\n## 2.1 What is the security dilemma?\nAccording to Wheeler and Booth, the security dilemma is the quintessential dilemma in interstate politics. Coined by Herz (1950) and Butterfield (1951), the term has since become an integral part of any discourse on international security and has been expanded and employed to “address many of the most important questions of international relations theory and security policy”. Both authors describe the security dilemma as a situation where the increase of a state’s security simultaneously (and unintentionally) decreases the security of other states. The risk here is that misperceptions and conflict spirals dramatically increase the chances of unnecessary or avoidable armed conflicts.\nFor instance, a state might attempt to increase its own security and avert aggression by acquiring more weapons, bringing them to a higher state of readiness, or creating alliances. Under anarchy, an adversarial state will get the wrong impression about this behaviour, interpreting it as a preparatory action for future attacks. This state will thus fell threatened and will take action to enhance its own security. The first state will have confirmed its suspicions about its adversary’s belligerence, increasing tension and leading to an arms race or even war. In this scenario, conflict is not the product of the actual intentions and military capabilities of a specific actor. Rather, it is the result of mutual misperceptions and miscommunications that arise from the inability of states to understand each other’s intentions and motives with complete\n Jervis 1978, 167.\n Carlsnaes et al. 2002, 372; Montgomery 2006, 183.\n Schweller 1996, 116. Note that, according to Mearsheimer, “the best way for a state to survive in anarchy is to take advantage of other states and gain power at their expenses” (Mearsheimer 2001, 36).\n Supra note 65, at 29.\n Glaser 1997, 172.\n Jervis describes the security dilemma as a situation where “many of the means by which a state tries to increase its security decreases the security of others” (Supra note 71, at 169-70). Likewise, Glaser explains that the security dilemma exists when a “state’s effort to increase its security would have the unintended effect of reducing its adversary’s security” (Glaser 2010, 56). Montgomery, on the other hand, sees the security dilemma as primarily an issue of perception; he describes it as “the situation where one state’s attempt to increase its security appear threatening to others and provoke an unnecessary conflict” (Montgomery 2006, 151).\nconfidence. In this sense, as Herz points out, “it is one of the tragic implications of the security dilemma that mutual fear of what initially may never have existed may subsequently bring about what is feared the most”. Note that this is a “fertile version” of the philosophical problem of Other Minds, that is, “how one mind can ever know what is in the mind of another”.\nThe difficulty in correctly perceiving other’s intentions is related to the fact that many of the methods by which a state attempts to enhance its security will certainly make other states feel less secure. Jervis notes that, at the domestic level, individuals can attempt to increase their safety in several ways without jeopardizing others; one can, for instance, put bars on the windows, move to a safer area, and avoid dark streets. At the international level, however, “one state’s gain in security often inadvertently threatens others”. The Cold War is a prime example of this. Both the United States’ and the Soviet Union’s efforts to increase their security had the unintended consequence of decreasing the security of the other superpower, leading to a spiral in which they accumulate more military capabilities without making themselves more secure.\nOn top of this, there is what Wheeler and Booth described as the “inherent ambiguity of weapons”. Since most weapons can be used for both defensive and offensive purposes, it is incredibly difficult for decision-makers to foresee with certainty when and how arms may be used by other states. On this topic, Jervis asserts that “[u]nless the requirement for offense and defence differ in kind or amount, a status quo power will desire a military posture that resembles that of an aggressor. For this reason, others cannot infer from its military forces and preparations whether the state is aggressive”. Armament, therefore, is the material reality that initiates the security dilemma.\n Gunitskiy 2011, 595; Supra note 65, at 4. Mearsheimer argues that governments can never be sure of the intentions of other states and that “intentions are impossible to divine with 100 percent certainty”. He also highlights that “intentions can change quickly, so a state’s intentions can be benign one day and hostile the next. Uncertainty about intentions is unavoidable, which means that states can never be sure that other states do not have offensive intentions to go along with their offensive capabilities” (Supra note 74, 2001, at 31).\n Herz 1959, 241.\n Hollis and Smith 1990, 171-172.\n Supra note 71, at 169-70.\n Ibid.\n Jervis 2017, xiii-xiv.\n Tang 2009, 594. On this topic, Libicki explains that “[d]uring the Cold War, when deterrence was the only feasible response to threat posed by the other side’s nuclear weapons, any attempt to build more weapons of bring them to a higher state of readiness [...] would alarm the other side who would feel impelled to do likewise” (Libicki 2016, 129).\n Supra note 65, at 4.\n Supra note 83, at 64. Therefore, even benign, security-seeking actors can be dragged into an arms race.\n Supra note 65, at 1.\n\nCertainly, Herz’s and Butterfield’s original formulations of the security dilemma were an interesting development from the realist school of thought. In its classical form, however, the concept may be of limited use in analysing the modern international system, which has a well-establish legal framework regulating the use of force, and in which most states are no longer threatened whether by war or external aggression. But this does not mean that the security dilemma is irrelevant or even obsolete for international security studies. On the contrary, it remains an extremely important tool for both policymakers and scholars since it can and has been reconceptualized to address modern challenges, including cyber-security ones.\n Supra note 83, at 66.\n Supra note 74, at 117.\n Supra note 75, at 31. “If the threat posed by one state to another [...] is accurately perceived [...] then the situation cannot be classified as a security ‘dilemma’. It is simply a security ‘problem’, albeit perhaps a difficult one”.\n Supra note 74, at 117. This argument generates an obvious puzzle, however: how can one know if threats are real or just apparent?\n Supra note 65.\n Note that realism is hardly the only school of thought to use the concept. The security dilemma has been broadly employed by liberals (see Doyle 1983; Oneal and Russett 1999; Cederman 2001), neoliberals (see Axelrod and Keohane 1985), constructivists (see Wendt 1995), to name a few.\n Bluth 2011, 1375.\n# Chapter 3 – The Attribution Problem\nOne threshold issue in discussing cyber-attribution involves the definition of attribution itself, a question that certainly pervades all literature about this topic. At the most general level, ‘attribution’ refers to the identification of the responsible entity for a malicious cyberattack. What is understood by ‘responsible entity’, however, can vary. There are usually three types of answers: the specific computing device used to carry out an attack, the individual pressing the keys that launch an attack, and ultimately the party that supervised and controlled the attack. According to Lin, even though “these three types of attribution are conceptually distinct, they are often related in practice”. Particularly, identifying the machine from which an attack was launched might provide some clues that can assist unveil the human attacker’s identity, which in turn can help determine the individual or entity responsible for authorizing or acquiescing the cyber operation. Still, each of these types offer different challenges, increasing the difficulty of the attribution process.\nAlthough attributing cyberattacks is not a new challenge, the attribution debate is developing “surprisingly slowly”. Scholars and experts have been dwelling upon the subject and hold a full spectrum of views on it. At the positive end of the spectrum are those, like Rid and Buchanan, who argue that cyber-attribution is not only possible, but “it has been happening successfully for a long time”. Lindsay strikes a more restrained yet positive note, by characterizing attribution as difficult, but acknowledging that there are strong systems for identifying the source of intrusions and responding to attacks, with an increasingly amount of investments being devoted to investigations. At the other end of the spectrum, Singer and Friedman characterize attribution as “[p]erhaps the most difficult problem” in cyberspace, and Eun and Aßmann argue that “determining the real aggressor is impossible unless the aggressor admits to it”. Shackelford further echoes this idea by affirming that sophisticated cyberattacks are “nearly impossible to trace to their sources”.\n---\n Ibid., 5.\n Lin 2016, 5.\n Ibid., 13.\n Supra note 12, at 955.\n Supra note 33, at 5.\n Ibid., 31.\n Supra note 36.\n Supra note 48, at 73.\n Eun and Aßmann 2016, 355.\n Shackelford 2010, 200. Brecher share the same idea that cyberattacks “can be nearly impossible to attribute definitively to their sources” (Brecher 2012, 423).\n3.1 Why is attribution so difficult?\nThere are a number of answers to this question. First, many academics and experts suggest that the difficulty in attributing blame for cyberattacks is mainly due to the intrinsic characteristics of the cyber domain. The structural anonymity, which has been one of the hallmarks and biggest strengths of the Internet, provides the perfect venue for state and non-state actors to undertake malicious operations without fearing attribution or retaliation. The Internet, as Lindsay points out, “was designed to make connections easy and reliable even when the true identity of the connector and the path of the connection were unknown; security did not figure strongly in its early design”. Lupovici, however, seems to disagree on the premise that cyberspace is an inherently anonymous domain. Even though he recognizes that some aspects of the Internet make harder to attribute an attack, he argues that anonymity is a socially attributed trait and, therefore, cyberspace could be structured in a way that does not uphold this characteristic. Along this line of thinking, McConnell suggests that the only solution for the attribution problem is redesigning the Internet so that attribution and geolocation are more feasible. Such a change, however, would be a massive undertaking and probably would not help to prevent the increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks that are being launched today. At the same time, reengineering the entire computer network would reduce its efficiency and dependability, and would bring into question characteristics of the current Internet, such as freedom of action and privacy, that are treasured by many, including intelligence agencies.\nSecond, cyber-attribution is further complicated by the fact that hackers have at their disposal a variety of programs, techniques and applications to conceal the identity of their own Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and thus to thwart detection. One common practice that attackers employ to hide their online trail is to break into poorly secured internet servers or even personal computers and use them as proxies through which they can launch a cyberattack.\n Lupovic 2016, 322; Supra note 25, at 387.\n Lindsay 2013, 375-76.\n Supra note 74, at 330. Lupovici further argues that the current assumption that anonymity is inherent to the cyber domain might affect states’ policies. “Defenders, discouraged from relying on cyber deterrence, may refuse to invest in efforts to establish it. This will decrease the efficiency of cyber deterrence and, as a result, reinforce the existing common knowledge that this strategy is doomed to fail”. (Supra note 104, at 331).\n McConnell 2010.\n Supra note 10, at 3. For instance, Rid argues that McConnell suggestion “is not only unrealistic, it would not even solve the problem at hand” (Rid 2013, 140-41). For Tran, “even if the Internet could arduously be redesigned to authenticate the source IP address of every bit of data sent over the Internet, these addresses would accomplish the goal of merely identifying the source machine of an attack, and not a person, thereby creating another degree of attenuation between an attack and the attacker” (Tran 2018, 390).\n Ibid.\n Greenemeier 2011.\n\"The IP address therefore does not present the attacked state with a physical location to blame or even attack in response. The discovered server could be located in a neutral, friendly or even your own country\". According to Lipson, \"an IP address is a poor surrogate on which to establish a basis for trustworthiness\". The cyberattacks that hit Estonia, for instance, originated from at least 177 countries, such as the United States, Russia, Peru, Egypt, and Estonian itself. As Brenner effectively observed, \"the Internet is one big masquerade ball. You can hide behind aliases, you can hide behind proxy servers, and you can surreptitiously enslave other computers without their owners' knowledge – and then use their computers to do your dirty work\". Another prime example of a technology available to obfuscate one's traces in cyberspace is the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) Marble Framework, which is capable of altering the language of the code from English to another foreign language, such as Chinese, Russian, Korean, Arabic and Farsi.\nIn this regard, Dinstein argues that future technological improvements will probably overcome the challenges that prevent cyber-attribution. Indeed, governments are more capable of attributing responsibility for cyberattacks than they were a decade ago, and these technological advancements and innovations have boosted states' confidence. For example, in 2014, Canada indicated to possess robust systems in place that allow the detection of highly sophisticated attacks, even those launched by state-sponsored actors and, in 2015, the United Kingdom's Chancellor affirmed that \"we are increasingly confident in our ability to determine from where attacks come\". It is important to bear in mind, however, that the technical realm is so \"dynamic\" that new technologies both enhance and hinder states' ability to attribute malicious attacks, generating \"a cycle of escalating offensive and defensive capabilities\".\nThird, even if it is possible to overcome all the technological issues mentioned above and identify the machine used to carry out a cyberoperation with sufficient certainty, cyber-\n Supra note 102.\n Lipson 2002, 56.\n Roscini 2010, 97; Supra note 28.\n Brenner 2011, 13.\n Mueller et al. 2019, 110; Leyden 2017.\n Dinstein 2002, 112. Similarly, Roscini argues that \"further developments in computer technology and Internet regulations might also make it easier to identify the source of the cyberattack\" (Roscini 2010, 97)\n Supra note 42, at 23\n Canada, Statement by the Chief Information Officer for the Government of Canada (July 29, 2014).\n United Kingdom, Chancellor's speech to GCHQ on cybersecurity (November 17, 2015).\n Supra note 33, 1510.\n The improvements in technical attribution might be matched over time by developments in attackers' abilities to conceal their identities, and this \"cat-and-mouse game\" will continue to cyber-attribution difficult. Supra note 93, at 9.\nattribution remains challenging due to what has been called the “human machine gap” or “entry-point anonymity”. That is to say, attribution can only be accomplished if the individual or organization who was operating the computing device can also be identified. With this in mind, it should be noted that rarely does the location of a computer provide precise conclusions vis-à-vis the machine operator’s identity. Therefore, knowing that a cyberattack was executed on the territory of a state, or from the governmental cyber framework of a state, is not enough to attribute said attack to that state.\nFourth, it may be quite difficult to determine the ultimately responsible entity as far as state responsibility is concerned. Even if it is possible to overcome all the technological challenges and identify the human attacker, there remains the question of whether or not there is a relationship between the individual pressing the keys and the state actor. Is the attacker an officially sanctioned government agent? Or is it a third party operating on their own? Deibert, Rohozinski, and Crete-Nishihata acknowledge that there is an increasing tendency towards privateering cyberattacks, and states are particularly interested in this market since it “allows them to execute their missions once removed and clandestinely, thus offering plausible deniability and avoiding responsibilities under international law or the laws of armed conflict”.\nMoving to the legal aspect of attribution, a state will only be held responsible for an internationally wrongful action that is attributable to the state under public international law or that constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the state. On this point, it is important to note that, traditionally, there has been an extremely high bar for establishing state responsibility for acts of non-state actors. Drawing from the International Law Commission’s (ILC) Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, a state can be held liable for the conduct of a non-state actor if the latter is “acting on the instruction of, or under the direction or control of” the state. Note that, sadly, the concepts of ‘instructions’,\n Geiß and Lahmann 2009, 625\n Supra note 111.\n Supra note 120.\n Supra note 55, at 646.\n Deibert, Rohozinski, and Crete-Nishihata 2012, 17.\n International Law Commission, Draft Articles of Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, November 2001, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), art. 2. It is important to note that the ILC’s rules are not a treaty and therefore they are not binding on any state. Yet, these rules were commended by the UN General Assembly in 2012 (UN Doc. A/RES/56/83) and have been mentioned 154 times by international courts, tribunals, and other bodies. (United Nations Legislative Series, Materials on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, 2012, ST/LEG/SER.B/25, viii).\n Supra note 31, at 204.\n Ibid., art. 8.\n'direct', and 'control' all need further explanation. According to the commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility, 'instruction' comprises private individuals or groups acting as an auxiliary of the state. More problematic issues, however, arise in determining the concepts of 'direction' and 'control', for the commentary falls short and does not explain the difference between both of them. Rather, it only says that the terms are \"disjunctive\". International tribunals have also failed to make a distinction between the three concepts with any level of detail. Therefore, as Schmitt put it, \"the prevailing approach tends towards a binary distinction in which either a state tells a non-state actor to perform an act (instruction or direction) or the state exercises 'effective control' over the non-state actor with respect to the act in question\".\nThe effective control test was coined by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in its Nicaragua v. United States of America judgement. Even though the Court does not provide a definition for the expression, it has asserted that a state's participation in the form of \"financing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping\" the non-state actor does not rise to the degree of effective control. In this sense, for example, supplying malware to a terrorist group would not result in state responsibility. In fact, even if the state plans the whole operation and selects the military targets, it still would not be enough to result in attribution. Furthermore, taking into considerations the technical challenges aforementioned, determining that a hacker was under the effective control of a nation-state at relevant time is probably impossible. For instance, the 2007 cyberattacks targeting Estonia were partially attributed to the pro-Kremlin youth group Nashi, but it is not clear whether Russia was involved in the incident.\nIn Prosecutor v. Tadic, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) lowered the threshold by adopting the much less restrictive overall control test, which\n Schmitt 2017b, 9.\n International Law Commission, Draft Article of Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with Commentaries, November 2001, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), art. 8, para. 2.\n Ibid., para. 7.\n Supra note 99.\n International Court of Justice, Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, 27 June 1986, para. 115.\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n Supra note 29, at 563.\n Supra note 9, at 23-24. On this topic, Schmitt and Vihul note that care should be taken when assuming state sponsorship of non-state cyberoperations because non-state actors can launch cyberattacks at a \"fairly low cost and without access to the technical wherewithal of states\" (Schmitt and Vihul 2014, 56).\n\nRegardless of whether effective control or overall control ultimately suits the cyber domain, the attribution bar continues to be extremely high. As a result, states are prevented from adopting any lawful response to a cyberattack, including their inherent right to self-defence, encouraging retaliatory operations outside the existing legal structure. Against this background, some scholars have suggested that one possible solution to these legal challenges is to lower the attribution standard. Schmitt, for instance, defended an indirect responsibility approach by which a state might be held responsible for the consequences of non-state actors’ unlawful operations on its territory “when it fails to take reasonably available measures to stop such acts in breach of its obligations to other states”. Lowering the attribution bar, however, increases the chances of misattribution and conflict escalation.\nFifth, another factor that contributes to the difficulty of attributing cyberattacks is the presence of dynamic and sophisticated non-state actors. Traditionally, states and non-state actors were distinguished by significant imbalances not only in legal status, but also in resources and capabilities. The cyber domain, however, seems to offer great opportunities for non-state actors to challenge and, in some situations, to overcome states’ hegemony. Indeed, today these entities need as much or more attention than other international player due to their ability to profoundly disturb international peace and security. Nevertheless, these actors “enjoy a relative degree of impunity” for the harmful effects of their actions since international law does not offer a tailored framework based on which non-state actors can be held responsible for unlawful acts. In this sense, an adequate legal response to the attribution problem should\n United Nations, International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, *Prosecutor v.

The investigation of cyberattacks is a complex process that requires detailed analysis of technical data, as well as a deep comprehension of political and economic motivations$^{147}$. Consequently, as Sheldon points out, “the forensics of attribution can rarely, if ever, give immediate results and can take days if not weeks to provide solid technical evidence”$^{148}$. Further, former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defence William Lynn III recognized the struggle to attribute cyberattacks, observing that “[t]he forensic work necessary to identify an attacker may take months, if identification is possible at all”$^{149}$. Cyber-attribution, however, is nearly useless if it takes too long and is not able to identify all the actors involved in the attack$^{150}$.\nThese are the numerous hurdles, both technological and legal, that have been oft-mentioned as a hindrance to the development of an effective legal framework for governing cyberattacks$^{151}$. In spite of the fact that previous literature on cybersecurity perceived the attribution problem as an insurmountable technical issue, recent scholars and experts have begun to acknowledge that actual attribution might not be rocket science after all$^{152}$. As Carlin aptly put it, “although attribution is difficult, it is far from impossible”$^{153}$.\n## 3.2 Why does cyber-attribution matter?\nConsidering the number of obstacles that significantly limit cyber-attribution, one is then left to question whether or not the matter is worth international society’s attention. What are the purposes of attributing blame for a cyberattack? Why should states and international stakeholders endeavour to solve the attribution problem?\n$^{146}$ Supra note 13, at 956.\n$^{147}$ Supra note 3, at 2.\n$^{148}$ Sheldon 2014, 289-90\n$^{149}$ Lynn III 2010, 99.\n$^{150}$ Carlin 2016, 409. The duration of the investigation is relevant for cyber-attribution because if a targeted state takes too long to respond, any countermeasures adopted may be seen as punishment, forbidden under public international law. On the other hand, if a targeted state engages in countermeasures too early and has wrongfully attributed the cyberattack, it will have committed an internationally wrongful act itself.\n$^{151}$ According to Shackelford, “the international law doctrine of attribution is in fact an essential ground for regulating cyberattacks” (Shackelford 2008, 233).\n$^{152}$ “Actual attribution of cyber events is already more nuanced, more common, and more political than the literature has acknowledged so far” (Supra note 62).\n$^{153}$ Supra note 119.\nTo start with, cyber-attribution function goes well beyond the mere identification of the responsible entity for a malicious cyberattack; it also serves as a legitimizing tool to justify both formal and informal sanctioning behaviour to other international actors. According to Article 22 of the ILC’s Draft Articles on State Responsibility, a state that has been the target of an internationally wrongful act may adopt countermeasures – actions that would otherwise be unlawful. In order to do so, the victim state must identify the state actor which is responsible for the internationally wrongful act. Eichensehr argues that “[s]uch an attribution could be done privately, but if so, the victim state would risk other states viewing its countermeasures as an initial wrongful act, rather than a lawful response”. Tran adds to the discussion by explaining that even in situations where formal law is not the answer, states would still be required to attribute responsibility in order to implement any informal method of sanctioning the attacker. Thus, attribution is a crucial and necessary prerequisite to any further legal action, be it countermeasures, diplomatic responses or any other informal kind of response. Consequently, it is not unreasonable to assume that solving the attribution problem is the pivotal first step to establish any functioning system of law that regulates cyberattacks.\nAdditionally, publicly attributing the blame for a cyberattack, and consequently sharing specific aspects of it, may help network defenders identify possible vulnerabilities in the system and, thus, prevent future attacks. It is often cited that, in some cases, attribution may also lead to macro-level deterrence. By identifying the culprits of a cyberattack, states are able to publicly name and shame them. Potentially, this practice will cause the named actor, and even third parties, to refrain from future operations. For instance, in 2014, the USA criminally charged five Chinese military hackers for cyberespionage against U.S. corporations and “[f]or a period of time following the indictments, there was a very significant decrease” in Chinese\n Supra note 25, 386.\n “The wrongfulness of an act of a State not in conformity with an international obligation towards another State is precluded if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State” (Supra note 96, art. 22).\n According to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, “countermeasures are actions or omissions by an injured State directed against a responsible State that would violate an obligation owed by the former to the latter” (Supra note 15, 111, rule 20 (1)). Note that countermeasures cannot be taken by non-state actors since they are reserved to states. Similarly, such measures cannot be taken against non-state actors, except when their (cyber) actions are attributable to a state actor. “This is because only states commit, as a matter of law, internationally wrongful acts” (Supra note 7, at 606). Also, Banks argues that countermeasures were created to compel a state to desist in its unlawful actions, not as punishment (Supra note 33, at 1502).\n Supra note 96, art. 49.\n Supra note 63, at 29.\n Supra note 25, at 383-84.\n Supra note 3, at 3.\n Supra note 63, at 25\ncyberactivity. Furthermore, publicly attributing responsibility for cyberattacks might create micro-level deterrence, which is related with the adoption of domestic legal procedures and economic sanctions. According to Goldsmith and Williams, the costs of these measures “are not nothing; would-be state-sponsored cyber-intruders and their principals surely take them into account”. Micro-level deterrence, therefore, could be more successful than its macro-level counterpart. According to Finnemore and Hollis, publicly attributing cyberattacks promote “interactions between the accuser, the accused, and third-party audiences that – over time – may result in the creation of a new norm”. Note, however, that public attribution alone may not be sufficient to deter malicious cyberactivity or produce cyber accountability, particularly if the responsible actor does not care if his/her identity and behaviour are made public.\nFrom an international relations perspective, states and international stakeholders should care about the attribution problem due to its capacity to deteriorate the international political environment. As noted earlier, attributing blame for a cyberattack is no easy task and thus the chances of a malicious cyber operation being framed wrongfully is extremely high. Indeed, misattribution is substantially more likely vis-à-vis cyberattacks than traditional kinetic warfare. With this in mind, one should be cognizant that there is a tendency to explain malicious cyber incidents in terms of geopolitical conditions and existing rivalries, particularly soon after a cyberattack when there is a haste to identify the culprits, to strengthen defences and to retaliate. The 2007 Estonian cyberattack provides one of the clearest examples of this tendency. Due to past Russian actions and the political atmosphere at the time, the attack was attributed to Russia and this explanation was later questioned by cyber experts. A yet more recently example is the 2015 Ukraine power grid cyberattack. Ukraine’s intelligence community was quick to blame Russia for the attack because it was perceived as an escalation of the conflict\n Nakashima 2015.\n To build upon the previous example, in addition to the criminal charges, the Chinese hackers cannot travel to the United States or other country with which it has extradition treaty; if they do, they could be extradited to the USA and face trial. Nor can they engage in financial transactions that touches the U.S. or other sanctioning state financial system.\n Goldsmith and Williams 2018.\n Nevertheless, Eichensehr explains that the effectiveness of micro-level deterrence might vary according to the nationality of the hackers (“losing the ability to travel or to store money in Western Europe may be less of a blow to North Korean hackers than to Russians”), and depends on the level of coercion to which the cyber-attackers are subject (“[i]f their actions on behalf of their government are not voluntary, then the hackers will not alter their behaviour in response”) (Supra note 63, at 27).\n Finnemore and Hollis 2019, 10-11.\n Supra note 29, at 556\n Supra note 13, at 960. Besides heightening the risk of misattribution, this tendency to blame the most obvious culprits prevents alternative explanations from being developed, as well as invites lesser rivals or non-state actors to provoke hostilities. Schulzke argues that “[a]s the risk of being caught diminishes, the costs of attack decrease and the potential benefits become even more attractive” (Supra note 13, at 961).\n\nIt is perhaps useful to underline that the most active participants in the cyber domain are also some of the world’s most powerful states, to wit: The United States, Russia and China. Taking into account that each of these states are equipped with a nuclear armoury, misattributing a cyberattacks could trigger off destructive conflicts with potential to threat the whole international system, putting a premium on a confident degree of cyber-attribution. On top of this, the relative availability and fairly low cost of the technology necessary to launch an attack in cyberspace “leaves the potential for mass destruction within the grasp of far less sophisticated non-state actors and organizations”. So, it does not take much imagination to see the potential threats an unregulated cyber domain pose to international security, economy and also to states’ infrastructure.\nIn this regard, inspired by great theorists such as Thomas Schelling, Robert Jervis, and John Herz, among others, Buchanan took the basic foundation of the security dilemma theory and employed it to cyberspace. A ‘cybersecurity dilemma’ is said to exist when one country cannot increase the security of its digital infrastructure, either through the creation of offensive cyber capabilities, without decreasing other’s cybersecurity. According to Buchanan, the cybersecurity dilemma can be potentially more dangerous and escalatory than traditional kinetic conflicts because, in cyber domain, there is a “perception of offense-dominance”, making defensive measures to be perceived as offensive and threatening. With this in mind, cyberspace appears to be the perfect environment for the security dilemma to thrive. The lack of clarity vis-à-vis the intentions and capabilities of cyber warfare, therefore, have the potential to undermine trust, rise escalation fears, provoke an arms race or even an international armed conflict. “As cyberoperations become more potent and computer networks grow still more important, the dilemma’s dangers – already real – will only grow”.\n Zetter 2016.\n Supra note 39, at 192.\n Supra note 107, at 55.\n Payne 2016, 684-85.\n Buchanan 2017, 108-09.\n Ibid., 191.\n Jinghua 2019.\n Ibid., 194.\nIt is well settled that cyberspace is a phenomenon of international relevance. As a result, the uses and abuses of this borderless virtual domain encroach on states concerns in the physical world, such as national security, economic development and public order and safety. Cybersecurity, like other global challenges faced by the existing international community, extends far beyond the domain of a single state and, therefore, cannot be appropriately addressed by any single international actor, regardless of how influential it might be. Given the increasing costs of insecurity and uncertainty associated with an unregulated cyberspace, international actors may soon come to realize the necessity of an international legal framework capable of addressing cyberattacks.\n\nIn spite of the fact that the principal building blocks of the World Wide Web were laid more than two decades ago, the community of states was not able to reach a broad international agreement on how to govern the cyber domain. In fact, some scholars even suggest that cyberspace seems “resistant to codification of the applicable rules in a comprehensive multilateral binding treaty”. Note, however, that the dearth of cyber-specific regulations is not for lack of trying by major international actors. Already in 1996, the French government pushed for the creation of the Charter for International Cooperation on the Internet, which would be “an accord comparable to the international law of the sea”. The proposal, however, was met with apathy by other international stakeholders.\nAfterwards, in January 2002, the UN General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to settle a group of governmental experts to conduct a study on “relevant international concepts aimed at strengthening the security of global information and telecommunications systems”. The United Nations’ Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications thus became the leading state-based initiative for the codification of international law vis-à-vis the cyber domain, but its success was limited. Between 2004 and 2015, the GGE submitted three reports which expressed the unanimous opinion of the state-participants.\nThe 2010 report was welcomed with great enthusiasm by the international community even though it brought an array of “very rudimentary findings and recommendations” and did not present much legal clarity. However, it highlighted that state actors are developing ICTs\n---\n Supra note 43.\n Wu 1997, 660.\n United Nations General Assembly, Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security, A/RES/56/19, 7 January 2002.\n Supra note 55, at 647. Another worthwhile example of a state-based initiative is the Code of Conduct for Information Security, put forward by China, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The proposal was submitted to the UN General Assembly twice, in 2011 and 2015, but it was not met with enthusiasm by the international community. Note that the 2015 proposal was also co-sponsored by Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.

More substantially, it recognized that “[i]nternational law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment”. The Group also claimed that the principles of sovereignty and state responsibility apply to cyberspace. Note that, in order to guarantee unanimity, a draft provision supporting the applicability of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) was excluded from the report. Even so, many states have publicly endorsed the application of the laws of armed conflict to the cyber domain. The USA, for instance, is of the view that “[l]ong-standing international norms guiding state behaviour – in times of peace and conflict – also apply in cyberspace”. Similarly, Japan stated that “existing international law, including the UN Charter and international humanitarian law, naturally applies to acts in cyberspace”.\nFinally, despite the absence of several important issues and the difficulty in reaching consensus, the 2015 report was considered a “breakthrough”. It explicitly mentioned the General Assembly resolutions on the right to privacy in the digital age and noted the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction, but it did not specifically affirm that IHL applies to activities in the cyber environment. The GGE further suggested that “[v]oluntary, non-binding norms of responsible State behaviour” may prevent conflict in cyberspace\n United Nations General Assembly, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunication in the Context of International Security, UN Doc.

On the other end of the spectrum, the USA, France and the United Kingdom share the position that, under public international law, there is no evidentiary requirement for making accusations. In this regard, U.S. State Department Legal Adviser Brian J. Egan stated that:\n[D]espite the suggestion by some States to the contrary, there is no international legal obligation to reveal evidence on which attribution is based prior to taking appropriate action. There may, of course, be political pressure to do so, and States may choose to reveal such evidence to convince other States to join them in condemnation, for example. But that is a policy choice – it is not compelled by international law.\nThis position was reiterated by the U.K. former Attorney General Jeremy Wright, who explained that “[t]here is no legal obligation requiring a state to publicly disclose the underlying information on which its decision to attribute hostile activity is based”. More recently, France echoed the same opinion.\nIn 2017, the GGE was supposed to submit another report to the UN General Assembly, but the experts failed to reach consensus due to disagreements over controversial areas of international law, such as the right of self-defence, countermeasures, and IHL. According to Herinksen, the collapse of the UN GGE initiative was “fairly predictable” because the debate vis-à-vis the regulation of cyberspace is “as much about strategy, politics and ideological\n Ibid., para. 10.\n Ibid., para. 28(f).\n Supra note 63, at 19.\n For instance, they formally presented a draft UN General Assembly resolution in 2018, asserting that “[s]tates should note that accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated”.

The Group held promise for the clarification of cyber-related customary international law, but it left the global community with an unresolved legal conundrum in which opinions appear to be diverging and solidifying instead of converging. Yet, the GGE reports were a welcomed first step for the discussion on international cyber norms and remain extremely relevant.\nOne encouraging conclusion is that, in spite of the lack of a specific legal framework, cyberspace is certainly not a lawless domain beyond the control of public international law. As it has been pointed out, it is well settled that general principles and rules of international law also apply to cyber operations. Indeed, if international law is to be an effective governance arrangement, it should be flexible to new situations without the necessity to recreate a whole set of rules on each occasion. The development of nuclear weapons is a prime example of this. When the UN Charter was being elaborated, its “framers could not be aware of the threat of nuclear weapons” and therefore the legal instrument did not include this type of armament in its provisions regarding the use of force. Yet, decades later, the ICJ provided an advisory opinion arguing that Articles 2(4) and 51 of the UN Charter, concerning the prohibition of the use of force and self-defence respectively, apply to “any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed”. By this logic, the body of international law that governs the use of force should apply to cyber activities, too. Despite these advances, however, many underlying questions remain virtually unanswered. Perhaps most importantly, how are international legal norms supposed to apply to the complex cyber domain?\n Ibid.\n Korzak 2017.\n Supra note 55, at 648.\n According to Henriksen, the 2013 UN GGE report “reflected an emerging consensus that cyberspace is subject to the same general principles of international law that governs the more physical domains” (Henriksen 2019, 3). The remaining question, therefore, is which international law?\n Supra note 42, at 9. On this point, the United States claims that “[t]he development of norms for state conduct in cyberspace does not require a reinvention of customary international law, nor does it render existing international norms obsolete” (United States of America, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World, May 2011, 9).\n International Court of Justice, Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict (Request for Advisory Opinion Submitted by the World Health Organization) and Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Request for Advisory Opinion Submitted by the General Assembly of the United Nations), CR 95/25, 1995, para. 46.\n International Court of Justice, Reports of Judgements, Advisory Opinions and Orders, Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, para. 39.\n “[T]he mere fact that a computer (rather than a more traditional weapon, weapon system, or platform) is used during an operation has no bearing on whether that operation amounts to a ‘use of force’”.

Given this gloomy picture, scholars, cyber-experts, and international stakeholders have been attempting to fill the normative void with their views on how international law applies to the cyber domain.

This subject, however, warrant a more extended discussion than I can here give it. In this sense, this study focuses on the two leading non-state-driven initiatives that epitomize the phenomenon described above: the Tallinn Manual Project and Microsoft’s proposals.\nThe first non-state initiative that tried to address cyberattacks and increase international cybersecurity was the Tallinn Project, which brought together an international group of independent experts led by Professor Michael Schmitt. The project published two editions of the Manual, respectively in 2013 and 2017, under the auspices of the NATO CCD COE. Their texts, however, must not be seen as representing the views of NATO or sponsoring nations. Rather, the Manuals should be understood as a reflexion of the views of the experts, all acting in their own private capacity. It should be noted that this project is neither an international treaty on cyber law nor does it set forth *lex ferenda*, but it is a restatement of international law as it is – *lex lata*.\nThe 2013 edition, entitled the *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, pays particular attention to cyber activities that occur above the level of use of force and encompasses purported rules of customary international law, the larger part of which related to the *jus ad bellum* (the law governing the use of force) and the *jus in bello* (the law\n Finnemore and Hollis 2016, 446; According to Finnemore and Sikkink, norm entrepreneurs are “agents having strong notions about appropriate or desirable behaviour in their community” (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998, 896-97). Henry Dunant, the founder of the International Committee of the Red Cross, is a prime example of norm entrepreneurship.\n For instance, Chernenko et al. recommend the creation of an “independent, international cyber court or arbitrage method that deals only with government-level cyber conflicts” (Chernenko et al. 2018). RAND’s *Stateless Attribution* report, on the other hand, suggests an international organization for cyber-attribution, the *Global Cyber Attribution Consortium*, which would involve “a broad team of international experts to conduct independent investigations of major cyber incidents for the purpose of attribution” and would operate “without standing state participation” (*Supra* note 3, at 27-31).\n *Supra* note 178.\n Ibid.\n Tallinn Manual, 23; Tallinn Manual 2.0, 2.\n Tallinn Manual, 19; Tallinn Manual 2.0, 3.\n Tallinn Manual, rules 10-19.\nof armed conflict). The Manual was considered to be a “remarkable achievement” and, according to Banks, provided “much-needed confidence for states that international law applies in the cyber domain”. Early reviews, nevertheless, criticized the project’s emphasis on cyber operations that amount to use of force since, in reality, the majority of, if not all, cyber activities fall below the use of force threshold. Another major criticism of the Tallinn Manual is the dearth of geographic diversity among the group of experts, all of whom hail from Western Europe, Australia, and the USA. Consequently, the impartiality of the project is challenged, hindering its acceptability and application by states outside the Global North. China, for instance, has been very critical of the whole Tallinn initiative since it seems to be a North American attempt to “maintain US dominance in the information age”. As noted by Eichensehr, the Manual is “channelling, even though not officially representing, a particular worldview with respect to the laws of armed conflict”.\nIn the 2013 Tallinn Manual, no effort was made to establish legal criteria for attributing blame for cyberattacks and attribution is addressed as a problem, instead of “a realistic task having technical, political and legal aspects”. Still, some provisions may shed light on the attribution problem. For example, Rule 5 asserts that “a state shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States”. Note that this provision restates in cyber terms the principle put forward in the ICJ’s Corfu Channel Judgement. The experts were able to reach consensus on the scope of application of Rule 5, but they could\n Tallinn Manual, rules 20-95.\n Ingber 2017, 1531.\n Supra note 33, at 1494.\n Supra note 42, at 16. On this topic, Xinmin explains that the majority of cyberattacks are perpetrated by non-state actors, which are generally seen as cybercrime or infringement of cyber rights that should be governed by domestic criminal law or the law of torts. Also, she points that “[e]ven if some of these attacks are conducted by states or may be attributable to states, most of them fall far below the threshold of ‘threat of use of force’ or ‘armed attack’. Instead, they are only cyber-attacks of minimal levels of intensity, which are comparable to other internationally wrongful acts such as interference with internal affairs of other states” (Xinmin 2016, 189-29).\n Supra note 152, at 4.\n Eichensehr 2014, 588.\n Fleck 2013, 338.\n Ibid., 334-35.\n It is important to point out that this rule has since been included in the 2015 UN GGE report: “[s]tates should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs” (Supra note 161, para. 13 (c)).\n “Such obligations are based [...] on certain general and well-recognized principles, namely: [...] every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”. International Court of Justice, The Corfu Channel Case, Merits, 9 April 1949, 22.\n “As to scope of application, this Rule covers all acts that are unlawful and that have detrimental effects on another state. (Tallinn Manual, Rule 5, para. 5, 33).\n\nOther noteworthy provision in the Manual is Rule 6, which affirms that “a State bears international legal responsibility for a cyber operation attributable to it and which constitutes a breach of an international obligation”. In this regard, the experts agreed that, in specific circumstances, the acts of non-state actors might be attributable to a state and therefore cause that state’s international legal responsibility$^{245}$. The non-state actor, however, must be either acting “on the instructions of” or “under the direction or control” of that state$^{246}$.\nIn 2017, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations was published, expanding considerably the scope of the project. Now, it also includes the analysis of the international legal framework that applies to malicious cyberattacks that do not meet the use of force threshold. Furthermore, the new Manual addresses peacetime legal regimes, such as state responsibility, human rights law, and the laws of space, air, and the sea. On the whole, the Tallinn 2.0 “reflects a careful effort to move international law forward in the challenging domain of cyberspace”$^{247}$. Mačák further echoes this idea by arguing that the expansion and revision of the document will probably “further strengthen the project’s overall relevance as well as its claim to authority”$^{248}$. Banks, on the other hand, explains that the Tallinn 2.0’s provisions and commentaries are “necessarily general in nature, sometimes ambiguous, and do not necessarily reflect settled international law”$^{249}$.\nRegarding cyber-attribution, in spite of the expectations surrounding its publication, the 2017 Tallinn Manual did not go any further than the previous edition in providing an effective legal solution to the attribution problem$^{250}$. Rather, the experts limited their analysis of cyber-attribution to the well-established Articles on State Responsibility, codified by the ILC$^{251}$. This body of law, as its name suggests, only offers prescriptive norms when there is a state nexus\n\nDespite criticism, the Tallinn initiative provides a comprehensive and attentive analysis of how the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* applies to the cyber environment, along with valuable commentaries on controversial issues that need to be further discussed. Even though the reliance on Western-centric approaches might handicap Tallinn’s acceptance in non-Western countries, such as China and the Russian Federation, the project still is an essential tool for scholars, international lawyers, policymakers, and international stakeholders.\nIn 2014, Microsoft Corporation published a white paper entitled *International Cybersecurity Norms: Reducing Conflict in an Internet-Dependent World*. It was the first thorough proposal to seek the definition of acceptable and unacceptable state conducts online, with the purpose of decreasing risks and bringing predictability and stability to the international scenario. In short, Microsoft proposed six cybersecurity norms to limit conflict and improve cyber defences. These norms are intended to “reduce the possibility that ICT products and services could be used, abused, or exploited by nation states as part of offensive operations”. Note that, like both editions of the Tallinn Manual, Microsoft’s white paper suggests guidelines of state conduct and is openly state-centric in its approach.\nThe project was widely criticized for emphasizing the role of states and thus overlooking the relevance of the private sector, in particular the global ICT industry, for the promotion of international cybersecurity. In response to these claims, Microsoft released another white paper, *From Articulation to Implementation: Enabling Progress on Cybersecurity Norms*, in which the Corporation outlines six further cybersecurity norms. This time, however, the norms were directed at ICT companies. For instance, the paper calls upon the ICT industry to “assist public sector efforts to identify, prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from events in\n Supra note 33, at 1495.\n Supra note 209, at 585.\n Note that Microsoft’s proposal was not the first time a private company put forward an initiative of this kind. Already in 1999, the CEO of AOL, Steve Case, strongly recommended states to “revis[e] outdated and ‘country-centric’ laws on telecommunications and taxes that could thwart the growth of the medium” and instead support “international standards – from security, to privacy, to taxation”. (Case, Steve, Remarks Prepared for Delivery (via satellite) Israel ‘99 Business Conference’, 13 December 1999, cited in Goldsmith and Wu 2006, 26)\n McKay 2014, 2.\n For the complete list of the proposed cybersecurity norms, see McKay 2014, 20.\n Ibid., 11.\n Supra note 42, at 17.\n Charney et al. 2016, 3.\n Ibid.\n\nNote that, while the rules brought by the Tallinn Manuals articulate purported customary international obligations that by themselves are binding on all states, except persistent objectors, the norms put forward by Microsoft’s proposals are only broad suggestions that do not create any right or legal obligation. In other words, Microsoft’s norms are “more aspirational than realistic” and require states to translate them into legally binding rules, which takes time and commitment. Despite this difference, both initiatives have in common the fact that they are non-state-driven, quasi-legal instruments which do not have any legally binding force. In other words, they are soft law rules. In fact, the Tallinn Manuals and Microsoft’s white papers could hardly amount to anything but a non-binding document since states still are “the legislators of the international legal system”. That said, one may call into question the importance of these initiatives for the development of international law. Is soft law an authentic law? Is soft law effective to produce norms despite its non-binding nature?\n\n## 4.2 The value of soft law\nAccording to Besson, international legal norms might have different levels of normativity, ranging from “being low (or soft) as with legal norms in the making to being imperative as with norms of *jus cogens*”. Certainly, the Tallinn Manual project and Microsoft’s papers have a lower degree of legal normativity than binding international rules. Indeed, as stated by the ILC on its study on the Identification of Customary International Law, the “conduct of other actors [than states] is not practice that contributes to the formation, or expression, of rules of customary international law”. This, however, does not imply that these initiatives are utterly irrelevant for the law-making process or even to the development of cyber law. Quite the opposite, considering the normative plurality in international law, non-state-driven initiatives of this kind might be valuable both in quantity and quality. For Thirlway, “soft law is a vital intermediate stage towards a more rigorously binding system, permitting experiment and rapid modification”.\nMoreover, even though these intermediary legal products are not “valid legal norms”, they might possess a certain evidentiary importance in the next stages of the development of rules of international law. Put differently, non-binding documents, such as UN resolutions, might evince the existence of both *opinio juris* and state practice which could later support the formation of customary norms. By this logic, hard and soft laws are not mutually exclusive and should be seen as “tools provided with a different degree of normativity along a *continuum*”. It also should be noted that soft law-making processes normally involve non-state actors and thus are more “multicultural and inclusive” than others.\n---\n By ‘normativity’, I mean “the law’s claim to authority, that is, its claim to provide its legal subjects with exclusionary albeit *prima facie* reasons for action through binding legal norms or in other words its claim to create obligations to obey the law that in principle preclude some countervailing reasons for action” (Besson, 2010, 173).\n Ibid., 174.\n *Supra note* 42, at 19.\n International Law Commission, *Draft Conclusions on Identification of Customary International Law*, with Commentaries, 2018, A/73/10, conclusion 4 (3), 130.\n *Supra note* 240, at 170.\n Thirlway 2019, 186-87.\n *Supra note* 240, at 170.\n Ibid. As pointed by the ILC, non-state practice “may be relevant” when assessing the practice of states (*Supra note* 243).\n Zerilli 2010, 11.\n *Supra note* 240, at 170-171. Regarding soft law, Joyner has interesting points that are worthwhile looking at. For instance, he notes that states are usually “more willing to be innovative when the adopted instrument is not legally binding” (Joyner 1998, 414).\nAccording to Article 38(1) of the Statute of the ICJ, scholarly works are a secondary source of public international law that informs the application of primary sources. Hence, it seems fair to conclude that the aforementioned initiatives are not only highly pertinent, but also “likely to prove especially influential”. Nevertheless, this situation is by no means ideal since states, and only states, hold the formal authority to create international law. As Judge Higgins aptly put it, “[s]tates are, at this moment of history, still at the heart of the international legal system”. However, it is important to bear in mind that the norms proposed by both the Tallinn Manual Project and Microsoft’s papers might “mature through codification into treaty law or crystallise into customary law”, so that they delineate the exact limits of activities in cyberspace.\nThis dynamic is certainly not without precedent. The Antarctic legal regime is the epitome of this. In the 1960s and 1970s, many non-legally binding norms were brought in with high hopes of conserving both living and non-living resources of Antarctica. Joyner argues that the adoption of these non-binding instruments laid the international legal foundation for the treaty that was yet to come. Ultimately, the majority of these norms were codified into the 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, a binding agreement that has been ratified by all major international actors, including the USA, China, and Russia.\nAnother prime example is the international nuclear safety regime. Even though proposals to establish a legally-binding international treaty were put forward since the 1960s, states were generally “disinclined to go beyond the recommendatory nature of the safety standards” issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This situation, however,\n “The Court, whose function is to decide in accordance with international law such disputes as are submitted to it, shall apply:\n(a) international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting states;\n(b) international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law;\n(c) the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations;\n(d) subject to the provisions of Article 59, judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicist of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law”. United Nations, Statute of the International Court of Justice, 18 April 1946, Article 38 (1).\n Schmitt and Vihul 2016, 47.\n Supra note 42, at 19.\n Higgins 1994, 39.\n Supra note 250.\n Joyner 1998, 420. In the 1960s, more than seventy recommended measures were adopted by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Party Meetings (ACTMs); and in 1970s, more than fifty were adopted.\n Ibid.\n Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, October 1991, United Nations Treaty Series, vol. 2941, A-5778.\n Nuclear Energy Agency and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Joint Report on International Law in the Post-Chernobyl Period, 2006, NEA No. 6146, 13.\nchanged rapidly after the Chernobyl accident, which exposed the costly transboundary consequences of unsafe nuclear activity. The 1986 disaster gave rise to an international legally-binding regime for the safe development of nuclear energy, which slowly transformed the safety standards and other relevant non-binding norms into hard law rules.\nOne must be aware, however, that the cyber domain differs in important ways from the Antarctic and the nuclear regimes. Perhaps the most notable difference is that, while the lawmaking process vis-à-vis cyberspace has been spearheaded by non-state-driven initiatives, the development of binding rules for international nuclear safety and the conservation of Antarctica had been led mainly by state actors. Yet, these two regimes are valuable examples that illustrate the codification of soft law norms. With this in mind, the current status of cyber international law should be seen as an early stage towards the codification or crystallisation of cyber hard law. The question that needs to be addressed, therefore, is whether states will finally rise to the challenge.\n Shull 2008, 4.\n To wit: Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, 1986, INFCIRC/335; Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency, 1986, INFCIRC/336; Convention on Nuclear Safety, 1994, INFCIRC/449; Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on The Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, 1997, INFCIRC/546.\n Supra note 42, at 21.\n Ibid.\n\nThe 2007 Estonian attacks, as well as other cyberattacks mentioned in this study, illustrate the severity of the threats facing states’ cybersecurity, and the equally important challenge of implementing a legal framework for attributing blame for cyber activities. Given the ever-growing reliance on ICTs and the increasing frequency, intensity, and complexity of cyberattacks, a solution for the attribution problem is crucial for both promoting a (relatively) stable world order and reducing the chances of conflict stemming from cyberoperations. Note, however, that this solution does not lie in the technical domains, as previously thought. Pragmatically, the most relevant hurdles for cyber deterrence nowadays are not poor technical capabilities since, from a technical standpoint, tools for attribution have matured significantly in recent years, increasing states’ confidence vis-à-vis assigning blame for malicious cyberattacks. Rather, the solution for this issue lies in the realm of international law and cooperation.\nAs transnational terrorism, migration crises, and other security challenges that plague the international community, the attribution problem cannot be appropriately tackled by any single international entity, regardless of how strong and influential that entity might be. Instead, these modern phenomena require a framework for active global collaboration. It is international law that “affords [such] a framework, a pattern, a fabric for international society”. Nevertheless, in the context of the computer network, it seems that international law fails to deliver. Even though states have agreed that public international law applies to cyberactivity, there is no broad multilateral agreement on how to govern cyberspace and, therefore, it is as yet uncertain how the international legal framework applies to this new, complex domain.\nThis difficulty in the application of traditional rules and principles of international law, in order to properly address cyber challenges, results from a number of reasons. Perhaps the most relevant of them is the attachment of this body of law to state-centric assumptions and foundations of the early formative stage of the international legal system. By placing state\n Supra note 3.\n Supra note 10, at 28.\n Supra note 33, at 1502.\n Supra note 43, at 137. By way of an example, the USA has declared that it has the ability to identify and hold their cyber opponents accountable (Fryer-Biggs 2012). Indeed, in the last few years, the U.S. government has attributed high-profile cyberattacks, such as the 2014 intrusion at Sony Pictures Entertainment and the 2016 DNC hack, respectively, to North Korean and Russia (Supra note 42, at 23-24).\n Supra note 42, at 2.\n Henkin 1978, 5.\n Moynihan 2019, 4.\n Supra note 2, at 375.\n Supra note 7, at 610-11.\nactors at the heart of its legal regimes, public international law requires in almost all situations a state link so as to determine either an international legal obligation or an internationally wrongful act. In an environment where non-state actors are as powerful, if not more so, than states, it seems fair to conclude that this legal system grounded in the traditional state-centric perspective of international law is not suitable or even adequate to address challenges posed by cyberspace and the rapid development of ICTs. In this sense, as long as states refuse to recognize the existence and the importance of other international players, any effort to govern cyberspace and to establish legal mechanisms for cyber-attribution will fall short.\nAs it stands now, international law not only fails in effectively dealing with the attribution problem, but also is unlikely to be instrumental in providing both predictability and stability to cyberspace in the short and medium-terms. Besides the lack of clarity of the law in this area, governments have been unwilling to clearly express their existing norms and practices in relation to the cyber domain, impeding the formation of customary international law and increasing unpredictability of state behaviour. Note that, in spite of the constructive contribution made by non-state initiatives, public international law is lagging far behind in many respects and thus continues to be underdeveloped vis-à-vis cyber-attribution.\nBefore proceeding, two points still need to be considered. First, by filling the void created by states’ reluctance to undertake the international law-making process, non-state-driven initiatives, especially the Tallinn Manuals and Microsoft’s proposals, have been providing much-needed clarity to some grey areas of international cyber law. These initiatives, however, are constrained by their state-centric approaches, non-binding character, and interpretative methods, which usually lack the necessary legal safety. Therefore, non-state initiatives represent a relevant but primitive point in the discussion about the application of international law to the cyber domain. They should be seen as a means to an end, not an end in itself.\n Ibid.\n According to Schmitt and Watts, the cyber domain and cyberactivity have bridged “a number of formerly significant gaps between states’ and non-state actors’ abilities to compromise international peace and security. in fact, some non-state actors now match, if not exceed, the cyber capabilities of many states in this respect” (Supra note 7, at 595).\n Supra note 33, at 1509.\n Supra note 42, at 1.\n Supra note 2, at 381. For instance, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 limited its analysis of cyber-attribution to the basic principles of State Responsibility, as codified by the ILC. However, as its name suggests, this body of law can only be applied when there is a state nexus.\n Supra note 33, at 1513.\n In this regard, Mačák points out that non-state initiatives might serve “as norm-making laboratories”, permitting states to identify and assess advantages and disadvantages of a number of proposals (Supra note 42, at 30-31).\n\nSecond, if states genuinely wish to address the problem of cyber-attribution, they can do so; they have the technological capabilities and all the necessary legal power. After all, states are still at the heart of the international legal framework and are the only ones to hold the formal authority to create international rules. This argument generates an obvious puzzle, however: why then do they not solve this conundrum? The answer to this question lies on the fact that some countries may benefit from the current state of affairs, characterized by uncertainties and the lack of express cyber norms. States that possess the most advanced cyber capabilities – such as the United States, Russia, China, and likely North Korea – may take advantage of the cyber domain in order to fulfil their national interests in the physical world. For instance, the USA has allegedly used an extremely sophisticated computer worm, called Stuxnet, to destroy numerous centrifuges in an Iranian nuclear facility, thwarting the prospects of Iran developing nuclear weapons and thus securing American geopolitical interests in the Middle East.\nBy this logic, if states believe that by acting in unregulated cyberspace their gains offset their losses, there will be no incentive for them to promote the regulation of this domain or to solve the attribution problem. This might help to explain why state actors have been so reluctant to engage in the cyber law-making process, as well as to express clear *opinio juris* with respect to cyberspace. Considering the ever-increasing costs of insecurity and uncertainty related to an ungoverned cyber domain, states may soon come to realize the necessity of an international legal framework capable of addressing cyberattacks. As Professor Koh aptly put it, “compliance with international law frees us to do more, and do more legitimately, in cyberspace, in a way that more fully promotes our national interests”. Therefore, one can only hope that\n Supra note 283.\n Supra note 42, at 19.\n Supra note 33, at 1511.\n It should be noted that the former U.S. Secretary of Defence Leon Panetta stated that the American government was “developing the plans that needed to be developed to ensure the United States would remain one of the strongest players in the cyber arena” (Stone 2019).\n Zetter 2014a.\n Note, however, that this process might already be in motion, as illustrated by the 2015 cyber agreement between the United States and China (Harold 2016; Supra note 42, at 27).\n Koh 2012, 10.\nstates do not wait for the occurrence of a “cyber 9/11” $^{316}$ or a “cyber Pearl Harbour” $^{317}$ to overcome their aversion to engaging in the development of international cyber law.\nIn the meantime, cyberspace will continue to be an environment that offers the perfect conditions for the security dilemma to thrive and in which the activities of both state and non-state actors can trigger off conflicts causing widespread harm to societies, the global economy, and the international security system. With this in mind, international stakeholders and policymakers should strive to increase transparency, so as to bridge the existing trust gaps inside the international community. Overall, greater transparency reduces misperceptions and conflict spirals and, consequently, leads to cooperation and better cybersecurity.\nIt is important to point out that, due to time constraints, this thesis was not able to assess the role played by the private sector in attributing blame for cyberattacks or to analyse non-Western approaches to the international rule of law in the cyber domain. Future researches, therefore, should attempt to explore these topics.\n\n45"

Even though determining the machines that launched a malicious cyber incident is no longer an arduous task for the most developed states, identifying the individuals, organizations, or governments that are legally responsible for the attack continues to be extremely difficult. This study argues that, as it stands now, international law not only fails in effectively dealing with the attribution problem, but also is unlikely to be instrumental in providing both predictability and stability to cyberspace in the short and medium-terms. As a result, the cyber domain will continue to be an environment that offers the perfect conditions for the security dilemma to thrive and in which incidents – whether intended or not – can trigger off conflicts causing widespread harm to the whole international security system.\nKeywords: cyber-attribution, attribution problem, cybersecurity, security dilemma, international security, Tallinn Manual, non-state initiatives.\n4\n# Table of Contents\nAbbreviations ... 5\nChapter 1 – Introduction ... 6\nChapter 2 – Realism and the Security Dilemma ... 14\n2.1 What is the security dilemma? ... 15\nChapter 3 – The Attribution Problem ... 18\n3.1 Why is attribution so difficult? ... 19\n3.2 Why does cyber-attribution matter? ... 24\nChapter 4 – International Law and Cybersecurity ... 29\n4.1 Leading non-state initiatives ... 34\n4.2 The value of soft law ... 39\nChapter 5 – Conclusion ... 42\nBibliography ... 46\nArticles, Reports and Books ... 46\nLegal Sources and Official Documents ... 53\nWebsites ... 56\n5\n# Abbreviations\nACTMs Antarctic Treaty Consultative Party Meetings\nCCD COE Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence\nCIA Central Intelligence Agency\nDDOS Distributed Denial of Service\nDNC Democratic National Committee\nDNI Director of National Intelligence\nGGE Group of Governmental Experts\nIAEA International Atomic Energy Agency\nICJ International Court of Justice\nICTs Information and Communication Technologies\nICTY International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia\nIHL International Humanitarian Law\nILC International Law Commission\nIP Internet Protocol\nNATO North Atlantic Treaty Organization\nUK United Kingdom\nUSA United States of America\nVCLT Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties\n# Chapter 1 – Introduction\nBy providing people across the globe with instant access to information, to communication, and to novel economic opportunities, cyberspace¹ and the rapid development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have essentially transformed not only the world economy, but also the way of life. Education, health, government, as well as sectors such as energy, communication, and transportation are inextricably linked to, if not dependent on, the cyber domain². As information technology becomes more widespread and integrated into our daily lives, the probability of compromise by malicious cyber activity increases³. According to the former Director of National Intelligence (DNI) of the United States, more than thirty countries are developing offensive cyber capabilities, which will rise the incidence of both standoff and remote operations⁴. To complicate matters further, these capabilities are progressively under criminal and other non-state actors’ control⁵. Therefore, cyberattacks⁶ that deeply affect international peace and the global economy are no longer “futuristic or far-fetched”, but rather the reality of cyberspace⁷.\n¹ “Cyberspace” is defined by the United States National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations as “a domain characterized by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructure” (United States Department of Defence (DoD), *The National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations*, December 2006,3). Therefore, cyberspace also includes all networked digital operations.\n² Pipyros et al. 2018, 371.\n³ Davis II et al. 2017, 1\n⁴ United States Senate 2017, 5.\n⁵ Owens, Dam, and Lin 2009, 27.\n⁶ By cyberattack, I refer to the definition applied by Oona Hathaway et al. as “any action taken to undermine the functions of a computer network for a political or national security purpose” (Hathaway et al. 2012, 826). This definition, however, differs from that used by the U.S. Cyber Command, which identifies cyberattacks as those “that cause physical damage to property or injury to persons.” (Ibid., 821 n.9). Hathaway et al.’s definition also differs from the one offered by the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, which describe cyberattack as “a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects” (Schmitt 2013, 92). It is important to bear in mind that both the Tallinn Manual and the Cyber Command definitions are under-inclusive, particularly considering the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack, which did not cause physical damage to property or persons, but involved the *domaine reservé* of the U.S., raising relevant national security concerns about democratic procedures and the violation of the prohibition of intervention. Hathaway et al.’s terminology, on the other hand, covers a broader set of cyberattacks, including attacks such as the DNC hack.\nIn addition, I use the term ‘cyberattack’ instead of ‘cyber warfare’ because the latter refers to a smaller subset of cyberattacks that “constitute armed attacks or that occur in the context of an ongoing armed conflict” (Hathaway et al. 2012, 821). By contrast, the term ‘cyberattack’ embraces a broad range of attacks, from cyber warfare to those attacks that fall short of armed conflict but still deserve some kind of sanction (Tran 2018, 380 n.13). Furthermore, Hathaway and her co-authors make a distinction between cyberattacks and cyberespionage; according to the they, “neither cyber-espionage nor cyber-exploitation constitutes a cyber-attack because these concepts do not involve altering computer networks in a way that affects their current or future ability to function” (Hathaway et al. 2012, 829).\n⁷ Schmitt and Watts 2016, 596.\nFollowing the relocation of a Soviet war memorial in 2007, Estonia was hit by a series of massive cyberattacks lasting three weeks⁸. Taking into consideration that the small Baltic country is one of the most wired societies in Europe⁹, the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks¹⁰ were particularly harmful, resulting in a temporary interruption of service on many government and commercial websites¹¹ and, thus, profoundly affecting the functioning of the country’s economy¹². Initially, the attacks were attributed to Russia due to the political atmosphere at the time, as well as past Russian actions. This explanation, however, was questioned by technical experts, and even NATO officials were disinclined to assign blame to the Russian government. Because of disagreements over the links between the attackers and Russia, what at first appeared to be a pretty obvious case of aggression became a gridlock. Although it is highly probable that the Russian state launched the cyberattack¹³, its involvement has never been proven. Yet, the attack continues to be an example of Russia’s cyber capabilities that following cyberattacks will be judged by¹⁴.\nIn hindsight, the Estonian attacks were “fairly mild and simple”, far less damaging than the cyberattacks that have followed¹⁵. Even so, they brought cyberspace to the forefront of international relations discussions, raising awareness among states about the severe risk posed by the growing dependence on ICTs, as well as the possibility of conflict in this new and unique environment. Indeed, during the last decade, the international community has witnessed and experienced a considerable number of problematic episodes in cyberspace – the cyber intrusion at Sony Pictures Entertainment¹⁶, the attack on France’s TV5Monde¹⁷, the Democratic National\n⁸ Traynor 2007.\n⁹ By 2007, 98% of Estonian territory was covered with Internet access, and mobile phone penetration was almost 100% (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010, 17).\n¹⁰ According to Clark and Landau, DDoS attack is a concerted malevolent effort in which a large number of machines from all over the Internet attack a site or a set of sites in order to disrupt service by overloading a server or a link (Clark and Landau 2011, 6).\n¹¹ Dinniss 2014, 38-39.\n¹² Supra note 8, at 25.\n¹³ Schulzke 2018, 960.\n¹⁴ Ibid. It is necessary to recognize that this situation poses a threat to international peace since, according to Gomez, the “adversary’s past behaviour may motivate a disproportionate response to pre-empt any further threats” (Gomez 2019, 1-2).\n¹⁵ Schmitt 2017, xxiii.\n¹⁶ On November 2014, Sony Pictures’ computers were broken into, and sensitive information from the film studio and unreleased movies were published online, disrupting the company business operations (Davis II et al. 2017, 42). Considering that Sony had produced the movie The Interview, which depicts the assassination of Kim Jong-Un, speculations about North Korean participation were raised (Egloff 2019, 10). Through a press statement, North Korea denied responsibility for the cyberattack, but praised the attackers for their actions. As of yet, no one was able to prove North Korean involvement and the evidence implicating it was considered “flimsy” (Zetter 2014b).\n¹⁷ In April 2015, the French-language television network had its computer infrastructure and social media accounts hacked. Initially, the group called Cyber Caliphate, an Islamic State affiliate, claimed responsibility for the\n7\nCommittee (DNC) hack¹⁸, to name a few. Almost each of them has illustrated the new international status that Lucas Kello calls “unpeace” – a “mid-spectrum rivalry lying below the physically destructive threshold of interstate violence, but whose harmful effects far surpass the tolerable level of peacetime competition”¹⁹.\nAgainst this background, at the 2016 Defence Ministerial Meeting, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) defence ministers officially recognized cyberspace as a new frontier of warfare²⁰, and that decision was endorsed at the 2016 Warsaw Summit²¹. Now, the Allies “recognize cyberspace as a domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea”²². Certainly, the change comes as a response to the increasing number of cyberattacks against both the organization and its member states. The threat posed by these attacks even prompted former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security to declare that cyberattacks “now exceed the risk of physical attacks” in terms of breadth and range of possible outcomes²³. And such attacks show no sign of decreasing, as the aforementioned examples demonstrate.\nAlthough the persistence of cyberattacks might be due, in part, to the relative availability and fairly low cost of the technology needed to mount an attack²⁴, it might also largely result from the difficulty in identifying its perpetrators and attributing blame²⁵. The structure of the Internet, which “was not designed with the goal of deterrence in mind”²⁶, provides the perfect setting for state and non-state actors to take part in malicious activity unafraid of attribution or retaliation²⁷. Worse still, aggressors are able to conceal themselves and the full effects of their operations by using technical mechanisms and/or relying on non-state proxies that they rent or compromise²⁸. For example, the cyberattacks that hit Estonia originated from at least 177\nattacks, but as the investigations began, it became clear that the jihadist group was just a cover-up (Corera 2016). The private company FireEye ultimately attributed the attack to Russian hackers.\n¹⁸ In 2015, in the middle of the presidential election, the DNC suffered a cyberattack, resulting in the exfiltration of files and emails, many of which were published by WikiLeaks. In 2016, the DNC publicly attributed the attack to two distinct Russian espionage groups, APT28 and APT29 (Egloff 2019, 13). Although it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to assess the full damage of the cyber intrusion, it is understood to have played a major role in the 58th U.S. presidential election (Davis II et al. 2017, 34).\n¹⁹ Allison 2018; Banks 2019, 191.\n²⁰ Barnes, 2016.\n²¹ Ablon et al. 2019, 1.\n²² NATO, Warsaw Summit Communiqué (July 2016), n.70.\n²³ Nielsen 2018.\n²⁴ Payne and Finlay 2017, 556; Boerbert 2010, 43.\n²⁵ Tran 2018, 381.\n²⁶ Supra note 10, at 1.\n²⁷ Supra note 24.\n²⁸ Carlin 2016, 409; Carr 2010, 139-40.\ncountries, including from within the Estonian territory²⁹. Evidence has been found that attackers also obscure their identities through the adoption of foreign languages and elements of malware previously associated with other actors³⁰, and they might even exploit existing animosities in order to mask their identity and thus hinder attribution efforts³¹. By way of one example, the escalating tension between Iran and the United States suggests that both countries would be unwilling to fully cooperate in the case of a cyberattack, making Iran the perfect cover-up for third-party states and non-state actors attempting to launch a cyberattack against the USA and vice versa. It is therefore understood that attributing cyberattacks is vastly time-consuming and an “inherently interdisciplinary”³² process, requiring great technical and non-technical expertise and input from a range of actors and sources³³. In this regard, taking into account the effort necessary for its fulfilment, cyber-attribution was considered to be “an art as much as a science”³⁴.\nThe Estonian attacks are a prime example of how challenging the attribution of cyberattacks can be; thirteen years have passed and one cannot affirm whether the attacks were officially sanctioned by the Russian government or whether they were perpetrated by rogue spies or even by independent nationalistic criminals³⁵. It is important to bear in mind that, in the cyber domain, attribution differs from punishment³⁶, and it is defined as “identifying the agent responsible for the action”³⁷. Since cyberattacks have proliferated and become commonplace, attribution has grown in relevance³⁸. As a result, states have been investing resources and political capital to develop accountable attribution mechanisms in order to deter potential cyberattackers.\nIn spite of the fact that determining the machines that launched a cyberattack is no longer an arduous task for the most developed countries, identifying the individuals, organizations, or governments that are legally responsible for the attack continues to be challenging³⁹. The attribution of cyberattacks presents unique legal challenges because states were not able to reach a broad international agreement on how to govern the cyber domain and the current\n²⁹ Payne and Finlay 2017, 560.\n³⁰ Supra note 12.\n³¹ Ibid; Payne and Finlay 2019, 203.\n³² Egloff and Wenger 2019, 3\n³³ Banks 2017, 1503.\n³⁴ Rid and Buchanan 2015, 7.\n³⁵ Supra note 12.\n³⁶ Lindsay 2015, 57.\n³⁷ Supra note 10.\n³⁸ Banks 2019, 191.\n³⁹ Supra note 38, at 192.\ninternational legal framework does little to control cyber operations⁴⁰. On this matter, Schmitt and Vihul believe that even if agreement were to be reached on a multilateral binding cyber treaty, it would probably be undermined by states’ individual reservations⁴¹. Similarly, according to Mačák, there seems to be a resistance to the codification of international rules applicable to cyberspace⁴².\nIn addition, as cyber operations usually happen in secrecy⁴³, customary international law is not able to develop understandings or recognize state practice about attributing responsibility for cyberattacks⁴⁴. Further complicating the issue, governments have been unwilling to clearly express *opinio juris* on topics associated with the cyber domain⁴⁵. This attitude might be the result of a domestic political deadlock, a calculated waiting strategy⁴⁶, or even the product of the “cybersecurity knowledge gap”⁴⁷. Nevertheless, this state reticence contributes to the enduring ambiguity of international cyber law⁴⁸. It is also important to point out that no international organization, agency, or entity has the legal authority to attribute responsibility for a cyberattack. Due to this institutional legal vacuum, seldom do governments make official attribution claims, and, in the rare occasion that they do, their statements are normally perceived\n⁴⁰ Supra note 25, at 384.\n⁴¹ Schmitt and Vihul 2016, 39. As codified in Article 2(d) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), reservation is “a unilateral statement, however phrased or named, made by a State, when signing, ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to a treaty, whereby it purports to exclude or to modify the legal effect of certain provisions of the treaty in their application to that State” (United Nations, *Vienna Convention on the law of treaties*, 23 May 1969, vol. 1155,1-18232, art. 2(d)).\nIt is perhaps useful to point out that some scholars have indicated that a successful agreement might be almost impossible to achieve, at least in the near future. For instance, Waxman believes that “not only do certain features of cyber-activities make international legal regulation very difficult, but major actors also have divergent strategic interests that will pull their preferred doctrinal interpretations and aspirations in different directions, impeding formations of a stable international consensus” (Waxman 2011, 425-26). On this point, Goldsmith argues that “the fundamental clash of interests concerning the regulation of electronic communications, the deep constrains the United States would have to adopt to receive reciprocal benefits in a cybersecurity treaty, and the debilitating verification problems will combine to make it unfeasible to create a cybersecurity treaty that purports to constrain governments”. (Goldsmith 2011, 12).\n⁴² Mačák 2017, 5.\n⁴³ Mačák 2016, 130. About the high classified nature of state practice in cyberspace, Clarke and Knake state that “the entire phenomenon of cyber war is shrouded in such government secrecy that it makes the Cold War look like a time of openness and transparency” (Clarke and Knake 2010, xi). Also, Efrony and Shany try to explain the absence of transparency in cyberspace; for them, states believe that transparency may reveal “their vulnerabilities, adversely affect their offensive or defensive capabilities, and weaken their power of deterrence” (Efrony and Shany 2018, 631).\n⁴⁴ Supra note 38, at 194.\n⁴⁵ Among the notable exceptions, the USA stands out with its International Strategy for Cyberspace (United States, The White House, *International Strategy for Cyberspace: Property, Security, and Openness in a Networked World*, May 2011).\n⁴⁶ Schmitt and Watts 2015, 211.\n⁴⁷ Singer and Friedman 2014, 4-8.\n⁴⁸ Supra note 43, at 130.\n10\nto be entirely political and shrouded in secrecy, which can raise questions about the veracity of the facts⁴⁹. The attribution problem⁵⁰, therefore, is critical because attribution is a, if not the, key prerequisite to any lawful response under public international law, including self-defence⁵¹. This creates a dangerous practical gap that both precludes state responsibility⁵² and encourages attackers by allowing them to strike with impunity⁵³. Indeed, without an operative legal regime, the cyber domain “is not so far from the lawless lacuna some hoped it would become”⁵⁴.\nAgainst this backdrop, scholars, cyber-experts, and international stakeholders have been attempting to bridge the gap with their views on how international law applies to cyberspace. These non-state-driven initiatives are trying to promote a safe international system and reduce the chances of conflict arising from cyberattacks by filling the void created by states’ reluctance to undertake the international law-making process⁵⁵. The most important and comprehensive of these attempts certainly is the Tallinn Manual project, which is under the auspices of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE). This project, however, is neither an international treaty on cyber law nor does it offer a new set of international rules nor represent the position of any country or organization⁵⁶. Rather, it is a restatement of international law as it is (lex lata)⁵⁷, establishing a comprehensive legal structure for the governance of cyber operations during both times of peace and conflict. Considering the Tallinn project’s non-state and non-binding nature, one is then left to question its actual relevance to public international law, which still is very much attached to state-centric assumptions and foundations of the early formative stage of the international legal regime.\nOn this basis, my main argument lies heavily on the idea that the current international legal framework is underdeveloped vis-à-vis cyber-attribution, as its norms and principles were designed to the physical world and still, at present, mainly govern the relationship between states. Cyberspace, on the other end of the spectrum, is predominantly inhabited by non-state\n⁴⁹ Supra note 2, at 19. It is interesting to highlight that attributing cyberattacks to states is a new phenomenon (Eichensehr 2019b ,7-8). For instance, the first official public accusation by the USA only came in 2014, when five Chinese military hackers were criminally charged for cyberespionage against U.S. corporations (The United States, Department of Justice, May 19 2014).\n⁵⁰ By attribution problem, I refer to the difficulty in discovering the identity or location of the responsible for a cyberattack or their intermediary.\n⁵¹ Supra note 25, at 384; Supra note 31, at 205.\n⁵² Supra note 32, at 1495.\n⁵³ Supra note 31, at 205.\n⁵⁴ Chircop 2018, 653.\n⁵⁵ Supra note 42, at 1.\n⁵⁶ Despite NATO’s sponsorship, the Tallinn Manuals do not reflect the official position of the Alliance.\n⁵⁷ Supra note 32, at 1494.\nactors⁵⁸ and, as Libicki aptly put it, is divided between the physical, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic layers⁵⁹. As it stands now, international law fails in coping with contemporary challenges posed by cyberspace and the rapid development of ICTs, notably the attribution of cyberattacks. As will be developed below, this practical gap not only hinders the cyber-attribution process, but also threatens international security on an equivalent scale to traditional armed attacks⁶⁰.\nAlthough literature on cybersecurity normally perceives the attribution problem as a technical issue, due to the significant technological advancements experienced in the last decade, attribution is already “more nuanced, more common, and more political”⁶¹ than it is acknowledged. It is therefore understood that the solution to this dangerous situation lies within the legal and political domains, not in the technical realm⁶². Non-state initiatives have been trying to overcome this legal quagmire, but the international legal system still is inherently attached to a state-centric approach. Therefore, no set of international binding rules as far as cybersecurity is concerned will ever likely be achieved without the participation of states.\nConsidering that so many aspects of our lives are now bound up with cyberspace, the discussion about cyber-attribution is not only pertinent but also urgent. Such a delicate situation deserves to be taken most seriously and it would be unduly ambitious to try to provide a full answer in this study. My purpose, however, is to make a modest attempt at shedding some light on the issue. Ideally, this may contribute to a constructive debate about the problem of attributing blame for cyberattacks.\nThe following research question was articulated in order to function as the backbone of the work here presented: to what extent is international law underdeveloped vis-à-vis cyber-attribution? Also, as a means to enlighten the path of this study, the following sub-questions were established: why does cyber-attribution matter? What are the legal and political challenges imposed by the attribution problem? How the difficulty in attributing blame of a cyberattack affects international security?\nIn order to carry out the aforementioned study, a qualitative research of a doctrinal nature will be applied. Mainly, this will be a legal work based on primary and secondary legal sources. Parallel to the legal background, this study will also endeavour to apply the International Relations’ concept of security dilemma to cyberspace. By bringing this concept to the\n⁵⁸ Supra note 42, at 14.\n⁵⁹ Libicki 2007, 236-37.\n⁶⁰ Supra note 54, at 652.\n⁶¹ Supra note 33, at 6.\n⁶² Eichensehr 2019b, 2.\n12\nstudy, I hope to achieve a better understanding of how the unconventional characteristics of the cyber domain can lead to misperceptions, fear, and conflict spirals. To that end, Chapter 2 provides a brief overview of the security dilemma concept, presenting its main characteristics. Chapter 3 reviews the problem of attribution, discussing its most oft-cited causes and explaining why this issue deserves attention from the international community. Also, it assesses how the difficulty in attributing blame for a cyberattack affects international security as a whole. Subsequently, Chapter 4 approaches the research question through the analysis of current international law, discussing grey areas, as well as international rules that are applicable to cyberspace. Moreover, it reviews leading non-state initiatives that have been contributing to the development of the international legal framework in the challenging domain of cyberspace, especially Microsoft's proposals and the Tallinn Manual project. In addition, Chapter 4 examines the value of soft law norms for the international legal framework, and briefly discuss the Antarctic and nuclear safety regimes as examples of the codification of nom-binding norms. Finally, Chapter 5 concludes by reflecting on the main ideas discussed throughout this study and opening the path for additional insights and hopefully avenues for further research.\n13\n# Chapter 2 – Realism and the Security Dilemma\nIn international relations theory, Realism, also known as political realism, is one of the dominants schools of thought⁶³. Realists depict an anarchical, competitive and conflictual world, in which insecurity among states is inescapable⁶⁴. Note that ‘anarchical’ is used here in a technical sense, indicating the dearth of an overarching, political authority at the international level. Under anarchy, states are the main actors in the international arena and their primary responsibility is to secure their own interests, especially their survival⁶⁵. In order to do so, according to the realist theory, states will attempt to acquire power and engage in power-balancing⁶⁶, creating what Hoffman called “a state of war”⁶⁷.\nThe interstate political order is, therefore, a self-help system plagued by “uncertainty, weapons and fear”⁶⁸, and in which power plays the leading role in shaping the relation between states⁶⁹. As long as we accept the basic premises of the realist theory, this hostile and insecure environment not only leaves little room for international cooperation⁷⁰, but also encourages “behaviour that leaves all concerned worse off than they could be, even in the extreme case in\n⁶³ This study will not differentiate Realism into its various strands since this warrant a more extended discussion that I can here give it. It is perhaps useful to point out, however, that realism is normally contrasted with liberalism or idealism, which tend to focus on international cooperation. Compared to these theories, the realist perspective is undeniably pessimistic. As Keohane put it, realism is “the language of power and interests rather than of ideals or norms” (Keohane 1986, 9).\n⁶⁴ Wheeler and Booth 2007, 2.\n⁶⁵ Waltz 1979, 91. Waltz points out that, “internationally, the environment of states’ actions, or the structure of their system, is set by the fact that some states prefer survival over other ends obtainable in the short run and act with relative efficiency to achieve that end” (Waltz, 1979, 93). On this topic, Jervis identifies throughout his book, entitled *Perception and Misperception in International Politics*, some states that did not have survival as their primary goal. For instance, During Hitler’s government, Germany valued territorial expansion over security (Jervis 2017).\n⁶⁶ According to Andersen, balance of power is “a mechanism that ideally would make states intentionally or unintentionally join the weaker part against the strong, to equal out or balance the distribution of power amongst states in the international system” and states “would do this to assure their own survival” (Andersen 2018, 1).\n⁶⁷ Hoffmann defines ‘state of war’ as “a competition of units in the kind of state of nature that knows no restrains other than those which the changing necessities of the game and the shallow convenience of the players impose” (Hoffmann 1965, vii).\n⁶⁸ *Supra note* 65.\n⁶⁹ Korab-Karpowicz 2017. It is important to note that Wendt argues, through the lenses of Constructivism, that “self-help and power politics are institutions, and not essential features of anarchy. Anarchy is what states make of it” (Wendt 1992, 395).\n⁷⁰ Waltz points out two reasons why international cooperation is limited by anarchy: insecurity and unequal gains. In an anarchic international system, states are not certain about each other’s intentions and they fear that cooperation might favour one state in detriment of the others, creating some kind of dependence. He argues that “[s]tates do not willingly place themselves in situations of increased dependence. In a self-help system, considerations of security subordinate economic gain to political interest” (*Supra note* 66, at 107).\n14\nwhich all states would like to freeze the status quo”⁷¹. To put it differently, the uncertainties inherent in an anarchic world cause states to feel insecure, leading to counterproductive policies and suboptimal results, such as security dilemmas, crises, or even wars⁷². As Schweller explained, “insecurity and the use of force are enduring attributes of the self-help international system”⁷³.\n## 2.1 What is the security dilemma?\nAccording to Wheeler and Booth, the security dilemma is the quintessential dilemma in interstate politics⁷⁴. Coined by Herz (1950) and Butterfield (1951), the term has since become an integral part of any discourse on international security and has been expanded and employed to “address many of the most important questions of international relations theory and security policy”⁷⁵. Both authors describe the security dilemma as a situation where the increase of a state’s security simultaneously (and unintentionally) decreases the security of other states⁷⁶. The risk here is that misperceptions and conflict spirals dramatically increase the chances of unnecessary or avoidable armed conflicts.\nFor instance, a state might attempt to increase its own security and avert aggression by acquiring more weapons, bringing them to a higher state of readiness, or creating alliances. Under anarchy, an adversarial state will get the wrong impression about this behaviour, interpreting it as a preparatory action for future attacks. This state will thus fell threatened and will take action to enhance its own security. The first state will have confirmed its suspicions about its adversary’s belligerence, increasing tension and leading to an arms race or even war. In this scenario, conflict is not the product of the actual intentions and military capabilities of a specific actor. Rather, it is the result of mutual misperceptions and miscommunications that arise from the inability of states to understand each other’s intentions and motives with complete\n⁷¹ Jervis 1978, 167.\n⁷² Carlsnaes et al. 2002, 372; Montgomery 2006, 183.\n⁷³ Schweller 1996, 116. Note that, according to Mearsheimer, “the best way for a state to survive in anarchy is to take advantage of other states and gain power at their expenses” (Mearsheimer 2001, 36).\n⁷⁴ Supra note 65, at 29.\n⁷⁵ Glaser 1997, 172.\n⁷⁶ Jervis describes the security dilemma as a situation where “many of the means by which a state tries to increase its security decreases the security of others” (Supra note 71, at 169-70). Likewise, Glaser explains that the security dilemma exists when a “state’s effort to increase its security would have the unintended effect of reducing its adversary’s security” (Glaser 2010, 56). Montgomery, on the other hand, sees the security dilemma as primarily an issue of perception; he describes it as “the situation where one state’s attempt to increase its security appear threatening to others and provoke an unnecessary conflict” (Montgomery 2006, 151).\nconfidence⁷⁷. In this sense, as Herz points out, “it is one of the tragic implications of the security dilemma that mutual fear of what initially may never have existed may subsequently bring about what is feared the most”⁷⁸. Note that this is a “fertile version” of the philosophical problem of Other Minds, that is, “how one mind can ever know what is in the mind of another”⁷⁹.\nThe difficulty in correctly perceiving other’s intentions is related to the fact that many of the methods by which a state attempts to enhance its security will certainly make other states feel less secure. Jervis notes that, at the domestic level, individuals can attempt to increase their safety in several ways without jeopardizing others; one can, for instance, put bars on the windows, move to a safer area, and avoid dark streets⁸⁰. At the international level, however, “one state’s gain in security often inadvertently threatens others”⁸¹. The Cold War is a prime example of this. Both the United States’ and the Soviet Union’s efforts to increase their security had the unintended consequence of decreasing the security of the other superpower⁸², leading to a spiral in which they accumulate more military capabilities without making themselves more secure⁸³.\nOn top of this, there is what Wheeler and Booth described as the “inherent ambiguity of weapons”⁸⁴. Since most weapons can be used for both defensive and offensive purposes, it is incredibly difficult for decision-makers to foresee with certainty when and how arms may be used by other states. On this topic, Jervis asserts that “[u]nless the requirement for offense and defence differ in kind or amount, a status quo power will desire a military posture that resembles that of an aggressor. For this reason, others cannot infer from its military forces and preparations whether the state is aggressive”⁸⁵. Armament, therefore, is the material reality that initiates the security dilemma⁸⁶.\n⁷⁷ Gunitskiy 2011, 595; Supra note 65, at 4. Mearsheimer argues that governments can never be sure of the intentions of other states and that “intentions are impossible to divine with 100 percent certainty”. He also highlights that “intentions can change quickly, so a state’s intentions can be benign one day and hostile the next. Uncertainty about intentions is unavoidable, which means that states can never be sure that other states do not have offensive intentions to go along with their offensive capabilities” (Supra note 74, 2001, at 31).\n⁷⁸ Herz 1959, 241.\n⁷⁹ Hollis and Smith 1990, 171-172.\n⁸⁰ Supra note 71, at 169-70.\n⁸¹ Ibid.\n⁸² Jervis 2017, xiii-xiv.\n⁸³ Tang 2009, 594. On this topic, Libicki explains that “[d]uring the Cold War, when deterrence was the only feasible response to threat posed by the other side’s nuclear weapons, any attempt to build more weapons of bring them to a higher state of readiness [...] would alarm the other side who would feel impelled to do likewise” (Libicki 2016, 129).\n⁸⁴ Supra note 65, at 4.\n⁸⁵ Supra note 83, at 64. Therefore, even benign, security-seeking actors can be dragged into an arms race.\n⁸⁶ Supra note 65, at 1.\n16\nBefore proceeding, a few points still need to be considered and further clarified vis-à-vis the security dilemma concept. First, arms race is the most distinct expression of the vicious circle of the dilemma, but it is not the only one. For instance, the competition among imperialist powers for colonies in the late nineteenth and at the beginning of the twentieth centuries is considered to have been fuelled by a security dilemma⁸⁷. Second, the security dilemma will never be real, it will always be apparent⁸⁸. The dilemma can only exist if both states have benign motives; if, however, one state (or even both of them) has malign intentions, thus the situation cannot be described as a security dilemma, but as a security problem⁸⁹. As Schweller aptly put it, “[i]f states are arming for something other than security; that is, if aggressors do in fact exist, then it is no longer a security dilemma”⁹⁰. Finally, according to Wheeler and Booth, the security dilemma can be mitigated via the development of international institutions and legal regimes⁹¹. Insecurity, however, cannot be completely eliminated.\nCertainly, Herz’s and Butterfield’s original formulations of the security dilemma were an interesting development from the realist school of thought⁹². In its classical form, however, the concept may be of limited use in analysing the modern international system, which has a well-establish legal framework regulating the use of force, and in which most states are no longer threatened whether by war or external aggression⁹³. But this does not mean that the security dilemma is irrelevant or even obsolete for international security studies. On the contrary, it remains an extremely important tool for both policymakers and scholars since it can and has been reconceptualized to address modern challenges, including cyber-security ones.\n⁸⁷ Supra note 83, at 66.\n⁸⁸ Supra note 74, at 117.\n⁸⁹ Supra note 75, at 31. “If the threat posed by one state to another [...] is accurately perceived [...] then the situation cannot be classified as a security ‘dilemma’. It is simply a security ‘problem’, albeit perhaps a difficult one”.\n⁹⁰ Supra note 74, at 117. This argument generates an obvious puzzle, however: how can one know if threats are real or just apparent?\n⁹¹ Supra note 65.\n⁹² Note that realism is hardly the only school of thought to use the concept. The security dilemma has been broadly employed by liberals (see Doyle 1983; Oneal and Russett 1999; Cederman 2001), neoliberals (see Axelrod and Keohane 1985), constructivists (see Wendt 1995), to name a few.\n⁹³ Bluth 2011, 1375.\n# Chapter 3 – The Attribution Problem\nOne threshold issue in discussing cyber-attribution involves the definition of attribution itself, a question that certainly pervades all literature about this topic. At the most general level, ‘attribution’ refers to the identification of the responsible entity for a malicious cyberattack⁹⁴. What is understood by ‘responsible entity’, however, can vary. There are usually three types of answers: the specific computing device used to carry out an attack, the individual pressing the keys that launch an attack, and ultimately the party that supervised and controlled the attack⁹⁵. According to Lin, even though “these three types of attribution are conceptually distinct, they are often related in practice”⁹⁶. Particularly, identifying the machine from which an attack was launched might provide some clues that can assist unveil the human attacker’s identity, which in turn can help determine the individual or entity responsible for authorizing or acquiescing the cyber operation. Still, each of these types offer different challenges, increasing the difficulty of the attribution process.\nAlthough attributing cyberattacks is not a new challenge⁹⁷, the attribution debate is developing “surprisingly slowly”⁹⁸. Scholars and experts have been dwelling upon the subject and hold a full spectrum of views on it. At the positive end of the spectrum are those, like Rid and Buchanan, who argue that cyber-attribution is not only possible, but “it has been happening successfully for a long time”⁹⁹. Lindsay strikes a more restrained yet positive note, by characterizing attribution as difficult, but acknowledging that there are strong systems for identifying the source of intrusions and responding to attacks, with an increasingly amount of investments being devoted to investigations¹⁰⁰. At the other end of the spectrum, Singer and Friedman characterize attribution as “[p]erhaps the most difficult problem” in cyberspace¹⁰¹, and Eun and Aßmann argue that “determining the real aggressor is impossible unless the aggressor admits to it”¹⁰². Shackelford further echoes this idea by affirming that sophisticated cyberattacks are “nearly impossible to trace to their sources”¹⁰³.\n---\n⁹⁴ Ibid., 5.\n⁹⁵ Lin 2016, 5.\n⁹⁶ Ibid., 13.\n⁹⁷ Supra note 12, at 955.\n⁹⁸ Supra note 33, at 5.\n⁹⁹ Ibid., 31.\n¹⁰⁰ Supra note 36.\n¹⁰¹ Supra note 48, at 73.\n¹⁰² Eun and Aßmann 2016, 355.\n¹⁰³ Shackelford 2010, 200. Brecher share the same idea that cyberattacks “can be nearly impossible to attribute definitively to their sources” (Brecher 2012, 423).\n3.1 Why is attribution so difficult?\nThere are a number of answers to this question. First, many academics and experts suggest that the difficulty in attributing blame for cyberattacks is mainly due to the intrinsic characteristics of the cyber domain¹⁰⁴. The structural anonymity, which has been one of the hallmarks and biggest strengths of the Internet, provides the perfect venue for state and non-state actors to undertake malicious operations without fearing attribution or retaliation. The Internet, as Lindsay points out, “was designed to make connections easy and reliable even when the true identity of the connector and the path of the connection were unknown; security did not figure strongly in its early design”¹⁰⁵. Lupovici, however, seems to disagree on the premise that cyberspace is an inherently anonymous domain. Even though he recognizes that some aspects of the Internet make harder to attribute an attack, he argues that anonymity is a socially attributed trait and, therefore, cyberspace could be structured in a way that does not uphold this characteristic¹⁰⁶. Along this line of thinking, McConnell suggests that the only solution for the attribution problem is redesigning the Internet so that attribution and geolocation are more feasible¹⁰⁷. Such a change, however, would be a massive undertaking and probably would not help to prevent the increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks that are being launched today¹⁰⁸. At the same time, reengineering the entire computer network would reduce its efficiency and dependability, and would bring into question characteristics of the current Internet, such as freedom of action and privacy, that are treasured by many, including intelligence agencies¹⁰⁹.\nSecond, cyber-attribution is further complicated by the fact that hackers have at their disposal a variety of programs, techniques and applications to conceal the identity of their own Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and thus to thwart detection. One common practice that attackers employ to hide their online trail is to break into poorly secured internet servers or even personal computers and use them as proxies through which they can launch a cyberattack¹¹⁰.\n¹⁰⁴ Lupovic 2016, 322; Supra note 25, at 387.\n¹⁰⁵ Lindsay 2013, 375-76.\n¹⁰⁶ Supra note 74, at 330. Lupovici further argues that the current assumption that anonymity is inherent to the cyber domain might affect states’ policies. “Defenders, discouraged from relying on cyber deterrence, may refuse to invest in efforts to establish it. This will decrease the efficiency of cyber deterrence and, as a result, reinforce the existing common knowledge that this strategy is doomed to fail”. (Supra note 104, at 331).\n¹⁰⁷ McConnell 2010.\n¹⁰⁸ Supra note 10, at 3. For instance, Rid argues that McConnell suggestion “is not only unrealistic, it would not even solve the problem at hand” (Rid 2013, 140-41). For Tran, “even if the Internet could arduously be redesigned to authenticate the source IP address of every bit of data sent over the Internet, these addresses would accomplish the goal of merely identifying the source machine of an attack, and not a person, thereby creating another degree of attenuation between an attack and the attacker” (Tran 2018, 390).\n¹⁰⁹ Ibid.\n¹¹⁰ Greenemeier 2011.\n\"The IP address therefore does not present the attacked state with a physical location to blame or even attack in response. The discovered server could be located in a neutral, friendly or even your own country\"¹¹¹. According to Lipson, \"an IP address is a poor surrogate on which to establish a basis for trustworthiness\"¹¹². The cyberattacks that hit Estonia, for instance, originated from at least 177 countries, such as the United States, Russia, Peru, Egypt, and Estonian itself¹¹³. As Brenner effectively observed, \"the Internet is one big masquerade ball. You can hide behind aliases, you can hide behind proxy servers, and you can surreptitiously enslave other computers without their owners' knowledge – and then use their computers to do your dirty work\"¹¹⁴. Another prime example of a technology available to obfuscate one's traces in cyberspace is the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) Marble Framework, which is capable of altering the language of the code from English to another foreign language, such as Chinese, Russian, Korean, Arabic and Farsi¹¹⁵.\nIn this regard, Dinstein argues that future technological improvements will probably overcome the challenges that prevent cyber-attribution¹¹⁶. Indeed, governments are more capable of attributing responsibility for cyberattacks than they were a decade ago, and these technological advancements and innovations have boosted states' confidence¹¹⁷. For example, in 2014, Canada indicated to possess robust systems in place that allow the detection of highly sophisticated attacks, even those launched by state-sponsored actors¹¹⁸ and, in 2015, the United Kingdom's Chancellor affirmed that \"we are increasingly confident in our ability to determine from where attacks come\"¹¹⁹. It is important to bear in mind, however, that the technical realm is so \"dynamic\" that new technologies both enhance and hinder states' ability to attribute malicious attacks¹²⁰, generating \"a cycle of escalating offensive and defensive capabilities\"¹²¹.\nThird, even if it is possible to overcome all the technological issues mentioned above and identify the machine used to carry out a cyberoperation with sufficient certainty, cyber-\n¹¹¹ Supra note 102.\n¹¹² Lipson 2002, 56.\n¹¹³ Roscini 2010, 97; Supra note 28.\n¹¹⁴ Brenner 2011, 13.\n¹¹⁵ Mueller et al. 2019, 110; Leyden 2017.\n¹¹⁶ Dinstein 2002, 112. Similarly, Roscini argues that \"further developments in computer technology and Internet regulations might also make it easier to identify the source of the cyberattack\" (Roscini 2010, 97)\n¹¹⁷ Supra note 42, at 23\n¹¹⁸ Canada, Statement by the Chief Information Officer for the Government of Canada (July 29, 2014).\n¹¹⁹ United Kingdom, Chancellor's speech to GCHQ on cybersecurity (November 17, 2015).\n¹²⁰ Supra note 33, 1510.\n¹²¹ The improvements in technical attribution might be matched over time by developments in attackers' abilities to conceal their identities, and this \"cat-and-mouse game\" will continue to cyber-attribution difficult. Supra note 93, at 9.\nattribution remains challenging due to what has been called the “human machine gap”¹²² or “entry-point anonymity”¹²³. That is to say, attribution can only be accomplished if the individual or organization who was operating the computing device can also be identified. With this in mind, it should be noted that rarely does the location of a computer provide precise conclusions vis-à-vis the machine operator’s identity¹²⁴. Therefore, knowing that a cyberattack was executed on the territory of a state, or from the governmental cyber framework of a state, is not enough to attribute said attack to that state¹²⁵.\nFourth, it may be quite difficult to determine the ultimately responsible entity as far as state responsibility is concerned. Even if it is possible to overcome all the technological challenges and identify the human attacker, there remains the question of whether or not there is a relationship between the individual pressing the keys and the state actor. Is the attacker an officially sanctioned government agent? Or is it a third party operating on their own? Deibert, Rohozinski, and Crete-Nishihata acknowledge that there is an increasing tendency towards privateering cyberattacks, and states are particularly interested in this market since it “allows them to execute their missions once removed and clandestinely, thus offering plausible deniability and avoiding responsibilities under international law or the laws of armed conflict”¹²⁶.\nMoving to the legal aspect of attribution, a state will only be held responsible for an internationally wrongful action that is attributable to the state under public international law or that constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the state¹²⁷. On this point, it is important to note that, traditionally, there has been an extremely high bar for establishing state responsibility for acts of non-state actors¹²⁸. Drawing from the International Law Commission’s (ILC) Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, a state can be held liable for the conduct of a non-state actor if the latter is “acting on the instruction of, or under the direction or control of” the state¹²⁹. Note that, sadly, the concepts of ‘instructions’,\n¹²² Geiß and Lahmann 2009, 625\n¹²³ Supra note 111.\n¹²⁴ Supra note 120.\n¹²⁵ Supra note 55, at 646.\n¹²⁶ Deibert, Rohozinski, and Crete-Nishihata 2012, 17.\n¹²⁷ International Law Commission, Draft Articles of Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, November 2001, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), art. 2. It is important to note that the ILC’s rules are not a treaty and therefore they are not binding on any state. Yet, these rules were commended by the UN General Assembly in 2012 (UN Doc. A/RES/56/83) and have been mentioned 154 times by international courts, tribunals, and other bodies. (United Nations Legislative Series, Materials on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, 2012, ST/LEG/SER.B/25, viii).\n¹²⁸ Supra note 31, at 204.\n¹²⁹ Ibid., art. 8.\n'direct', and 'control' all need further explanation¹³⁰. According to the commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility, 'instruction' comprises private individuals or groups acting as an auxiliary of the state¹³¹. More problematic issues, however, arise in determining the concepts of 'direction' and 'control', for the commentary falls short and does not explain the difference between both of them. Rather, it only says that the terms are \"disjunctive\"¹³². International tribunals have also failed to make a distinction between the three concepts with any level of detail. Therefore, as Schmitt put it, \"the prevailing approach tends towards a binary distinction in which either a state tells a non-state actor to perform an act (instruction or direction) or the state exercises 'effective control' over the non-state actor with respect to the act in question\"¹³³.\nThe effective control test was coined by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in its Nicaragua v. United States of America judgement¹³⁴. Even though the Court does not provide a definition for the expression, it has asserted that a state's participation in the form of \"financing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping\" the non-state actor does not rise to the degree of effective control¹³⁵. In this sense, for example, supplying malware to a terrorist group would not result in state responsibility. In fact, even if the state plans the whole operation and selects the military targets, it still would not be enough to result in attribution¹³⁶. Furthermore, taking into considerations the technical challenges aforementioned, determining that a hacker was under the effective control of a nation-state at relevant time is probably impossible¹³⁷. For instance, the 2007 cyberattacks targeting Estonia were partially attributed to the pro-Kremlin youth group Nashi, but it is not clear whether Russia was involved in the incident¹³⁸.\nIn Prosecutor v. Tadic, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) lowered the threshold by adopting the much less restrictive overall control test, which\n¹³⁰ Schmitt 2017b, 9.\n¹³¹ International Law Commission, Draft Article of Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with Commentaries, November 2001, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), art. 8, para. 2.\n¹³² Ibid., para. 7.\n¹³³ Supra note 99.\n¹³⁴ International Court of Justice, Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

On this topic, Schmitt and Vihul note that care should be taken when assuming state sponsorship of non-state cyberoperations because non-state actors can launch cyberattacks at a \"fairly low cost and without access to the technical wherewithal of states\" (Schmitt and Vihul 2014, 56).\n22\napplies to an “organized and hierarchically structured group”¹³⁹. In light of the latter, the overall control test seems inappropriate for cyberspace, where the activity is more decentralized and rarely follows a hierarchical form. According to the ICJ in *Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Servia and Montenegro*, the “overall control test is unsuitable, for it stretches too far, almost to breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State’s organs and its international responsibility”¹⁴⁰. One then is left to question the legal validity of this test.\nRegardless of whether effective control or overall control ultimately suits the cyber domain, the attribution bar continues to be extremely high. As a result, states are prevented from adopting any lawful response to a cyberattack, including their inherent right to self-defence, encouraging retaliatory operations outside the existing legal structure¹⁴¹. Against this background, some scholars have suggested that one possible solution to these legal challenges is to lower the attribution standard. Schmitt, for instance, defended an indirect responsibility approach by which a state might be held responsible for the consequences of non-state actors’ unlawful operations on its territory “when it fails to take reasonably available measures to stop such acts in breach of its obligations to other states”¹⁴². Lowering the attribution bar, however, increases the chances of misattribution and conflict escalation.\nFifth, another factor that contributes to the difficulty of attributing cyberattacks is the presence of dynamic and sophisticated non-state actors. Traditionally, states and non-state actors were distinguished by significant imbalances not only in legal status, but also in resources and capabilities. The cyber domain, however, seems to offer great opportunities for non-state actors to challenge and, in some situations, to overcome states’ hegemony¹⁴³. Indeed, today these entities need as much or more attention than other international player due to their ability to profoundly disturb international peace and security. Nevertheless, these actors “enjoy a relative degree of impunity” for the harmful effects of their actions¹⁴⁴ since international law does not offer a tailored framework based on which non-state actors can be held responsible for unlawful acts¹⁴⁵. In this sense, an adequate legal response to the attribution problem should\n¹³⁹ United Nations, International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, *Prosecutor v.

The investigation of cyberattacks is a complex process that requires detailed analysis of technical data, as well as a deep comprehension of political and economic motivations$^{147}$. Consequently, as Sheldon points out, “the forensics of attribution can rarely, if ever, give immediate results and can take days if not weeks to provide solid technical evidence”$^{148}$. Further, former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defence William Lynn III recognized the struggle to attribute cyberattacks, observing that “[t]he forensic work necessary to identify an attacker may take months, if identification is possible at all”$^{149}$. Cyber-attribution, however, is nearly useless if it takes too long and is not able to identify all the actors involved in the attack$^{150}$.\nThese are the numerous hurdles, both technological and legal, that have been oft-mentioned as a hindrance to the development of an effective legal framework for governing cyberattacks$^{151}$. In spite of the fact that previous literature on cybersecurity perceived the attribution problem as an insurmountable technical issue, recent scholars and experts have begun to acknowledge that actual attribution might not be rocket science after all$^{152}$. As Carlin aptly put it, “although attribution is difficult, it is far from impossible”$^{153}$.\n## 3.2 Why does cyber-attribution matter?\nConsidering the number of obstacles that significantly limit cyber-attribution, one is then left to question whether or not the matter is worth international society’s attention. What are the purposes of attributing blame for a cyberattack? Why should states and international stakeholders endeavour to solve the attribution problem?\n$^{146}$ Supra note 13, at 956.\n$^{147}$ Supra note 3, at 2.\n$^{148}$ Sheldon 2014, 289-90\n$^{149}$ Lynn III 2010, 99.\n$^{150}$ Carlin 2016, 409. The duration of the investigation is relevant for cyber-attribution because if a targeted state takes too long to respond, any countermeasures adopted may be seen as punishment, forbidden under public international law. On the other hand, if a targeted state engages in countermeasures too early and has wrongfully attributed the cyberattack, it will have committed an internationally wrongful act itself.\n$^{151}$ According to Shackelford, “the international law doctrine of attribution is in fact an essential ground for regulating cyberattacks” (Shackelford 2008, 233).\n$^{152}$ “Actual attribution of cyber events is already more nuanced, more common, and more political than the literature has acknowledged so far” (Supra note 62).\n$^{153}$ Supra note 119.\nTo start with, cyber-attribution function goes well beyond the mere identification of the responsible entity for a malicious cyberattack; it also serves as a legitimizing tool to justify both formal and informal sanctioning behaviour to other international actors¹⁵⁴. According to Article 22 of the ILC’s Draft Articles on State Responsibility, a state that has been the target of an internationally wrongful act may adopt countermeasures¹⁵⁵ – actions that would otherwise be unlawful¹⁵⁶. In order to do so, the victim state must identify the state actor which is responsible for the internationally wrongful act¹⁵⁷. Eichensehr argues that “[s]uch an attribution could be done privately, but if so, the victim state would risk other states viewing its countermeasures as an initial wrongful act, rather than a lawful response”¹⁵⁸. Tran adds to the discussion by explaining that even in situations where formal law is not the answer, states would still be required to attribute responsibility in order to implement any informal method of sanctioning the attacker¹⁵⁹. Thus, attribution is a crucial and necessary prerequisite to any further legal action, be it countermeasures, diplomatic responses or any other informal kind of response. Consequently, it is not unreasonable to assume that solving the attribution problem is the pivotal first step to establish any functioning system of law that regulates cyberattacks.\nAdditionally, publicly attributing the blame for a cyberattack, and consequently sharing specific aspects of it, may help network defenders identify possible vulnerabilities in the system and, thus, prevent future attacks¹⁶⁰. It is often cited that, in some cases, attribution may also lead to macro-level deterrence. By identifying the culprits of a cyberattack, states are able to publicly name and shame them. Potentially, this practice will cause the named actor, and even third parties, to refrain from future operations¹⁶¹. For instance, in 2014, the USA criminally charged five Chinese military hackers for cyberespionage against U.S. corporations and “[f]or a period of time following the indictments, there was a very significant decrease” in Chinese\n¹⁵⁴ Supra note 25, 386.\n¹⁵⁵ “The wrongfulness of an act of a State not in conformity with an international obligation towards another State is precluded if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State” (Supra note 96, art. 22).\n¹⁵⁶ According to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, “countermeasures are actions or omissions by an injured State directed against a responsible State that would violate an obligation owed by the former to the latter” (Supra note 15, 111, rule 20 (1)). Note that countermeasures cannot be taken by non-state actors since they are reserved to states. Similarly, such measures cannot be taken against non-state actors, except when their (cyber) actions are attributable to a state actor. “This is because only states commit, as a matter of law, internationally wrongful acts” (Supra note 7, at 606). Also, Banks argues that countermeasures were created to compel a state to desist in its unlawful actions, not as punishment (Supra note 33, at 1502).\n¹⁵⁷ Supra note 96, art. 49.\n¹⁵⁸ Supra note 63, at 29.\n¹⁵⁹ Supra note 25, at 383-84.\n¹⁶⁰ Supra note 3, at 3.\n¹⁶¹ Supra note 63, at 25\ncyberactivity¹⁶². Furthermore, publicly attributing responsibility for cyberattacks might create micro-level deterrence, which is related with the adoption of domestic legal procedures and economic sanctions¹⁶³. According to Goldsmith and Williams, the costs of these measures “are not nothing; would-be state-sponsored cyber-intruders and their principals surely take them into account”¹⁶⁴. Micro-level deterrence, therefore, could be more successful than its macro-level counterpart¹⁶⁵. According to Finnemore and Hollis, publicly attributing cyberattacks promote “interactions between the accuser, the accused, and third-party audiences that – over time – may result in the creation of a new norm”¹⁶⁶. Note, however, that public attribution alone may not be sufficient to deter malicious cyberactivity or produce cyber accountability, particularly if the responsible actor does not care if his/her identity and behaviour are made public.\nFrom an international relations perspective, states and international stakeholders should care about the attribution problem due to its capacity to deteriorate the international political environment. As noted earlier, attributing blame for a cyberattack is no easy task and thus the chances of a malicious cyber operation being framed wrongfully is extremely high. Indeed, misattribution is substantially more likely vis-à-vis cyberattacks than traditional kinetic warfare¹⁶⁷. With this in mind, one should be cognizant that there is a tendency to explain malicious cyber incidents in terms of geopolitical conditions and existing rivalries¹⁶⁸, particularly soon after a cyberattack when there is a haste to identify the culprits, to strengthen defences and to retaliate. The 2007 Estonian cyberattack provides one of the clearest examples of this tendency. Due to past Russian actions and the political atmosphere at the time, the attack was attributed to Russia and this explanation was later questioned by cyber experts. A yet more recently example is the 2015 Ukraine power grid cyberattack. Ukraine’s intelligence community was quick to blame Russia for the attack because it was perceived as an escalation of the conflict\n¹⁶² Nakashima 2015.\n¹⁶³ To build upon the previous example, in addition to the criminal charges, the Chinese hackers cannot travel to the United States or other country with which it has extradition treaty; if they do, they could be extradited to the USA and face trial. Nor can they engage in financial transactions that touches the U.S. or other sanctioning state financial system.\n¹⁶⁴ Goldsmith and Williams 2018.\n¹⁶⁵ Nevertheless, Eichensehr explains that the effectiveness of micro-level deterrence might vary according to the nationality of the hackers (“losing the ability to travel or to store money in Western Europe may be less of a blow to North Korean hackers than to Russians”), and depends on the level of coercion to which the cyber-attackers are subject (“[i]f their actions on behalf of their government are not voluntary, then the hackers will not alter their behaviour in response”) (Supra note 63, at 27).\n¹⁶⁶ Finnemore and Hollis 2019, 10-11.\n¹⁶⁷ Supra note 29, at 556\n¹⁶⁸ Supra note 13, at 960. Besides heightening the risk of misattribution, this tendency to blame the most obvious culprits prevents alternative explanations from being developed, as well as invites lesser rivals or non-state actors to provoke hostilities. Schulzke argues that “[a]s the risk of being caught diminishes, the costs of attack decrease and the potential benefits become even more attractive” (Supra note 13, at 961).\n26\nbetween both countries¹⁶⁹. However, no proof was ever offered to support this allegation and it is believed that the power grid system had been compromised before the hostilities. Had Ukraine adopted any retaliatory measures, the tension would have heightened and the conflict could have spilt out of the cyber domain and into the physical world.\nIt is perhaps useful to underline that the most active participants in the cyber domain are also some of the world’s most powerful states, to wit: The United States, Russia and China. Taking into account that each of these states are equipped with a nuclear armoury, misattributing a cyberattacks could trigger off destructive conflicts with potential to threat the whole international system, putting a premium on a confident degree of cyber-attribution¹⁷⁰. On top of this, the relative availability and fairly low cost of the technology necessary to launch an attack¹⁷¹ in cyberspace “leaves the potential for mass destruction within the grasp of far less sophisticated non-state actors and organizations”¹⁷². So, it does not take much imagination to see the potential threats an unregulated cyber domain pose to international security, economy and also to states’ infrastructure.\nIn this regard, inspired by great theorists such as Thomas Schelling, Robert Jervis, and John Herz, among others, Buchanan took the basic foundation of the security dilemma theory and employed it to cyberspace. A ‘cybersecurity dilemma’ is said to exist when one country cannot increase the security of its digital infrastructure, either through the creation of offensive cyber capabilities, without decreasing other’s cybersecurity. According to Buchanan, the cybersecurity dilemma can be potentially more dangerous and escalatory than traditional kinetic conflicts because, in cyber domain, there is a “perception of offense-dominance”¹⁷³, making defensive measures to be perceived as offensive and threatening. With this in mind, cyberspace appears to be the perfect environment for the security dilemma to thrive. The lack of clarity vis-à-vis the intentions and capabilities of cyber warfare, therefore, have the potential to undermine trust¹⁷⁴, rise escalation fears, provoke an arms race or even an international armed conflict¹⁷⁵. “As cyberoperations become more potent and computer networks grow still more important, the dilemma’s dangers – already real – will only grow”¹⁷⁶.\n¹⁶⁹ Zetter 2016.\n¹⁷⁰ Supra note 39, at 192.\n¹⁷¹ Supra note 107, at 55.\n¹⁷² Payne 2016, 684-85.\n¹⁷³ Buchanan 2017, 108-09.\n¹⁷⁴ Ibid., 191.\n¹⁷⁵ Jinghua 2019.\n¹⁷⁶ Ibid., 194.\nIt is well settled that cyberspace is a phenomenon of international relevance. As a result, the uses and abuses of this borderless virtual domain encroach on states concerns in the physical world, such as national security, economic development and public order and safety. Cybersecurity, like other global challenges faced by the existing international community, extends far beyond the domain of a single state and, therefore, cannot be appropriately addressed by any single international actor, regardless of how influential it might be. Given the increasing costs of insecurity and uncertainty associated with an unregulated cyberspace, international actors may soon come to realize the necessity of an international legal framework capable of addressing cyberattacks.\n28\n# Chapter 4 – International Law and Cybersecurity\nIn spite of the fact that the principal building blocks of the World Wide Web were laid more than two decades ago, the community of states was not able to reach a broad international agreement on how to govern the cyber domain. In fact, some scholars even suggest that cyberspace seems “resistant to codification of the applicable rules in a comprehensive multilateral binding treaty”¹⁷⁷. Note, however, that the dearth of cyber-specific regulations is not for lack of trying by major international actors. Already in 1996, the French government pushed for the creation of the Charter for International Cooperation on the Internet, which would be “an accord comparable to the international law of the sea”¹⁷⁸. The proposal, however, was met with apathy by other international stakeholders.\nAfterwards, in January 2002, the UN General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to settle a group of governmental experts to conduct a study on “relevant international concepts aimed at strengthening the security of global information and telecommunications systems”¹⁷⁹. The United Nations’ Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications thus became the leading state-based initiative for the codification of international law vis-à-vis the cyber domain¹⁸⁰, but its success was limited. Between 2004 and 2015, the GGE submitted three reports which expressed the unanimous opinion of the state-participants¹⁸¹.\nThe 2010 report was welcomed with great enthusiasm by the international community even though it brought an array of “very rudimentary findings and recommendations”¹⁸² and did not present much legal clarity. However, it highlighted that state actors are developing ICTs\n---\n¹⁷⁷ Supra note 43.\n¹⁷⁸ Wu 1997, 660.\n¹⁷⁹ United Nations General Assembly, Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security, A/RES/56/19, 7 January 2002.\n¹⁸⁰ Supra note 55, at 647. Another worthwhile example of a state-based initiative is the Code of Conduct for Information Security, put forward by China, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The proposal was submitted to the UN General Assembly twice, in 2011 and 2015, but it was not met with enthusiasm by the international community. Note that the 2015 proposal was also co-sponsored by Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.

More substantially, it recognized that “[i]nternational law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment”¹⁸⁵. The Group also claimed that the principles of sovereignty and state responsibility apply to cyberspace¹⁸⁶. Note that, in order to guarantee unanimity, a draft provision supporting the applicability of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) was excluded from the report¹⁸⁷. Even so, many states have publicly endorsed the application of the laws of armed conflict to the cyber domain. The USA, for instance, is of the view that “[l]ong-standing international norms guiding state behaviour – in times of peace and conflict – also apply in cyberspace”¹⁸⁸. Similarly, Japan stated that “existing international law, including the UN Charter and international humanitarian law, naturally applies to acts in cyberspace”¹⁸⁹.\nFinally, despite the absence of several important issues and the difficulty in reaching consensus, the 2015 report was considered a “breakthrough”¹⁹⁰. It explicitly mentioned the General Assembly resolutions on the right to privacy in the digital age¹⁹¹ and noted the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction¹⁹², but it did not specifically affirm that IHL applies to activities in the cyber environment. The GGE further suggested that “[v]oluntary, non-binding norms of responsible State behaviour” may prevent conflict in cyberspace\n¹⁸³ United Nations General Assembly, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunication in the Context of International Security, UN Doc.

A final point to consider is that the Group claimed that “accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated”¹⁹⁴. A problem, however, is that at no time the report clarified what kind of or how much evidence would be necessary to ‘substantiate’ an accusation¹⁹⁵.\nIt is perhaps useful to point out that, since the 2015 report, the Russian Federation and China, along with several other states, have continued to advocate for the view that accusations ought to be substantiated¹⁹⁶. On the other end of the spectrum, the USA, France and the United Kingdom share the position that, under public international law, there is no evidentiary requirement for making accusations. In this regard, U.S. State Department Legal Adviser Brian J. Egan stated that:\n[D]espite the suggestion by some States to the contrary, there is no international legal obligation to reveal evidence on which attribution is based prior to taking appropriate action. There may, of course, be political pressure to do so, and States may choose to reveal such evidence to convince other States to join them in condemnation, for example. But that is a policy choice – it is not compelled by international law¹⁹⁷.\nThis position was reiterated by the U.K. former Attorney General Jeremy Wright, who explained that “[t]here is no legal obligation requiring a state to publicly disclose the underlying information on which its decision to attribute hostile activity is based”¹⁹⁸. More recently, France echoed the same opinion¹⁹⁹.\nIn 2017, the GGE was supposed to submit another report to the UN General Assembly, but the experts failed to reach consensus due to disagreements over controversial areas of international law, such as the right of self-defence, countermeasures, and IHL. According to Herinksen, the collapse of the UN GGE initiative was “fairly predictable”²⁰⁰ because the debate vis-à-vis the regulation of cyberspace is “as much about strategy, politics and ideological\n¹⁹³ Ibid., para. 10.\n¹⁹⁴ Ibid., para. 28(f).\n¹⁹⁵ Supra note 63, at 19.\n¹⁹⁶ For instance, they formally presented a draft UN General Assembly resolution in 2018, asserting that “[s]tates should note that accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated”.

The Group held promise for the clarification of cyber-related customary international law, but it left the global community with an unresolved legal conundrum in which opinions appear to be diverging and solidifying instead of converging²⁰². Yet, the GGE reports were a welcomed first step for the discussion on international cyber norms and remain extremely relevant²⁰³.\nOne encouraging conclusion is that, in spite of the lack of a specific legal framework, cyberspace is certainly not a lawless domain beyond the control of public international law. As it has been pointed out, it is well settled that general principles and rules of international law also apply to cyber operations²⁰⁴. Indeed, if international law is to be an effective governance arrangement, it should be flexible to new situations without the necessity to recreate a whole set of rules on each occasion²⁰⁵. The development of nuclear weapons is a prime example of this. When the UN Charter was being elaborated, its “framers could not be aware of the threat of nuclear weapons”²⁰⁶ and therefore the legal instrument did not include this type of armament in its provisions regarding the use of force. Yet, decades later, the ICJ provided an advisory opinion arguing that Articles 2(4) and 51 of the UN Charter, concerning the prohibition of the use of force and self-defence respectively, apply to “any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed”²⁰⁷. By this logic, the body of international law that governs the use of force should apply to cyber activities, too²⁰⁸. Despite these advances, however, many underlying questions remain virtually unanswered. Perhaps most importantly, how are international legal norms supposed to apply to the complex cyber domain?²⁰⁹\n²⁰¹ Ibid.\n²⁰² Korzak 2017.\n²⁰³ Supra note 55, at 648.\n²⁰⁴ According to Henriksen, the 2013 UN GGE report “reflected an emerging consensus that cyberspace is subject to the same general principles of international law that governs the more physical domains” (Henriksen 2019, 3). The remaining question, therefore, is which international law?\n²⁰⁵ Supra note 42, at 9. On this point, the United States claims that “[t]he development of norms for state conduct in cyberspace does not require a reinvention of customary international law, nor does it render existing international norms obsolete” (United States of America, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World, May 2011, 9).\n²⁰⁶ International Court of Justice, Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict (Request for Advisory Opinion Submitted by the World Health Organization) and Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Request for Advisory Opinion Submitted by the General Assembly of the United Nations), CR 95/25, 1995, para. 46.\n²⁰⁷ International Court of Justice, Reports of Judgements, Advisory Opinions and Orders, Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, para. 39.\n²⁰⁸ “[T]he mere fact that a computer (rather than a more traditional weapon, weapon system, or platform) is used during an operation has no bearing on whether that operation amounts to a ‘use of force’”.

See section 4.1 infra for a detailed debate on the Tallinn initiative.\n²⁰⁹ Osula and Rõigas 2016, 14.\n32\nNote that, besides the general principles and rules of international law, there are some regional and sectorial legal regimes that are not precisely focused on cybersecurity but nevertheless provide tools that may be used to address specific forms of malicious cyberattacks²¹⁰. These include, principally, the 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation²¹¹, the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)²¹², the 1992 Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union²¹³, the 2001 Convention on Cybercrime²¹⁴ and its Additional Protocol²¹⁵, the 2009 Information Security Agreement of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization²¹⁶, and the 2014 African Union Convention on Cybersecurity and Personal Data Protection²¹⁷. This “patchwork of regulations”²¹⁸, however, only govern a small portion of the activities in cyberspace or have a very limited number of members²¹⁹. Therefore, they do not offer a comprehensive or effective framework for dealing with all forms of cyber operations.\nWith this in mind, one should be cognizant that, even though cybersecurity has certainly drawn huge attention in recent years, short-term prospects for the establishment of a far-reaching international treaty or the formation of new customary international law have been described as “not encouraging”²²⁰, “doubtful”²²¹, and even “unfeasible”²²². Given this gloomy picture, scholars, cyber-experts, and international stakeholders have been attempting to fill the normative void with their views on how international law applies to the cyber domain. Note that these non-state-driven initiatives were only possible because of the “power vacuum” created by states’ reluctance to undertake the international law-making process²²³.

This subject, however, warrant a more extended discussion than I can here give it. In this sense, this study focuses on the two leading non-state-driven initiatives that epitomize the phenomenon described above: the Tallinn Manual Project and Microsoft’s proposals.\nThe first non-state initiative that tried to address cyberattacks and increase international cybersecurity was the Tallinn Project, which brought together an international group of independent experts led by Professor Michael Schmitt. The project published two editions of the Manual, respectively in 2013²²⁶ and 2017²²⁷, under the auspices of the NATO CCD COE. Their texts, however, must not be seen as representing the views of NATO or sponsoring nations. Rather, the Manuals should be understood as a reflexion of the views of the experts, all acting in their own private capacity²²⁸. It should be noted that this project is neither an international treaty on cyber law nor does it set forth *lex ferenda*, but it is a restatement of international law as it is – *lex lata*²²⁹.\nThe 2013 edition, entitled the *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, pays particular attention to cyber activities that occur above the level of use of force and encompasses purported rules of customary international law, the larger part of which related to the *jus ad bellum* (the law governing the use of force)²³⁰ and the *jus in bello* (the law\n²²⁴ Finnemore and Hollis 2016, 446; According to Finnemore and Sikkink, norm entrepreneurs are “agents having strong notions about appropriate or desirable behaviour in their community” (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998, 896-97). Henry Dunant, the founder of the International Committee of the Red Cross, is a prime example of norm entrepreneurship.\n²²⁵ For instance, Chernenko et al. recommend the creation of an “independent, international cyber court or arbitrage method that deals only with government-level cyber conflicts” (Chernenko et al. 2018). RAND’s *Stateless Attribution* report, on the other hand, suggests an international organization for cyber-attribution, the *Global Cyber Attribution Consortium*, which would involve “a broad team of international experts to conduct independent investigations of major cyber incidents for the purpose of attribution” and would operate “without standing state participation” (*Supra* note 3, at 27-31).\n²²⁶ *Supra* note 178.\n²²⁷ Ibid.\n²²⁸ Tallinn Manual, 23; Tallinn Manual 2.0, 2.\n²²⁹ Tallinn Manual, 19; Tallinn Manual 2.0, 3.\n²³⁰ Tallinn Manual, rules 10-19.\nof armed conflict)²³¹. The Manual was considered to be a “remarkable achievement”²³² and, according to Banks, provided “much-needed confidence for states that international law applies in the cyber domain”²³³. Early reviews, nevertheless, criticized the project’s emphasis on cyber operations that amount to use of force since, in reality, the majority of, if not all, cyber activities fall below the use of force threshold²³⁴. Another major criticism of the Tallinn Manual is the dearth of geographic diversity among the group of experts, all of whom hail from Western Europe, Australia, and the USA. Consequently, the impartiality of the project is challenged, hindering its acceptability and application by states outside the Global North. China, for instance, has been very critical of the whole Tallinn initiative since it seems to be a North American attempt to “maintain US dominance in the information age”²³⁵. As noted by Eichensehr, the Manual is “channelling, even though not officially representing, a particular worldview with respect to the laws of armed conflict”²³⁶.\nIn the 2013 Tallinn Manual, no effort was made to establish legal criteria for attributing blame for cyberattacks²³⁷ and attribution is addressed as a problem, instead of “a realistic task having technical, political and legal aspects”²³⁸. Still, some provisions may shed light on the attribution problem. For example, Rule 5 asserts that “a state shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States”²³⁹. Note that this provision restates in cyber terms the principle put forward in the ICJ’s Corfu Channel Judgement²⁴⁰. The experts were able to reach consensus on the scope of application of Rule 5²⁴¹, but they could\n²³¹ Tallinn Manual, rules 20-95.\n²³² Ingber 2017, 1531.\n²³³ Supra note 33, at 1494.\n²³⁴ Supra note 42, at 16. On this topic, Xinmin explains that the majority of cyberattacks are perpetrated by non-state actors, which are generally seen as cybercrime or infringement of cyber rights that should be governed by domestic criminal law or the law of torts. Also, she points that “[e]ven if some of these attacks are conducted by states or may be attributable to states, most of them fall far below the threshold of ‘threat of use of force’ or ‘armed attack’. Instead, they are only cyber-attacks of minimal levels of intensity, which are comparable to other internationally wrongful acts such as interference with internal affairs of other states” (Xinmin 2016, 189-29).\n²³⁵ Supra note 152, at 4.\n²³⁶ Eichensehr 2014, 588.\n²³⁷ Fleck 2013, 338.\n²³⁸ Ibid., 334-35.\n²³⁹ It is important to point out that this rule has since been included in the 2015 UN GGE report: “[s]tates should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs” (Supra note 161, para. 13 (c)).\n²⁴⁰ “Such obligations are based [...] on certain general and well-recognized principles, namely: [...] every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”. International Court of Justice, The Corfu Channel Case, Merits, 9 April 1949, 22.\n²⁴¹ “As to scope of application, this Rule covers all acts that are unlawful and that have detrimental effects on another state. (Tallinn Manual, Rule 5, para. 5, 33).\n35\nnot agree whether this rule applies (1) to states through which cyberattacks are routed$^{242}$, (2) to states that only have constructive knowledge$^{243}$, and (3) to situations in which the relevant acts are purely prospective$^{244}$.\nOther noteworthy provision in the Manual is Rule 6, which affirms that “a State bears international legal responsibility for a cyber operation attributable to it and which constitutes a breach of an international obligation”. In this regard, the experts agreed that, in specific circumstances, the acts of non-state actors might be attributable to a state and therefore cause that state’s international legal responsibility$^{245}$. The non-state actor, however, must be either acting “on the instructions of” or “under the direction or control” of that state$^{246}$.\nIn 2017, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations was published, expanding considerably the scope of the project. Now, it also includes the analysis of the international legal framework that applies to malicious cyberattacks that do not meet the use of force threshold. Furthermore, the new Manual addresses peacetime legal regimes, such as state responsibility, human rights law, and the laws of space, air, and the sea. On the whole, the Tallinn 2.0 “reflects a careful effort to move international law forward in the challenging domain of cyberspace”$^{247}$. Mačák further echoes this idea by arguing that the expansion and revision of the document will probably “further strengthen the project’s overall relevance as well as its claim to authority”$^{248}$. Banks, on the other hand, explains that the Tallinn 2.0’s provisions and commentaries are “necessarily general in nature, sometimes ambiguous, and do not necessarily reflect settled international law”$^{249}$.\nRegarding cyber-attribution, in spite of the expectations surrounding its publication, the 2017 Tallinn Manual did not go any further than the previous edition in providing an effective legal solution to the attribution problem$^{250}$. Rather, the experts limited their analysis of cyber-attribution to the well-established Articles on State Responsibility, codified by the ILC$^{251}$. This body of law, as its name suggests, only offers prescriptive norms when there is a state nexus\n36\nand, therefore, provides no legal understanding vis-à-vis the attribution of cyberattacks to non-state actors operating on their own²⁵².\nDespite criticism, the Tallinn initiative provides a comprehensive and attentive analysis of how the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* applies to the cyber environment, along with valuable commentaries on controversial issues that need to be further discussed. Even though the reliance on Western-centric approaches might handicap Tallinn’s acceptance in non-Western countries, such as China and the Russian Federation, the project still is an essential tool for scholars, international lawyers, policymakers, and international stakeholders²⁵³.\nIn 2014, Microsoft Corporation published a white paper entitled *International Cybersecurity Norms: Reducing Conflict in an Internet-Dependent World*²⁵⁴. It was the first thorough proposal to seek the definition of acceptable and unacceptable state conducts online, with the purpose of decreasing risks and bringing predictability and stability to the international scenario²⁵⁵. In short, Microsoft proposed six cybersecurity norms to limit conflict and improve cyber defences²⁵⁶. These norms are intended to “reduce the possibility that ICT products and services could be used, abused, or exploited by nation states as part of offensive operations”²⁵⁷. Note that, like both editions of the Tallinn Manual, Microsoft’s white paper suggests guidelines of state conduct and is openly state-centric in its approach²⁵⁸.\nThe project was widely criticized for emphasizing the role of states and thus overlooking the relevance of the private sector, in particular the global ICT industry, for the promotion of international cybersecurity²⁵⁹. In response to these claims, Microsoft released another white paper, *From Articulation to Implementation: Enabling Progress on Cybersecurity Norms*, in which the Corporation outlines six further cybersecurity norms. This time, however, the norms were directed at ICT companies²⁶⁰. For instance, the paper calls upon the ICT industry to “assist public sector efforts to identify, prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from events in\n²⁵² Supra note 33, at 1495.\n²⁵³ Supra note 209, at 585.\n²⁵⁴ Note that Microsoft’s proposal was not the first time a private company put forward an initiative of this kind. Already in 1999, the CEO of AOL, Steve Case, strongly recommended states to “revis[e] outdated and ‘country-centric’ laws on telecommunications and taxes that could thwart the growth of the medium” and instead support “international standards – from security, to privacy, to taxation”. (Case, Steve, Remarks Prepared for Delivery (via satellite) Israel ‘99 Business Conference’, 13 December 1999, cited in Goldsmith and Wu 2006, 26)\n²⁵⁵ McKay 2014, 2.\n²⁵⁶ For the complete list of the proposed cybersecurity norms, see McKay 2014, 20.\n²⁵⁷ Ibid., 11.\n²⁵⁸ Supra note 42, at 17.\n²⁵⁹ Charney et al. 2016, 3.\n²⁶⁰ Ibid.\n37\ncyberspace”²⁶¹. Furthermore, in 2017, the President of Microsoft, Brad Smith, proposed the adoption of a “Digital Geneva Convention” to protect civilians from nation-state cyberattacks²⁶². Such a convention would include an independent attribution organization that could “address cyber threats in a manner like the role played by the International Atomic Energy Agency in the field of nuclear non-proliferation”²⁶³. This organization would also facilitate cooperation between academia, governments, technology companies, and civil society in the sphere of cyber-attribution.\nNote that, while the rules brought by the Tallinn Manuals articulate purported customary international obligations that by themselves are binding on all states, except persistent objectors²⁶⁴, the norms put forward by Microsoft’s proposals are only broad suggestions that do not create any right or legal obligation. In other words, Microsoft’s norms are “more aspirational than realistic” and require states to translate them into legally binding rules, which takes time and commitment²⁶⁵. Despite this difference, both initiatives have in common the fact that they are non-state-driven, quasi-legal instruments which do not have any legally binding force²⁶⁶. In other words, they are soft law rules²⁶⁷. In fact, the Tallinn Manuals and Microsoft’s white papers could hardly amount to anything but a non-binding document²⁶⁸ since states still are “the legislators of the international legal system”²⁶⁹. That said, one may call into question the importance of these initiatives for the development of international law. Is soft law an authentic law? Is soft law effective to produce norms despite its non-binding nature?\n38\n39\n## 4.2 The value of soft law\nAccording to Besson, international legal norms might have different levels of normativity²⁷⁰, ranging from “being low (or soft) as with legal norms in the making to being imperative as with norms of *jus cogens*”²⁷¹. Certainly, the Tallinn Manual project and Microsoft’s papers have a lower degree of legal normativity than binding international rules²⁷². Indeed, as stated by the ILC on its study on the Identification of Customary International Law, the “conduct of other actors [than states] is not practice that contributes to the formation, or expression, of rules of customary international law”²⁷³. This, however, does not imply that these initiatives are utterly irrelevant for the law-making process or even to the development of cyber law. Quite the opposite, considering the normative plurality in international law, non-state-driven initiatives of this kind might be valuable both in quantity and quality²⁷⁴. For Thirlway, “soft law is a vital intermediate stage towards a more rigorously binding system, permitting experiment and rapid modification”²⁷⁵.\nMoreover, even though these intermediary legal products are not “valid legal norms”, they might possess a certain evidentiary importance in the next stages of the development of rules of international law²⁷⁶. Put differently, non-binding documents, such as UN resolutions, might evince the existence of both *opinio juris* and state practice which could later support the formation of customary norms²⁷⁷. By this logic, hard and soft laws are not mutually exclusive and should be seen as “tools provided with a different degree of normativity along a *continuum*”²⁷⁸. It also should be noted that soft law-making processes normally involve non-state actors and thus are more “multicultural and inclusive” than others²⁷⁹.\n---\n²⁷⁰ By ‘normativity’, I mean “the law’s claim to authority, that is, its claim to provide its legal subjects with exclusionary albeit *prima facie* reasons for action through binding legal norms or in other words its claim to create obligations to obey the law that in principle preclude some countervailing reasons for action” (Besson, 2010, 173).\n²⁷¹ Ibid., 174.\n²⁷² *Supra note* 42, at 19.\n²⁷³ International Law Commission, *Draft Conclusions on Identification of Customary International Law*, with Commentaries, 2018, A/73/10, conclusion 4 (3), 130.\n²⁷⁴ *Supra note* 240, at 170.\n²⁷⁵ Thirlway 2019, 186-87.\n²⁷⁶ *Supra note* 240, at 170.\n²⁷⁷ Ibid.

Regarding soft law, Joyner has interesting points that are worthwhile looking at. For instance, he notes that states are usually “more willing to be innovative when the adopted instrument is not legally binding” (Joyner 1998, 414).\nAccording to Article 38(1) of the Statute of the ICJ, scholarly works are a secondary source of public international law that informs the application of primary sources²⁸⁰. Hence, it seems fair to conclude that the aforementioned initiatives are not only highly pertinent, but also “likely to prove especially influential”²⁸¹. Nevertheless, this situation is by no means ideal since states, and only states, hold the formal authority to create international law²⁸². As Judge Higgins aptly put it, “[s]tates are, at this moment of history, still at the heart of the international legal system”²⁸³. However, it is important to bear in mind that the norms proposed by both the Tallinn Manual Project and Microsoft’s papers might “mature through codification into treaty law or crystallise into customary law”, so that they delineate the exact limits of activities in cyberspace²⁸⁴.\nThis dynamic is certainly not without precedent. The Antarctic legal regime is the epitome of this. In the 1960s and 1970s, many non-legally binding norms were brought in with high hopes of conserving both living and non-living resources of Antarctica²⁸⁵. Joyner argues that the adoption of these non-binding instruments laid the international legal foundation for the treaty that was yet to come²⁸⁶. Ultimately, the majority of these norms were codified into the 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, a binding agreement that has been ratified by all major international actors, including the USA, China, and Russia²⁸⁷.\nAnother prime example is the international nuclear safety regime. Even though proposals to establish a legally-binding international treaty were put forward since the 1960s, states were generally “disinclined to go beyond the recommendatory nature of the safety standards” issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)²⁸⁸. This situation, however,\n²⁸⁰ “The Court, whose function is to decide in accordance with international law such disputes as are submitted to it, shall apply:\n(a) international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting states;\n(b) international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law;\n(c) the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations;\n(d) subject to the provisions of Article 59, judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicist of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law”. United Nations, Statute of the International Court of Justice, 18 April 1946, Article 38 (1).\n²⁸¹ Schmitt and Vihul 2016, 47.\n²⁸² Supra note 42, at 19.\n²⁸³ Higgins 1994, 39.\n²⁸⁴ Supra note 250.\n²⁸⁵ Joyner 1998, 420. In the 1960s, more than seventy recommended measures were adopted by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Party Meetings (ACTMs); and in 1970s, more than fifty were adopted.\n²⁸⁶ Ibid.\n²⁸⁷ Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, October 1991, United Nations Treaty Series, vol. 2941, A-5778.\n²⁸⁸ Nuclear Energy Agency and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Joint Report on International Law in the Post-Chernobyl Period, 2006, NEA No. 6146, 13.\nchanged rapidly after the Chernobyl accident, which exposed the costly transboundary consequences of unsafe nuclear activity²⁸⁹. The 1986 disaster gave rise to an international legally-binding regime for the safe development of nuclear energy, which slowly transformed the safety standards and other relevant non-binding norms into hard law rules²⁹⁰.\nOne must be aware, however, that the cyber domain differs in important ways from the Antarctic and the nuclear regimes. Perhaps the most notable difference is that, while the lawmaking process vis-à-vis cyberspace has been spearheaded by non-state-driven initiatives, the development of binding rules for international nuclear safety and the conservation of Antarctica had been led mainly by state actors. Yet, these two regimes are valuable examples that illustrate the codification of soft law norms²⁹¹. With this in mind, the current status of cyber international law should be seen as an early stage towards the codification or crystallisation of cyber hard law²⁹². The question that needs to be addressed, therefore, is whether states will finally rise to the challenge.\n²⁸⁹ Shull 2008, 4.\n²⁹⁰ To wit: Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, 1986, INFCIRC/335; Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency, 1986, INFCIRC/336; Convention on Nuclear Safety, 1994, INFCIRC/449; Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on The Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, 1997, INFCIRC/546.\n²⁹¹ Supra note 42, at 21.\n²⁹² Ibid.\n41\n# Chapter 5 – Conclusion\nThe 2007 Estonian attacks, as well as other cyberattacks mentioned in this study, illustrate the severity of the threats facing states’ cybersecurity, and the equally important challenge of implementing a legal framework for attributing blame for cyber activities. Given the ever-growing reliance on ICTs and the increasing frequency, intensity, and complexity of cyberattacks, a solution for the attribution problem is crucial for both promoting a (relatively) stable world order and reducing the chances of conflict stemming from cyberoperations²⁹³. Note, however, that this solution does not lie in the technical domains, as previously thought²⁹⁴. Pragmatically, the most relevant hurdles for cyber deterrence nowadays are not poor technical capabilities since, from a technical standpoint, tools for attribution have matured significantly in recent years²⁹⁵, increasing states’ confidence vis-à-vis assigning blame for malicious cyberattacks²⁹⁶. Rather, the solution for this issue lies in the realm of international law and cooperation.\nAs transnational terrorism, migration crises, and other security challenges that plague the international community, the attribution problem cannot be appropriately tackled by any single international entity, regardless of how strong and influential that entity might be²⁹⁷. Instead, these modern phenomena require a framework for active global collaboration. It is international law that “affords [such] a framework, a pattern, a fabric for international society”²⁹⁸. Nevertheless, in the context of the computer network, it seems that international law fails to deliver. Even though states have agreed that public international law applies to cyberactivity, there is no broad multilateral agreement on how to govern cyberspace²⁹⁹ and, therefore, it is as yet uncertain how the international legal framework applies to this new, complex domain.\nThis difficulty in the application of traditional rules and principles of international law, in order to properly address cyber challenges, results from a number of reasons³⁰⁰. Perhaps the most relevant of them is the attachment of this body of law to state-centric assumptions and foundations of the early formative stage of the international legal system³⁰¹. By placing state\n²⁹³ Supra note 3.\n²⁹⁴ Supra note 10, at 28.\n²⁹⁵ Supra note 33, at 1502.\n²⁹⁶ Supra note 43, at 137. By way of an example, the USA has declared that it has the ability to identify and hold their cyber opponents accountable (Fryer-Biggs 2012). Indeed, in the last few years, the U.S. government has attributed high-profile cyberattacks, such as the 2014 intrusion at Sony Pictures Entertainment and the 2016 DNC hack, respectively, to North Korean and Russia (Supra note 42, at 23-24).\n²⁹⁷ Supra note 42, at 2.\n²⁹⁸ Henkin 1978, 5.\n²⁹⁹ Moynihan 2019, 4.\n³⁰⁰ Supra note 2, at 375.\n³⁰¹ Supra note 7, at 610-11.\nactors at the heart of its legal regimes, public international law requires in almost all situations a state link so as to determine either an international legal obligation or an internationally wrongful act³⁰². In an environment where non-state actors are as powerful, if not more so, than states, it seems fair to conclude that this legal system grounded in the traditional state-centric perspective of international law is not suitable or even adequate to address challenges posed by cyberspace and the rapid development of ICTs³⁰³. In this sense, as long as states refuse to recognize the existence and the importance of other international players, any effort to govern cyberspace and to establish legal mechanisms for cyber-attribution will fall short.\nAs it stands now, international law not only fails in effectively dealing with the attribution problem, but also is unlikely to be instrumental in providing both predictability and stability to cyberspace in the short and medium-terms. Besides the lack of clarity of the law in this area, governments have been unwilling to clearly express their existing norms and practices in relation to the cyber domain, impeding the formation of customary international law and increasing unpredictability of state behaviour³⁰⁴. Note that, in spite of the constructive contribution made by non-state initiatives, public international law is lagging far behind in many respects and thus continues to be underdeveloped vis-à-vis cyber-attribution.\nBefore proceeding, two points still need to be considered. First, by filling the void created by states’ reluctance to undertake the international law-making process, non-state-driven initiatives, especially the Tallinn Manuals and Microsoft’s proposals, have been providing much-needed clarity to some grey areas of international cyber law³⁰⁵. These initiatives, however, are constrained by their state-centric approaches, non-binding character, and interpretative methods, which usually lack the necessary legal safety³⁰⁶. Therefore, non-state initiatives represent a relevant but primitive point in the discussion about the application of international law to the cyber domain³⁰⁷. They should be seen as a means to an end, not an end in itself³⁰⁸.\n³⁰² Ibid.\n³⁰³ According to Schmitt and Watts, the cyber domain and cyberactivity have bridged “a number of formerly significant gaps between states’ and non-state actors’ abilities to compromise international peace and security. in fact, some non-state actors now match, if not exceed, the cyber capabilities of many states in this respect” (Supra note 7, at 595).\n³⁰⁴ Supra note 33, at 1509.\n³⁰⁵ Supra note 42, at 1.\n³⁰⁶ Supra note 2, at 381. For instance, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 limited its analysis of cyber-attribution to the basic principles of State Responsibility, as codified by the ILC. However, as its name suggests, this body of law can only be applied when there is a state nexus.\n³⁰⁷ Supra note 33, at 1513.\n³⁰⁸ In this regard, Mačák points out that non-state initiatives might serve “as norm-making laboratories”, permitting states to identify and assess advantages and disadvantages of a number of proposals (Supra note 42, at 30-31).\n43\nTo put it differently, this situation marks an early stage towards the formation of cyber hard law, for the non-binding norms presented by these initiatives might, over time, mature through either codification or crystallisation.\nSecond, if states genuinely wish to address the problem of cyber-attribution, they can do so; they have the technological capabilities and all the necessary legal power. After all, states are still at the heart of the international legal framework³⁰⁹ and are the only ones to hold the formal authority to create international rules³¹⁰. This argument generates an obvious puzzle, however: why then do they not solve this conundrum? The answer to this question lies on the fact that some countries may benefit from the current state of affairs, characterized by uncertainties and the lack of express cyber norms³¹¹. States that possess the most advanced cyber capabilities – such as the United States, Russia, China, and likely North Korea – may take advantage of the cyber domain in order to fulfil their national interests in the physical world³¹². For instance, the USA has allegedly used an extremely sophisticated computer worm, called Stuxnet, to destroy numerous centrifuges in an Iranian nuclear facility³¹³, thwarting the prospects of Iran developing nuclear weapons and thus securing American geopolitical interests in the Middle East.\nBy this logic, if states believe that by acting in unregulated cyberspace their gains offset their losses, there will be no incentive for them to promote the regulation of this domain or to solve the attribution problem. This might help to explain why state actors have been so reluctant to engage in the cyber law-making process, as well as to express clear *opinio juris* with respect to cyberspace. Considering the ever-increasing costs of insecurity and uncertainty related to an ungoverned cyber domain, states may soon come to realize the necessity of an international legal framework capable of addressing cyberattacks³¹⁴. As Professor Koh aptly put it, “compliance with international law frees us to do more, and do more legitimately, in cyberspace, in a way that more fully promotes our national interests”³¹⁵. Therefore, one can only hope that\n³⁰⁹ Supra note 283.\n³¹⁰ Supra note 42, at 19.\n³¹¹ Supra note 33, at 1511.\n³¹² It should be noted that the former U.S. Secretary of Defence Leon Panetta stated that the American government was “developing the plans that needed to be developed to ensure the United States would remain one of the strongest players in the cyber arena” (Stone 2019).\n³¹³ Zetter 2014a.\n³¹⁴ Note, however, that this process might already be in motion, as illustrated by the 2015 cyber agreement between the United States and China (Harold 2016; Supra note 42, at 27).\n³¹⁵ Koh 2012, 10.\nstates do not wait for the occurrence of a “cyber 9/11” $^{316}$ or a “cyber Pearl Harbour” $^{317}$ to overcome their aversion to engaging in the development of international cyber law.\nIn the meantime, cyberspace will continue to be an environment that offers the perfect conditions for the security dilemma to thrive and in which the activities of both state and non-state actors can trigger off conflicts causing widespread harm to societies, the global economy, and the international security system. With this in mind, international stakeholders and policymakers should strive to increase transparency, so as to bridge the existing trust gaps inside the international community. Overall, greater transparency reduces misperceptions and conflict spirals and, consequently, leads to cooperation and better cybersecurity.\nIt is important to point out that, due to time constraints, this thesis was not able to assess the role played by the private sector in attributing blame for cyberattacks or to analyse non-Western approaches to the international rule of law in the cyber domain. Future researches, therefore, should attempt to explore these topics.\n316 Fazzini 2018.\n317 Supra note 312.\n45"

Even though determining the machines that launched a malicious cyber incident is no longer an arduous task for the most developed states, identifying the individuals, organizations, or governments that are legally responsible for the attack continues to be extremely difficult. This study argues that, as it stands now, international law not only fails in effectively dealing with the attribution problem, but also is unlikely to be instrumental in providing both predictability and stability to cyberspace in the short and medium-terms. As a result, the cyber domain will continue to be an environment that offers the perfect conditions for the security dilemma to thrive and in which incidents – whether intended or not – can trigger off conflicts causing widespread harm to the whole international security system.\nKeywords: cyber-attribution, attribution problem, cybersecurity, security dilemma, international security, Tallinn Manual, non-state initiatives.\n\nAbbreviations... 5 Chapter 1 – Introduction... 6 Chapter 2 – Realism and the Security Dilemma... 14 2.1 What is the security dilemma?... 15 Chapter 3 – The Attribution Problem... 18 3.1 Why is attribution so difficult?... 19 3.2 Why does cyber-attribution matter?... 24 Chapter 4 – International Law and Cybersecurity... 29 4.1 Leading non-state initiatives... 34 4.2 The value of soft law... 39 Chapter 5 – Conclusion... 42 Bibliography... 46 Articles, Reports and Books... 46 Legal Sources and Official Documents... 53 Websites... 56 ACTMs Antarctic Treaty Consultative Party Meetings CCD COE Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence CIA Central Intelligence Agency DDOS Distributed Denial of Service DNC Democratic National Committee DNI Director of National Intelligence GGE Group of Governmental Experts IAEA International Atomic Energy Agency ICJ International Court of Justice ICTs Information and Communication Technologies ICTY International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia IHL International Humanitarian Law ILC International Law Commission IP Internet Protocol NATO North Atlantic Treaty Organization UK United Kingdom USA United States of America VCLT Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties # Chapter 1 – Introduction By providing people across the globe with instant access to information, to communication, and to novel economic opportunities, cyberspace¹ and the rapid development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have essentially transformed not only the world economy, but also the way of life. Education, health, government, as well as sectors such as energy, communication, and transportation are inextricably linked to, if not dependent on, the cyber domain². As information technology becomes more widespread and integrated into our daily lives, the probability of compromise by malicious cyber activity increases³. According to the former Director of National Intelligence (DNI) of the United States, more than thirty countries are developing offensive cyber capabilities, which will rise the incidence of both standoff and remote operations⁴. To complicate matters further, these capabilities are progressively under criminal and other non-state actors’ control⁵. Therefore, cyberattacks⁶ that deeply affect international peace and the global economy are no longer “futuristic or far-fetched”, but rather the reality of cyberspace⁷.\n¹ “Cyberspace” is defined by the United States National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations as “a domain characterized by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructure” (United States Department of Defence (DoD), *The National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations*, December 2006,3). Therefore, cyberspace also includes all networked digital operations.\n² Pipyros et al. 2018, 371.\n³ Davis II et al. 2017, 1 ⁴ United States Senate 2017, 5.\n⁵ Owens, Dam, and Lin 2009, 27.\n⁶ By cyberattack, I refer to the definition applied by Oona Hathaway et al. as “any action taken to undermine the functions of a computer network for a political or national security purpose”. This definition, however, differs from that used by the U.S. Cyber Command, which identifies cyberattacks as those “that cause physical damage to property or injury to persons.” (Ibid., 821 n.9). Hathaway et al.’s definition also differs from the one offered by the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, which describe cyberattack as “a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects”. It is important to bear in mind that both the Tallinn Manual and the Cyber Command definitions are under-inclusive, particularly considering the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack, which did not cause physical damage to property or persons, but involved the *domaine reservé* of the U.S., raising relevant national security concerns about democratic procedures and the violation of the prohibition of intervention. Hathaway et al.’s terminology, on the other hand, covers a broader set of cyberattacks, including attacks such as the DNC hack.\nIn addition, I use the term ‘cyberattack’ instead of ‘cyber warfare’ because the latter refers to a smaller subset of cyberattacks that “constitute armed attacks or that occur in the context of an ongoing armed conflict”. By contrast, the term ‘cyberattack’ embraces a broad range of attacks, from cyber warfare to those attacks that fall short of armed conflict but still deserve some kind of sanction. Furthermore, Hathaway and her co-authors make a distinction between cyberattacks and cyberespionage; according to the they, “neither cyber-espionage nor cyber-exploitation constitutes a cyber-attack because these concepts do not involve altering computer networks in a way that affects their current or future ability to function”.\n⁷ Schmitt and Watts 2016, 596.\nFollowing the relocation of a Soviet war memorial in 2007, Estonia was hit by a series of massive cyberattacks lasting three weeks⁸. Taking into consideration that the small Baltic country is one of the most wired societies in Europe⁹, the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks¹⁰ were particularly harmful, resulting in a temporary interruption of service on many government and commercial websites¹¹ and, thus, profoundly affecting the functioning of the country’s economy¹². Initially, the attacks were attributed to Russia due to the political atmosphere at the time, as well as past Russian actions. This explanation, however, was questioned by technical experts, and even NATO officials were disinclined to assign blame to the Russian government. Because of disagreements over the links between the attackers and Russia, what at first appeared to be a pretty obvious case of aggression became a gridlock. Although it is highly probable that the Russian state launched the cyberattack¹³, its involvement has never been proven. Yet, the attack continues to be an example of Russia’s cyber capabilities that following cyberattacks will be judged by¹⁴.\nIn hindsight, the Estonian attacks were “fairly mild and simple”, far less damaging than the cyberattacks that have followed¹⁵. Even so, they brought cyberspace to the forefront of international relations discussions, raising awareness among states about the severe risk posed by the growing dependence on ICTs, as well as the possibility of conflict in this new and unique environment. Indeed, during the last decade, the international community has witnessed and experienced a considerable number of problematic episodes in cyberspace – the cyber intrusion at Sony Pictures Entertainment¹⁶, the attack on France’s TV5Monde¹⁷, the Democratic National ⁸ Traynor 2007.\n⁹ By 2007, 98% of Estonian territory was covered with Internet access, and mobile phone penetration was almost 100% (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010, 17).\n¹⁰ According to Clark and Landau, DDoS attack is a concerted malevolent effort in which a large number of machines from all over the Internet attack a site or a set of sites in order to disrupt service by overloading a server or a link.\n¹¹ Dinniss 2014, 38-39.\n¹² Supra note 8, at 25.\n¹³ Schulzke 2018, 960.\n¹⁴ Ibid. It is necessary to recognize that this situation poses a threat to international peace since, according to Gomez, the “adversary’s past behaviour may motivate a disproportionate response to pre-empt any further threats”.\n¹⁵ Schmitt 2017, xxiii.\n¹⁶ On November 2014, Sony Pictures’ computers were broken into, and sensitive information from the film studio and unreleased movies were published online, disrupting the company business operations (Davis II et al. 2017, 42). Considering that Sony had produced the movie The Interview, which depicts the assassination of Kim Jong-Un, speculations about North Korean participation were raised. Through a press statement, North Korea denied responsibility for the cyberattack, but praised the attackers for their actions. As of yet, no one was able to prove North Korean involvement and the evidence implicating it was considered “flimsy”.\n¹⁷ In April 2015, the French-language television network had its computer infrastructure and social media accounts hacked. Initially, the group called Cyber Caliphate, an Islamic State affiliate, claimed responsibility for the Against this background, at the 2016 Defence Ministerial Meeting, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) defence ministers officially recognized cyberspace as a new frontier of warfare²⁰, and that decision was endorsed at the 2016 Warsaw Summit²¹. Now, the Allies “recognize cyberspace as a domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea”²². Certainly, the change comes as a response to the increasing number of cyberattacks against both the organization and its member states. The threat posed by these attacks even prompted former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security to declare that cyberattacks “now exceed the risk of physical attacks” in terms of breadth and range of possible outcomes²³. And such attacks show no sign of decreasing, as the aforementioned examples demonstrate.\nAlthough the persistence of cyberattacks might be due, in part, to the relative availability and fairly low cost of the technology needed to mount an attack²⁴, it might also largely result from the difficulty in identifying its perpetrators and attributing blame²⁵. The structure of the Internet, which “was not designed with the goal of deterrence in mind”²⁶, provides the perfect setting for state and non-state actors to take part in malicious activity unafraid of attribution or retaliation²⁷. Worse still, aggressors are able to conceal themselves and the full effects of their operations by using technical mechanisms and/or relying on non-state proxies that they rent or compromise²⁸. For example, the cyberattacks that hit Estonia originated from at least 177 attacks, but as the investigations began, it became clear that the jihadist group was just a cover-up. The private company FireEye ultimately attributed the attack to Russian hackers.\n¹⁸ In 2015, in the middle of the presidential election, the DNC suffered a cyberattack, resulting in the exfiltration of files and emails, many of which were published by WikiLeaks. In 2016, the DNC publicly attributed the attack to two distinct Russian espionage groups, APT28 and APT29. Although it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to assess the full damage of the cyber intrusion, it is understood to have played a major role in the 58th U.S. presidential election (Davis II et al. 2017, 34).\n¹⁹ Allison 2018; Banks 2019, 191.\n²⁰ Barnes, 2016.\n²¹ Ablon et al. 2019, 1.\n²² NATO, Warsaw Summit Communiqué, n.70.\n²³ Nielsen 2018.\n²⁴ Payne and Finlay 2017, 556; Boerbert 2010, 43.\n²⁵ Tran 2018, 381.\n²⁶ Supra note 10, at 1.\n²⁷ Supra note 24.\n²⁸ Carlin 2016, 409; Carr 2010, 139-40.\ncountries, including from within the Estonian territory²⁹. Evidence has been found that attackers also obscure their identities through the adoption of foreign languages and elements of malware previously associated with other actors³⁰, and they might even exploit existing animosities in order to mask their identity and thus hinder attribution efforts³¹. By way of one example, the escalating tension between Iran and the United States suggests that both countries would be unwilling to fully cooperate in the case of a cyberattack, making Iran the perfect cover-up for third-party states and non-state actors attempting to launch a cyberattack against the USA and vice versa. It is therefore understood that attributing cyberattacks is vastly time-consuming and an “inherently interdisciplinary”³² process, requiring great technical and non-technical expertise and input from a range of actors and sources³³. In this regard, taking into account the effort necessary for its fulfilment, cyber-attribution was considered to be “an art as much as a science”³⁴.\nThe Estonian attacks are a prime example of how challenging the attribution of cyberattacks can be; thirteen years have passed and one cannot affirm whether the attacks were officially sanctioned by the Russian government or whether they were perpetrated by rogue spies or even by independent nationalistic criminals³⁵. It is important to bear in mind that, in the cyber domain, attribution differs from punishment³⁶, and it is defined as “identifying the agent responsible for the action”³⁷. Since cyberattacks have proliferated and become commonplace, attribution has grown in relevance³⁸. As a result, states have been investing resources and political capital to develop accountable attribution mechanisms in order to deter potential cyberattackers.\nIn spite of the fact that determining the machines that launched a cyberattack is no longer an arduous task for the most developed countries, identifying the individuals, organizations, or governments that are legally responsible for the attack continues to be challenging³⁹. The attribution of cyberattacks presents unique legal challenges because states were not able to reach a broad international agreement on how to govern the cyber domain and the current ²⁹ Payne and Finlay 2017, 560.\n³⁰ Supra note 12.\n³¹ Ibid; Payne and Finlay 2019, 203.\n³² Egloff and Wenger 2019, 3 ³³ Banks 2017, 1503.\n³⁴ Rid and Buchanan 2015, 7.\n³⁵ Supra note 12.\n³⁶ Lindsay 2015, 57.\n³⁷ Supra note 10.\n³⁸ Banks 2019, 191.\n³⁹ Supra note 38, at 192.\ninternational legal framework does little to control cyber operations⁴⁰. On this matter, Schmitt and Vihul believe that even if agreement were to be reached on a multilateral binding cyber treaty, it would probably be undermined by states’ individual reservations⁴¹. Similarly, according to Mačák, there seems to be a resistance to the codification of international rules applicable to cyberspace⁴².\nIn addition, as cyber operations usually happen in secrecy⁴³, customary international law is not able to develop understandings or recognize state practice about attributing responsibility for cyberattacks⁴⁴. Further complicating the issue, governments have been unwilling to clearly express *opinio juris* on topics associated with the cyber domain⁴⁵. This attitude might be the result of a domestic political deadlock, a calculated waiting strategy⁴⁶, or even the product of the “cybersecurity knowledge gap”⁴⁷. Nevertheless, this state reticence contributes to the enduring ambiguity of international cyber law⁴⁸. It is also important to point out that no international organization, agency, or entity has the legal authority to attribute responsibility for a cyberattack. Due to this institutional legal vacuum, seldom do governments make official attribution claims, and, in the rare occasion that they do, their statements are normally perceived ⁴⁰ Supra note 25, at 384.\n⁴¹ Schmitt and Vihul 2016, 39. As codified in Article 2(d) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), reservation is “a unilateral statement, however phrased or named, made by a State, when signing, ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to a treaty, whereby it purports to exclude or to modify the legal effect of certain provisions of the treaty in their application to that State” (United Nations, *Vienna Convention on the law of treaties*, 23 May 1969, vol. 1155,1-18232, art. 2(d)).\nIt is perhaps useful to point out that some scholars have indicated that a successful agreement might be almost impossible to achieve, at least in the near future. For instance, Waxman believes that “not only do certain features of cyber-activities make international legal regulation very difficult, but major actors also have divergent strategic interests that will pull their preferred doctrinal interpretations and aspirations in different directions, impeding formations of a stable international consensus”. On this point, Goldsmith argues that “the fundamental clash of interests concerning the regulation of electronic communications, the deep constrains the United States would have to adopt to receive reciprocal benefits in a cybersecurity treaty, and the debilitating verification problems will combine to make it unfeasible to create a cybersecurity treaty that purports to constrain governments”..\n⁴² Mačák 2017, 5.\n⁴³ Mačák 2016, 130. About the high classified nature of state practice in cyberspace, Clarke and Knake state that “the entire phenomenon of cyber war is shrouded in such government secrecy that it makes the Cold War look like a time of openness and transparency”. Also, Efrony and Shany try to explain the absence of transparency in cyberspace; for them, states believe that transparency may reveal “their vulnerabilities, adversely affect their offensive or defensive capabilities, and weaken their power of deterrence”.\n⁴⁴ Supra note 38, at 194.\n⁴⁵ Among the notable exceptions, the USA stands out with its International Strategy for Cyberspace (United States, The White House, *International Strategy for Cyberspace: Property, Security, and Openness in a Networked World*, May 2011).\n⁴⁶ Schmitt and Watts 2015, 211.\n⁴⁷ Singer and Friedman 2014, 4-8.\n⁴⁸ Supra note 43, at 130.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, scholars, cyber-experts, and international stakeholders have been attempting to bridge the gap with their views on how international law applies to cyberspace. These non-state-driven initiatives are trying to promote a safe international system and reduce the chances of conflict arising from cyberattacks by filling the void created by states’ reluctance to undertake the international law-making process⁵⁵. The most important and comprehensive of these attempts certainly is the Tallinn Manual project, which is under the auspices of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE). This project, however, is neither an international treaty on cyber law nor does it offer a new set of international rules nor represent the position of any country or organization⁵⁶. Rather, it is a restatement of international law as it is (lex lata)⁵⁷, establishing a comprehensive legal structure for the governance of cyber operations during both times of peace and conflict. Considering the Tallinn project’s non-state and non-binding nature, one is then left to question its actual relevance to public international law, which still is very much attached to state-centric assumptions and foundations of the early formative stage of the international legal regime.\nOn this basis, my main argument lies heavily on the idea that the current international legal framework is underdeveloped vis-à-vis cyber-attribution, as its norms and principles were designed to the physical world and still, at present, mainly govern the relationship between states. Cyberspace, on the other end of the spectrum, is predominantly inhabited by non-state ⁴⁹ Supra note 2, at 19. It is interesting to highlight that attributing cyberattacks to states is a new phenomenon. For instance, the first official public accusation by the USA only came in 2014, when five Chinese military hackers were criminally charged for cyberespionage against U.S. corporations (The United States, Department of Justice, May 19 2014).\n⁵⁰ By attribution problem, I refer to the difficulty in discovering the identity or location of the responsible for a cyberattack or their intermediary.\n⁵¹ Supra note 25, at 384; Supra note 31, at 205.\n⁵² Supra note 32, at 1495.\n⁵³ Supra note 31, at 205.\n⁵⁴ Chircop 2018, 653.\n⁵⁵ Supra note 42, at 1.\n⁵⁶ Despite NATO’s sponsorship, the Tallinn Manuals do not reflect the official position of the Alliance.\n⁵⁷ Supra note 32, at 1494.\nactors⁵⁸ and, as Libicki aptly put it, is divided between the physical, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic layers⁵⁹. As it stands now, international law fails in coping with contemporary challenges posed by cyberspace and the rapid development of ICTs, notably the attribution of cyberattacks. As will be developed below, this practical gap not only hinders the cyber-attribution process, but also threatens international security on an equivalent scale to traditional armed attacks⁶⁰.\nAlthough literature on cybersecurity normally perceives the attribution problem as a technical issue, due to the significant technological advancements experienced in the last decade, attribution is already “more nuanced, more common, and more political”⁶¹ than it is acknowledged. It is therefore understood that the solution to this dangerous situation lies within the legal and political domains, not in the technical realm⁶². Non-state initiatives have been trying to overcome this legal quagmire, but the international legal system still is inherently attached to a state-centric approach. Therefore, no set of international binding rules as far as cybersecurity is concerned will ever likely be achieved without the participation of states.\nConsidering that so many aspects of our lives are now bound up with cyberspace, the discussion about cyber-attribution is not only pertinent but also urgent. Such a delicate situation deserves to be taken most seriously and it would be unduly ambitious to try to provide a full answer in this study. My purpose, however, is to make a modest attempt at shedding some light on the issue. Ideally, this may contribute to a constructive debate about the problem of attributing blame for cyberattacks.\nThe following research question was articulated in order to function as the backbone of the work here presented: to what extent is international law underdeveloped vis-à-vis cyber-attribution? Also, as a means to enlighten the path of this study, the following sub-questions were established: why does cyber-attribution matter? What are the legal and political challenges imposed by the attribution problem? How the difficulty in attributing blame of a cyberattack affects international security?\nIn order to carry out the aforementioned study, a qualitative research of a doctrinal nature will be applied. Mainly, this will be a legal work based on primary and secondary legal sources. Parallel to the legal background, this study will also endeavour to apply the International Relations’ concept of security dilemma to cyberspace. By bringing this concept to the ⁵⁸ Supra note 42, at 14.\n⁵⁹ Libicki 2007, 236-37.\n⁶⁰ Supra note 54, at 652.\n⁶¹ Supra note 33, at 6.\n⁶² Eichensehr 2019b, 2.\n\nIn international relations theory, Realism, also known as political realism, is one of the dominants schools of thought⁶³. Realists depict an anarchical, competitive and conflictual world, in which insecurity among states is inescapable⁶⁴. Note that ‘anarchical’ is used here in a technical sense, indicating the dearth of an overarching, political authority at the international level. Under anarchy, states are the main actors in the international arena and their primary responsibility is to secure their own interests, especially their survival⁶⁵. In order to do so, according to the realist theory, states will attempt to acquire power and engage in power-balancing⁶⁶, creating what Hoffman called “a state of war”⁶⁷.\nThe interstate political order is, therefore, a self-help system plagued by “uncertainty, weapons and fear”⁶⁸, and in which power plays the leading role in shaping the relation between states⁶⁹. As long as we accept the basic premises of the realist theory, this hostile and insecure environment not only leaves little room for international cooperation⁷⁰, but also encourages “behaviour that leaves all concerned worse off than they could be, even in the extreme case in ⁶³ This study will not differentiate Realism into its various strands since this warrant a more extended discussion that I can here give it. It is perhaps useful to point out, however, that realism is normally contrasted with liberalism or idealism, which tend to focus on international cooperation. Compared to these theories, the realist perspective is undeniably pessimistic. As Keohane put it, realism is “the language of power and interests rather than of ideals or norms”.\n⁶⁴ Wheeler and Booth 2007, 2.\n⁶⁵ Waltz 1979, 91. Waltz points out that, “internationally, the environment of states’ actions, or the structure of their system, is set by the fact that some states prefer survival over other ends obtainable in the short run and act with relative efficiency to achieve that end”. On this topic, Jervis identifies throughout his book, entitled *Perception and Misperception in International Politics*, some states that did not have survival as their primary goal. For instance, During Hitler’s government, Germany valued territorial expansion over security.\n⁶⁶ According to Andersen, balance of power is “a mechanism that ideally would make states intentionally or unintentionally join the weaker part against the strong, to equal out or balance the distribution of power amongst states in the international system” and states “would do this to assure their own survival”.\n⁶⁷ Hoffmann defines ‘state of war’ as “a competition of units in the kind of state of nature that knows no restrains other than those which the changing necessities of the game and the shallow convenience of the players impose”.\n⁶⁸ *Supra note* 65.\n⁶⁹ Korab-Karpowicz 2017. It is important to note that Wendt argues, through the lenses of Constructivism, that “self-help and power politics are institutions, and not essential features of anarchy. Anarchy is what states make of it”.\n⁷⁰ Waltz points out two reasons why international cooperation is limited by anarchy: insecurity and unequal gains. In an anarchic international system, states are not certain about each other’s intentions and they fear that cooperation might favour one state in detriment of the others, creating some kind of dependence. He argues that “[s]tates do not willingly place themselves in situations of increased dependence. In a self-help system, considerations of security subordinate economic gain to political interest” (*Supra note* 66, at 107).\n\n## 2.1 What is the security dilemma?\nAccording to Wheeler and Booth, the security dilemma is the quintessential dilemma in interstate politics⁷⁴. Coined by Herz (1950) and Butterfield (1951), the term has since become an integral part of any discourse on international security and has been expanded and employed to “address many of the most important questions of international relations theory and security policy”⁷⁵. Both authors describe the security dilemma as a situation where the increase of a state’s security simultaneously (and unintentionally) decreases the security of other states⁷⁶. The risk here is that misperceptions and conflict spirals dramatically increase the chances of unnecessary or avoidable armed conflicts.\nFor instance, a state might attempt to increase its own security and avert aggression by acquiring more weapons, bringing them to a higher state of readiness, or creating alliances. Under anarchy, an adversarial state will get the wrong impression about this behaviour, interpreting it as a preparatory action for future attacks. This state will thus fell threatened and will take action to enhance its own security. The first state will have confirmed its suspicions about its adversary’s belligerence, increasing tension and leading to an arms race or even war. In this scenario, conflict is not the product of the actual intentions and military capabilities of a specific actor. Rather, it is the result of mutual misperceptions and miscommunications that arise from the inability of states to understand each other’s intentions and motives with complete\n⁷¹ Jervis 1978, 167.\n⁷² Carlsnaes et al. 2002, 372; Montgomery 2006, 183.\n⁷³ Schweller 1996, 116. Note that, according to Mearsheimer, “the best way for a state to survive in anarchy is to take advantage of other states and gain power at their expenses” .\n⁷⁴ Supra note 65, at 29.\n⁷⁵ Glaser 1997, 172.\n⁷⁶ Jervis describes the security dilemma as a situation where “many of the means by which a state tries to increase its security decreases the security of others” (Supra note 71, at 169-70). Likewise, Glaser explains that the security dilemma exists when a “state’s effort to increase its security would have the unintended effect of reducing its adversary’s security” . Montgomery, on the other hand, sees the security dilemma as primarily an issue of perception; he describes it as “the situation where one state’s attempt to increase its security appear threatening to others and provoke an unnecessary conflict” .\nconfidence⁷⁷. In this sense, as Herz points out, “it is one of the tragic implications of the security dilemma that mutual fear of what initially may never have existed may subsequently bring about what is feared the most”⁷⁸. Note that this is a “fertile version” of the philosophical problem of Other Minds, that is, “how one mind can ever know what is in the mind of another”⁷⁹.\nThe difficulty in correctly perceiving other’s intentions is related to the fact that many of the methods by which a state attempts to enhance its security will certainly make other states feel less secure. Jervis notes that, at the domestic level, individuals can attempt to increase their safety in several ways without jeopardizing others; one can, for instance, put bars on the windows, move to a safer area, and avoid dark streets⁸⁰. At the international level, however, “one state’s gain in security often inadvertently threatens others”⁸¹. The Cold War is a prime example of this. Both the United States’ and the Soviet Union’s efforts to increase their security had the unintended consequence of decreasing the security of the other superpower⁸², leading to a spiral in which they accumulate more military capabilities without making themselves more secure⁸³.\nOn top of this, there is what Wheeler and Booth described as the “inherent ambiguity of weapons”⁸⁴. Since most weapons can be used for both defensive and offensive purposes, it is incredibly difficult for decision-makers to foresee with certainty when and how arms may be used by other states. On this topic, Jervis asserts that “[u]nless the requirement for offense and defence differ in kind or amount, a status quo power will desire a military posture that resembles that of an aggressor. For this reason, others cannot infer from its military forces and preparations whether the state is aggressive”⁸⁵. Armament, therefore, is the material reality that initiates the security dilemma⁸⁶.\n⁷⁷ Gunitskiy 2011, 595; Supra note 65, at 4. Mearsheimer argues that governments can never be sure of the intentions of other states and that “intentions are impossible to divine with 100 percent certainty”. He also highlights that “intentions can change quickly, so a state’s intentions can be benign one day and hostile the next. Uncertainty about intentions is unavoidable, which means that states can never be sure that other states do not have offensive intentions to go along with their offensive capabilities” (Supra note 74, 2001, at 31).\n⁷⁸ Herz 1959, 241.\n⁷⁹ Hollis and Smith 1990, 171-172.\n⁸⁰ Supra note 71, at 169-70.\n⁸¹ Ibid.\n⁸² Jervis 2017, xiii-xiv.\n⁸³ Tang 2009, 594. On this topic, Libicki explains that “[d]uring the Cold War, when deterrence was the only feasible response to threat posed by the other side’s nuclear weapons, any attempt to build more weapons of bring them to a higher state of readiness [...] would alarm the other side who would feel impelled to do likewise” .\n⁸⁴ Supra note 65, at 4.\n⁸⁵ Supra note 83, at 64. Therefore, even benign, security-seeking actors can be dragged into an arms race.\n⁸⁶ Supra note 65, at 1.\n\nCertainly, Herz’s and Butterfield’s original formulations of the security dilemma were an interesting development from the realist school of thought⁹². In its classical form, however, the concept may be of limited use in analysing the modern international system, which has a well-establish legal framework regulating the use of force, and in which most states are no longer threatened whether by war or external aggression⁹³. But this does not mean that the security dilemma is irrelevant or even obsolete for international security studies. On the contrary, it remains an extremely important tool for both policymakers and scholars since it can and has been reconceptualized to address modern challenges, including cyber-security ones.\n⁸⁷ Supra note 83, at 66.\n⁸⁸ Supra note 74, at 117.\n⁸⁹ Supra note 75, at 31. “If the threat posed by one state to another [...] is accurately perceived [...] then the situation cannot be classified as a security ‘dilemma’. It is simply a security ‘problem’, albeit perhaps a difficult one”.\n⁹⁰ Supra note 74, at 117. This argument generates an obvious puzzle, however: how can one know if threats are real or just apparent?\n⁹¹ Supra note 65.\n⁹² Note that realism is hardly the only school of thought to use the concept. The security dilemma has been broadly employed by liberals (see Doyle 1983; Oneal and Russett 1999; Cederman 2001), neoliberals (see Axelrod and Keohane 1985), constructivists (see Wendt 1995), to name a few.\n⁹³ Bluth 2011, 1375.\n# Chapter 3 – The Attribution Problem One threshold issue in discussing cyber-attribution involves the definition of attribution itself, a question that certainly pervades all literature about this topic. At the most general level, ‘attribution’ refers to the identification of the responsible entity for a malicious cyberattack⁹⁴. What is understood by ‘responsible entity’, however, can vary. There are usually three types of answers: the specific computing device used to carry out an attack, the individual pressing the keys that launch an attack, and ultimately the party that supervised and controlled the attack⁹⁵. According to Lin, even though “these three types of attribution are conceptually distinct, they are often related in practice”⁹⁶. Particularly, identifying the machine from which an attack was launched might provide some clues that can assist unveil the human attacker’s identity, which in turn can help determine the individual or entity responsible for authorizing or acquiescing the cyber operation. Still, each of these types offer different challenges, increasing the difficulty of the attribution process.\nAlthough attributing cyberattacks is not a new challenge⁹⁷, the attribution debate is developing “surprisingly slowly”⁹⁸. Scholars and experts have been dwelling upon the subject and hold a full spectrum of views on it. At the positive end of the spectrum are those, like Rid and Buchanan, who argue that cyber-attribution is not only possible, but “it has been happening successfully for a long time”⁹⁹. Lindsay strikes a more restrained yet positive note, by characterizing attribution as difficult, but acknowledging that there are strong systems for identifying the source of intrusions and responding to attacks, with an increasingly amount of investments being devoted to investigations¹⁰⁰. At the other end of the spectrum, Singer and Friedman characterize attribution as “[p]erhaps the most difficult problem” in cyberspace¹⁰¹, and Eun and Aßmann argue that “determining the real aggressor is impossible unless the aggressor admits to it”¹⁰². Shackelford further echoes this idea by affirming that sophisticated cyberattacks are “nearly impossible to trace to their sources”¹⁰³.\n--- ⁹⁴ Ibid., 5.\n⁹⁵ Lin 2016, 5.\n⁹⁶ Ibid., 13.\n⁹⁷ Supra note 12, at 955.\n⁹⁸ Supra note 33, at 5.\n⁹⁹ Ibid., 31.\n¹⁰⁰ Supra note 36.\n¹⁰¹ Supra note 48, at 73.\n¹⁰² Eun and Aßmann 2016, 355.\n¹⁰³ Shackelford 2010, 200. Brecher share the same idea that cyberattacks “can be nearly impossible to attribute definitively to their sources”.\n3.1 Why is attribution so difficult?\nThere are a number of answers to this question. First, many academics and experts suggest that the difficulty in attributing blame for cyberattacks is mainly due to the intrinsic characteristics of the cyber domain¹⁰⁴. The structural anonymity, which has been one of the hallmarks and biggest strengths of the Internet, provides the perfect venue for state and non-state actors to undertake malicious operations without fearing attribution or retaliation. The Internet, as Lindsay points out, “was designed to make connections easy and reliable even when the true identity of the connector and the path of the connection were unknown; security did not figure strongly in its early design”¹⁰⁵. Lupovici, however, seems to disagree on the premise that cyberspace is an inherently anonymous domain. Even though he recognizes that some aspects of the Internet make harder to attribute an attack, he argues that anonymity is a socially attributed trait and, therefore, cyberspace could be structured in a way that does not uphold this characteristic¹⁰⁶. Along this line of thinking, McConnell suggests that the only solution for the attribution problem is redesigning the Internet so that attribution and geolocation are more feasible¹⁰⁷. Such a change, however, would be a massive undertaking and probably would not help to prevent the increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks that are being launched today¹⁰⁸. At the same time, reengineering the entire computer network would reduce its efficiency and dependability, and would bring into question characteristics of the current Internet, such as freedom of action and privacy, that are treasured by many, including intelligence agencies¹⁰⁹.\nSecond, cyber-attribution is further complicated by the fact that hackers have at their disposal a variety of programs, techniques and applications to conceal the identity of their own Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and thus to thwart detection. One common practice that attackers employ to hide their online trail is to break into poorly secured internet servers or even personal computers and use them as proxies through which they can launch a cyberattack¹¹⁰.\n¹⁰⁴ Lupovic 2016, 322; Supra note 25, at 387.\n¹⁰⁵ Lindsay 2013, 375-76.\n¹⁰⁶ Supra note 74, at 330. Lupovici further argues that the current assumption that anonymity is inherent to the cyber domain might affect states’ policies. “Defenders, discouraged from relying on cyber deterrence, may refuse to invest in efforts to establish it. This will decrease the efficiency of cyber deterrence and, as a result, reinforce the existing common knowledge that this strategy is doomed to fail”. (Supra note 104, at 331).\n¹⁰⁷ McConnell 2010.\n¹⁰⁸ Supra note 10, at 3. For instance, Rid argues that McConnell suggestion “is not only unrealistic, it would not even solve the problem at hand”. For Tran, “even if the Internet could arduously be redesigned to authenticate the source IP address of every bit of data sent over the Internet, these addresses would accomplish the goal of merely identifying the source machine of an attack, and not a person, thereby creating another degree of attenuation between an attack and the attacker”.\n¹⁰⁹ Ibid.\n¹¹⁰ Greenemeier 2011.\"The IP address therefore does not present the attacked state with a physical location to blame or even attack in response. The discovered server could be located in a neutral, friendly or even your own country\"¹¹¹. According to Lipson,\"an IP address is a poor surrogate on which to establish a basis for trustworthiness\"¹¹². The cyberattacks that hit Estonia, for instance, originated from at least 177 countries, such as the United States, Russia, Peru, Egypt, and Estonian itself¹¹³. As Brenner effectively observed,\"the Internet is one big masquerade ball. You can hide behind aliases, you can hide behind proxy servers, and you can surreptitiously enslave other computers without their owners' knowledge – and then use their computers to do your dirty work\"¹¹⁴. Another prime example of a technology available to obfuscate one's traces in cyberspace is the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) Marble Framework, which is capable of altering the language of the code from English to another foreign language, such as Chinese, Russian, Korean, Arabic and Farsi¹¹⁵.\nIn this regard, Dinstein argues that future technological improvements will probably overcome the challenges that prevent cyber-attribution¹¹⁶. Indeed, governments are more capable of attributing responsibility for cyberattacks than they were a decade ago, and these technological advancements and innovations have boosted states' confidence¹¹⁷. For example, in 2014, Canada indicated to possess robust systems in place that allow the detection of highly sophisticated attacks, even those launched by state-sponsored actors¹¹⁸ and, in 2015, the United Kingdom's Chancellor affirmed that\"we are increasingly confident in our ability to determine from where attacks come\"¹¹⁹. It is important to bear in mind, however, that the technical realm is so\"dynamic\"that new technologies both enhance and hinder states' ability to attribute malicious attacks¹²⁰, generating\"a cycle of escalating offensive and defensive capabilities\"¹²¹.\nThird, even if it is possible to overcome all the technological issues mentioned above and identify the machine used to carry out a cyberoperation with sufficient certainty, cyber- ¹¹¹ Supra note 102.\n¹¹² Lipson 2002, 56.\n¹¹³ Roscini 2010, 97; Supra note 28.\n¹¹⁴ Brenner 2011, 13.\n¹¹⁵ Mueller et al. 2019, 110; Leyden 2017.\n¹¹⁶ Dinstein 2002, 112. Similarly, Roscini argues that\"further developments in computer technology and Internet regulations might also make it easier to identify the source of the cyberattack\"¹¹⁷ Supra note 42, at 23 ¹¹⁸ Canada, Statement by the Chief Information Officer for the Government of Canada (July 29, 2014).\n¹¹⁹ United Kingdom, Chancellor's speech to GCHQ on cybersecurity (November 17, 2015).\n¹²⁰ Supra note 33, 1510.\n¹²¹ The improvements in technical attribution might be matched over time by developments in attackers' abilities to conceal their identities, and this\"cat-and-mouse game\"will continue to cyber-attribution difficult. Supra note 93, at 9.\nattribution remains challenging due to what has been called the “human machine gap”¹²² or “entry-point anonymity”¹²³. That is to say, attribution can only be accomplished if the individual or organization who was operating the computing device can also be identified. With this in mind, it should be noted that rarely does the location of a computer provide precise conclusions vis-à-vis the machine operator’s identity¹²⁴. Therefore, knowing that a cyberattack was executed on the territory of a state, or from the governmental cyber framework of a state, is not enough to attribute said attack to that state¹²⁵.\nFourth, it may be quite difficult to determine the ultimately responsible entity as far as state responsibility is concerned. Even if it is possible to overcome all the technological challenges and identify the human attacker, there remains the question of whether or not there is a relationship between the individual pressing the keys and the state actor. Is the attacker an officially sanctioned government agent? Or is it a third party operating on their own? Deibert, Rohozinski, and Crete-Nishihata acknowledge that there is an increasing tendency towards privateering cyberattacks, and states are particularly interested in this market since it “allows them to execute their missions once removed and clandestinely, thus offering plausible deniability and avoiding responsibilities under international law or the laws of armed conflict”¹²⁶.\nMoving to the legal aspect of attribution, a state will only be held responsible for an internationally wrongful action that is attributable to the state under public international law or that constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the state¹²⁷. On this point, it is important to note that, traditionally, there has been an extremely high bar for establishing state responsibility for acts of non-state actors¹²⁸. Drawing from the International Law Commission’s (ILC) Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, a state can be held liable for the conduct of a non-state actor if the latter is “acting on the instruction of, or under the direction or control of” the state¹²⁹. Note that, sadly, the concepts of ‘instructions’, ¹²² Geiß and Lahmann 2009, 625 ¹²³ Supra note 111.\n¹²⁴ Supra note 120.\n¹²⁵ Supra note 55, at 646.\n¹²⁶ Deibert, Rohozinski, and Crete-Nishihata 2012, 17.\n¹²⁷ International Law Commission, Draft Articles of Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, November 2001, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), art. 2. It is important to note that the ILC’s rules are not a treaty and therefore they are not binding on any state. Yet, these rules were commended by the UN General Assembly in 2012 (UN Doc. A/RES/56/83) and have been mentioned 154 times by international courts, tribunals, and other bodies. (United Nations Legislative Series, Materials on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, 2012, ST/LEG/SER.B/25, viii).\n¹²⁸ Supra note 31, at 204.\n¹²⁹ Ibid., art. 8.\n'direct', and 'control' all need further explanation¹³⁰. According to the commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility, 'instruction' comprises private individuals or groups acting as an auxiliary of the state¹³¹. More problematic issues, however, arise in determining the concepts of 'direction' and 'control', for the commentary falls short and does not explain the difference between both of them. Rather, it only says that the terms are\"disjunctive\"¹³². International tribunals have also failed to make a distinction between the three concepts with any level of detail. Therefore, as Schmitt put it,\"the prevailing approach tends towards a binary distinction in which either a state tells a non-state actor to perform an act (instruction or direction) or the state exercises 'effective control' over the non-state actor with respect to the act in question\"¹³³.\nThe effective control test was coined by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in its Nicaragua v. United States of America judgement¹³⁴. Even though the Court does not provide a definition for the expression, it has asserted that a state's participation in the form of\"financing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping\"the non-state actor does not rise to the degree of effective control¹³⁵. In this sense, for example, supplying malware to a terrorist group would not result in state responsibility. In fact, even if the state plans the whole operation and selects the military targets, it still would not be enough to result in attribution¹³⁶. Furthermore, taking into considerations the technical challenges aforementioned, determining that a hacker was under the effective control of a nation-state at relevant time is probably impossible¹³⁷. For instance, the 2007 cyberattacks targeting Estonia were partially attributed to the pro-Kremlin youth group Nashi, but it is not clear whether Russia was involved in the incident¹³⁸.\nIn Prosecutor v. Tadic, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) lowered the threshold by adopting the much less restrictive overall control test, which ¹³⁰ Schmitt 2017b, 9.\n¹³¹ International Law Commission, Draft Article of Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with Commentaries, November 2001, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), art. 8, para. 2.\n¹³² Ibid., para. 7.\n¹³³ Supra note 99.\n¹³⁴ International Court of Justice, Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, 27 June 1986, para. 115.\n¹³⁵ Ibid.\n¹³⁶ Ibid.\n¹³⁷ Supra note 29, at 563.\n¹³⁸ Supra note 9, at 23-24. On this topic, Schmitt and Vihul note that care should be taken when assuming state sponsorship of non-state cyberoperations because non-state actors can launch cyberattacks at a\"fairly low cost and without access to the technical wherewithal of states\".\n\nRegardless of whether effective control or overall control ultimately suits the cyber domain, the attribution bar continues to be extremely high. As a result, states are prevented from adopting any lawful response to a cyberattack, including their inherent right to self-defence, encouraging retaliatory operations outside the existing legal structure¹⁴¹. Against this background, some scholars have suggested that one possible solution to these legal challenges is to lower the attribution standard. Schmitt, for instance, defended an indirect responsibility approach by which a state might be held responsible for the consequences of non-state actors’ unlawful operations on its territory “when it fails to take reasonably available measures to stop such acts in breach of its obligations to other states”¹⁴². Lowering the attribution bar, however, increases the chances of misattribution and conflict escalation.\nFifth, another factor that contributes to the difficulty of attributing cyberattacks is the presence of dynamic and sophisticated non-state actors. Traditionally, states and non-state actors were distinguished by significant imbalances not only in legal status, but also in resources and capabilities. The cyber domain, however, seems to offer great opportunities for non-state actors to challenge and, in some situations, to overcome states’ hegemony¹⁴³. Indeed, today these entities need as much or more attention than other international player due to their ability to profoundly disturb international peace and security. Nevertheless, these actors “enjoy a relative degree of impunity” for the harmful effects of their actions¹⁴⁴ since international law does not offer a tailored framework based on which non-state actors can be held responsible for unlawful acts¹⁴⁵. In this sense, an adequate legal response to the attribution problem should ¹³⁹ United Nations, International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, *Prosecutor v. Dusko Tadic*, Case no.

The investigation of cyberattacks is a complex process that requires detailed analysis of technical data, as well as a deep comprehension of political and economic motivations. Consequently, as Sheldon points out, “the forensics of attribution can rarely, if ever, give immediate results and can take days if not weeks to provide solid technical evidence”. Further, former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defence William Lynn III recognized the struggle to attribute cyberattacks, observing that “[t]he forensic work necessary to identify an attacker may take months, if identification is possible at all”. Cyber-attribution, however, is nearly useless if it takes too long and is not able to identify all the actors involved in the attack.\nThese are the numerous hurdles, both technological and legal, that have been oft-mentioned as a hindrance to the development of an effective legal framework for governing cyberattacks. In spite of the fact that previous literature on cybersecurity perceived the attribution problem as an insurmountable technical issue, recent scholars and experts have begun to acknowledge that actual attribution might not be rocket science after all. As Carlin aptly put it, “although attribution is difficult, it is far from impossible”.\n## 3.2 Why does cyber-attribution matter?\nConsidering the number of obstacles that significantly limit cyber-attribution, one is then left to question whether or not the matter is worth international society’s attention. What are the purposes of attributing blame for a cyberattack? Why should states and international stakeholders endeavour to solve the attribution problem?\n Supra note 13, at 956.\n Supra note 3, at 2.\n Sheldon 2014, 289-90 Lynn III 2010, 99.\n Carlin 2016, 409. The duration of the investigation is relevant for cyber-attribution because if a targeted state takes too long to respond, any countermeasures adopted may be seen as punishment, forbidden under public international law. On the other hand, if a targeted state engages in countermeasures too early and has wrongfully attributed the cyberattack, it will have committed an internationally wrongful act itself.\n According to Shackelford, “the international law doctrine of attribution is in fact an essential ground for regulating cyberattacks”.\n “Actual attribution of cyber events is already more nuanced, more common, and more political than the literature has acknowledged so far” (Supra note 62).\n Supra note 119.\nTo start with, cyber-attribution function goes well beyond the mere identification of the responsible entity for a malicious cyberattack; it also serves as a legitimizing tool to justify both formal and informal sanctioning behaviour to other international actors¹⁵⁴. According to Article 22 of the ILC’s Draft Articles on State Responsibility, a state that has been the target of an internationally wrongful act may adopt countermeasures¹⁵⁵ – actions that would otherwise be unlawful¹⁵⁶. In order to do so, the victim state must identify the state actor which is responsible for the internationally wrongful act¹⁵⁷. Eichensehr argues that “[s]uch an attribution could be done privately, but if so, the victim state would risk other states viewing its countermeasures as an initial wrongful act, rather than a lawful response”¹⁵⁸. Tran adds to the discussion by explaining that even in situations where formal law is not the answer, states would still be required to attribute responsibility in order to implement any informal method of sanctioning the attacker¹⁵⁹. Thus, attribution is a crucial and necessary prerequisite to any further legal action, be it countermeasures, diplomatic responses or any other informal kind of response. Consequently, it is not unreasonable to assume that solving the attribution problem is the pivotal first step to establish any functioning system of law that regulates cyberattacks.\nAdditionally, publicly attributing the blame for a cyberattack, and consequently sharing specific aspects of it, may help network defenders identify possible vulnerabilities in the system and, thus, prevent future attacks¹⁶⁰. It is often cited that, in some cases, attribution may also lead to macro-level deterrence. By identifying the culprits of a cyberattack, states are able to publicly name and shame them. Potentially, this practice will cause the named actor, and even third parties, to refrain from future operations¹⁶¹. For instance, in 2014, the USA criminally charged five Chinese military hackers for cyberespionage against U.S. corporations and “[f]or a period of time following the indictments, there was a very significant decrease” in Chinese ¹⁵⁴ Supra note 25, 386.\n¹⁵⁵ “The wrongfulness of an act of a State not in conformity with an international obligation towards another State is precluded if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State” (Supra note 96, art. 22).\n¹⁵⁶ According to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, “countermeasures are actions or omissions by an injured State directed against a responsible State that would violate an obligation owed by the former to the latter” (Supra note 15, 111, rule 20 (1)). Note that countermeasures cannot be taken by non-state actors since they are reserved to states. Similarly, such measures cannot be taken against non-state actors, except when their (cyber) actions are attributable to a state actor. “This is because only states commit, as a matter of law, internationally wrongful acts” (Supra note 7, at 606). Also, Banks argues that countermeasures were created to compel a state to desist in its unlawful actions, not as punishment (Supra note 33, at 1502).\n¹⁵⁷ Supra note 96, art. 49.\n¹⁵⁸ Supra note 63, at 29.\n¹⁵⁹ Supra note 25, at 383-84.\n¹⁶⁰ Supra note 3, at 3.\n¹⁶¹ Supra note 63, at 25 cyberactivity¹⁶². Furthermore, publicly attributing responsibility for cyberattacks might create micro-level deterrence, which is related with the adoption of domestic legal procedures and economic sanctions¹⁶³. According to Goldsmith and Williams, the costs of these measures “are not nothing; would-be state-sponsored cyber-intruders and their principals surely take them into account”¹⁶⁴. Micro-level deterrence, therefore, could be more successful than its macro-level counterpart¹⁶⁵. According to Finnemore and Hollis, publicly attributing cyberattacks promote “interactions between the accuser, the accused, and third-party audiences that – over time – may result in the creation of a new norm”¹⁶⁶. Note, however, that public attribution alone may not be sufficient to deter malicious cyberactivity or produce cyber accountability, particularly if the responsible actor does not care if his/her identity and behaviour are made public.\nFrom an international relations perspective, states and international stakeholders should care about the attribution problem due to its capacity to deteriorate the international political environment. As noted earlier, attributing blame for a cyberattack is no easy task and thus the chances of a malicious cyber operation being framed wrongfully is extremely high. Indeed, misattribution is substantially more likely vis-à-vis cyberattacks than traditional kinetic warfare¹⁶⁷. With this in mind, one should be cognizant that there is a tendency to explain malicious cyber incidents in terms of geopolitical conditions and existing rivalries¹⁶⁸, particularly soon after a cyberattack when there is a haste to identify the culprits, to strengthen defences and to retaliate. The 2007 Estonian cyberattack provides one of the clearest examples of this tendency. Due to past Russian actions and the political atmosphere at the time, the attack was attributed to Russia and this explanation was later questioned by cyber experts. A yet more recently example is the 2015 Ukraine power grid cyberattack. Ukraine’s intelligence community was quick to blame Russia for the attack because it was perceived as an escalation of the conflict ¹⁶² Nakashima 2015.\n¹⁶³ To build upon the previous example, in addition to the criminal charges, the Chinese hackers cannot travel to the United States or other country with which it has extradition treaty; if they do, they could be extradited to the USA and face trial. Nor can they engage in financial transactions that touches the U.S. or other sanctioning state financial system.\n¹⁶⁴ Goldsmith and Williams 2018.\n¹⁶⁵ Nevertheless, Eichensehr explains that the effectiveness of micro-level deterrence might vary according to the nationality of the hackers (“losing the ability to travel or to store money in Western Europe may be less of a blow to North Korean hackers than to Russians”), and depends on the level of coercion to which the cyber-attackers are subject (“[i]f their actions on behalf of their government are not voluntary, then the hackers will not alter their behaviour in response”) (Supra note 63, at 27).\n¹⁶⁶ Finnemore and Hollis 2019, 10-11.\n¹⁶⁷ Supra note 29, at 556 ¹⁶⁸ Supra note 13, at 960. Besides heightening the risk of misattribution, this tendency to blame the most obvious culprits prevents alternative explanations from being developed, as well as invites lesser rivals or non-state actors to provoke hostilities. Schulzke argues that “[a]s the risk of being caught diminishes, the costs of attack decrease and the potential benefits become even more attractive” (Supra note 13, at 961).\n\nIt is perhaps useful to underline that the most active participants in the cyber domain are also some of the world’s most powerful states, to wit: The United States, Russia and China. Taking into account that each of these states are equipped with a nuclear armoury, misattributing a cyberattacks could trigger off destructive conflicts with potential to threat the whole international system, putting a premium on a confident degree of cyber-attribution¹⁷⁰. On top of this, the relative availability and fairly low cost of the technology necessary to launch an attack¹⁷¹ in cyberspace “leaves the potential for mass destruction within the grasp of far less sophisticated non-state actors and organizations”¹⁷². So, it does not take much imagination to see the potential threats an unregulated cyber domain pose to international security, economy and also to states’ infrastructure.\nIn this regard, inspired by great theorists such as Thomas Schelling, Robert Jervis, and John Herz, among others, Buchanan took the basic foundation of the security dilemma theory and employed it to cyberspace. A ‘cybersecurity dilemma’ is said to exist when one country cannot increase the security of its digital infrastructure, either through the creation of offensive cyber capabilities, without decreasing other’s cybersecurity. According to Buchanan, the cybersecurity dilemma can be potentially more dangerous and escalatory than traditional kinetic conflicts because, in cyber domain, there is a “perception of offense-dominance”¹⁷³, making defensive measures to be perceived as offensive and threatening. With this in mind, cyberspace appears to be the perfect environment for the security dilemma to thrive. The lack of clarity vis-à-vis the intentions and capabilities of cyber warfare, therefore, have the potential to undermine trust¹⁷⁴, rise escalation fears, provoke an arms race or even an international armed conflict¹⁷⁵. “As cyberoperations become more potent and computer networks grow still more important, the dilemma’s dangers – already real – will only grow”¹⁷⁶.\n¹⁶⁹ Zetter 2016.\n¹⁷⁰ Supra note 39, at 192.\n¹⁷¹ Supra note 107, at 55.\n¹⁷² Payne 2016, 684-85.\n¹⁷³ Buchanan 2017, 108-09.\n¹⁷⁴ Ibid., 191.\n¹⁷⁵ Jinghua 2019.\n¹⁷⁶ Ibid., 194.\nIt is well settled that cyberspace is a phenomenon of international relevance. As a result, the uses and abuses of this borderless virtual domain encroach on states concerns in the physical world, such as national security, economic development and public order and safety. Cybersecurity, like other global challenges faced by the existing international community, extends far beyond the domain of a single state and, therefore, cannot be appropriately addressed by any single international actor, regardless of how influential it might be. Given the increasing costs of insecurity and uncertainty associated with an unregulated cyberspace, international actors may soon come to realize the necessity of an international legal framework capable of addressing cyberattacks.\n\nIn spite of the fact that the principal building blocks of the World Wide Web were laid more than two decades ago, the community of states was not able to reach a broad international agreement on how to govern the cyber domain. In fact, some scholars even suggest that cyberspace seems “resistant to codification of the applicable rules in a comprehensive multilateral binding treaty”¹⁷⁷. Note, however, that the dearth of cyber-specific regulations is not for lack of trying by major international actors. Already in 1996, the French government pushed for the creation of the Charter for International Cooperation on the Internet, which would be “an accord comparable to the international law of the sea”¹⁷⁸. The proposal, however, was met with apathy by other international stakeholders.\nAfterwards, in January 2002, the UN General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to settle a group of governmental experts to conduct a study on “relevant international concepts aimed at strengthening the security of global information and telecommunications systems”¹⁷⁹. The United Nations’ Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications thus became the leading state-based initiative for the codification of international law vis-à-vis the cyber domain¹⁸⁰, but its success was limited. Between 2004 and 2015, the GGE submitted three reports which expressed the unanimous opinion of the state-participants¹⁸¹.\nThe 2010 report was welcomed with great enthusiasm by the international community even though it brought an array of “very rudimentary findings and recommendations”¹⁸² and did not present much legal clarity. However, it highlighted that state actors are developing ICTs --- ¹⁷⁷ Supra note 43.\n¹⁷⁸ Wu 1997, 660.\n¹⁷⁹ United Nations General Assembly, Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security, A/RES/56/19, 7 January 2002.\n¹⁸⁰ Supra note 55, at 647. Another worthwhile example of a state-based initiative is the Code of Conduct for Information Security, put forward by China, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The proposal was submitted to the UN General Assembly twice, in 2011 and 2015, but it was not met with enthusiasm by the international community. Note that the 2015 proposal was also co-sponsored by Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.

More substantially, it recognized that “[i]nternational law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment”¹⁸⁵. The Group also claimed that the principles of sovereignty and state responsibility apply to cyberspace¹⁸⁶. Note that, in order to guarantee unanimity, a draft provision supporting the applicability of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) was excluded from the report¹⁸⁷. Even so, many states have publicly endorsed the application of the laws of armed conflict to the cyber domain. The USA, for instance, is of the view that “[l]ong-standing international norms guiding state behaviour – in times of peace and conflict – also apply in cyberspace”¹⁸⁸. Similarly, Japan stated that “existing international law, including the UN Charter and international humanitarian law, naturally applies to acts in cyberspace”¹⁸⁹.\nFinally, despite the absence of several important issues and the difficulty in reaching consensus, the 2015 report was considered a “breakthrough”¹⁹⁰. It explicitly mentioned the General Assembly resolutions on the right to privacy in the digital age¹⁹¹ and noted the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction¹⁹², but it did not specifically affirm that IHL applies to activities in the cyber environment. The GGE further suggested that “[v]oluntary, non-binding norms of responsible State behaviour” may prevent conflict in cyberspace ¹⁸³ United Nations General Assembly, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunication in the Context of International Security, UN Doc.

On the other end of the spectrum, the USA, France and the United Kingdom share the position that, under public international law, there is no evidentiary requirement for making accusations. In this regard, U.S. State Department Legal Adviser Brian J. Egan stated that: [D]espite the suggestion by some States to the contrary, there is no international legal obligation to reveal evidence on which attribution is based prior to taking appropriate action. There may, of course, be political pressure to do so, and States may choose to reveal such evidence to convince other States to join them in condemnation, for example. But that is a policy choice – it is not compelled by international law¹⁹⁷.\nThis position was reiterated by the U.K. former Attorney General Jeremy Wright, who explained that “[t]here is no legal obligation requiring a state to publicly disclose the underlying information on which its decision to attribute hostile activity is based”¹⁹⁸. More recently, France echoed the same opinion¹⁹⁹.\nIn 2017, the GGE was supposed to submit another report to the UN General Assembly, but the experts failed to reach consensus due to disagreements over controversial areas of international law, such as the right of self-defence, countermeasures, and IHL. According to Herinksen, the collapse of the UN GGE initiative was “fairly predictable”²⁰⁰ because the debate vis-à-vis the regulation of cyberspace is “as much about strategy, politics and ideological ¹⁹³ Ibid., para. 10.\n¹⁹⁴ Ibid., para. 28(f).\n¹⁹⁵ Supra note 63, at 19.\n¹⁹⁶ For instance, they formally presented a draft UN General Assembly resolution in 2018, asserting that “[s]tates should note that accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated”.

The Group held promise for the clarification of cyber-related customary international law, but it left the global community with an unresolved legal conundrum in which opinions appear to be diverging and solidifying instead of converging²⁰². Yet, the GGE reports were a welcomed first step for the discussion on international cyber norms and remain extremely relevant²⁰³.\nOne encouraging conclusion is that, in spite of the lack of a specific legal framework, cyberspace is certainly not a lawless domain beyond the control of public international law. As it has been pointed out, it is well settled that general principles and rules of international law also apply to cyber operations²⁰⁴. Indeed, if international law is to be an effective governance arrangement, it should be flexible to new situations without the necessity to recreate a whole set of rules on each occasion²⁰⁵. The development of nuclear weapons is a prime example of this. When the UN Charter was being elaborated, its “framers could not be aware of the threat of nuclear weapons”²⁰⁶ and therefore the legal instrument did not include this type of armament in its provisions regarding the use of force. Yet, decades later, the ICJ provided an advisory opinion arguing that Articles 2(4) and 51 of the UN Charter, concerning the prohibition of the use of force and self-defence respectively, apply to “any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed”²⁰⁷. By this logic, the body of international law that governs the use of force should apply to cyber activities, too²⁰⁸. Despite these advances, however, many underlying questions remain virtually unanswered. Perhaps most importantly, how are international legal norms supposed to apply to the complex cyber domain?²⁰⁹ ²⁰¹ Ibid.\n²⁰² Korzak 2017.\n²⁰³ Supra note 55, at 648.\n²⁰⁴ According to Henriksen, the 2013 UN GGE report “reflected an emerging consensus that cyberspace is subject to the same general principles of international law that governs the more physical domains”. The remaining question, therefore, is which international law?\n²⁰⁵ Supra note 42, at 9. On this point, the United States claims that “[t]he development of norms for state conduct in cyberspace does not require a reinvention of customary international law, nor does it render existing international norms obsolete” (United States of America, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World, May 2011, 9).\n²⁰⁶ International Court of Justice, Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict (Request for Advisory Opinion Submitted by the World Health Organization) and Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Request for Advisory Opinion Submitted by the General Assembly of the United Nations), CR 95/25, 1995, para. 46.\n²⁰⁷ International Court of Justice, Reports of Judgements, Advisory Opinions and Orders, Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, para. 39.\n²⁰⁸ “[T]he mere fact that a computer (rather than a more traditional weapon, weapon system, or platform) is used during an operation has no bearing on whether that operation amounts to a ‘use of force’”.

Given this gloomy picture, scholars, cyber-experts, and international stakeholders have been attempting to fill the normative void with their views on how international law applies to the cyber domain. Note that these non-state-driven initiatives were only possible because of the “power vacuum” created by states’ reluctance to undertake the international law-making process²²³.

This subject, however, warrant a more extended discussion than I can here give it. In this sense, this study focuses on the two leading non-state-driven initiatives that epitomize the phenomenon described above: the Tallinn Manual Project and Microsoft’s proposals.\nThe first non-state initiative that tried to address cyberattacks and increase international cybersecurity was the Tallinn Project, which brought together an international group of independent experts led by Professor Michael Schmitt. The project published two editions of the Manual, respectively in 2013²²⁶ and 2017²²⁷, under the auspices of the NATO CCD COE. Their texts, however, must not be seen as representing the views of NATO or sponsoring nations. Rather, the Manuals should be understood as a reflexion of the views of the experts, all acting in their own private capacity²²⁸. It should be noted that this project is neither an international treaty on cyber law nor does it set forth *lex ferenda*, but it is a restatement of international law as it is – *lex lata*²²⁹.\nThe 2013 edition, entitled the *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, pays particular attention to cyber activities that occur above the level of use of force and encompasses purported rules of customary international law, the larger part of which related to the *jus ad bellum* (the law governing the use of force)²³⁰ and the *jus in bello* (the law ²²⁴ Finnemore and Hollis 2016, 446; According to Finnemore and Sikkink, norm entrepreneurs are “agents having strong notions about appropriate or desirable behaviour in their community”. Henry Dunant, the founder of the International Committee of the Red Cross, is a prime example of norm entrepreneurship.\n²²⁵ For instance, Chernenko et al. recommend the creation of an “independent, international cyber court or arbitrage method that deals only with government-level cyber conflicts”. RAND’s *Stateless Attribution* report, on the other hand, suggests an international organization for cyber-attribution, the *Global Cyber Attribution Consortium*, which would involve “a broad team of international experts to conduct independent investigations of major cyber incidents for the purpose of attribution” and would operate “without standing state participation” (*Supra* note 3, at 27-31).\n²²⁶ *Supra* note 178.\n²²⁷ Ibid.\n²²⁸ Tallinn Manual, 23; Tallinn Manual 2.0, 2.\n²²⁹ Tallinn Manual, 19; Tallinn Manual 2.0, 3.\n²³⁰ Tallinn Manual, rules 10-19.\nof armed conflict)²³¹. The Manual was considered to be a “remarkable achievement”²³² and, according to Banks, provided “much-needed confidence for states that international law applies in the cyber domain”²³³. Early reviews, nevertheless, criticized the project’s emphasis on cyber operations that amount to use of force since, in reality, the majority of, if not all, cyber activities fall below the use of force threshold²³⁴. Another major criticism of the Tallinn Manual is the dearth of geographic diversity among the group of experts, all of whom hail from Western Europe, Australia, and the USA. Consequently, the impartiality of the project is challenged, hindering its acceptability and application by states outside the Global North. China, for instance, has been very critical of the whole Tallinn initiative since it seems to be a North American attempt to “maintain US dominance in the information age”²³⁵. As noted by Eichensehr, the Manual is “channelling, even though not officially representing, a particular worldview with respect to the laws of armed conflict”²³⁶.\nIn the 2013 Tallinn Manual, no effort was made to establish legal criteria for attributing blame for cyberattacks²³⁷ and attribution is addressed as a problem, instead of “a realistic task having technical, political and legal aspects”²³⁸. Still, some provisions may shed light on the attribution problem. For example, Rule 5 asserts that “a state shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States”²³⁹. Note that this provision restates in cyber terms the principle put forward in the ICJ’s Corfu Channel Judgement²⁴⁰. The experts were able to reach consensus on the scope of application of Rule 5²⁴¹, but they could ²³¹ Tallinn Manual, rules 20-95.\n²³² Ingber 2017, 1531.\n²³³ Supra note 33, at 1494.\n²³⁴ Supra note 42, at 16. On this topic, Xinmin explains that the majority of cyberattacks are perpetrated by non-state actors, which are generally seen as cybercrime or infringement of cyber rights that should be governed by domestic criminal law or the law of torts. Also, she points that “[e]ven if some of these attacks are conducted by states or may be attributable to states, most of them fall far below the threshold of ‘threat of use of force’ or ‘armed attack’. Instead, they are only cyber-attacks of minimal levels of intensity, which are comparable to other internationally wrongful acts such as interference with internal affairs of other states”.\n²³⁵ Supra note 152, at 4.\n²³⁶ Eichensehr 2014, 588.\n²³⁷ Fleck 2013, 338.\n²³⁸ Ibid., 334-35.\n²³⁹ It is important to point out that this rule has since been included in the 2015 UN GGE report: “[s]tates should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs” (Supra note 161, para. 13 (c)).\n²⁴⁰ “Such obligations are based [...] on certain general and well-recognized principles, namely: [...] every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”. International Court of Justice, The Corfu Channel Case, Merits, 9 April 1949, 22.\n²⁴¹ “As to scope of application, this Rule covers all acts that are unlawful and that have detrimental effects on another state. (Tallinn Manual, Rule 5, para. 5, 33).\n\nOther noteworthy provision in the Manual is Rule 6, which affirms that “a State bears international legal responsibility for a cyber operation attributable to it and which constitutes a breach of an international obligation”. In this regard, the experts agreed that, in specific circumstances, the acts of non-state actors might be attributable to a state and therefore cause that state’s international legal responsibility. The non-state actor, however, must be either acting “on the instructions of” or “under the direction or control” of that state.\nIn 2017, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations was published, expanding considerably the scope of the project. Now, it also includes the analysis of the international legal framework that applies to malicious cyberattacks that do not meet the use of force threshold. Furthermore, the new Manual addresses peacetime legal regimes, such as state responsibility, human rights law, and the laws of space, air, and the sea. On the whole, the Tallinn 2.0 “reflects a careful effort to move international law forward in the challenging domain of cyberspace”. Mačák further echoes this idea by arguing that the expansion and revision of the document will probably “further strengthen the project’s overall relevance as well as its claim to authority”. Banks, on the other hand, explains that the Tallinn 2.0’s provisions and commentaries are “necessarily general in nature, sometimes ambiguous, and do not necessarily reflect settled international law”.\nRegarding cyber-attribution, in spite of the expectations surrounding its publication, the 2017 Tallinn Manual did not go any further than the previous edition in providing an effective legal solution to the attribution problem. Rather, the experts limited their analysis of cyber-attribution to the well-established Articles on State Responsibility, codified by the ILC. This body of law, as its name suggests, only offers prescriptive norms when there is a state nexus Despite criticism, the Tallinn initiative provides a comprehensive and attentive analysis of how the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* applies to the cyber environment, along with valuable commentaries on controversial issues that need to be further discussed. Even though the reliance on Western-centric approaches might handicap Tallinn’s acceptance in non-Western countries, such as China and the Russian Federation, the project still is an essential tool for scholars, international lawyers, policymakers, and international stakeholders²⁵³.\nIn 2014, Microsoft Corporation published a white paper entitled *International Cybersecurity Norms: Reducing Conflict in an Internet-Dependent World*²⁵⁴. It was the first thorough proposal to seek the definition of acceptable and unacceptable state conducts online, with the purpose of decreasing risks and bringing predictability and stability to the international scenario²⁵⁵. In short, Microsoft proposed six cybersecurity norms to limit conflict and improve cyber defences²⁵⁶. These norms are intended to “reduce the possibility that ICT products and services could be used, abused, or exploited by nation states as part of offensive operations”²⁵⁷. Note that, like both editions of the Tallinn Manual, Microsoft’s white paper suggests guidelines of state conduct and is openly state-centric in its approach²⁵⁸.\nThe project was widely criticized for emphasizing the role of states and thus overlooking the relevance of the private sector, in particular the global ICT industry, for the promotion of international cybersecurity²⁵⁹. In response to these claims, Microsoft released another white paper, *From Articulation to Implementation: Enabling Progress on Cybersecurity Norms*, in which the Corporation outlines six further cybersecurity norms. This time, however, the norms were directed at ICT companies²⁶⁰. For instance, the paper calls upon the ICT industry to “assist public sector efforts to identify, prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from events in ²⁵² Supra note 33, at 1495.\n²⁵³ Supra note 209, at 585.\n²⁵⁴ Note that Microsoft’s proposal was not the first time a private company put forward an initiative of this kind. Already in 1999, the CEO of AOL, Steve Case, strongly recommended states to “revis[e] outdated and ‘country-centric’ laws on telecommunications and taxes that could thwart the growth of the medium” and instead support “international standards – from security, to privacy, to taxation”. (Case, Steve, Remarks Prepared for Delivery (via satellite) Israel ‘99 Business Conference’, 13 December 1999, cited in Goldsmith and Wu 2006, 26) ²⁵⁵ McKay 2014, 2.\n²⁵⁶ For the complete list of the proposed cybersecurity norms, see McKay 2014, 20.\n²⁵⁷ Ibid., 11.\n²⁵⁸ Supra note 42, at 17.\n²⁵⁹ Charney et al. 2016, 3.\n²⁶⁰ Ibid.\n\nNote that, while the rules brought by the Tallinn Manuals articulate purported customary international obligations that by themselves are binding on all states, except persistent objectors²⁶⁴, the norms put forward by Microsoft’s proposals are only broad suggestions that do not create any right or legal obligation. In other words, Microsoft’s norms are “more aspirational than realistic” and require states to translate them into legally binding rules, which takes time and commitment²⁶⁵. Despite this difference, both initiatives have in common the fact that they are non-state-driven, quasi-legal instruments which do not have any legally binding force²⁶⁶. In other words, they are soft law rules²⁶⁷. In fact, the Tallinn Manuals and Microsoft’s white papers could hardly amount to anything but a non-binding document²⁶⁸ since states still are “the legislators of the international legal system”²⁶⁹. That said, one may call into question the importance of these initiatives for the development of international law. Is soft law an authentic law? Is soft law effective to produce norms despite its non-binding nature?\n\n## 4.2 The value of soft law\nAccording to Besson, international legal norms might have different levels of normativity²⁷⁰, ranging from “being low (or soft) as with legal norms in the making to being imperative as with norms of *jus cogens*”²⁷¹. Certainly, the Tallinn Manual project and Microsoft’s papers have a lower degree of legal normativity than binding international rules²⁷². Indeed, as stated by the ILC on its study on the Identification of Customary International Law, the “conduct of other actors [than states] is not practice that contributes to the formation, or expression, of rules of customary international law”²⁷³. This, however, does not imply that these initiatives are utterly irrelevant for the law-making process or even to the development of cyber law. Quite the opposite, considering the normative plurality in international law, non-state-driven initiatives of this kind might be valuable both in quantity and quality²⁷⁴. For Thirlway, “soft law is a vital intermediate stage towards a more rigorously binding system, permitting experiment and rapid modification”²⁷⁵.\nMoreover, even though these intermediary legal products are not “valid legal norms”, they might possess a certain evidentiary importance in the next stages of the development of rules of international law²⁷⁶. Put differently, non-binding documents, such as UN resolutions, might evince the existence of both *opinio juris* and state practice which could later support the formation of customary norms²⁷⁷. By this logic, hard and soft laws are not mutually exclusive and should be seen as “tools provided with a different degree of normativity along a *continuum*”²⁷⁸. It also should be noted that soft law-making processes normally involve non-state actors and thus are more “multicultural and inclusive” than others²⁷⁹.\n---\n²⁷⁰ By ‘normativity’, I mean “the law’s claim to authority, that is, its claim to provide its legal subjects with exclusionary albeit *prima facie* reasons for action through binding legal norms or in other words its claim to create obligations to obey the law that in principle preclude some countervailing reasons for action” .\n²⁷¹ Ibid., 174.\n²⁷² *Supra note* 42, at 19.\n²⁷³ International Law Commission, *Draft Conclusions on Identification of Customary International Law*, with Commentaries, 2018, A/73/10, conclusion 4 (3), 130.\n²⁷⁴ *Supra note* 240, at 170.\n²⁷⁵ Thirlway 2019, 186-87.\n²⁷⁶ *Supra note* 240, at 170.\n²⁷⁷ Ibid. As pointed by the ILC, non-state practice “may be relevant” when assessing the practice of states (*Supra note* 243).\n²⁷⁸ Zerilli 2010, 11.\n²⁷⁹ *Supra note* 240, at 170-171. Regarding soft law, Joyner has interesting points that are worthwhile looking at. For instance, he notes that states are usually “more willing to be innovative when the adopted instrument is not legally binding” .\nAccording to Article 38(1) of the Statute of the ICJ, scholarly works are a secondary source of public international law that informs the application of primary sources²⁸⁰. Hence, it seems fair to conclude that the aforementioned initiatives are not only highly pertinent, but also “likely to prove especially influential”²⁸¹. Nevertheless, this situation is by no means ideal since states, and only states, hold the formal authority to create international law²⁸². As Judge Higgins aptly put it, “[s]tates are, at this moment of history, still at the heart of the international legal system”²⁸³. However, it is important to bear in mind that the norms proposed by both the Tallinn Manual Project and Microsoft’s papers might “mature through codification into treaty law or crystallise into customary law”, so that they delineate the exact limits of activities in cyberspace²⁸⁴.\nThis dynamic is certainly not without precedent. The Antarctic legal regime is the epitome of this. In the 1960s and 1970s, many non-legally binding norms were brought in with high hopes of conserving both living and non-living resources of Antarctica²⁸⁵. Joyner argues that the adoption of these non-binding instruments laid the international legal foundation for the treaty that was yet to come²⁸⁶. Ultimately, the majority of these norms were codified into the 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, a binding agreement that has been ratified by all major international actors, including the USA, China, and Russia²⁸⁷.\nAnother prime example is the international nuclear safety regime. Even though proposals to establish a legally-binding international treaty were put forward since the 1960s, states were generally “disinclined to go beyond the recommendatory nature of the safety standards” issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)²⁸⁸. This situation, however,\n²⁸⁰ “The Court, whose function is to decide in accordance with international law such disputes as are submitted to it, shall apply:\n(a) international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting states;\n(b) international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law;\n(c) the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations;\n(d) subject to the provisions of Article 59, judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicist of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law”. United Nations, Statute of the International Court of Justice, 18 April 1946, Article 38 (1).\n²⁸¹ Schmitt and Vihul 2016, 47.\n²⁸² Supra note 42, at 19.\n²⁸³ Higgins 1994, 39.\n²⁸⁴ Supra note 250.\n²⁸⁵ Joyner 1998, 420. In the 1960s, more than seventy recommended measures were adopted by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Party Meetings (ACTMs); and in 1970s, more than fifty were adopted.\n²⁸⁶ Ibid.\n²⁸⁷ Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, October 1991, United Nations Treaty Series, vol. 2941, A-5778.\n²⁸⁸ Nuclear Energy Agency and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Joint Report on International Law in the Post-Chernobyl Period, 2006, NEA No. 6146, 13.\nchanged rapidly after the Chernobyl accident, which exposed the costly transboundary consequences of unsafe nuclear activity²⁸⁹. The 1986 disaster gave rise to an international legally-binding regime for the safe development of nuclear energy, which slowly transformed the safety standards and other relevant non-binding norms into hard law rules²⁹⁰.\nOne must be aware, however, that the cyber domain differs in important ways from the Antarctic and the nuclear regimes. Perhaps the most notable difference is that, while the lawmaking process vis-à-vis cyberspace has been spearheaded by non-state-driven initiatives, the development of binding rules for international nuclear safety and the conservation of Antarctica had been led mainly by state actors. Yet, these two regimes are valuable examples that illustrate the codification of soft law norms²⁹¹. With this in mind, the current status of cyber international law should be seen as an early stage towards the codification or crystallisation of cyber hard law²⁹². The question that needs to be addressed, therefore, is whether states will finally rise to the challenge.\n²⁸⁹ Shull 2008, 4.\n²⁹⁰ To wit: Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, 1986, INFCIRC/335; Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency, 1986, INFCIRC/336; Convention on Nuclear Safety, 1994, INFCIRC/449; Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on The Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, 1997, INFCIRC/546.\n²⁹¹ Supra note 42, at 21.\n²⁹² Ibid.\n\nThe 2007 Estonian attacks, as well as other cyberattacks mentioned in this study, illustrate the severity of the threats facing states’ cybersecurity, and the equally important challenge of implementing a legal framework for attributing blame for cyber activities. Given the ever-growing reliance on ICTs and the increasing frequency, intensity, and complexity of cyberattacks, a solution for the attribution problem is crucial for both promoting a (relatively) stable world order and reducing the chances of conflict stemming from cyberoperations²⁹³. Note, however, that this solution does not lie in the technical domains, as previously thought²⁹⁴. Pragmatically, the most relevant hurdles for cyber deterrence nowadays are not poor technical capabilities since, from a technical standpoint, tools for attribution have matured significantly in recent years²⁹⁵, increasing states’ confidence vis-à-vis assigning blame for malicious cyberattacks²⁹⁶. Rather, the solution for this issue lies in the realm of international law and cooperation.\nAs transnational terrorism, migration crises, and other security challenges that plague the international community, the attribution problem cannot be appropriately tackled by any single international entity, regardless of how strong and influential that entity might be²⁹⁷. Instead, these modern phenomena require a framework for active global collaboration. It is international law that “affords [such] a framework, a pattern, a fabric for international society”²⁹⁸. Nevertheless, in the context of the computer network, it seems that international law fails to deliver. Even though states have agreed that public international law applies to cyberactivity, there is no broad multilateral agreement on how to govern cyberspace²⁹⁹ and, therefore, it is as yet uncertain how the international legal framework applies to this new, complex domain.\nThis difficulty in the application of traditional rules and principles of international law, in order to properly address cyber challenges, results from a number of reasons³⁰⁰. Perhaps the most relevant of them is the attachment of this body of law to state-centric assumptions and foundations of the early formative stage of the international legal system³⁰¹. By placing state ²⁹³ Supra note 3.\n²⁹⁴ Supra note 10, at 28.\n²⁹⁵ Supra note 33, at 1502.\n²⁹⁶ Supra note 43, at 137. By way of an example, the USA has declared that it has the ability to identify and hold their cyber opponents accountable. Indeed, in the last few years, the U.S. government has attributed high-profile cyberattacks, such as the 2014 intrusion at Sony Pictures Entertainment and the 2016 DNC hack, respectively, to North Korean and Russia (Supra note 42, at 23-24).\n²⁹⁷ Supra note 42, at 2.\n²⁹⁸ Henkin 1978, 5.\n²⁹⁹ Moynihan 2019, 4.\n³⁰⁰ Supra note 2, at 375.\n³⁰¹ Supra note 7, at 610-11.\nactors at the heart of its legal regimes, public international law requires in almost all situations a state link so as to determine either an international legal obligation or an internationally wrongful act³⁰². In an environment where non-state actors are as powerful, if not more so, than states, it seems fair to conclude that this legal system grounded in the traditional state-centric perspective of international law is not suitable or even adequate to address challenges posed by cyberspace and the rapid development of ICTs³⁰³. In this sense, as long as states refuse to recognize the existence and the importance of other international players, any effort to govern cyberspace and to establish legal mechanisms for cyber-attribution will fall short.\nAs it stands now, international law not only fails in effectively dealing with the attribution problem, but also is unlikely to be instrumental in providing both predictability and stability to cyberspace in the short and medium-terms. Besides the lack of clarity of the law in this area, governments have been unwilling to clearly express their existing norms and practices in relation to the cyber domain, impeding the formation of customary international law and increasing unpredictability of state behaviour³⁰⁴. Note that, in spite of the constructive contribution made by non-state initiatives, public international law is lagging far behind in many respects and thus continues to be underdeveloped vis-à-vis cyber-attribution.\nBefore proceeding, two points still need to be considered. First, by filling the void created by states’ reluctance to undertake the international law-making process, non-state-driven initiatives, especially the Tallinn Manuals and Microsoft’s proposals, have been providing much-needed clarity to some grey areas of international cyber law³⁰⁵. These initiatives, however, are constrained by their state-centric approaches, non-binding character, and interpretative methods, which usually lack the necessary legal safety³⁰⁶. Therefore, non-state initiatives represent a relevant but primitive point in the discussion about the application of international law to the cyber domain³⁰⁷. They should be seen as a means to an end, not an end in itself³⁰⁸.\n³⁰² Ibid.\n³⁰³ According to Schmitt and Watts, the cyber domain and cyberactivity have bridged “a number of formerly significant gaps between states’ and non-state actors’ abilities to compromise international peace and security. in fact, some non-state actors now match, if not exceed, the cyber capabilities of many states in this respect” (Supra note 7, at 595).\n³⁰⁴ Supra note 33, at 1509.\n³⁰⁵ Supra note 42, at 1.\n³⁰⁶ Supra note 2, at 381. For instance, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 limited its analysis of cyber-attribution to the basic principles of State Responsibility, as codified by the ILC. However, as its name suggests, this body of law can only be applied when there is a state nexus.\n³⁰⁷ Supra note 33, at 1513.\n³⁰⁸ In this regard, Mačák points out that non-state initiatives might serve “as norm-making laboratories”, permitting states to identify and assess advantages and disadvantages of a number of proposals (Supra note 42, at 30-31).\n\nSecond, if states genuinely wish to address the problem of cyber-attribution, they can do so; they have the technological capabilities and all the necessary legal power. After all, states are still at the heart of the international legal framework³⁰⁹ and are the only ones to hold the formal authority to create international rules³¹⁰. This argument generates an obvious puzzle, however: why then do they not solve this conundrum? The answer to this question lies on the fact that some countries may benefit from the current state of affairs, characterized by uncertainties and the lack of express cyber norms³¹¹. States that possess the most advanced cyber capabilities – such as the United States, Russia, China, and likely North Korea – may take advantage of the cyber domain in order to fulfil their national interests in the physical world³¹². For instance, the USA has allegedly used an extremely sophisticated computer worm, called Stuxnet, to destroy numerous centrifuges in an Iranian nuclear facility³¹³, thwarting the prospects of Iran developing nuclear weapons and thus securing American geopolitical interests in the Middle East.\nBy this logic, if states believe that by acting in unregulated cyberspace their gains offset their losses, there will be no incentive for them to promote the regulation of this domain or to solve the attribution problem. This might help to explain why state actors have been so reluctant to engage in the cyber law-making process, as well as to express clear *opinio juris* with respect to cyberspace. Considering the ever-increasing costs of insecurity and uncertainty related to an ungoverned cyber domain, states may soon come to realize the necessity of an international legal framework capable of addressing cyberattacks³¹⁴. As Professor Koh aptly put it, “compliance with international law frees us to do more, and do more legitimately, in cyberspace, in a way that more fully promotes our national interests”³¹⁵. Therefore, one can only hope that ³⁰⁹ Supra note 283.\n³¹⁰ Supra note 42, at 19.\n³¹¹ Supra note 33, at 1511.\n³¹² It should be noted that the former U.S. Secretary of Defence Leon Panetta stated that the American government was “developing the plans that needed to be developed to ensure the United States would remain one of the strongest players in the cyber arena”.\n³¹³ Zetter 2014a.\n³¹⁴ Note, however, that this process might already be in motion, as illustrated by the 2015 cyber agreement between the United States and China.\n³¹⁵ Koh 2012, 10.\nstates do not wait for the occurrence of a “cyber 9/11” or a “cyber Pearl Harbour” to overcome their aversion to engaging in the development of international cyber law.\nIn the meantime, cyberspace will continue to be an environment that offers the perfect conditions for the security dilemma to thrive and in which the activities of both state and non-state actors can trigger off conflicts causing widespread harm to societies, the global economy, and the international security system. With this in mind, international stakeholders and policymakers should strive to increase transparency, so as to bridge the existing trust gaps inside the international community. Overall, greater transparency reduces misperceptions and conflict spirals and, consequently, leads to cooperation and better cybersecurity.\nIt is important to point out that, due to time constraints, this thesis was not able to assess the role played by the private sector in attributing blame for cyberattacks or to analyse non-Western approaches to the international rule of law in the cyber domain. Future researches, therefore, should attempt to explore these topics.\n\n45"
