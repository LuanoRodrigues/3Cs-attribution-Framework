As cyber threats and tactics of their originators develop, so must international law keep moving and prevent exploitation of the rule of law by removing legal gaps surrounding deceptive actions of States. Cyber deception refers to a situation when a State launches a false-flag cyber attack against another State but orchestrates the attack in a way that points towards a third (victim) country as the wrongdoer. The target State then launches retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer. The legal analysis of the proposed contribution focuses on the legality of such deception and responsibility of both its author and the deceived State for damage caused to the victim State. The contribution demonstrates the gap in the rules of international responsibility for holding the orchestrator of deception responsible for the damage caused to a victim State as a consequence of misattribution. It also focuses on the legality of the deception as such. Misleading another State is a matter not per se regulated by international law, but it may result in a violation of the no-harm principle. This principle is recognized as a distinct legal norm in specific areas, but it is unclear whether and how it applies to the cyber domain. Finally, the contribution analyses whether the responsibility of the deceived State may be alleviated based on a mistake of fact that caused the misattribution.\nKeywords: false-flag attack, deception, misattribution, mistake of fact, countermeasures, derived international responsibility\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

INTRODUCTION\nDeception is human activity that can take place in various forms or contexts whenever humans interact. This article introduces the concept of cyber deception aimed at causing misattribution and damage to a victim State as a more advanced (in respect of a plurality of parties as well as technical sophistication) form of deception. Apart from the law of armed conflict, deception on the inter-state level is not regulated by international law and does not enjoy the attention of the doctrine of international law so far. However, deception in the cybersphere is a threat and sophisticated challenge for international security due to the technical specifics of this domain and the opportunities this tactic offers. Resorting to false-flag attacks is a matter of concern also for intelligence services¹ and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is committed to addressing modern cyber threats in general.² NATO CCDCOE also prepared a report on mitigation of risks arising from false-flag and no-flag cyber attacks.³ This paper, to the best of the knowledge of the authors, can be considered as one of the first academic legal works that address this phenomenon from the perspective of public international law. It aims to present and legally assess hypothetical deceptive cyber operations intended to damage another State and to initiate expert discussion on this emerging threat.\nCyber deception, as introduced in this contribution, refers to the tactics when a deceiving State launches a cyber operation against another State but orchestrates the attack in a way that points towards a third (victim) country as the wrongdoer. The deceived State may eventually launch retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer, who naturally denies any responsibility for the cyber attack. This can lead to destabilization and conflict between the deceived and the victim States at potentially little cost (political, material and legal) to the deceiving State, unless it is revealed. Confusion and exploitation of the so-called attribution problem may also be examples of the lawfare tactics in the broader hybrid warfare strategy.⁴\nThe following analysis focuses on the legality of the deceptive conduct orchestrated by the deceiving State with the intent of causing damage to the victim State. As part of that, rules for invocation of responsibility for the conduct of another State\n¹ See, for example, the 2020 annual report of the Security Information Service (Czech intelligence and counterintelligence service), ‘Annual Report of the Security Information Service for 2020’ (2021) 18. The US National Security Agency (NSA) and UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) even established a joint advisory group to avoid misattribution.

Then, the analysis addresses legal responsibility for cyber retaliation directed against the wrong target due to misattribution. Whether a mistake of fact can alleviate the international responsibility of the deceived State towards the victim State is examined. This paper does not focus in detail on the rules of attribution.5 The following analysis demonstrates that rules for international responsibility are not sufficient to invoke responsibility on a State that misled another State and caused damage to a victim State. The paper also shows that an error on the side of the misled State does not generally alleviate its responsibility for the retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer. The paper presents the view that the act of deception as such is not in contradiction with any of the established primary rules of general international law.\nBased on that, the contribution calls for further academic discussion and points to other legal concepts that might apply to the act of deception. As cyber threats and the tactics of their originators develop, so must international law keep moving and prevent exploitation of the rule of law by removing legal gaps surrounding deceptive actions.\n## 2. CONCEPT OF CYBER DECEPTION\nDeceptions are commonly encountered in everyday life in economic interactions, sport, politics, diplomacy. Deception can be defined as an interaction between two parties in which the deceiver successfully causes the target to accept as true a specific incorrect version of reality, with the intent of causing the target to act in a way that benefits the deceiver.6\nOn various levels of inter-state relations, deception may also be utilized as a strategy by States pursuing their interests (be it on the level of diplomacy, negotiation, the conclusion of strategic agreements, etc.). Naturally, deception is also a method used for gaining a military advantage in the theatre of operations during hostilities. From a different angle, the concept of deception is also an important part of the cyber security defence strategies in the information technology sector.7 This article introduces and focuses on the concept of cyber deception aimed at causing misattribution and damage to a victim State as a more advanced (in respect of a plurality of parties as well as technical sophistication) form of deception.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

Restrictions apply.\n5 The issue of attribution is even more challenging in situations where a State uses non-state actors as proxies for the conduct of malicious cyber operations.\n6 Neil C Rowe and John E Custy, ‘Deception in Cyber-Attacks’ in Andrew Colarik and Lech Janczewski (eds), Cyber War and Cyber Terrorism (Idea Group 2007) 91.\n7 Kristin E Heckman et al. (eds), Cyber Denial, Deception and Counter Deception: A Framework for Supporting Active Cyber Defence (Springer 2015) – addressing deception as a strategy and technical method of resisting and eliminating cyber intrusions.\nIn a hypothetical scenario, a deceiving State may decide to conduct a harmful cyber operation against another State and include deceptive elements to orchestrate wrongful attribution of this operation to a third, victim State. The aim of the deceiving State would be that misattribution of such a false-flag cyber operation would be followed by retaliatory measures of the deceived State against the victim State. If the desired consequences of the false-flag operation materialize, the deceived State can resort to various measures against the alleged wrongdoer, ranging from diplomatic and political actions, economic countermeasures, to retaliatory measures in cyberspace. This can lead to destabilization and conflict between the deceived and the victim States with potentially little cost (political, material and legal) for the deceiving State, unless it is revealed.\nThere are multiple technical methods of execution of this modus operandi. With respect to the target of the false-flag cyber operation, examples from the practice show that the malware used against the deceived State may be designed to cause significant damage, for example, to the State's critical infrastructures. An example of such damage comes from 2015 when Ukraine's electric power grid was hit by damage to servers and workstations of a national control centre and sub-centres. The preparation phase of the attack was devoted to the spear-phishing campaign, infecting relevant machines and opening a backdoor for the destructive malware by deleting critical system files, which finally resulted in temporary loss of control over the distribution of power across the country and local power outages.⁸ Targeting of infrastructures, such as the electric power grid, is especially perilous, as severe damage may lead to a chain of further consequences, such as the inoperability of essential State infrastructure or government services.\nConcerning the methods used for deception, the cyberspace domain offers various technical possibilities for concealment and deception.⁹ For this primarily legal study, it is sufficient to mention that the practice has already shown that malware used for false-flag cyber attack may be created in such a way as to point towards another State or actor. The deceiving State may include specific segments of codes and combine them in a way to allow the deceived State to identify false, but persuasive, traces leading to the victim State.¹⁰ The alleged origin of the cyber incident may also be indirectly supported by false information acquired by intelligence agencies and by the contextual elements (e.g. if the relations between the deceived and the victim States are unfriendly in general or if there has already been a real incident between them)\n⁸ See for example Kim Zetter, ‘Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid’ (Wired, 3 March 2016) <https: 03=\"\" 2016=\"\" inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 September 2021.\n⁹ See for example Florian Skopik and Timea Pahi, ‘Under false flag: using technical artifacts for cyber attack attribution’ (2020) 3 Cybersecurity <https: 10.1186=\"\" articles=\"\" cybersecurity.springeropen.com=\"\" s42400-020-00048-4=\"\"> accessed 10 January 2022.\n¹⁰ ibid 14.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

However, as mentioned previously, the practice has already shown some relevant examples of cyber deception utilised by State or State-related actors that were made public. There are reported incidents where China or Russia designed their false-flag attack in such a way as to point to Iran $^{12}$  or a non-State actor. $^{13}$  Probably more publicly known is the Olympic Destroyer malware, which targeted computers used by officials, athletes and visitors during the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang. $^{14}$  The operation bore several features previously attributed to cyber espionage and sabotage actors allegedly based in or working for China and North Korea (known as the Lazarus group). $^{15}$  Subsequently, it was revealed that a Russian foreign military intelligence (GRU) unit was behind the operation. $^{16}$\nA successful deception operation and the materialization of its purpose consists of two distinct acts of two actors: the false-flag operation carried out by the deceiving State against the deceived State (incident 1) and possible retaliatory measures of the latter against the victim State as the alleged wrongdoer (incident 2). The following text will legally analyse both elements.\n11 The 2020 annual report of the Security Information Service (n 1) 18. In fact, identified actions are correlated with socio-political contextual indicators and known capabilities and tactics of actor groups, meaning that attribution is often based on matching the investigation findings with threat actor profiles. See Skopik and Pahi (n 9) 4, 10–11.\n12 Pierluigi Paganini, 'UK/US investigation revealed that Russian Turla APT masqueraded as Iranian hackers' (securityaffairs.co, 21 October 2019) <https: 92770=\"\" apt=\"\" apet=\"\" article=\"\" apnews.com=\"\" archival=\"\" aptturla-false-flag-iran.=\"\" www.fas.org=\"\"> accessed 12 December 2021.\n13 Raphael Satter, 'Russian hackers posed as IS to threaten military wives' (AP News, 8 May 2018) <https: apnews.com=\"\" article=\"\" mi-state-wire-or-state-wire-russia-co-state-wire-north-america-4d174e45ef5843a0ba82e804f080988f=\"\"> accessed 12 December 2021.

LEGAL EFFECTS OF CYBER DECEPTION (INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONDUCT OF THE DECEIVED STATE)\nUnder current international law, it is only the law of armed conflict that addresses specific forms of deception. Article 37 of the Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions and Article 21 of the Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions state that ruses of war are not generally prohibited. However, these provisions and customary international law prohibit perfidy.[17]\nIn general, the question of legal consequences of a false-flag cyber operation must be divided into two separate questions: responsibility for the conduct against the deceived State (depending on the nature of the false-flag attack) and responsibility for the damage caused to the victim State.\nConcerning the former in cases of an attack against a power grid, launching a cyber operation that causes loss of control over the distribution of power across the territory of another State and local power outages can lead to the loss of functionality of that State's critical infrastructure and e-government systems, significantly reducing its capability to serve its inherently governmental functions and its ability to conduct its affairs freely. Such a cyber operation may therefore amount to a breach of the prohibition on intervention and the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other States.[18] According to some experts, the mere disruption and malfunctioning of the cyberinfrastructure of another State may already qualify as a violation of territorial sovereignty.[19] The fact that causation of physical consequences even by remote means can be inconsistent with these rules seems to be generally accepted.[20] Moreover, if an armed conflict exists between the two States, an extensive attack on the electric power grid may also result, depending on circumstance, in a violation of the law of armed conflict. However, a more challenging question arises as to whether the State orchestrating the deception may be internationally responsible for the wrongful conduct committed by the deceived State towards the victim State. In other words, is it possible, and if so, on what grounds, for the victim State to invoke the responsibility of the author of the deception for the consequences caused by the retaliatory measures of the deceived State? The rules on State responsibility contain legal constructions\n210\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London. Downloaded on April 08,2025 at 20:51:56 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply.\non how a State can incur responsibility in connection with the wrongful conduct of another State. These rules also apply to cyberspace.²¹\nAccording to the principle of independent responsibility, each State is responsible for its own internationally wrongful conduct.²² However, a joint or collective wrongful act may lead to a plurality of responsible States.²³ Moreover, a State may also be responsible for a wrongful act of another State if it is implicated in the conduct of that other State. International law recognizes several forms of derived international responsibility:²⁴ aid or assistance (to assist in the commission of a wrongful act by another State),²⁵ direction or control (over the commission of an internationally wrongful act of another State)²⁶ and coercion (of another State to commit an internationally wrongful act).²⁷ These forms of implication have in common that the specific nature of the relationship between the State that is the actual author of the unlawful act and the implicated State causes the incurrence of responsibility of the latter.²⁸ The assisting State will typically not be responsible for the assisted wrongful act,²⁹ but for a distinct wrongful act – that is, deliberately assisting another State in breaching an international obligation by which they are both bound.³⁰ In contrast, the exercise of direction and control or coercion by one State over the commission of an internationally wrongful act by another incurs responsibility for the (directed or coerced) act itself³¹ towards the injured State.³² The coerced State might benefit from force majeure if the requirements are met.³³ In that case, it would be only the State exerting coercion that would bear responsibility.³⁴\n²² James Crawford, *State Responsibility: The General Part* (CUP 2013) 333; Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 2001, vol.

This form of indirect responsibility is rare, belligerent occupation being one of the few examples. A distinction must be made from the situation where an organ of one State has been placed at the disposal of another State. Upon certain conditions, acts of this organ might be attributable to the latter State.

(eds), *The Law of International Responsibility* (OUP 2010) 284.\n²⁹ In situations where aid or assistance is an essential and integral element of the assisted State’s operation, the assisting State may be responsible for the assisted conduct. Responsibility of the assisting State therefore attaches for the extent of its contribution.

Restrictions apply.\nThe problem is that the commission of the deceptive false-flag cyber operation as described above does not fit any of the recognized forms of the implication of international responsibility for the conduct of the deceived State. The nature of the relationship between the deceiving and the deceived States does not qualify as aid or assistance since the deceived State was not aware of the origin of the false-flag operation and intent of the deceiving State. In the situation where the deceived State misattributes the false-flag attack, there is also probably no relationship of dependence that would amount to direction or control.35 Finally, that State is also not typically coerced to engage in retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer, as it was not deprived of its freedom of action.36 Consequently, the victim State cannot invoke the responsibility of the deceiving State for the consequences caused by the retaliatory measures of the deceived State.\n# 4. LEGALITY OF THE ACT OF DECEPTION\nDeception can also be approached from a different perspective, when the focus is not on the question of international responsibility and retaliatory measures of the deceived State but on the legal assessment of the very act of deception. In other words, it can be asked whether misleading a State into the commission of an internationally wrongful act against another State may itself amount to a breach of international law. Answering this question is a challenging undertaking. Deception is a matter not, per se, regulated by international law. Thus, it appears problematic to identify the rules of general international law that such conduct may be in contradiction with.37\nInternational law contains a principle according to which a State must not knowingly allow its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States (sic utere tuo (no-harm) principle).38 Max Huber even argued that a State bears the obligation to protect within its territory the rights of other States, including their integrity and inviolability.39 This principle is recognized as a limitation of State sovereignty40 and\n35 ibid 287–288. Notably, the mere incitement is not unlawful in the law of State responsibility.\n36 Derived responsibility may be relevant, for example, when a State knowingly provides its cyberinfrastructure to another State for the commission of a wrongful act by the latter may incur international responsibility for such assistance (Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 18) commentary to Rule 18, para 6). Derivative responsibility may also be relevant when cyber operation is conducted through computer networks infected and used remotely without the free will of the territorial State (e.g. botnets used against Estonia in 2007) – see François Delerue, Cyber Operations and International Law (CUP 2020) 307.\n37 Deception may constitute a breach of obligations existing between the States concerned, such as multilateral or bilateral treaties on friendship and cooperation, but the existence and content of such obligations may vary. This contribution, therefore, focuses on obligations stemming from general international law.\n38 The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania), Judgment (1949) para 22.\n39 Jutta Brunnée, ‘Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas’, in Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed) Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (Oxford University Press, updated March 2010) para 6, referring to Palmas Island Arbitration.\n40 ibid paras 1, 4, 9.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London. Downloaded on April 08,2025 at 20:51:56 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply.\nin specific areas (in particular in international environmental law) as a distinct legal norm.41 However, it is a question of whether this principle constitutes a stand-alone legal rule applicable in the cyber context, thus outside the context of international environmental law where the principle originally evolved.42 Several authors claim that the obligation not to allow one State’s territory to be used contrary to the rights of another State is now part of customary international law, even in relation to cyberspace.43\nThe *sic utere tuo* principle is often characterized as an obligation of due diligence nature.44 Under the due diligence standard, a State is responsible if it knew about a cyber operation carried out from its territory, where the operation was contrary to the rights of another State and it failed to take feasible measures to prevent it.45 That might in some situations ease the burden of the victim State to prove attribution as it would be enough to prove that the deceiving State’s territory was used for the false-flag operation and that the deceiving State must have been aware of that and failed to prevent such event.46\nHowever, the application of the no-harm principle raises several questions, such as the identification of the harm caused to the victim State and whether the harm originates from the territory of the deceiving State.47 Can the causing of misattribution constitute a violation of the misled State’s rights and amount to harm? Or is it the eventual damage caused to the third (victim) State by retaliatory measures adopted by the misled State that can be seen as the harm? If the former is correct, this harm can be understood as originating from the territory of the deceiving State since its false-flag attack caused it. However, if the latter is correct, it has to be asked whether the harm caused by the retaliatory measures is to be understood as originating from the territory of the deceiving State since it is also the result of the sovereign decision of the *deceived* State (although caused by deception).\nFinally, one might also consider whether orchestration of the deception can or cannot amount to aggression. However, if the *false-flag attack that was used as a tool for deception* as such does not qualify as aggression due to the lack of use of armed force, then it can hardly be argued that the very act of deceiving a State into the commission of internationally wrongful conduct can be denoted as aggression either.48\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

LEGAL EFFECTS OF MISATTRIBUTION CAUSED BY CYBER DECEPTION\nOne of the legal issues arising out of the misattribution caused by the deception is the legality of the retaliatory measures directed by the deceived State against the alleged wrongdoer. The legality of such measures depends on their legal character. If the deceived State responds with reciprocal measures, they may also qualify as a violation of the prohibition on intervention or the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other States.⁴⁹ However, retaliatory measures that are otherwise contrary to international obligations may be legal if they qualify as countermeasures or if they fulfil conditions of any of the (other) circumstances precluding wrongfulness.\nIt is the very first basic precondition of any countermeasure that it must be taken in response to a previous internationally wrongful act of another State and must be directed against that State.⁵⁰ This appears problematic in the case where technical evidence and intelligence information acquired by one State point towards another (victim) State as the wrongdoer, but in reality, the author of the false-flag cyber operation was different. Identification of the wrongdoer and attribution in the context of cyber operations is challenging because of the evidentiary and technical⁵¹ peculiarities of cyberspace that make it possible to hide identity and leave false traces.⁵² At the same time, the basic principle is that in bilateral disputes, the onus to establish responsibility lies on the injured State.⁵³ Together with the specific features of cyberspace, high demands are placed on the injured State in the process of attribution of harmful conduct.⁵⁴ Of course, retaliatory measures of the deceived State would also have to fulfil other requirements of countermeasures, namely a previous call upon the allegedly responsible State to fulfil its obligations and offer of negotiations.⁵⁵\n⁴⁹ See the analysis above.\n⁵⁰ Case Concerning the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary v Slovakia), Judgment (1997) para 83; Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 18) commentary to Rule 26, para 6.\n⁵¹ For an overview of possible technical methods of attribution, see Massimiliano Albanese et al., ‘Deceiving Attackers by Creating a Virtual Attack Surface’ in Sushil Jajodia et al. (eds), Cyber Deception: Building the Scientific Foundation (Springer 2016) 150–151.\n⁵² Robin Geiss and Henning Lahmann, ‘Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Shifting the Focus Away from Military Responses Towards Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention’ in Katharina Ziolkowski (ed), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace (NATO CCD COE 2013) 625–626. At the same time, the basic principle is that in bilateral disputes, the onus to establish responsibility lies on the injured State. This places high demands on the injured State with respect to the process of attribution of a harmful conduct.\n⁵³ Draft Articles (n 22) commentary to Chapter V, para 8.\n⁵⁴ Carrying out in-depth investigation and gaining sufficiently convincing evidence may be time-consuming and take even years – see Geiss and Lahmann (n 52) 626. The more sophisticated the adversary, the longer the investigation may be to gain sufficient evidence – see Thomas Rid and Ben Buchanan, ‘Attributing Cyber Attacks’ (2015) 38 The Journal of Strategic Studies 1–2, 32. On the other hand, security and policy considerations may require prompt reaction to deter further cyber incidents.\n⁵⁵ For more details on function and preconditions of countermeasures in the domain of cyberspace, see Geiss and Lahmann (n 52) 628–644, and Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 18) Rules 20–25. Since countermeasures shall not affect the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force, it would also be necessary to assess whether the destruction of a critical infrastructure in State C could not amount to the use of force.

Restrictions apply.\nThe question that is pertinent in the context of cyber deception is the relevance of the mistake of fact that led to misattribution. Mistake of fact plays a role in some areas of international law, such as international criminal law or the law of international treaties.56 With regard to the law of State responsibility, the relevance of mistake of fact can be discussed in relation to the criteria establishing State responsibility, circumstances precluding wrongfulness and arguably in relation to the determination of reparation.57\nWhen considering criteria for the establishment of international responsibility (breach of an international obligation and attribution), a mistake of fact does not play any role since these criteria are objective in nature58 and any subjective considerations are not relevant.59 Once a breach of an international obligation is established and is attributable, it is prima facie sufficient to establish responsibility.60 Fault,61 culpa or dolus of the organs in question is not required unless otherwise provided for by the primary norm in question.62\nThe same applies to the question of the relevance of mistakes of fact with respect to circumstances precluding wrongfulness. First, a mistake of fact does not constitute a stand-alone circumstance precluding wrongfulness recognized in international law, including in cyberspace. Errors or mistakes of fact are absent from the authoritative list of circumstances precluding wrongfulness in the International Law Commission's (ILC) Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.63 Second, a mistake of fact also\n56 Marko Milanovic, ‘Mistakes of Fact When Using Lethal Force in International Law: Part I’ (EJIL: Talk!, 14 January 2020) <https: mistakes-of-fact-when-using-lethal-force-in-international-law-part-i=\"\" www.ejiltalk.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 27 January 2020, and the following parts.\n57 Art 39 of the Draft Articles reflects the rule that conduct of the injured State that contributed to its damage should be considered. Naturally, this does not apply to the wilful conduct or negligence of the wrongdoer (deceived State) and this rule probably cannot be extended to the scenario where it is a wilful act of a third State that contributed to the injury.\n58 There are some subjective elements in the realm of derivative responsibility discussed below (e.g. aid or assistance or coercion).

There are few opinions that a mistake of fact might qualify as a circumstance precluding wrongfulness, but often they are not further elaborated on. See for example Second report on State responsibility, by Mr James Crawford, Special Rapporteur (1994, A/CN.4/498 and Add. 1–4) para 262. An error has significant legal relevance in some other sub-fields of international law, for example as a ground for invalidity of international treaties – see Article 48 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties from 1969, or in the context of international criminal law – see for example art 32 para 1 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court from 1998.

Restrictions apply.\ncannot serve as a ground for the invocation of any of the established circumstances precluding wrongfulness since none of them requires an inquiry into a subjective element, such as fault⁶⁴ or error.⁶⁵ Specifically, with respect to countermeasures, the law of State responsibility is based on an objective standard.⁶⁶ A State resorting to countermeasures does so at its own risk and on the basis of its unilateral assessment of the situation. An incorrect assessment, including in the event of misattribution of malicious cyber operations,⁶⁷ may result in the commission of a wrongful act by the State resorting to countermeasures for which that State would be internationally responsible.⁶⁸ Interestingly, according to the ILC, there is no difference between countermeasures and other circumstances precluding wrongfulness in this respect.⁶⁹ Similarly, also in the context of self-defence, mistake or error of fact is irrelevant as the requirements for invoking self-defence are ‘strict and objective’.⁷⁰\nDepending on the nature, timing and context, the illegality of actions of the deceived State taken against the alleged wrongdoer might in some situations be precluded by the reference to the state of necessity. The point is that actions taken with reference to the plea of necessity need not respond to an internationally wrongful act⁷¹ and can violate the rights of non-responsible States.⁷² However, necessity could only be invoked if it could be established that the reactive measure adopted by the misled State is the only means for the State to safeguard an essential interest (e.g. protection of an electric grid or critical infrastructure)⁷³ against a grave and imminent peril caused by the cyber threat. In light of the above-described objective standard, this can hardly be the case if the victim State is not at all involved in the false-flag attack. But one could imagine a different scenario where a computer network located in the victim State was exploited by the deceiving State and still remains an imminent threat to the critical infrastructure of the deceived State.⁷⁴\nConsequently, even when misattribution is caused by the wilful deception orchestrated by a deceiving State, conditions of international responsibility of the deceived State may be established due to their objective nature. Thus, it seems that rules of\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London. Downloaded on April 08,2025 at 20:51:56 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

Various solutions to the consequences caused by wrongful attribution are of course possible if the deceived and the victim States reach a corresponding agreement (or the victim State does not invoke the responsibility of the deceived State). But that would require a constructive approach and clear establishment of the facts (including technical evidence), which might not be easy to achieve in some political contexts in combination with the complexity of the cybersphere.\n# 6. CONCLUSION\nDeception in cybersphere is a threat and a sophisticated challenge for international security. As this contribution has proven, it also constitutes a legal challenge. The analysis demonstrated that due to the lack of regulation of the issue in international law, it is problematic to identify international law rules that the deceptive action could violate. A possibly applicable principle, the no-harm rule, has been identified; however, its use appears problematic and deserves broader discussion. At the same time, the rules of international responsibility do not allow for the invocation of responsibility of a State that conducted deceptive action for the damage caused by the deceived State to the victim State. Moreover, a mistake of fact on the side of the misled State does not generally alleviate its responsibility for the retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer, since it does not qualify as a distinct circumstance precluding wrongfulness, nor is it relevant for the invocation of any of the recognized circumstances precluding wrongfulness.\nFrom the analysis, it seems apparent that a legal gap exists in international law. Rules of international responsibility address various forms of what is known as derived international responsibility, but deception does not fall into any of them. Legal consequences of misattribution in cyberspace are not sufficiently addressed in the doctrine and the topic appears to pose a challenge for the law of international responsibility. This outcome is not desirable since mistaken attribution may contribute to the destabilization of international peace and security.75 Therefore, States carry a great burden to use all efforts to properly investigate and assess the background of cyber operations they face, and they must very carefully balance the need to\nDelerue (n 36) 190.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

However, in a situation when the two States' relations are not particularly friendly (something the deceiving State may be fully aware of when choosing the target of the false-flag attack), an agreement is less likely.\n76 For an overview of State positions related to errors and mistakes in the non-cyber context (e.g. land-frontier and aerial incidents), see 'Force majeure' and 'Fortuitous event' as circumstances precluding wrongfulness: Survey of State practice, international judicial decisions and doctrine – study prepared by the Secretariat (Extract from the Yearbook of the ILC 1978, Vol. II/1, A/CN.4/315) para 118 and following.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

As cyber threats and tactics of their originators develop, so must international law keep moving and prevent exploitation of the rule of law by removing legal gaps surrounding deceptive actions of States. Cyber deception refers to a situation when a State launches a false-flag cyber attack against another State but orchestrates the attack in a way that points towards a third (victim) country as the wrongdoer. The target State then launches retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer. The legal analysis of the proposed contribution focuses on the legality of such deception and responsibility of both its author and the deceived State for damage caused to the victim State. The contribution demonstrates the gap in the rules of international responsibility for holding the orchestrator of deception responsible for the damage caused to a victim State as a consequence of misattribution. It also focuses on the legality of the deception as such. Misleading another State is a matter not per se regulated by international law, but it may result in a violation of the no-harm principle. This principle is recognized as a distinct legal norm in specific areas, but it is unclear whether and how it applies to the cyber domain.

INTRODUCTION\nDeception is human activity that can take place in various forms or contexts whenever humans interact. This article introduces the concept of cyber deception aimed at causing misattribution and damage to a victim State as a more advanced (in respect of a plurality of parties as well as technical sophistication) form of deception. Apart from the law of armed conflict, deception on the inter-state level is not regulated by international law and does not enjoy the attention of the doctrine of international law so far. However, deception in the cybersphere is a threat and sophisticated challenge for international security due to the technical specifics of this domain and the opportunities this tactic offers. Resorting to false-flag attacks is a matter of concern also for intelligence services and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is committed to addressing modern cyber threats in general. NATO CCDCOE also prepared a report on mitigation of risks arising from false-flag and no-flag cyber attacks. This paper, to the best of the knowledge of the authors, can be considered as one of the first academic legal works that address this phenomenon from the perspective of public international law. It aims to present and legally assess hypothetical deceptive cyber operations intended to damage another State and to initiate expert discussion on this emerging threat.\nCyber deception, as introduced in this contribution, refers to the tactics when a deceiving State launches a cyber operation against another State but orchestrates the attack in a way that points towards a third (victim) country as the wrongdoer. The deceived State may eventually launch retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer, who naturally denies any responsibility for the cyber attack. This can lead to destabilization and conflict between the deceived and the victim States at potentially little cost (political, material and legal) to the deceiving State, unless it is revealed. Confusion and exploitation of the so-called attribution problem may also be examples of the lawfare tactics in the broader hybrid warfare strategy.\nThe following analysis focuses on the legality of the deceptive conduct orchestrated by the deceiving State with the intent of causing damage to the victim State. As part of that, rules for invocation of responsibility for the conduct of another State\n See, for example, the 2020 annual report of the Security Information Service (Czech intelligence and counterintelligence service), ‘Annual Report of the Security Information Service for 2020’ (2021) 18. The US National Security Agency (NSA) and UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) even established a joint advisory group to avoid misattribution.

Then, the analysis addresses legal responsibility for cyber retaliation directed against the wrong target due to misattribution. Whether a mistake of fact can alleviate the international responsibility of the deceived State towards the victim State is examined. This paper does not focus in detail on the rules of attribution.5 The following analysis demonstrates that rules for international responsibility are not sufficient to invoke responsibility on a State that misled another State and caused damage to a victim State. The paper also shows that an error on the side of the misled State does not generally alleviate its responsibility for the retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer. The paper presents the view that the act of deception as such is not in contradiction with any of the established primary rules of general international law.\nBased on that, the contribution calls for further academic discussion and points to other legal concepts that might apply to the act of deception. As cyber threats and the tactics of their originators develop, so must international law keep moving and prevent exploitation of the rule of law by removing legal gaps surrounding deceptive actions.\n## 2. CONCEPT OF CYBER DECEPTION\nDeceptions are commonly encountered in everyday life in economic interactions, sport, politics, diplomacy. Deception can be defined as an interaction between two parties in which the deceiver successfully causes the target to accept as true a specific incorrect version of reality, with the intent of causing the target to act in a way that benefits the deceiver.6\nOn various levels of inter-state relations, deception may also be utilized as a strategy by States pursuing their interests (be it on the level of diplomacy, negotiation, the conclusion of strategic agreements, etc.). Naturally, deception is also a method used for gaining a military advantage in the theatre of operations during hostilities. From a different angle, the concept of deception is also an important part of the cyber security defence strategies in the information technology sector.7 This article introduces and focuses on the concept of cyber deception aimed at causing misattribution and damage to a victim State as a more advanced (in respect of a plurality of parties as well as technical sophistication) form of deception.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London. Downloaded on April 08,2025 at 20:51:56 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply.\n\nIn a hypothetical scenario, a deceiving State may decide to conduct a harmful cyber operation against another State and include deceptive elements to orchestrate wrongful attribution of this operation to a third, victim State. The aim of the deceiving State would be that misattribution of such a false-flag cyber operation would be followed by retaliatory measures of the deceived State against the victim State. If the desired consequences of the false-flag operation materialize, the deceived State can resort to various measures against the alleged wrongdoer, ranging from diplomatic and political actions, economic countermeasures, to retaliatory measures in cyberspace. This can lead to destabilization and conflict between the deceived and the victim States with potentially little cost (political, material and legal) for the deceiving State, unless it is revealed.\nThere are multiple technical methods of execution of this modus operandi. With respect to the target of the false-flag cyber operation, examples from the practice show that the malware used against the deceived State may be designed to cause significant damage, for example, to the State's critical infrastructures. An example of such damage comes from 2015 when Ukraine's electric power grid was hit by damage to servers and workstations of a national control centre and sub-centres. The preparation phase of the attack was devoted to the spear-phishing campaign, infecting relevant machines and opening a backdoor for the destructive malware by deleting critical system files, which finally resulted in temporary loss of control over the distribution of power across the country and local power outages. Targeting of infrastructures, such as the electric power grid, is especially perilous, as severe damage may lead to a chain of further consequences, such as the inoperability of essential State infrastructure or government services.\nConcerning the methods used for deception, the cyberspace domain offers various technical possibilities for concealment and deception. For this primarily legal study, it is sufficient to mention that the practice has already shown that malware used for false-flag cyber attack may be created in such a way as to point towards another State or actor. The deceiving State may include specific segments of codes and combine them in a way to allow the deceived State to identify false, but persuasive, traces leading to the victim State. The alleged origin of the cyber incident may also be indirectly supported by false information acquired by intelligence agencies and by the contextual elements (e.g. if the relations between the deceived and the victim States are unfriendly in general or if there has already been a real incident between them)\n See for example Kim Zetter, ‘Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid’ (Wired, 3 March 2016) <https: 03=\"\" 2016=\"\" inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 September 2021.\n See for example Florian Skopik and Timea Pahi, ‘Under false flag: using technical artifacts for cyber attack attribution’ (2020) 3 Cybersecurity <https: 10.1186=\"\" articles=\"\" cybersecurity.springeropen.com=\"\" s42400-020-00048-4=\"\"> accessed 10 January 2022.\n ibid 14.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

However, as mentioned previously, the practice has already shown some relevant examples of cyber deception utilised by State or State-related actors that were made public. There are reported incidents where China or Russia designed their false-flag attack in such a way as to point to Iran $^{12}$  or a non-State actor. $^{13}$  Probably more publicly known is the Olympic Destroyer malware, which targeted computers used by officials, athletes and visitors during the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang. $^{14}$  The operation bore several features previously attributed to cyber espionage and sabotage actors allegedly based in or working for China and North Korea (known as the Lazarus group). $^{15}$  Subsequently, it was revealed that a Russian foreign military intelligence (GRU) unit was behind the operation. $^{16}$\nA successful deception operation and the materialization of its purpose consists of two distinct acts of two actors: the false-flag operation carried out by the deceiving State against the deceived State (incident 1) and possible retaliatory measures of the latter against the victim State as the alleged wrongdoer (incident 2). The following text will legally analyse both elements.\n\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London. Downloaded on April 08,2025 at 20:51:56 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

LEGAL EFFECTS OF CYBER DECEPTION (INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONDUCT OF THE DECEIVED STATE)\nUnder current international law, it is only the law of armed conflict that addresses specific forms of deception. Article 37 of the Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions and Article 21 of the Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions state that ruses of war are not generally prohibited. However, these provisions and customary international law prohibit perfidy.[17]\nIn general, the question of legal consequences of a false-flag cyber operation must be divided into two separate questions: responsibility for the conduct against the deceived State (depending on the nature of the false-flag attack) and responsibility for the damage caused to the victim State.\nConcerning the former in cases of an attack against a power grid, launching a cyber operation that causes loss of control over the distribution of power across the territory of another State and local power outages can lead to the loss of functionality of that State's critical infrastructure and e-government systems, significantly reducing its capability to serve its inherently governmental functions and its ability to conduct its affairs freely. Such a cyber operation may therefore amount to a breach of the prohibition on intervention and the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other States.[18] According to some experts, the mere disruption and malfunctioning of the cyberinfrastructure of another State may already qualify as a violation of territorial sovereignty.[19] The fact that causation of physical consequences even by remote means can be inconsistent with these rules seems to be generally accepted.[20] Moreover, if an armed conflict exists between the two States, an extensive attack on the electric power grid may also result, depending on circumstance, in a violation of the law of armed conflict. However, a more challenging question arises as to whether the State orchestrating the deception may be internationally responsible for the wrongful conduct committed by the deceived State towards the victim State. In other words, is it possible, and if so, on what grounds, for the victim State to invoke the responsibility of the author of the deception for the consequences caused by the retaliatory measures of the deceived State? The rules on State responsibility contain legal constructions\n\non how a State can incur responsibility in connection with the wrongful conduct of another State. These rules also apply to cyberspace.\nAccording to the principle of independent responsibility, each State is responsible for its own internationally wrongful conduct. However, a joint or collective wrongful act may lead to a plurality of responsible States. Moreover, a State may also be responsible for a wrongful act of another State if it is implicated in the conduct of that other State. International law recognizes several forms of derived international responsibility: aid or assistance (to assist in the commission of a wrongful act by another State), direction or control (over the commission of an internationally wrongful act of another State) and coercion (of another State to commit an internationally wrongful act). These forms of implication have in common that the specific nature of the relationship between the State that is the actual author of the unlawful act and the implicated State causes the incurrence of responsibility of the latter. The assisting State will typically not be responsible for the assisted wrongful act, but for a distinct wrongful act – that is, deliberately assisting another State in breaching an international obligation by which they are both bound. In contrast, the exercise of direction and control or coercion by one State over the commission of an internationally wrongful act by another incurs responsibility for the (directed or coerced) act itself towards the injured State. The coerced State might benefit from force majeure if the requirements are met. In that case, it would be only the State exerting coercion that would bear responsibility.\n James Crawford, *State Responsibility: The General Part* (CUP 2013) 333; Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 2001, vol.

This form of indirect responsibility is rare, belligerent occupation being one of the few examples. A distinction must be made from the situation where an organ of one State has been placed at the disposal of another State. Upon certain conditions, acts of this organ might be attributable to the latter State.

(eds), *The Law of International Responsibility* (OUP 2010) 284.\n In situations where aid or assistance is an essential and integral element of the assisted State’s operation, the assisting State may be responsible for the assisted conduct. Responsibility of the assisting State therefore attaches for the extent of its contribution.

Restrictions apply.\nThe problem is that the commission of the deceptive false-flag cyber operation as described above does not fit any of the recognized forms of the implication of international responsibility for the conduct of the deceived State. The nature of the relationship between the deceiving and the deceived States does not qualify as aid or assistance since the deceived State was not aware of the origin of the false-flag operation and intent of the deceiving State. In the situation where the deceived State misattributes the false-flag attack, there is also probably no relationship of dependence that would amount to direction or control.35 Finally, that State is also not typically coerced to engage in retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer, as it was not deprived of its freedom of action.36 Consequently, the victim State cannot invoke the responsibility of the deceiving State for the consequences caused by the retaliatory measures of the deceived State.\n# 4. LEGALITY OF THE ACT OF DECEPTION\nDeception can also be approached from a different perspective, when the focus is not on the question of international responsibility and retaliatory measures of the deceived State but on the legal assessment of the very act of deception. In other words, it can be asked whether misleading a State into the commission of an internationally wrongful act against another State may itself amount to a breach of international law. Answering this question is a challenging undertaking. Deception is a matter not, per se, regulated by international law. Thus, it appears problematic to identify the rules of general international law that such conduct may be in contradiction with.37\nInternational law contains a principle according to which a State must not knowingly allow its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States (sic utere tuo (no-harm) principle).38 Max Huber even argued that a State bears the obligation to protect within its territory the rights of other States, including their integrity and inviolability.39 This principle is recognized as a limitation of State sovereignty40 and\n\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London. Downloaded on April 08,2025 at 20:51:56 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply.\nin specific areas (in particular in international environmental law) as a distinct legal norm.41 However, it is a question of whether this principle constitutes a stand-alone legal rule applicable in the cyber context, thus outside the context of international environmental law where the principle originally evolved.42 Several authors claim that the obligation not to allow one State’s territory to be used contrary to the rights of another State is now part of customary international law, even in relation to cyberspace.43\nThe *sic utere tuo* principle is often characterized as an obligation of due diligence nature.44 Under the due diligence standard, a State is responsible if it knew about a cyber operation carried out from its territory, where the operation was contrary to the rights of another State and it failed to take feasible measures to prevent it.45 That might in some situations ease the burden of the victim State to prove attribution as it would be enough to prove that the deceiving State’s territory was used for the false-flag operation and that the deceiving State must have been aware of that and failed to prevent such event.46\nHowever, the application of the no-harm principle raises several questions, such as the identification of the harm caused to the victim State and whether the harm originates from the territory of the deceiving State.47 Can the causing of misattribution constitute a violation of the misled State’s rights and amount to harm? Or is it the eventual damage caused to the third (victim) State by retaliatory measures adopted by the misled State that can be seen as the harm? If the former is correct, this harm can be understood as originating from the territory of the deceiving State since its false-flag attack caused it. However, if the latter is correct, it has to be asked whether the harm caused by the retaliatory measures is to be understood as originating from the territory of the deceiving State since it is also the result of the sovereign decision of the *deceived* State (although caused by deception).\nFinally, one might also consider whether orchestration of the deception can or cannot amount to aggression. However, if the *false-flag attack that was used as a tool for deception* as such does not qualify as aggression due to the lack of use of armed force, then it can hardly be argued that the very act of deceiving a State into the commission of internationally wrongful conduct can be denoted as aggression either.48\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

LEGAL EFFECTS OF MISATTRIBUTION CAUSED BY CYBER DECEPTION\nOne of the legal issues arising out of the misattribution caused by the deception is the legality of the retaliatory measures directed by the deceived State against the alleged wrongdoer. The legality of such measures depends on their legal character. If the deceived State responds with reciprocal measures, they may also qualify as a violation of the prohibition on intervention or the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other States. However, retaliatory measures that are otherwise contrary to international obligations may be legal if they qualify as countermeasures or if they fulfil conditions of any of the (other) circumstances precluding wrongfulness.\nIt is the very first basic precondition of any countermeasure that it must be taken in response to a previous internationally wrongful act of another State and must be directed against that State. This appears problematic in the case where technical evidence and intelligence information acquired by one State point towards another (victim) State as the wrongdoer, but in reality, the author of the false-flag cyber operation was different. Identification of the wrongdoer and attribution in the context of cyber operations is challenging because of the evidentiary and technical peculiarities of cyberspace that make it possible to hide identity and leave false traces. At the same time, the basic principle is that in bilateral disputes, the onus to establish responsibility lies on the injured State. Together with the specific features of cyberspace, high demands are placed on the injured State in the process of attribution of harmful conduct. Of course, retaliatory measures of the deceived State would also have to fulfil other requirements of countermeasures, namely a previous call upon the allegedly responsible State to fulfil its obligations and offer of negotiations.\n See the analysis above.\n Case Concerning the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary v Slovakia), Judgment (1997) para 83; Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 18) commentary to Rule 26, para 6.\n For an overview of possible technical methods of attribution, see Massimiliano Albanese et al., ‘Deceiving Attackers by Creating a Virtual Attack Surface’ in Sushil Jajodia et al. (eds), Cyber Deception: Building the Scientific Foundation (Springer 2016) 150–151.\n Robin Geiss and Henning Lahmann, ‘Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Shifting the Focus Away from Military Responses Towards Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention’ in Katharina Ziolkowski (ed), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace (NATO CCD COE 2013) 625–626. At the same time, the basic principle is that in bilateral disputes, the onus to establish responsibility lies on the injured State. This places high demands on the injured State with respect to the process of attribution of a harmful conduct.\n Draft Articles (n 22) commentary to Chapter V, para 8.\n Carrying out in-depth investigation and gaining sufficiently convincing evidence may be time-consuming and take even years – see Geiss and Lahmann (n 52) 626. The more sophisticated the adversary, the longer the investigation may be to gain sufficient evidence – see Thomas Rid and Ben Buchanan, ‘Attributing Cyber Attacks’ (2015) 38 The Journal of Strategic Studies 1–2, 32. On the other hand, security and policy considerations may require prompt reaction to deter further cyber incidents.\n For more details on function and preconditions of countermeasures in the domain of cyberspace, see Geiss and Lahmann (n 52) 628–644, and Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 18) Rules 20–25. Since countermeasures shall not affect the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force, it would also be necessary to assess whether the destruction of a critical infrastructure in State C could not amount to the use of force. See Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v United States of America), Judgment (1986) para 249; Draft Articles (n 22) art 50 para 1 letter a).\n\nThe question that is pertinent in the context of cyber deception is the relevance of the mistake of fact that led to misattribution. Mistake of fact plays a role in some areas of international law, such as international criminal law or the law of international treaties.56 With regard to the law of State responsibility, the relevance of mistake of fact can be discussed in relation to the criteria establishing State responsibility, circumstances precluding wrongfulness and arguably in relation to the determination of reparation.57\nWhen considering criteria for the establishment of international responsibility (breach of an international obligation and attribution), a mistake of fact does not play any role since these criteria are objective in nature58 and any subjective considerations are not relevant.59 Once a breach of an international obligation is established and is attributable, it is prima facie sufficient to establish responsibility.60 Fault,61 culpa or dolus of the organs in question is not required unless otherwise provided for by the primary norm in question.62\nThe same applies to the question of the relevance of mistakes of fact with respect to circumstances precluding wrongfulness. First, a mistake of fact does not constitute a stand-alone circumstance precluding wrongfulness recognized in international law, including in cyberspace. Errors or mistakes of fact are absent from the authoritative list of circumstances precluding wrongfulness in the International Law Commission's (ILC) Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.63 Second, a mistake of fact also\n\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London. Downloaded on April 08,2025 at 20:51:56 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply.\ncannot serve as a ground for the invocation of any of the established circumstances precluding wrongfulness since none of them requires an inquiry into a subjective element, such as fault or error. Specifically, with respect to countermeasures, the law of State responsibility is based on an objective standard. A State resorting to countermeasures does so at its own risk and on the basis of its unilateral assessment of the situation. An incorrect assessment, including in the event of misattribution of malicious cyber operations, may result in the commission of a wrongful act by the State resorting to countermeasures for which that State would be internationally responsible. Interestingly, according to the ILC, there is no difference between countermeasures and other circumstances precluding wrongfulness in this respect. Similarly, also in the context of self-defence, mistake or error of fact is irrelevant as the requirements for invoking self-defence are ‘strict and objective’.\nDepending on the nature, timing and context, the illegality of actions of the deceived State taken against the alleged wrongdoer might in some situations be precluded by the reference to the state of necessity. The point is that actions taken with reference to the plea of necessity need not respond to an internationally wrongful act and can violate the rights of non-responsible States. However, necessity could only be invoked if it could be established that the reactive measure adopted by the misled State is the only means for the State to safeguard an essential interest (e.g. protection of an electric grid or critical infrastructure) against a grave and imminent peril caused by the cyber threat. In light of the above-described objective standard, this can hardly be the case if the victim State is not at all involved in the false-flag attack. But one could imagine a different scenario where a computer network located in the victim State was exploited by the deceiving State and still remains an imminent threat to the critical infrastructure of the deceived State.\nConsequently, even when misattribution is caused by the wilful deception orchestrated by a deceiving State, conditions of international responsibility of the deceived State may be established due to their objective nature. Thus, it seems that rules of\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London. Downloaded on April 08,2025 at 20:51:56 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply.\n\ninternational responsibility (with some exceptions in Article 39 of the ILC's Draft Articles related to the determination of reparation once responsibility is established) do not contain any legal concepts that would take into account an excusable mistake caused by another State in the process of attribution. Various solutions to the consequences caused by wrongful attribution are of course possible if the deceived and the victim States reach a corresponding agreement (or the victim State does not invoke the responsibility of the deceived State). But that would require a constructive approach and clear establishment of the facts (including technical evidence), which might not be easy to achieve in some political contexts in combination with the complexity of the cybersphere.\n# 6. CONCLUSION\nDeception in cybersphere is a threat and a sophisticated challenge for international security. As this contribution has proven, it also constitutes a legal challenge. The analysis demonstrated that due to the lack of regulation of the issue in international law, it is problematic to identify international law rules that the deceptive action could violate. A possibly applicable principle, the no-harm rule, has been identified; however, its use appears problematic and deserves broader discussion. At the same time, the rules of international responsibility do not allow for the invocation of responsibility of a State that conducted deceptive action for the damage caused by the deceived State to the victim State. Moreover, a mistake of fact on the side of the misled State does not generally alleviate its responsibility for the retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer, since it does not qualify as a distinct circumstance precluding wrongfulness, nor is it relevant for the invocation of any of the recognized circumstances precluding wrongfulness.\nFrom the analysis, it seems apparent that a legal gap exists in international law. Rules of international responsibility address various forms of what is known as derived international responsibility, but deception does not fall into any of them. Legal consequences of misattribution in cyberspace are not sufficiently addressed in the doctrine and the topic appears to pose a challenge for the law of international responsibility. This outcome is not desirable since mistaken attribution may contribute to the destabilization of international peace and security.75 Therefore, States carry a great burden to use all efforts to properly investigate and assess the background of cyber operations they face, and they must very carefully balance the need to\nDelerue (n 36) 190.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

As cyber threats and tactics of their originators develop, so must international law keep moving and prevent exploitation of the rule of law by removing legal gaps surrounding deceptive actions of States. Cyber deception refers to a situation when a State launches a false-flag cyber attack against another State but orchestrates the attack in a way that points towards a third (victim) country as the wrongdoer. The target State then launches retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer. The legal analysis of the proposed contribution focuses on the legality of such deception and responsibility of both its author and the deceived State for damage caused to the victim State. The contribution demonstrates the gap in the rules of international responsibility for holding the orchestrator of deception responsible for the damage caused to a victim State as a consequence of misattribution. It also focuses on the legality of the deception as such. Misleading another State is a matter not per se regulated by international law, but it may result in a violation of the no-harm principle. This principle is recognized as a distinct legal norm in specific areas, but it is unclear whether and how it applies to the cyber domain. Finally, the contribution analyses whether the responsibility of the deceived State may be alleviated based on a mistake of fact that caused the misattribution.\nKeywords: false-flag attack, deception, misattribution, mistake of fact, countermeasures, derived international responsibility Authorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

It aims to present and legally assess hypothetical deceptive cyber operations intended to damage another State and to initiate expert discussion on this emerging threat.": "Cyber deception, as introduced in this contribution, refers to the tactics when a deceiving State launches a cyber operation against another State but orchestrates the attack in a way that points towards a third (victim) country as the wrongdoer. The deceived State may eventually launch retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer, who naturally denies any responsibility for the cyber attack. This can lead to destabilization and conflict between the deceived and the victim States at potentially little cost (political, material and legal) to the deceiving State, unless it is revealed. Confusion and exploitation of the so-called attribution problem may also be examples of the lawfare tactics in the broader hybrid warfare strategy.⁴ The following analysis focuses on the legality of the deceptive conduct orchestrated by the deceiving State with the intent of causing damage to the victim State. As part of that, rules for invocation of responsibility for the conduct of another State ¹ See, for example, the 2020 annual report of the Security Information Service (Czech intelligence and counterintelligence service), ‘Annual Report of the Security Information Service for 2020’ (2021) 18. The US National Security Agency (NSA) and UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) even established a joint advisory group to avoid misattribution.

Then, the analysis addresses legal responsibility for cyber retaliation directed against the wrong target due to misattribution. Whether a mistake of fact can alleviate the international responsibility of the deceived State towards the victim State is examined. This paper does not focus in detail on the rules of attribution.5 The following analysis demonstrates that rules for international responsibility are not sufficient to invoke responsibility on a State that misled another State and caused damage to a victim State. The paper also shows that an error on the side of the misled State does not generally alleviate its responsibility for the retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer. The paper presents the view that the act of deception as such is not in contradiction with any of the established primary rules of general international law.\nBased on that, the contribution calls for further academic discussion and points to other legal concepts that might apply to the act of deception. As cyber threats and the tactics of their originators develop, so must international law keep moving and prevent exploitation of the rule of law by removing legal gaps surrounding deceptive actions.",

Restrictions apply.": "in specific areas (in particular in international environmental law) as a distinct legal norm.41 However, it is a question of whether this principle constitutes a stand-alone legal rule applicable in the cyber context, thus outside the context of international environmental law where the principle originally evolved.42 Several authors claim that the obligation not to allow one State’s territory to be used contrary to the rights of another State is now part of customary international law, even in relation to cyberspace.43 The *sic utere tuo* principle is often characterized as an obligation of due diligence nature.44 Under the due diligence standard, a State is responsible if it knew about a cyber operation carried out from its territory, where the operation was contrary to the rights of another State and it failed to take feasible measures to prevent it.45 That might in some situations ease the burden of the victim State to prove attribution as it would be enough to prove that the deceiving State’s territory was used for the false-flag operation and that the deceiving State must have been aware of that and failed to prevent such event.46 However, the application of the no-harm principle raises several questions, such as the identification of the harm caused to the victim State and whether the harm originates from the territory of the deceiving State.47 Can the causing of misattribution constitute a violation of the misled State’s rights and amount to harm? Or is it the eventual damage caused to the third (victim) State by retaliatory measures adopted by the misled State that can be seen as the harm? If the former is correct, this harm can be understood as originating from the territory of the deceiving State since its false-flag attack caused it.

This outcome is not desirable since mistaken attribution may contribute to the destabilization of international peace and security.75 Therefore, States carry a great burden to use all efforts to properly investigate and assess the background of cyber operations they face, and they must very carefully balance the need to Delerue (n 36) 190.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

Cyber deception refers to a situation when a State launches a false-flag cyber attack against another State but orchestrates the attack in a way that points towards a third (victim) country as the wrongdoer. The target State then launches retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer. The legal analysis of the proposed contribution focuses on the legality of such deception and responsibility of both its author and the deceived State for damage caused to the victim State. The contribution demonstrates the gap in the rules of international responsibility for holding the orchestrator of deception responsible for the damage caused to a victim State as a consequence of misattribution. It also focuses on the legality of the deception as such. Misleading another State is a matter not per se regulated by international law, but it may result in a violation of the no-harm principle. This principle is recognized as a distinct legal norm in specific areas, but it is unclear whether and how it applies to the cyber domain.

INTRODUCTION\nDeception is human activity that can take place in various forms or contexts whenever humans interact. This article introduces the concept of cyber deception aimed at causing misattribution and damage to a victim State as a more advanced (in respect of a plurality of parties as well as technical sophistication) form of deception. Apart from the law of armed conflict, deception on the inter-state level is not regulated by international law and does not enjoy the attention of the doctrine of international law so far. However, deception in the cybersphere is a threat and sophisticated challenge for international security due to the technical specifics of this domain and the opportunities this tactic offers. Resorting to false-flag attacks is a matter of concern also for intelligence services and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is committed to addressing modern cyber threats in general. NATO CCDCOE also prepared a report on mitigation of risks arising from false-flag and no-flag cyber attacks. This paper, to the best of the knowledge of the authors, can be considered as one of the first academic legal works that address this phenomenon from the perspective of public international law. It aims to present and legally assess hypothetical deceptive cyber operations intended to damage another State and to initiate expert discussion on this emerging threat.\nCyber deception, as introduced in this contribution, refers to the tactics when a deceiving State launches a cyber operation against another State but orchestrates the attack in a way that points towards a third (victim) country as the wrongdoer. The deceived State may eventually launch retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer, who naturally denies any responsibility for the cyber attack. This can lead to destabilization and conflict between the deceived and the victim States at potentially little cost (political, material and legal) to the deceiving State, unless it is revealed. Confusion and exploitation of the so-called attribution problem may also be examples of the lawfare tactics in the broader hybrid warfare strategy.\nThe following analysis focuses on the legality of the deceptive conduct orchestrated by the deceiving State with the intent of causing damage to the victim State. As part of that, rules for invocation of responsibility for the conduct of another State\n See, for example, the 2020 annual report of the Security Information Service (Czech intelligence and counterintelligence service), ‘Annual Report of the Security Information Service for 2020’ (2021) 18. The US National Security Agency (NSA) and UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) even established a joint advisory group to avoid misattribution.

Then, the analysis addresses legal responsibility for cyber retaliation directed against the wrong target due to misattribution. Whether a mistake of fact can alleviate the international responsibility of the deceived State towards the victim State is examined. This paper does not focus in detail on the rules of attribution.5 The following analysis demonstrates that rules for international responsibility are not sufficient to invoke responsibility on a State that misled another State and caused damage to a victim State. The paper also shows that an error on the side of the misled State does not generally alleviate its responsibility for the retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer. The paper presents the view that the act of deception as such is not in contradiction with any of the established primary rules of general international law.\nBased on that, the contribution calls for further academic discussion and points to other legal concepts that might apply to the act of deception. As cyber threats and the tactics of their originators develop, so must international law keep moving and prevent exploitation of the rule of law by removing legal gaps surrounding deceptive actions.\n## 2. CONCEPT OF CYBER DECEPTION\nDeceptions are commonly encountered in everyday life in economic interactions, sport, politics, diplomacy. Deception can be defined as an interaction between two parties in which the deceiver successfully causes the target to accept as true a specific incorrect version of reality, with the intent of causing the target to act in a way that benefits the deceiver.6\nOn various levels of inter-state relations, deception may also be utilized as a strategy by States pursuing their interests (be it on the level of diplomacy, negotiation, the conclusion of strategic agreements, etc.). Naturally, deception is also a method used for gaining a military advantage in the theatre of operations during hostilities. From a different angle, the concept of deception is also an important part of the cyber security defence strategies in the information technology sector.7 This article introduces and focuses on the concept of cyber deception aimed at causing misattribution and damage to a victim State as a more advanced (in respect of a plurality of parties as well as technical sophistication) form of deception.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London. Downloaded on April 08,2025 at 20:51:56 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply.\n\nIn a hypothetical scenario, a deceiving State may decide to conduct a harmful cyber operation against another State and include deceptive elements to orchestrate wrongful attribution of this operation to a third, victim State. The aim of the deceiving State would be that misattribution of such a false-flag cyber operation would be followed by retaliatory measures of the deceived State against the victim State. If the desired consequences of the false-flag operation materialize, the deceived State can resort to various measures against the alleged wrongdoer, ranging from diplomatic and political actions, economic countermeasures, to retaliatory measures in cyberspace. This can lead to destabilization and conflict between the deceived and the victim States with potentially little cost (political, material and legal) for the deceiving State, unless it is revealed.\nThere are multiple technical methods of execution of this modus operandi. With respect to the target of the false-flag cyber operation, examples from the practice show that the malware used against the deceived State may be designed to cause significant damage, for example, to the State's critical infrastructures. An example of such damage comes from 2015 when Ukraine's electric power grid was hit by damage to servers and workstations of a national control centre and sub-centres. The preparation phase of the attack was devoted to the spear-phishing campaign, infecting relevant machines and opening a backdoor for the destructive malware by deleting critical system files, which finally resulted in temporary loss of control over the distribution of power across the country and local power outages. Targeting of infrastructures, such as the electric power grid, is especially perilous, as severe damage may lead to a chain of further consequences, such as the inoperability of essential State infrastructure or government services.\nConcerning the methods used for deception, the cyberspace domain offers various technical possibilities for concealment and deception. For this primarily legal study, it is sufficient to mention that the practice has already shown that malware used for false-flag cyber attack may be created in such a way as to point towards another State or actor. The deceiving State may include specific segments of codes and combine them in a way to allow the deceived State to identify false, but persuasive, traces leading to the victim State. The alleged origin of the cyber incident may also be indirectly supported by false information acquired by intelligence agencies and by the contextual elements (e.g. if the relations between the deceived and the victim States are unfriendly in general or if there has already been a real incident between them)\n See for example Kim Zetter, ‘Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid’ (Wired, 3 March 2016) <https: 03=\"\" 2016=\"\" inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 September 2021.\n See for example Florian Skopik and Timea Pahi, ‘Under false flag: using technical artifacts for cyber attack attribution’ (2020) 3 Cybersecurity <https: 10.1186=\"\" articles=\"\" cybersecurity.springeropen.com=\"\" s42400-020-00048-4=\"\"> accessed 10 January 2022.\n ibid 14.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

However, as mentioned previously, the practice has already shown some relevant examples of cyber deception utilised by State or State-related actors that were made public. There are reported incidents where China or Russia designed their false-flag attack in such a way as to point to Iran $^{12}$  or a non-State actor. $^{13}$  Probably more publicly known is the Olympic Destroyer malware, which targeted computers used by officials, athletes and visitors during the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang. $^{14}$  The operation bore several features previously attributed to cyber espionage and sabotage actors allegedly based in or working for China and North Korea (known as the Lazarus group). $^{15}$  Subsequently, it was revealed that a Russian foreign military intelligence (GRU) unit was behind the operation. $^{16}$\nA successful deception operation and the materialization of its purpose consists of two distinct acts of two actors: the false-flag operation carried out by the deceiving State against the deceived State (incident 1) and possible retaliatory measures of the latter against the victim State as the alleged wrongdoer (incident 2).

LEGAL EFFECTS OF CYBER DECEPTION (INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONDUCT OF THE DECEIVED STATE)\nUnder current international law, it is only the law of armed conflict that addresses specific forms of deception. Article 37 of the Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions and Article 21 of the Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions state that ruses of war are not generally prohibited. However, these provisions and customary international law prohibit perfidy.[17]\nIn general, the question of legal consequences of a false-flag cyber operation must be divided into two separate questions: responsibility for the conduct against the deceived State (depending on the nature of the false-flag attack) and responsibility for the damage caused to the victim State.\nConcerning the former in cases of an attack against a power grid, launching a cyber operation that causes loss of control over the distribution of power across the territory of another State and local power outages can lead to the loss of functionality of that State's critical infrastructure and e-government systems, significantly reducing its capability to serve its inherently governmental functions and its ability to conduct its affairs freely. Such a cyber operation may therefore amount to a breach of the prohibition on intervention and the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other States.[18] According to some experts, the mere disruption and malfunctioning of the cyberinfrastructure of another State may already qualify as a violation of territorial sovereignty.[19] The fact that causation of physical consequences even by remote means can be inconsistent with these rules seems to be generally accepted.[20] Moreover, if an armed conflict exists between the two States, an extensive attack on the electric power grid may also result, depending on circumstance, in a violation of the law of armed conflict. However, a more challenging question arises as to whether the State orchestrating the deception may be internationally responsible for the wrongful conduct committed by the deceived State towards the victim State. In other words, is it possible, and if so, on what grounds, for the victim State to invoke the responsibility of the author of the deception for the consequences caused by the retaliatory measures of the deceived State? The rules on State responsibility contain legal constructions\n\non how a State can incur responsibility in connection with the wrongful conduct of another State. These rules also apply to cyberspace.\nAccording to the principle of independent responsibility, each State is responsible for its own internationally wrongful conduct. However, a joint or collective wrongful act may lead to a plurality of responsible States. Moreover, a State may also be responsible for a wrongful act of another State if it is implicated in the conduct of that other State. International law recognizes several forms of derived international responsibility: aid or assistance (to assist in the commission of a wrongful act by another State), direction or control (over the commission of an internationally wrongful act of another State) and coercion (of another State to commit an internationally wrongful act). These forms of implication have in common that the specific nature of the relationship between the State that is the actual author of the unlawful act and the implicated State causes the incurrence of responsibility of the latter. The assisting State will typically not be responsible for the assisted wrongful act, but for a distinct wrongful act – that is, deliberately assisting another State in breaching an international obligation by which they are both bound. In contrast, the exercise of direction and control or coercion by one State over the commission of an internationally wrongful act by another incurs responsibility for the (directed or coerced) act itself towards the injured State. The coerced State might benefit from force majeure if the requirements are met. In that case, it would be only the State exerting coercion that would bear responsibility.\n James Crawford, *State Responsibility: The General Part* (CUP 2013) 333; Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 2001, vol. II, Part Two - Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries.

This form of indirect responsibility is rare, belligerent occupation being one of the few examples. A distinction must be made from the situation where an organ of one State has been placed at the disposal of another State. Upon certain conditions, acts of this organ might be attributable to the latter State. See *Tallinn Manual 2.0* (n 18) Rule 16.\n Draft Articles (n 22) art 18.\n Christian Dominicé, ‘Attribution of Conduct to Multiple States and the Implication of a State in the Act of Another State’ in James Crawford et al. (eds), *The Law of International Responsibility* (OUP 2010) 284.\n In situations where aid or assistance is an essential and integral element of the assisted State’s operation, the assisting State may be responsible for the assisted conduct. Responsibility of the assisting State therefore attaches for the extent of its contribution.

Restrictions apply.\nThe problem is that the commission of the deceptive false-flag cyber operation as described above does not fit any of the recognized forms of the implication of international responsibility for the conduct of the deceived State. The nature of the relationship between the deceiving and the deceived States does not qualify as aid or assistance since the deceived State was not aware of the origin of the false-flag operation and intent of the deceiving State. In the situation where the deceived State misattributes the false-flag attack, there is also probably no relationship of dependence that would amount to direction or control.35 Finally, that State is also not typically coerced to engage in retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer, as it was not deprived of its freedom of action.36 Consequently, the victim State cannot invoke the responsibility of the deceiving State for the consequences caused by the retaliatory measures of the deceived State.\n# 4. LEGALITY OF THE ACT OF DECEPTION\nDeception can also be approached from a different perspective, when the focus is not on the question of international responsibility and retaliatory measures of the deceived State but on the legal assessment of the very act of deception. In other words, it can be asked whether misleading a State into the commission of an internationally wrongful act against another State may itself amount to a breach of international law. Answering this question is a challenging undertaking. Deception is a matter not, per se, regulated by international law. Thus, it appears problematic to identify the rules of general international law that such conduct may be in contradiction with.37\nInternational law contains a principle according to which a State must not knowingly allow its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States (sic utere tuo (no-harm) principle).38 Max Huber even argued that a State bears the obligation to protect within its territory the rights of other States, including their integrity and inviolability.39 This principle is recognized as a limitation of State sovereignty40 and\n\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London. Downloaded on April 08,2025 at 20:51:56 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply.\nin specific areas (in particular in international environmental law) as a distinct legal norm.41 However, it is a question of whether this principle constitutes a stand-alone legal rule applicable in the cyber context, thus outside the context of international environmental law where the principle originally evolved.42 Several authors claim that the obligation not to allow one State’s territory to be used contrary to the rights of another State is now part of customary international law, even in relation to cyberspace.43\nThe *sic utere tuo* principle is often characterized as an obligation of due diligence nature.44 Under the due diligence standard, a State is responsible if it knew about a cyber operation carried out from its territory, where the operation was contrary to the rights of another State and it failed to take feasible measures to prevent it.45 That might in some situations ease the burden of the victim State to prove attribution as it would be enough to prove that the deceiving State’s territory was used for the false-flag operation and that the deceiving State must have been aware of that and failed to prevent such event.46\nHowever, the application of the no-harm principle raises several questions, such as the identification of the harm caused to the victim State and whether the harm originates from the territory of the deceiving State.47 Can the causing of misattribution constitute a violation of the misled State’s rights and amount to harm? Or is it the eventual damage caused to the third (victim) State by retaliatory measures adopted by the misled State that can be seen as the harm? If the former is correct, this harm can be understood as originating from the territory of the deceiving State since its false-flag attack caused it. However, if the latter is correct, it has to be asked whether the harm caused by the retaliatory measures is to be understood as originating from the territory of the deceiving State since it is also the result of the sovereign decision of the *deceived* State (although caused by deception).\nFinally, one might also consider whether orchestration of the deception can or cannot amount to aggression. However, if the *false-flag attack that was used as a tool for deception* as such does not qualify as aggression due to the lack of use of armed force, then it can hardly be argued that the very act of deceiving a State into the commission of internationally wrongful conduct can be denoted as aggression either.48\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

LEGAL EFFECTS OF MISATTRIBUTION CAUSED BY CYBER DECEPTION\nOne of the legal issues arising out of the misattribution caused by the deception is the legality of the retaliatory measures directed by the deceived State against the alleged wrongdoer. The legality of such measures depends on their legal character. If the deceived State responds with reciprocal measures, they may also qualify as a violation of the prohibition on intervention or the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other States. However, retaliatory measures that are otherwise contrary to international obligations may be legal if they qualify as countermeasures or if they fulfil conditions of any of the (other) circumstances precluding wrongfulness.\nIt is the very first basic precondition of any countermeasure that it must be taken in response to a previous internationally wrongful act of another State and must be directed against that State. This appears problematic in the case where technical evidence and intelligence information acquired by one State point towards another (victim) State as the wrongdoer, but in reality, the author of the false-flag cyber operation was different. Identification of the wrongdoer and attribution in the context of cyber operations is challenging because of the evidentiary and technical peculiarities of cyberspace that make it possible to hide identity and leave false traces. At the same time, the basic principle is that in bilateral disputes, the onus to establish responsibility lies on the injured State. Together with the specific features of cyberspace, high demands are placed on the injured State in the process of attribution of harmful conduct. Of course, retaliatory measures of the deceived State would also have to fulfil other requirements of countermeasures, namely a previous call upon the allegedly responsible State to fulfil its obligations and offer of negotiations.\n See the analysis above.\n Case Concerning the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary v Slovakia), Judgment (1997) para 83; Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 18) commentary to Rule 26, para 6.\n For an overview of possible technical methods of attribution, see Massimiliano Albanese et al., ‘Deceiving Attackers by Creating a Virtual Attack Surface’ in Sushil Jajodia et al. (eds), Cyber Deception: Building the Scientific Foundation (Springer 2016) 150–151.\n Robin Geiss and Henning Lahmann, ‘Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Shifting the Focus Away from Military Responses Towards Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention’ in Katharina Ziolkowski (ed), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace (NATO CCD COE 2013) 625–626. At the same time, the basic principle is that in bilateral disputes, the onus to establish responsibility lies on the injured State. This places high demands on the injured State with respect to the process of attribution of a harmful conduct.\n Draft Articles (n 22) commentary to Chapter V, para 8.\n Carrying out in-depth investigation and gaining sufficiently convincing evidence may be time-consuming and take even years – see Geiss and Lahmann (n 52) 626. The more sophisticated the adversary, the longer the investigation may be to gain sufficient evidence – see Thomas Rid and Ben Buchanan, ‘Attributing Cyber Attacks’ (2015) 38 The Journal of Strategic Studies 1–2, 32. On the other hand, security and policy considerations may require prompt reaction to deter further cyber incidents.\n For more details on function and preconditions of countermeasures in the domain of cyberspace, see Geiss and Lahmann (n 52) 628–644, and Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 18) Rules 20–25. Since countermeasures shall not affect the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force, it would also be necessary to assess whether the destruction of a critical infrastructure in State C could not amount to the use of force. See Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v United States of America), Judgment (1986) para 249; Draft Articles (n 22) art 50 para 1 letter a).\n\nThe question that is pertinent in the context of cyber deception is the relevance of the mistake of fact that led to misattribution. Mistake of fact plays a role in some areas of international law, such as international criminal law or the law of international treaties.56 With regard to the law of State responsibility, the relevance of mistake of fact can be discussed in relation to the criteria establishing State responsibility, circumstances precluding wrongfulness and arguably in relation to the determination of reparation.57\nWhen considering criteria for the establishment of international responsibility (breach of an international obligation and attribution), a mistake of fact does not play any role since these criteria are objective in nature58 and any subjective considerations are not relevant.59 Once a breach of an international obligation is established and is attributable, it is prima facie sufficient to establish responsibility.60 Fault,61 culpa or dolus of the organs in question is not required unless otherwise provided for by the primary norm in question.62\nThe same applies to the question of the relevance of mistakes of fact with respect to circumstances precluding wrongfulness. First, a mistake of fact does not constitute a stand-alone circumstance precluding wrongfulness recognized in international law, including in cyberspace. Errors or mistakes of fact are absent from the authoritative list of circumstances precluding wrongfulness in the International Law Commission's (ILC) Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.63 Second, a mistake of fact also\n\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London. Downloaded on April 08,2025 at 20:51:56 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply.\ncannot serve as a ground for the invocation of any of the established circumstances precluding wrongfulness since none of them requires an inquiry into a subjective element, such as fault or error. Specifically, with respect to countermeasures, the law of State responsibility is based on an objective standard. A State resorting to countermeasures does so at its own risk and on the basis of its unilateral assessment of the situation. An incorrect assessment, including in the event of misattribution of malicious cyber operations, may result in the commission of a wrongful act by the State resorting to countermeasures for which that State would be internationally responsible. Interestingly, according to the ILC, there is no difference between countermeasures and other circumstances precluding wrongfulness in this respect. Similarly, also in the context of self-defence, mistake or error of fact is irrelevant as the requirements for invoking self-defence are ‘strict and objective’.\nDepending on the nature, timing and context, the illegality of actions of the deceived State taken against the alleged wrongdoer might in some situations be precluded by the reference to the state of necessity. The point is that actions taken with reference to the plea of necessity need not respond to an internationally wrongful act and can violate the rights of non-responsible States. However, necessity could only be invoked if it could be established that the reactive measure adopted by the misled State is the only means for the State to safeguard an essential interest (e.g. protection of an electric grid or critical infrastructure) against a grave and imminent peril caused by the cyber threat. In light of the above-described objective standard, this can hardly be the case if the victim State is not at all involved in the false-flag attack. But one could imagine a different scenario where a computer network located in the victim State was exploited by the deceiving State and still remains an imminent threat to the critical infrastructure of the deceived State.\nConsequently, even when misattribution is caused by the wilful deception orchestrated by a deceiving State, conditions of international responsibility of the deceived State may be established due to their objective nature.

Various solutions to the consequences caused by wrongful attribution are of course possible if the deceived and the victim States reach a corresponding agreement (or the victim State does not invoke the responsibility of the deceived State). But that would require a constructive approach and clear establishment of the facts (including technical evidence), which might not be easy to achieve in some political contexts in combination with the complexity of the cybersphere.\n# 6. CONCLUSION\nDeception in cybersphere is a threat and a sophisticated challenge for international security. As this contribution has proven, it also constitutes a legal challenge. The analysis demonstrated that due to the lack of regulation of the issue in international law, it is problematic to identify international law rules that the deceptive action could violate. A possibly applicable principle, the no-harm rule, has been identified; however, its use appears problematic and deserves broader discussion. At the same time, the rules of international responsibility do not allow for the invocation of responsibility of a State that conducted deceptive action for the damage caused by the deceived State to the victim State. Moreover, a mistake of fact on the side of the misled State does not generally alleviate its responsibility for the retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer, since it does not qualify as a distinct circumstance precluding wrongfulness, nor is it relevant for the invocation of any of the recognized circumstances precluding wrongfulness.\nFrom the analysis, it seems apparent that a legal gap exists in international law. Rules of international responsibility address various forms of what is known as derived international responsibility, but deception does not fall into any of them. Legal consequences of misattribution in cyberspace are not sufficiently addressed in the doctrine and the topic appears to pose a challenge for the law of international responsibility. This outcome is not desirable since mistaken attribution may contribute to the destabilization of international peace and security.75 Therefore, States carry a great burden to use all efforts to properly investigate and assess the background of cyber operations they face, and they must very carefully balance the need to\nDelerue (n 36) 190.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

However, in a situation when the two States' relations are not particularly friendly (something the deceiving State may be fully aware of when choosing the target of the false-flag attack), an agreement is less likely.\n\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

As cyber threats and tactics of their originators develop, so must international law keep moving and prevent exploitation of the rule of law by removing legal gaps surrounding deceptive actions of States. Cyber deception refers to a situation when a State launches a false-flag cyber attack against another State but orchestrates the attack in a way that points towards a third (victim) country as the wrongdoer. The target State then launches retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer. The legal analysis of the proposed contribution focuses on the legality of such deception and responsibility of both its author and the deceived State for damage caused to the victim State. The contribution demonstrates the gap in the rules of international responsibility for holding the orchestrator of deception responsible for the damage caused to a victim State as a consequence of misattribution. It also focuses on the legality of the deception as such. Misleading another State is a matter not per se regulated by international law, but it may result in a violation of the no-harm principle. This principle is recognized as a distinct legal norm in specific areas, but it is unclear whether and how it applies to the cyber domain. Finally, the contribution analyses whether the responsibility of the deceived State may be alleviated based on a mistake of fact that caused the misattribution.\nKeywords: false-flag attack, deception, misattribution, mistake of fact, countermeasures, derived international responsibility\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

INTRODUCTION\nDeception is human activity that can take place in various forms or contexts whenever humans interact. This article introduces the concept of cyber deception aimed at causing misattribution and damage to a victim State as a more advanced (in respect of a plurality of parties as well as technical sophistication) form of deception. Apart from the law of armed conflict, deception on the inter-state level is not regulated by international law and does not enjoy the attention of the doctrine of international law so far. However, deception in the cybersphere is a threat and sophisticated challenge for international security due to the technical specifics of this domain and the opportunities this tactic offers. Resorting to false-flag attacks is a matter of concern also for intelligence services and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is committed to addressing modern cyber threats in general. NATO CCDCOE also prepared a report on mitigation of risks arising from false-flag and no-flag cyber attacks. This paper, to the best of the knowledge of the authors, can be considered as one of the first academic legal works that address this phenomenon from the perspective of public international law. It aims to present and legally assess hypothetical deceptive cyber operations intended to damage another State and to initiate expert discussion on this emerging threat.\nCyber deception, as introduced in this contribution, refers to the tactics when a deceiving State launches a cyber operation against another State but orchestrates the attack in a way that points towards a third (victim) country as the wrongdoer. The deceived State may eventually launch retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer, who naturally denies any responsibility for the cyber attack. This can lead to destabilization and conflict between the deceived and the victim States at potentially little cost (political, material and legal) to the deceiving State, unless it is revealed. Confusion and exploitation of the so-called attribution problem may also be examples of the lawfare tactics in the broader hybrid warfare strategy.\nThe following analysis focuses on the legality of the deceptive conduct orchestrated by the deceiving State with the intent of causing damage to the victim State. As part of that, rules for invocation of responsibility for the conduct of another State\n See, for example, the 2020 annual report of the Security Information Service (Czech intelligence and counterintelligence service), ‘Annual Report of the Security Information Service for 2020’ (2021) 18. The US National Security Agency (NSA) and UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) even established a joint advisory group to avoid misattribution. See ‘NSA and NCSC Release Joint Advisory on Turla Group Activity’ (CISA, 23 October 2019) <https: 10=\"\" 2019=\"\" 21=\"\" current-activity=\"\" nsa-and-ncsc-release-joint-advisory-turla-group-activity=\"\" nsa-and-ncsc-release-joint-advisory-turla-group-activity=\"\" www.cisa.gov=\"\"> accessed 12 January 2022.\n NATO, ‘Wales Summit Declaration’ (2014) 73.\n Mauno Pihelgas, ‘Mitigating Risks arising from False-Flag and No-Flag Cyber Attacks’ (2015) <https: ccdcoc.org=\"\" publications=\"\" mitigating-risks-arising-from-false-flag-and-no-flag-cyber-attacks=\"\"></https:> accessed 12 January 2022.\n Tomáš Bruner and Martin Faix, ‘The Attribution Problem as a Tool of Lawfare’ (2018) 18(1) Obrana a strategie 79.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

Then, the analysis addresses legal responsibility for cyber retaliation directed against the wrong target due to misattribution. Whether a mistake of fact can alleviate the international responsibility of the deceived State towards the victim State is examined. This paper does not focus in detail on the rules of attribution.5 The following analysis demonstrates that rules for international responsibility are not sufficient to invoke responsibility on a State that misled another State and caused damage to a victim State. The paper also shows that an error on the side of the misled State does not generally alleviate its responsibility for the retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer. The paper presents the view that the act of deception as such is not in contradiction with any of the established primary rules of general international law.\nBased on that, the contribution calls for further academic discussion and points to other legal concepts that might apply to the act of deception. As cyber threats and the tactics of their originators develop, so must international law keep moving and prevent exploitation of the rule of law by removing legal gaps surrounding deceptive actions.\n## 2. CONCEPT OF CYBER DECEPTION\nDeceptions are commonly encountered in everyday life in economic interactions, sport, politics, diplomacy. Deception can be defined as an interaction between two parties in which the deceiver successfully causes the target to accept as true a specific incorrect version of reality, with the intent of causing the target to act in a way that benefits the deceiver.6\nOn various levels of inter-state relations, deception may also be utilized as a strategy by States pursuing their interests (be it on the level of diplomacy, negotiation, the conclusion of strategic agreements, etc.). Naturally, deception is also a method used for gaining a military advantage in the theatre of operations during hostilities. From a different angle, the concept of deception is also an important part of the cyber security defence strategies in the information technology sector.7 This article introduces and focuses on the concept of cyber deception aimed at causing misattribution and damage to a victim State as a more advanced (in respect of a plurality of parties as well as technical sophistication) form of deception.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London. Downloaded on April 08,2025 at 20:51:56 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply.\n\nIn a hypothetical scenario, a deceiving State may decide to conduct a harmful cyber operation against another State and include deceptive elements to orchestrate wrongful attribution of this operation to a third, victim State. The aim of the deceiving State would be that misattribution of such a false-flag cyber operation would be followed by retaliatory measures of the deceived State against the victim State. If the desired consequences of the false-flag operation materialize, the deceived State can resort to various measures against the alleged wrongdoer, ranging from diplomatic and political actions, economic countermeasures, to retaliatory measures in cyberspace. This can lead to destabilization and conflict between the deceived and the victim States with potentially little cost (political, material and legal) for the deceiving State, unless it is revealed.\nThere are multiple technical methods of execution of this modus operandi. With respect to the target of the false-flag cyber operation, examples from the practice show that the malware used against the deceived State may be designed to cause significant damage, for example, to the State's critical infrastructures. An example of such damage comes from 2015 when Ukraine's electric power grid was hit by damage to servers and workstations of a national control centre and sub-centres. The preparation phase of the attack was devoted to the spear-phishing campaign, infecting relevant machines and opening a backdoor for the destructive malware by deleting critical system files, which finally resulted in temporary loss of control over the distribution of power across the country and local power outages. Targeting of infrastructures, such as the electric power grid, is especially perilous, as severe damage may lead to a chain of further consequences, such as the inoperability of essential State infrastructure or government services.\nConcerning the methods used for deception, the cyberspace domain offers various technical possibilities for concealment and deception. For this primarily legal study, it is sufficient to mention that the practice has already shown that malware used for false-flag cyber attack may be created in such a way as to point towards another State or actor. The deceiving State may include specific segments of codes and combine them in a way to allow the deceived State to identify false, but persuasive, traces leading to the victim State. The alleged origin of the cyber incident may also be indirectly supported by false information acquired by intelligence agencies and by the contextual elements (e.g. if the relations between the deceived and the victim States are unfriendly in general or if there has already been a real incident between them)\n See for example Kim Zetter, ‘Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid’ (Wired, 3 March 2016) <https: 03=\"\" 2016=\"\" inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 September 2021.\n See for example Florian Skopik and Timea Pahi, ‘Under false flag: using technical artifacts for cyber attack attribution’ (2020) 3 Cybersecurity <https: 10.1186=\"\" articles=\"\" cybersecurity.springeropen.com=\"\" s42400-020-00048-4=\"\"> accessed 10 January 2022.\n ibid 14.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

Restrictions apply.</https:>\nas attribution in cyberspace is mainly based on technical analysis of the attack and all-source analysis.[11]\nDue to its design (where deception is successful) or because of the policy and security considerations of the targeted State that revealed the true origin of the false-flag attack, the frequency of incidents of false-flag attacks is hidden under the veil of mystery. However, as mentioned previously, the practice has already shown some relevant examples of cyber deception utilised by State or State-related actors that were made public. There are reported incidents where China or Russia designed their false-flag attack in such a way as to point to Iran $^{12}$  or a non-State actor. $^{13}$  Probably more publicly known is the Olympic Destroyer malware, which targeted computers used by officials, athletes and visitors during the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang. $^{14}$  The operation bore several features previously attributed to cyber espionage and sabotage actors allegedly based in or working for China and North Korea (known as the Lazarus group). $^{15}$  Subsequently, it was revealed that a Russian foreign military intelligence (GRU) unit was behind the operation. $^{16}$\nA successful deception operation and the materialization of its purpose consists of two distinct acts of two actors: the false-flag operation carried out by the deceiving State against the deceived State (incident 1) and possible retaliatory measures of the latter against the victim State as the alleged wrongdoer (incident 2). The following text will legally analyse both elements.\n\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London. Downloaded on April 08,2025 at 20:51:56 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

LEGAL EFFECTS OF CYBER DECEPTION (INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONDUCT OF THE DECEIVED STATE)\nUnder current international law, it is only the law of armed conflict that addresses specific forms of deception. Article 37 of the Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions and Article 21 of the Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions state that ruses of war are not generally prohibited. However, these provisions and customary international law prohibit perfidy.[17]\nIn general, the question of legal consequences of a false-flag cyber operation must be divided into two separate questions: responsibility for the conduct against the deceived State (depending on the nature of the false-flag attack) and responsibility for the damage caused to the victim State.\nConcerning the former in cases of an attack against a power grid, launching a cyber operation that causes loss of control over the distribution of power across the territory of another State and local power outages can lead to the loss of functionality of that State's critical infrastructure and e-government systems, significantly reducing its capability to serve its inherently governmental functions and its ability to conduct its affairs freely. Such a cyber operation may therefore amount to a breach of the prohibition on intervention and the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other States.[18] According to some experts, the mere disruption and malfunctioning of the cyberinfrastructure of another State may already qualify as a violation of territorial sovereignty.[19] The fact that causation of physical consequences even by remote means can be inconsistent with these rules seems to be generally accepted.[20] Moreover, if an armed conflict exists between the two States, an extensive attack on the electric power grid may also result, depending on circumstance, in a violation of the law of armed conflict. However, a more challenging question arises as to whether the State orchestrating the deception may be internationally responsible for the wrongful conduct committed by the deceived State towards the victim State. In other words, is it possible, and if so, on what grounds, for the victim State to invoke the responsibility of the author of the deception for the consequences caused by the retaliatory measures of the deceived State? The rules on State responsibility contain legal constructions\n\non how a State can incur responsibility in connection with the wrongful conduct of another State. These rules also apply to cyberspace.\nAccording to the principle of independent responsibility, each State is responsible for its own internationally wrongful conduct. However, a joint or collective wrongful act may lead to a plurality of responsible States. Moreover, a State may also be responsible for a wrongful act of another State if it is implicated in the conduct of that other State. International law recognizes several forms of derived international responsibility: aid or assistance (to assist in the commission of a wrongful act by another State), direction or control (over the commission of an internationally wrongful act of another State) and coercion (of another State to commit an internationally wrongful act). These forms of implication have in common that the specific nature of the relationship between the State that is the actual author of the unlawful act and the implicated State causes the incurrence of responsibility of the latter. The assisting State will typically not be responsible for the assisted wrongful act, but for a distinct wrongful act – that is, deliberately assisting another State in breaching an international obligation by which they are both bound. In contrast, the exercise of direction and control or coercion by one State over the commission of an internationally wrongful act by another incurs responsibility for the (directed or coerced) act itself towards the injured State. The coerced State might benefit from force majeure if the requirements are met. In that case, it would be only the State exerting coercion that would bear responsibility.\n James Crawford, *State Responsibility: The General Part* (CUP 2013) 333; Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 2001, vol.

This form of indirect responsibility is rare, belligerent occupation being one of the few examples. A distinction must be made from the situation where an organ of one State has been placed at the disposal of another State. Upon certain conditions, acts of this organ might be attributable to the latter State.

Responsibility of the assisting State therefore attaches for the extent of its contribution.

Restrictions apply.\nThe problem is that the commission of the deceptive false-flag cyber operation as described above does not fit any of the recognized forms of the implication of international responsibility for the conduct of the deceived State. The nature of the relationship between the deceiving and the deceived States does not qualify as aid or assistance since the deceived State was not aware of the origin of the false-flag operation and intent of the deceiving State. In the situation where the deceived State misattributes the false-flag attack, there is also probably no relationship of dependence that would amount to direction or control.35 Finally, that State is also not typically coerced to engage in retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer, as it was not deprived of its freedom of action.36 Consequently, the victim State cannot invoke the responsibility of the deceiving State for the consequences caused by the retaliatory measures of the deceived State.\n# 4. LEGALITY OF THE ACT OF DECEPTION\nDeception can also be approached from a different perspective, when the focus is not on the question of international responsibility and retaliatory measures of the deceived State but on the legal assessment of the very act of deception. In other words, it can be asked whether misleading a State into the commission of an internationally wrongful act against another State may itself amount to a breach of international law. Answering this question is a challenging undertaking. Deception is a matter not, per se, regulated by international law. Thus, it appears problematic to identify the rules of general international law that such conduct may be in contradiction with.37\nInternational law contains a principle according to which a State must not knowingly allow its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States (sic utere tuo (no-harm) principle).38 Max Huber even argued that a State bears the obligation to protect within its territory the rights of other States, including their integrity and inviolability.39 This principle is recognized as a limitation of State sovereignty40 and\n\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London. Downloaded on April 08,2025 at 20:51:56 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply.\nin specific areas (in particular in international environmental law) as a distinct legal norm.41 However, it is a question of whether this principle constitutes a stand-alone legal rule applicable in the cyber context, thus outside the context of international environmental law where the principle originally evolved.42 Several authors claim that the obligation not to allow one State’s territory to be used contrary to the rights of another State is now part of customary international law, even in relation to cyberspace.43\nThe *sic utere tuo* principle is often characterized as an obligation of due diligence nature.44 Under the due diligence standard, a State is responsible if it knew about a cyber operation carried out from its territory, where the operation was contrary to the rights of another State and it failed to take feasible measures to prevent it.45 That might in some situations ease the burden of the victim State to prove attribution as it would be enough to prove that the deceiving State’s territory was used for the false-flag operation and that the deceiving State must have been aware of that and failed to prevent such event.46\nHowever, the application of the no-harm principle raises several questions, such as the identification of the harm caused to the victim State and whether the harm originates from the territory of the deceiving State.47 Can the causing of misattribution constitute a violation of the misled State’s rights and amount to harm? Or is it the eventual damage caused to the third (victim) State by retaliatory measures adopted by the misled State that can be seen as the harm? If the former is correct, this harm can be understood as originating from the territory of the deceiving State since its false-flag attack caused it. However, if the latter is correct, it has to be asked whether the harm caused by the retaliatory measures is to be understood as originating from the territory of the deceiving State since it is also the result of the sovereign decision of the *deceived* State (although caused by deception).\nFinally, one might also consider whether orchestration of the deception can or cannot amount to aggression. However, if the *false-flag attack that was used as a tool for deception* as such does not qualify as aggression due to the lack of use of armed force, then it can hardly be argued that the very act of deceiving a State into the commission of internationally wrongful conduct can be denoted as aggression either.48\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

LEGAL EFFECTS OF MISATTRIBUTION CAUSED BY CYBER DECEPTION\nOne of the legal issues arising out of the misattribution caused by the deception is the legality of the retaliatory measures directed by the deceived State against the alleged wrongdoer. The legality of such measures depends on their legal character. If the deceived State responds with reciprocal measures, they may also qualify as a violation of the prohibition on intervention or the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other States. However, retaliatory measures that are otherwise contrary to international obligations may be legal if they qualify as countermeasures or if they fulfil conditions of any of the (other) circumstances precluding wrongfulness.\nIt is the very first basic precondition of any countermeasure that it must be taken in response to a previous internationally wrongful act of another State and must be directed against that State. This appears problematic in the case where technical evidence and intelligence information acquired by one State point towards another (victim) State as the wrongdoer, but in reality, the author of the false-flag cyber operation was different. Identification of the wrongdoer and attribution in the context of cyber operations is challenging because of the evidentiary and technical peculiarities of cyberspace that make it possible to hide identity and leave false traces. At the same time, the basic principle is that in bilateral disputes, the onus to establish responsibility lies on the injured State. Together with the specific features of cyberspace, high demands are placed on the injured State in the process of attribution of harmful conduct. Of course, retaliatory measures of the deceived State would also have to fulfil other requirements of countermeasures, namely a previous call upon the allegedly responsible State to fulfil its obligations and offer of negotiations.\n See the analysis above.\n Case Concerning the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary v Slovakia), Judgment (1997) para 83; Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 18) commentary to Rule 26, para 6.\n For an overview of possible technical methods of attribution, see Massimiliano Albanese et al., ‘Deceiving Attackers by Creating a Virtual Attack Surface’ in Sushil Jajodia et al. (eds), Cyber Deception: Building the Scientific Foundation (Springer 2016) 150–151.\n Robin Geiss and Henning Lahmann, ‘Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Shifting the Focus Away from Military Responses Towards Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention’ in Katharina Ziolkowski (ed), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace (NATO CCD COE 2013) 625–626. At the same time, the basic principle is that in bilateral disputes, the onus to establish responsibility lies on the injured State. This places high demands on the injured State with respect to the process of attribution of a harmful conduct.\n Draft Articles (n 22) commentary to Chapter V, para 8.\n Carrying out in-depth investigation and gaining sufficiently convincing evidence may be time-consuming and take even years – see Geiss and Lahmann (n 52) 626. The more sophisticated the adversary, the longer the investigation may be to gain sufficient evidence – see Thomas Rid and Ben Buchanan, ‘Attributing Cyber Attacks’ (2015) 38 The Journal of Strategic Studies 1–2, 32. On the other hand, security and policy considerations may require prompt reaction to deter further cyber incidents.\n For more details on function and preconditions of countermeasures in the domain of cyberspace, see Geiss and Lahmann (n 52) 628–644, and Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 18) Rules 20–25. Since countermeasures shall not affect the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force, it would also be necessary to assess whether the destruction of a critical infrastructure in State C could not amount to the use of force. See Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v United States of America), Judgment (1986) para 249; Draft Articles (n 22) art 50 para 1 letter a).\n\nThe question that is pertinent in the context of cyber deception is the relevance of the mistake of fact that led to misattribution. Mistake of fact plays a role in some areas of international law, such as international criminal law or the law of international treaties.56 With regard to the law of State responsibility, the relevance of mistake of fact can be discussed in relation to the criteria establishing State responsibility, circumstances precluding wrongfulness and arguably in relation to the determination of reparation.57\nWhen considering criteria for the establishment of international responsibility (breach of an international obligation and attribution), a mistake of fact does not play any role since these criteria are objective in nature58 and any subjective considerations are not relevant.59 Once a breach of an international obligation is established and is attributable, it is prima facie sufficient to establish responsibility.60 Fault,61 culpa or dolus of the organs in question is not required unless otherwise provided for by the primary norm in question.62\nThe same applies to the question of the relevance of mistakes of fact with respect to circumstances precluding wrongfulness. First, a mistake of fact does not constitute a stand-alone circumstance precluding wrongfulness recognized in international law, including in cyberspace. Errors or mistakes of fact are absent from the authoritative list of circumstances precluding wrongfulness in the International Law Commission's (ILC) Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.63 Second, a mistake of fact also\n\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London. Downloaded on April 08,2025 at 20:51:56 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply.\ncannot serve as a ground for the invocation of any of the established circumstances precluding wrongfulness since none of them requires an inquiry into a subjective element, such as fault or error. Specifically, with respect to countermeasures, the law of State responsibility is based on an objective standard. A State resorting to countermeasures does so at its own risk and on the basis of its unilateral assessment of the situation. An incorrect assessment, including in the event of misattribution of malicious cyber operations, may result in the commission of a wrongful act by the State resorting to countermeasures for which that State would be internationally responsible. Interestingly, according to the ILC, there is no difference between countermeasures and other circumstances precluding wrongfulness in this respect. Similarly, also in the context of self-defence, mistake or error of fact is irrelevant as the requirements for invoking self-defence are ‘strict and objective’.\nDepending on the nature, timing and context, the illegality of actions of the deceived State taken against the alleged wrongdoer might in some situations be precluded by the reference to the state of necessity. The point is that actions taken with reference to the plea of necessity need not respond to an internationally wrongful act and can violate the rights of non-responsible States. However, necessity could only be invoked if it could be established that the reactive measure adopted by the misled State is the only means for the State to safeguard an essential interest (e.g. protection of an electric grid or critical infrastructure) against a grave and imminent peril caused by the cyber threat. In light of the above-described objective standard, this can hardly be the case if the victim State is not at all involved in the false-flag attack. But one could imagine a different scenario where a computer network located in the victim State was exploited by the deceiving State and still remains an imminent threat to the critical infrastructure of the deceived State.\nConsequently, even when misattribution is caused by the wilful deception orchestrated by a deceiving State, conditions of international responsibility of the deceived State may be established due to their objective nature. Thus, it seems that rules of\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London. Downloaded on April 08,2025 at 20:51:56 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply.\n\ninternational responsibility (with some exceptions in Article 39 of the ILC's Draft Articles related to the determination of reparation once responsibility is established) do not contain any legal concepts that would take into account an excusable mistake caused by another State in the process of attribution. Various solutions to the consequences caused by wrongful attribution are of course possible if the deceived and the victim States reach a corresponding agreement (or the victim State does not invoke the responsibility of the deceived State). But that would require a constructive approach and clear establishment of the facts (including technical evidence), which might not be easy to achieve in some political contexts in combination with the complexity of the cybersphere.\n# 6. CONCLUSION\nDeception in cybersphere is a threat and a sophisticated challenge for international security. As this contribution has proven, it also constitutes a legal challenge. The analysis demonstrated that due to the lack of regulation of the issue in international law, it is problematic to identify international law rules that the deceptive action could violate. A possibly applicable principle, the no-harm rule, has been identified; however, its use appears problematic and deserves broader discussion. At the same time, the rules of international responsibility do not allow for the invocation of responsibility of a State that conducted deceptive action for the damage caused by the deceived State to the victim State. Moreover, a mistake of fact on the side of the misled State does not generally alleviate its responsibility for the retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer, since it does not qualify as a distinct circumstance precluding wrongfulness, nor is it relevant for the invocation of any of the recognized circumstances precluding wrongfulness.\nFrom the analysis, it seems apparent that a legal gap exists in international law. Rules of international responsibility address various forms of what is known as derived international responsibility, but deception does not fall into any of them. Legal consequences of misattribution in cyberspace are not sufficiently addressed in the doctrine and the topic appears to pose a challenge for the law of international responsibility. This outcome is not desirable since mistaken attribution may contribute to the destabilization of international peace and security.75 Therefore, States carry a great burden to use all efforts to properly investigate and assess the background of cyber operations they face, and they must very carefully balance the need to\nDelerue (n 36) 190.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

However, in a situation when the two States' relations are not particularly friendly (something the deceiving State may be fully aware of when choosing the target of the false-flag attack), an agreement is less likely.\n\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

As cyber threats and tactics of their originators develop, so must international law keep moving and prevent exploitation of the rule of law by removing legal gaps surrounding deceptive actions of States. Cyber deception refers to a situation when a State launches a false-flag cyber attack against another State but orchestrates the attack in a way that points towards a third (victim) country as the wrongdoer. The target State then launches retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer. The legal analysis of the proposed contribution focuses on the legality of such deception and responsibility of both its author and the deceived State for damage caused to the victim State. The contribution demonstrates the gap in the rules of international responsibility for holding the orchestrator of deception responsible for the damage caused to a victim State as a consequence of misattribution. It also focuses on the legality of the deception as such. Misleading another State is a matter not per se regulated by international law, but it may result in a violation of the no-harm principle. This principle is recognized as a distinct legal norm in specific areas, but it is unclear whether and how it applies to the cyber domain. Finally, the contribution analyses whether the responsibility of the deceived State may be alleviated based on a mistake of fact that caused the misattribution.\nKeywords: false-flag attack, deception, misattribution, mistake of fact, countermeasures, derived international responsibility\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

INTRODUCTION\nDeception is human activity that can take place in various forms or contexts whenever humans interact. This article introduces the concept of cyber deception aimed at causing misattribution and damage to a victim State as a more advanced (in respect of a plurality of parties as well as technical sophistication) form of deception. Apart from the law of armed conflict, deception on the inter-state level is not regulated by international law and does not enjoy the attention of the doctrine of international law so far. However, deception in the cybersphere is a threat and sophisticated challenge for international security due to the technical specifics of this domain and the opportunities this tactic offers. Resorting to false-flag attacks is a matter of concern also for intelligence services¹ and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is committed to addressing modern cyber threats in general.² NATO CCDCOE also prepared a report on mitigation of risks arising from false-flag and no-flag cyber attacks.³ This paper, to the best of the knowledge of the authors, can be considered as one of the first academic legal works that address this phenomenon from the perspective of public international law. It aims to present and legally assess hypothetical deceptive cyber operations intended to damage another State and to initiate expert discussion on this emerging threat.\nCyber deception, as introduced in this contribution, refers to the tactics when a deceiving State launches a cyber operation against another State but orchestrates the attack in a way that points towards a third (victim) country as the wrongdoer. The deceived State may eventually launch retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer, who naturally denies any responsibility for the cyber attack. This can lead to destabilization and conflict between the deceived and the victim States at potentially little cost (political, material and legal) to the deceiving State, unless it is revealed. Confusion and exploitation of the so-called attribution problem may also be examples of the lawfare tactics in the broader hybrid warfare strategy.⁴\nThe following analysis focuses on the legality of the deceptive conduct orchestrated by the deceiving State with the intent of causing damage to the victim State. As part of that, rules for invocation of responsibility for the conduct of another State\n¹ See, for example, the 2020 annual report of the Security Information Service (Czech intelligence and counterintelligence service), ‘Annual Report of the Security Information Service for 2020’ (2021) 18. The US National Security Agency (NSA) and UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) even established a joint advisory group to avoid misattribution.

Then, the analysis addresses legal responsibility for cyber retaliation directed against the wrong target due to misattribution. Whether a mistake of fact can alleviate the international responsibility of the deceived State towards the victim State is examined. This paper does not focus in detail on the rules of attribution.5 The following analysis demonstrates that rules for international responsibility are not sufficient to invoke responsibility on a State that misled another State and caused damage to a victim State. The paper also shows that an error on the side of the misled State does not generally alleviate its responsibility for the retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer. The paper presents the view that the act of deception as such is not in contradiction with any of the established primary rules of general international law.\nBased on that, the contribution calls for further academic discussion and points to other legal concepts that might apply to the act of deception. As cyber threats and the tactics of their originators develop, so must international law keep moving and prevent exploitation of the rule of law by removing legal gaps surrounding deceptive actions.\n## 2. CONCEPT OF CYBER DECEPTION\nDeceptions are commonly encountered in everyday life in economic interactions, sport, politics, diplomacy. Deception can be defined as an interaction between two parties in which the deceiver successfully causes the target to accept as true a specific incorrect version of reality, with the intent of causing the target to act in a way that benefits the deceiver.6\nOn various levels of inter-state relations, deception may also be utilized as a strategy by States pursuing their interests (be it on the level of diplomacy, negotiation, the conclusion of strategic agreements, etc.). Naturally, deception is also a method used for gaining a military advantage in the theatre of operations during hostilities. From a different angle, the concept of deception is also an important part of the cyber security defence strategies in the information technology sector.7 This article introduces and focuses on the concept of cyber deception aimed at causing misattribution and damage to a victim State as a more advanced (in respect of a plurality of parties as well as technical sophistication) form of deception.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London. Downloaded on April 08,2025 at 20:51:56 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply.\n5 The issue of attribution is even more challenging in situations where a State uses non-state actors as proxies for the conduct of malicious cyber operations.\n6 Neil C Rowe and John E Custy, ‘Deception in Cyber-Attacks’ in Andrew Colarik and Lech Janczewski (eds), Cyber War and Cyber Terrorism (Idea Group 2007) 91.\n7 Kristin E Heckman et al. (eds), Cyber Denial, Deception and Counter Deception: A Framework for Supporting Active Cyber Defence (Springer 2015) – addressing deception as a strategy and technical method of resisting and eliminating cyber intrusions.\nIn a hypothetical scenario, a deceiving State may decide to conduct a harmful cyber operation against another State and include deceptive elements to orchestrate wrongful attribution of this operation to a third, victim State. The aim of the deceiving State would be that misattribution of such a false-flag cyber operation would be followed by retaliatory measures of the deceived State against the victim State. If the desired consequences of the false-flag operation materialize, the deceived State can resort to various measures against the alleged wrongdoer, ranging from diplomatic and political actions, economic countermeasures, to retaliatory measures in cyberspace. This can lead to destabilization and conflict between the deceived and the victim States with potentially little cost (political, material and legal) for the deceiving State, unless it is revealed.\nThere are multiple technical methods of execution of this modus operandi. With respect to the target of the false-flag cyber operation, examples from the practice show that the malware used against the deceived State may be designed to cause significant damage, for example, to the State's critical infrastructures. An example of such damage comes from 2015 when Ukraine's electric power grid was hit by damage to servers and workstations of a national control centre and sub-centres. The preparation phase of the attack was devoted to the spear-phishing campaign, infecting relevant machines and opening a backdoor for the destructive malware by deleting critical system files, which finally resulted in temporary loss of control over the distribution of power across the country and local power outages.⁸ Targeting of infrastructures, such as the electric power grid, is especially perilous, as severe damage may lead to a chain of further consequences, such as the inoperability of essential State infrastructure or government services.\nConcerning the methods used for deception, the cyberspace domain offers various technical possibilities for concealment and deception.⁹ For this primarily legal study, it is sufficient to mention that the practice has already shown that malware used for false-flag cyber attack may be created in such a way as to point towards another State or actor. The deceiving State may include specific segments of codes and combine them in a way to allow the deceived State to identify false, but persuasive, traces leading to the victim State.¹⁰ The alleged origin of the cyber incident may also be indirectly supported by false information acquired by intelligence agencies and by the contextual elements (e.g. if the relations between the deceived and the victim States are unfriendly in general or if there has already been a real incident between them)\n⁸ See for example Kim Zetter, ‘Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid’ (Wired, 3 March 2016) <https: 03=\"\" 2016=\"\" inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 September 2021.\n⁹ See for example Florian Skopik and Timea Pahi, ‘Under false flag: using technical artifacts for cyber attack attribution’ (2020) 3 Cybersecurity <https: 10.1186=\"\" articles=\"\" cybersecurity.springeropen.com=\"\" s42400-020-00048-4=\"\"> accessed 10 January 2022.\n¹⁰ ibid 14.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

However, as mentioned previously, the practice has already shown some relevant examples of cyber deception utilised by State or State-related actors that were made public. There are reported incidents where China or Russia designed their false-flag attack in such a way as to point to Iran $^{12}$  or a non-State actor. $^{13}$  Probably more publicly known is the Olympic Destroyer malware, which targeted computers used by officials, athletes and visitors during the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang. $^{14}$  The operation bore several features previously attributed to cyber espionage and sabotage actors allegedly based in or working for China and North Korea (known as the Lazarus group). $^{15}$  Subsequently, it was revealed that a Russian foreign military intelligence (GRU) unit was behind the operation. $^{16}$\nA successful deception operation and the materialization of its purpose consists of two distinct acts of two actors: the false-flag operation carried out by the deceiving State against the deceived State (incident 1) and possible retaliatory measures of the latter against the victim State as the alleged wrongdoer (incident 2). The following text will legally analyse both elements.\n11 The 2020 annual report of the Security Information Service (n 1) 18.

LEGAL EFFECTS OF CYBER DECEPTION (INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONDUCT OF THE DECEIVED STATE)\nUnder current international law, it is only the law of armed conflict that addresses specific forms of deception. Article 37 of the Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions and Article 21 of the Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions state that ruses of war are not generally prohibited. However, these provisions and customary international law prohibit perfidy.\nIn general, the question of legal consequences of a false-flag cyber operation must be divided into two separate questions: responsibility for the conduct against the deceived State (depending on the nature of the false-flag attack) and responsibility for the damage caused to the victim State.\nConcerning the former in cases of an attack against a power grid, launching a cyber operation that causes loss of control over the distribution of power across the territory of another State and local power outages can lead to the loss of functionality of that State's critical infrastructure and e-government systems, significantly reducing its capability to serve its inherently governmental functions and its ability to conduct its affairs freely. Such a cyber operation may therefore amount to a breach of the prohibition on intervention and the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other States. According to some experts, the mere disruption and malfunctioning of the cyberinfrastructure of another State may already qualify as a violation of territorial sovereignty. The fact that causation of physical consequences even by remote means can be inconsistent with these rules seems to be generally accepted. Moreover, if an armed conflict exists between the two States, an extensive attack on the electric power grid may also result, depending on circumstance, in a violation of the law of armed conflict. However, a more challenging question arises as to whether the State orchestrating the deception may be internationally responsible for the wrongful conduct committed by the deceived State towards the victim State. In other words, is it possible, and if so, on what grounds, for the victim State to invoke the responsibility of the author of the deception for the consequences caused by the retaliatory measures of the deceived State? The rules on State responsibility contain legal constructions\n210\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London. Downloaded on April 08,2025 at 20:51:56 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply.\non how a State can incur responsibility in connection with the wrongful conduct of another State. These rules also apply to cyberspace.²¹\nAccording to the principle of independent responsibility, each State is responsible for its own internationally wrongful conduct.²² However, a joint or collective wrongful act may lead to a plurality of responsible States.²³ Moreover, a State may also be responsible for a wrongful act of another State if it is implicated in the conduct of that other State. International law recognizes several forms of derived international responsibility:²⁴ aid or assistance (to assist in the commission of a wrongful act by another State),²⁵ direction or control (over the commission of an internationally wrongful act of another State)²⁶ and coercion (of another State to commit an internationally wrongful act).²⁷ These forms of implication have in common that the specific nature of the relationship between the State that is the actual author of the unlawful act and the implicated State causes the incurrence of responsibility of the latter.²⁸ The assisting State will typically not be responsible for the assisted wrongful act,²⁹ but for a distinct wrongful act – that is, deliberately assisting another State in breaching an international obligation by which they are both bound.³⁰ In contrast, the exercise of direction and control or coercion by one State over the commission of an internationally wrongful act by another incurs responsibility for the (directed or coerced) act itself³¹ towards the injured State.³² The coerced State might benefit from force majeure if the requirements are met.³³ In that case, it would be only the State exerting coercion that would bear responsibility.³⁴\n²² James Crawford, *State Responsibility: The General Part* (CUP 2013) 333; Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 2001, vol.

This form of indirect responsibility is rare, belligerent occupation being one of the few examples. A distinction must be made from the situation where an organ of one State has been placed at the disposal of another State.

Restrictions apply.\nThe problem is that the commission of the deceptive false-flag cyber operation as described above does not fit any of the recognized forms of the implication of international responsibility for the conduct of the deceived State. The nature of the relationship between the deceiving and the deceived States does not qualify as aid or assistance since the deceived State was not aware of the origin of the false-flag operation and intent of the deceiving State. In the situation where the deceived State misattributes the false-flag attack, there is also probably no relationship of dependence that would amount to direction or control.35 Finally, that State is also not typically coerced to engage in retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer, as it was not deprived of its freedom of action.36 Consequently, the victim State cannot invoke the responsibility of the deceiving State for the consequences caused by the retaliatory measures of the deceived State.\n# 4. LEGALITY OF THE ACT OF DECEPTION\nDeception can also be approached from a different perspective, when the focus is not on the question of international responsibility and retaliatory measures of the deceived State but on the legal assessment of the very act of deception. In other words, it can be asked whether misleading a State into the commission of an internationally wrongful act against another State may itself amount to a breach of international law. Answering this question is a challenging undertaking. Deception is a matter not, per se, regulated by international law. Thus, it appears problematic to identify the rules of general international law that such conduct may be in contradiction with.37\nInternational law contains a principle according to which a State must not knowingly allow its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States (sic utere tuo (no-harm) principle).38 Max Huber even argued that a State bears the obligation to protect within its territory the rights of other States, including their integrity and inviolability.39 This principle is recognized as a limitation of State sovereignty40 and\n35 ibid 287–288. Notably, the mere incitement is not unlawful in the law of State responsibility.\n36 Derived responsibility may be relevant, for example, when a State knowingly provides its cyberinfrastructure to another State for the commission of a wrongful act by the latter may incur international responsibility for such assistance (Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 18) commentary to Rule 18, para 6). Derivative responsibility may also be relevant when cyber operation is conducted through computer networks infected and used remotely without the free will of the territorial State (e.g. botnets used against Estonia in 2007) – see François Delerue, Cyber Operations and International Law (CUP 2020) 307.\n37 Deception may constitute a breach of obligations existing between the States concerned, such as multilateral or bilateral treaties on friendship and cooperation, but the existence and content of such obligations may vary. This contribution, therefore, focuses on obligations stemming from general international law.\n38 The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania), Judgment (1949) para 22.\n39 Jutta Brunnée, ‘Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas’, in Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed) Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (Oxford University Press, updated March 2010) para 6, referring to Palmas Island Arbitration.\n40 ibid paras 1, 4, 9.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

Restrictions apply.\nin specific areas (in particular in international environmental law) as a distinct legal norm.41 However, it is a question of whether this principle constitutes a stand-alone legal rule applicable in the cyber context, thus outside the context of international environmental law where the principle originally evolved.42 Several authors claim that the obligation not to allow one State’s territory to be used contrary to the rights of another State is now part of customary international law, even in relation to cyberspace.43\nThe *sic utere tuo* principle is often characterized as an obligation of due diligence nature.44 Under the due diligence standard, a State is responsible if it knew about a cyber operation carried out from its territory, where the operation was contrary to the rights of another State and it failed to take feasible measures to prevent it.45 That might in some situations ease the burden of the victim State to prove attribution as it would be enough to prove that the deceiving State’s territory was used for the false-flag operation and that the deceiving State must have been aware of that and failed to prevent such event.46\nHowever, the application of the no-harm principle raises several questions, such as the identification of the harm caused to the victim State and whether the harm originates from the territory of the deceiving State.47 Can the causing of misattribution constitute a violation of the misled State’s rights and amount to harm? Or is it the eventual damage caused to the third (victim) State by retaliatory measures adopted by the misled State that can be seen as the harm? If the former is correct, this harm can be understood as originating from the territory of the deceiving State since its false-flag attack caused it. However, if the latter is correct, it has to be asked whether the harm caused by the retaliatory measures is to be understood as originating from the territory of the deceiving State since it is also the result of the sovereign decision of the *deceived* State (although caused by deception).\nFinally, one might also consider whether orchestration of the deception can or cannot amount to aggression. However, if the *false-flag attack that was used as a tool for deception* as such does not qualify as aggression due to the lack of use of armed force, then it can hardly be argued that the very act of deceiving a State into the commission of internationally wrongful conduct can be denoted as aggression either.48\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

LEGAL EFFECTS OF MISATTRIBUTION CAUSED BY CYBER DECEPTION\nOne of the legal issues arising out of the misattribution caused by the deception is the legality of the retaliatory measures directed by the deceived State against the alleged wrongdoer. The legality of such measures depends on their legal character. If the deceived State responds with reciprocal measures, they may also qualify as a violation of the prohibition on intervention or the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other States.⁴⁹ However, retaliatory measures that are otherwise contrary to international obligations may be legal if they qualify as countermeasures or if they fulfil conditions of any of the (other) circumstances precluding wrongfulness.\nIt is the very first basic precondition of any countermeasure that it must be taken in response to a previous internationally wrongful act of another State and must be directed against that State.⁵⁰ This appears problematic in the case where technical evidence and intelligence information acquired by one State point towards another (victim) State as the wrongdoer, but in reality, the author of the false-flag cyber operation was different. Identification of the wrongdoer and attribution in the context of cyber operations is challenging because of the evidentiary and technical⁵¹ peculiarities of cyberspace that make it possible to hide identity and leave false traces.⁵² At the same time, the basic principle is that in bilateral disputes, the onus to establish responsibility lies on the injured State.⁵³ Together with the specific features of cyberspace, high demands are placed on the injured State in the process of attribution of harmful conduct.⁵⁴ Of course, retaliatory measures of the deceived State would also have to fulfil other requirements of countermeasures, namely a previous call upon the allegedly responsible State to fulfil its obligations and offer of negotiations.⁵⁵\n⁴⁹ See the analysis above.\n⁵⁰ Case Concerning the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary v Slovakia), Judgment (1997) para 83; Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 18) commentary to Rule 26, para 6.\n⁵¹ For an overview of possible technical methods of attribution, see Massimiliano Albanese et al., ‘Deceiving Attackers by Creating a Virtual Attack Surface’ in Sushil Jajodia et al.

At the same time, the basic principle is that in bilateral disputes, the onus to establish responsibility lies on the injured State. This places high demands on the injured State with respect to the process of attribution of a harmful conduct.\n⁵³ Draft Articles (n 22) commentary to Chapter V, para 8.\n⁵⁴ Carrying out in-depth investigation and gaining sufficiently convincing evidence may be time-consuming and take even years – see Geiss and Lahmann (n 52) 626. The more sophisticated the adversary, the longer the investigation may be to gain sufficient evidence – see Thomas Rid and Ben Buchanan, ‘Attributing Cyber Attacks’ (2015) 38 The Journal of Strategic Studies 1–2, 32. On the other hand, security and policy considerations may require prompt reaction to deter further cyber incidents.\n⁵⁵ For more details on function and preconditions of countermeasures in the domain of cyberspace, see Geiss and Lahmann (n 52) 628–644, and Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 18) Rules 20–25. Since countermeasures shall not affect the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force, it would also be necessary to assess whether the destruction of a critical infrastructure in State C could not amount to the use of force.

Restrictions apply.\nThe question that is pertinent in the context of cyber deception is the relevance of the mistake of fact that led to misattribution. Mistake of fact plays a role in some areas of international law, such as international criminal law or the law of international treaties.56 With regard to the law of State responsibility, the relevance of mistake of fact can be discussed in relation to the criteria establishing State responsibility, circumstances precluding wrongfulness and arguably in relation to the determination of reparation.57\nWhen considering criteria for the establishment of international responsibility (breach of an international obligation and attribution), a mistake of fact does not play any role since these criteria are objective in nature58 and any subjective considerations are not relevant.59 Once a breach of an international obligation is established and is attributable, it is prima facie sufficient to establish responsibility.60 Fault,61 culpa or dolus of the organs in question is not required unless otherwise provided for by the primary norm in question.62\nThe same applies to the question of the relevance of mistakes of fact with respect to circumstances precluding wrongfulness. First, a mistake of fact does not constitute a stand-alone circumstance precluding wrongfulness recognized in international law, including in cyberspace. Errors or mistakes of fact are absent from the authoritative list of circumstances precluding wrongfulness in the International Law Commission's (ILC) Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.63 Second, a mistake of fact also\n56 Marko Milanovic, ‘Mistakes of Fact When Using Lethal Force in International Law: Part I’ (EJIL: Talk!, 14 January 2020) <https: mistakes-of-fact-when-using-lethal-force-in-international-law-part-i=\"\" www.ejiltalk.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 27 January 2020, and the following parts.\n57 Art 39 of the Draft Articles reflects the rule that conduct of the injured State that contributed to its damage should be considered. Naturally, this does not apply to the wilful conduct or negligence of the wrongdoer (deceived State) and this rule probably cannot be extended to the scenario where it is a wilful act of a third State that contributed to the injury.\n58 There are some subjective elements in the realm of derivative responsibility discussed below (e.g. aid or assistance or coercion). See Crawford (n 22) 405.\n59 ibid 61; Draft Articles (n 22) commentary to art 2, para 3; Mary Ellen O’Connell, The Power &amp; Purpose of International Law: Insights from the Theory &amp; Practice of Enforcement (OUP 2008) 248. For an explanation of a different approach, see Giuseppe Palmisano, ‘Fault’, in Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed) Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (Oxford University Press, updated September 2007) paras 6–14\n60 Crawford (n 22) 61.\n61 O’Connell (n 59) 248.\n62 Crawford (n 22) 61; Draft Articles (n 22) commentary to art 2, para 3.

There are few opinions that a mistake of fact might qualify as a circumstance precluding wrongfulness, but often they are not further elaborated on. See for example Second report on State responsibility, by Mr James Crawford, Special Rapporteur (1994, A/CN.4/498 and Add. 1–4) para 262. An error has significant legal relevance in some other sub-fields of international law, for example as a ground for invalidity of international treaties – see Article 48 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties from 1969, or in the context of international criminal law – see for example art 32 para 1 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court from 1998. See an overview of state practice on the relevance of mistake of facts in various sub-fields of international law in Milanovic (n 56) and the following parts.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

Restrictions apply.\ncannot serve as a ground for the invocation of any of the established circumstances precluding wrongfulness since none of them requires an inquiry into a subjective element, such as fault⁶⁴ or error.⁶⁵ Specifically, with respect to countermeasures, the law of State responsibility is based on an objective standard.⁶⁶ A State resorting to countermeasures does so at its own risk and on the basis of its unilateral assessment of the situation. An incorrect assessment, including in the event of misattribution of malicious cyber operations,⁶⁷ may result in the commission of a wrongful act by the State resorting to countermeasures for which that State would be internationally responsible.⁶⁸ Interestingly, according to the ILC, there is no difference between countermeasures and other circumstances precluding wrongfulness in this respect.⁶⁹ Similarly, also in the context of self-defence, mistake or error of fact is irrelevant as the requirements for invoking self-defence are ‘strict and objective’.⁷⁰\nDepending on the nature, timing and context, the illegality of actions of the deceived State taken against the alleged wrongdoer might in some situations be precluded by the reference to the state of necessity. The point is that actions taken with reference to the plea of necessity need not respond to an internationally wrongful act⁷¹ and can violate the rights of non-responsible States.⁷² However, necessity could only be invoked if it could be established that the reactive measure adopted by the misled State is the only means for the State to safeguard an essential interest (e.g. protection of an electric grid or critical infrastructure)⁷³ against a grave and imminent peril caused by the cyber threat. In light of the above-described objective standard, this can hardly be the case if the victim State is not at all involved in the false-flag attack. But one could imagine a different scenario where a computer network located in the victim State was exploited by the deceiving State and still remains an imminent threat to the critical infrastructure of the deceived State.⁷⁴\nConsequently, even when misattribution is caused by the wilful deception orchestrated by a deceiving State, conditions of international responsibility of the deceived State may be established due to their objective nature. Thus, it seems that rules of\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London. Downloaded on April 08,2025 at 20:51:56 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

Various solutions to the consequences caused by wrongful attribution are of course possible if the deceived and the victim States reach a corresponding agreement (or the victim State does not invoke the responsibility of the deceived State). But that would require a constructive approach and clear establishment of the facts (including technical evidence), which might not be easy to achieve in some political contexts in combination with the complexity of the cybersphere.\n# 6. CONCLUSION\nDeception in cybersphere is a threat and a sophisticated challenge for international security. As this contribution has proven, it also constitutes a legal challenge. The analysis demonstrated that due to the lack of regulation of the issue in international law, it is problematic to identify international law rules that the deceptive action could violate. A possibly applicable principle, the no-harm rule, has been identified; however, its use appears problematic and deserves broader discussion. At the same time, the rules of international responsibility do not allow for the invocation of responsibility of a State that conducted deceptive action for the damage caused by the deceived State to the victim State. Moreover, a mistake of fact on the side of the misled State does not generally alleviate its responsibility for the retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer, since it does not qualify as a distinct circumstance precluding wrongfulness, nor is it relevant for the invocation of any of the recognized circumstances precluding wrongfulness.\nFrom the analysis, it seems apparent that a legal gap exists in international law. Rules of international responsibility address various forms of what is known as derived international responsibility, but deception does not fall into any of them. Legal consequences of misattribution in cyberspace are not sufficiently addressed in the doctrine and the topic appears to pose a challenge for the law of international responsibility. This outcome is not desirable since mistaken attribution may contribute to the destabilization of international peace and security.75 Therefore, States carry a great burden to use all efforts to properly investigate and assess the background of cyber operations they face, and they must very carefully balance the need to\nDelerue (n 36) 190.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

As cyber threats and tactics of their originators develop, so must international law keep moving and prevent exploitation of the rule of law by removing legal gaps surrounding deceptive actions of States. Cyber deception refers to a situation when a State launches a false-flag cyber attack against another State but orchestrates the attack in a way that points towards a third (victim) country as the wrongdoer. The target State then launches retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer. The legal analysis of the proposed contribution focuses on the legality of such deception and responsibility of both its author and the deceived State for damage caused to the victim State. The contribution demonstrates the gap in the rules of international responsibility for holding the orchestrator of deception responsible for the damage caused to a victim State as a consequence of misattribution. It also focuses on the legality of the deception as such. Misleading another State is a matter not per se regulated by international law, but it may result in a violation of the no-harm principle. This principle is recognized as a distinct legal norm in specific areas, but it is unclear whether and how it applies to the cyber domain.

INTRODUCTION Deception is human activity that can take place in various forms or contexts whenever humans interact. This article introduces the concept of cyber deception aimed at causing misattribution and damage to a victim State as a more advanced (in respect of a plurality of parties as well as technical sophistication) form of deception. Apart from the law of armed conflict, deception on the inter-state level is not regulated by international law and does not enjoy the attention of the doctrine of international law so far. However, deception in the cybersphere is a threat and sophisticated challenge for international security due to the technical specifics of this domain and the opportunities this tactic offers. Resorting to false-flag attacks is a matter of concern also for intelligence services¹ and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is committed to addressing modern cyber threats in general.² NATO CCDCOE also prepared a report on mitigation of risks arising from false-flag and no-flag cyber attacks.³ This paper, to the best of the knowledge of the authors, can be considered as one of the first academic legal works that address this phenomenon from the perspective of public international law. It aims to present and legally assess hypothetical deceptive cyber operations intended to damage another State and to initiate expert discussion on this emerging threat.\nCyber deception, as introduced in this contribution, refers to the tactics when a deceiving State launches a cyber operation against another State but orchestrates the attack in a way that points towards a third (victim) country as the wrongdoer. The deceived State may eventually launch retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer, who naturally denies any responsibility for the cyber attack. This can lead to destabilization and conflict between the deceived and the victim States at potentially little cost (political, material and legal) to the deceiving State, unless it is revealed. Confusion and exploitation of the so-called attribution problem may also be examples of the lawfare tactics in the broader hybrid warfare strategy.⁴ The following analysis focuses on the legality of the deceptive conduct orchestrated by the deceiving State with the intent of causing damage to the victim State. As part of that, rules for invocation of responsibility for the conduct of another State ¹ See, for example, the 2020 annual report of the Security Information Service (Czech intelligence and counterintelligence service), ‘Annual Report of the Security Information Service for 2020’ (2021) 18. The US National Security Agency (NSA) and UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) even established a joint advisory group to avoid misattribution. See ‘NSA and NCSC Release Joint Advisory on Turla Group Activity’ (CISA, 23 October 2019) <https: 10=\"\"2019=\"\"21=\"\"current-activity=\"\"nsa-and-ncsc-release-joint-advisory-turla-group-activity=\"\"nsa-and-ncsc-release-joint-advisory-turla-group-activity=\"\"www.cisa.gov=\"\"> accessed 12 January 2022.\n² NATO, ‘Wales Summit Declaration’ (2014) 73.\n³ Mauno Pihelgas, ‘Mitigating Risks arising from False-Flag and No-Flag Cyber Attacks’ (2015) <https: ccdcoc.org=\"\"publications=\"\"mitigating-risks-arising-from-false-flag-and-no-flag-cyber-attacks=\"\"></https:> accessed 12 January 2022.\n⁴ Tomáš Bruner and Martin Faix, ‘The Attribution Problem as a Tool of Lawfare’ (2018) 18(1) Obrana a strategie 79.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

Then, the analysis addresses legal responsibility for cyber retaliation directed against the wrong target due to misattribution. Whether a mistake of fact can alleviate the international responsibility of the deceived State towards the victim State is examined. This paper does not focus in detail on the rules of attribution.5 The following analysis demonstrates that rules for international responsibility are not sufficient to invoke responsibility on a State that misled another State and caused damage to a victim State. The paper also shows that an error on the side of the misled State does not generally alleviate its responsibility for the retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer. The paper presents the view that the act of deception as such is not in contradiction with any of the established primary rules of general international law.\nBased on that, the contribution calls for further academic discussion and points to other legal concepts that might apply to the act of deception. As cyber threats and the tactics of their originators develop, so must international law keep moving and prevent exploitation of the rule of law by removing legal gaps surrounding deceptive actions.\n## 2. CONCEPT OF CYBER DECEPTION Deceptions are commonly encountered in everyday life in economic interactions, sport, politics, diplomacy. Deception can be defined as an interaction between two parties in which the deceiver successfully causes the target to accept as true a specific incorrect version of reality, with the intent of causing the target to act in a way that benefits the deceiver.6 On various levels of inter-state relations, deception may also be utilized as a strategy by States pursuing their interests (be it on the level of diplomacy, negotiation, the conclusion of strategic agreements, etc.). Naturally, deception is also a method used for gaining a military advantage in the theatre of operations during hostilities. From a different angle, the concept of deception is also an important part of the cyber security defence strategies in the information technology sector.7 This article introduces and focuses on the concept of cyber deception aimed at causing misattribution and damage to a victim State as a more advanced (in respect of a plurality of parties as well as technical sophistication) form of deception.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

Restrictions apply.\n\nIn a hypothetical scenario, a deceiving State may decide to conduct a harmful cyber operation against another State and include deceptive elements to orchestrate wrongful attribution of this operation to a third, victim State. The aim of the deceiving State would be that misattribution of such a false-flag cyber operation would be followed by retaliatory measures of the deceived State against the victim State. If the desired consequences of the false-flag operation materialize, the deceived State can resort to various measures against the alleged wrongdoer, ranging from diplomatic and political actions, economic countermeasures, to retaliatory measures in cyberspace. This can lead to destabilization and conflict between the deceived and the victim States with potentially little cost (political, material and legal) for the deceiving State, unless it is revealed.\nThere are multiple technical methods of execution of this modus operandi. With respect to the target of the false-flag cyber operation, examples from the practice show that the malware used against the deceived State may be designed to cause significant damage, for example, to the State's critical infrastructures. An example of such damage comes from 2015 when Ukraine's electric power grid was hit by damage to servers and workstations of a national control centre and sub-centres. The preparation phase of the attack was devoted to the spear-phishing campaign, infecting relevant machines and opening a backdoor for the destructive malware by deleting critical system files, which finally resulted in temporary loss of control over the distribution of power across the country and local power outages.⁸ Targeting of infrastructures, such as the electric power grid, is especially perilous, as severe damage may lead to a chain of further consequences, such as the inoperability of essential State infrastructure or government services.\nConcerning the methods used for deception, the cyberspace domain offers various technical possibilities for concealment and deception.⁹ For this primarily legal study, it is sufficient to mention that the practice has already shown that malware used for false-flag cyber attack may be created in such a way as to point towards another State or actor. The deceiving State may include specific segments of codes and combine them in a way to allow the deceived State to identify false, but persuasive, traces leading to the victim State.¹⁰ The alleged origin of the cyber incident may also be indirectly supported by false information acquired by intelligence agencies and by the contextual elements (e.g. if the relations between the deceived and the victim States are unfriendly in general or if there has already been a real incident between them) ⁸ See for example Kim Zetter, ‘Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid’ (Wired, 3 March 2016) <https: 03=\"\"2016=\"\"inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid=\"\"www.wired.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 September 2021.\n⁹ See for example Florian Skopik and Timea Pahi, ‘Under false flag: using technical artifacts for cyber attack attribution’ (2020) 3 Cybersecurity <https: 10.1186=\"\"articles=\"\"cybersecurity.springeropen.com=\"\"s42400-020-00048-4=\"\"> accessed 10 January 2022.\n¹⁰ ibid 14.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

However, as mentioned previously, the practice has already shown some relevant examples of cyber deception utilised by State or State-related actors that were made public. There are reported incidents where China or Russia designed their false-flag attack in such a way as to point to Iran or a non-State actor. Probably more publicly known is the Olympic Destroyer malware, which targeted computers used by officials, athletes and visitors during the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang. The operation bore several features previously attributed to cyber espionage and sabotage actors allegedly based in or working for China and North Korea (known as the Lazarus group). Subsequently, it was revealed that a Russian foreign military intelligence (GRU) unit was behind the operation. \nA successful deception operation and the materialization of its purpose consists of two distinct acts of two actors: the false-flag operation carried out by the deceiving State against the deceived State (incident 1) and possible retaliatory measures of the latter against the victim State as the alleged wrongdoer (incident 2). The following text will legally analyse both elements.\n\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London. Downloaded on April 08,2025 at 20:51:56 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

LEGAL EFFECTS OF CYBER DECEPTION (INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONDUCT OF THE DECEIVED STATE) Under current international law, it is only the law of armed conflict that addresses specific forms of deception. Article 37 of the Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions and Article 21 of the Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions state that ruses of war are not generally prohibited. However, these provisions and customary international law prohibit perfidy.[17] In general, the question of legal consequences of a false-flag cyber operation must be divided into two separate questions: responsibility for the conduct against the deceived State (depending on the nature of the false-flag attack) and responsibility for the damage caused to the victim State.\nConcerning the former in cases of an attack against a power grid, launching a cyber operation that causes loss of control over the distribution of power across the territory of another State and local power outages can lead to the loss of functionality of that State's critical infrastructure and e-government systems, significantly reducing its capability to serve its inherently governmental functions and its ability to conduct its affairs freely. Such a cyber operation may therefore amount to a breach of the prohibition on intervention and the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other States.[18] According to some experts, the mere disruption and malfunctioning of the cyberinfrastructure of another State may already qualify as a violation of territorial sovereignty.[19] The fact that causation of physical consequences even by remote means can be inconsistent with these rules seems to be generally accepted.[20] Moreover, if an armed conflict exists between the two States, an extensive attack on the electric power grid may also result, depending on circumstance, in a violation of the law of armed conflict. However, a more challenging question arises as to whether the State orchestrating the deception may be internationally responsible for the wrongful conduct committed by the deceived State towards the victim State. In other words, is it possible, and if so, on what grounds, for the victim State to invoke the responsibility of the author of the deception for the consequences caused by the retaliatory measures of the deceived State? The rules on State responsibility contain legal constructions on how a State can incur responsibility in connection with the wrongful conduct of another State. These rules also apply to cyberspace.²¹ According to the principle of independent responsibility, each State is responsible for its own internationally wrongful conduct.²² However, a joint or collective wrongful act may lead to a plurality of responsible States.²³ Moreover, a State may also be responsible for a wrongful act of another State if it is implicated in the conduct of that other State. International law recognizes several forms of derived international responsibility:²⁴ aid or assistance (to assist in the commission of a wrongful act by another State),²⁵ direction or control (over the commission of an internationally wrongful act of another State)²⁶ and coercion (of another State to commit an internationally wrongful act).²⁷ These forms of implication have in common that the specific nature of the relationship between the State that is the actual author of the unlawful act and the implicated State causes the incurrence of responsibility of the latter.²⁸ The assisting State will typically not be responsible for the assisted wrongful act,²⁹ but for a distinct wrongful act – that is, deliberately assisting another State in breaching an international obligation by which they are both bound.³⁰ In contrast, the exercise of direction and control or coercion by one State over the commission of an internationally wrongful act by another incurs responsibility for the (directed or coerced) act itself³¹ towards the injured State.³² The coerced State might benefit from force majeure if the requirements are met.³³ In that case, it would be only the State exerting coercion that would bear responsibility.³⁴ ²² James Crawford, *State Responsibility: The General Part* 333; Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 2001, vol.

This form of indirect responsibility is rare, belligerent occupation being one of the few examples. A distinction must be made from the situation where an organ of one State has been placed at the disposal of another State. Upon certain conditions, acts of this organ might be attributable to the latter State.

(eds), *The Law of International Responsibility* 284.\n²⁹ In situations where aid or assistance is an essential and integral element of the assisted State’s operation, the assisting State may be responsible for the assisted conduct. Responsibility of the assisting State therefore attaches for the extent of its contribution.

Restrictions apply.\nThe problem is that the commission of the deceptive false-flag cyber operation as described above does not fit any of the recognized forms of the implication of international responsibility for the conduct of the deceived State. The nature of the relationship between the deceiving and the deceived States does not qualify as aid or assistance since the deceived State was not aware of the origin of the false-flag operation and intent of the deceiving State. In the situation where the deceived State misattributes the false-flag attack, there is also probably no relationship of dependence that would amount to direction or control.35 Finally, that State is also not typically coerced to engage in retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer, as it was not deprived of its freedom of action.36 Consequently, the victim State cannot invoke the responsibility of the deceiving State for the consequences caused by the retaliatory measures of the deceived State.\n# 4. LEGALITY OF THE ACT OF DECEPTION Deception can also be approached from a different perspective, when the focus is not on the question of international responsibility and retaliatory measures of the deceived State but on the legal assessment of the very act of deception. In other words, it can be asked whether misleading a State into the commission of an internationally wrongful act against another State may itself amount to a breach of international law. Answering this question is a challenging undertaking. Deception is a matter not, per se, regulated by international law. Thus, it appears problematic to identify the rules of general international law that such conduct may be in contradiction with.37 International law contains a principle according to which a State must not knowingly allow its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States (sic utere tuo (no-harm) principle).38 Max Huber even argued that a State bears the obligation to protect within its territory the rights of other States, including their integrity and inviolability.39 This principle is recognized as a limitation of State sovereignty40 and Authorized licensed use limited to: University College London. Downloaded on April 08,2025 at 20:51:56 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply.\nin specific areas (in particular in international environmental law) as a distinct legal norm.41 However, it is a question of whether this principle constitutes a stand-alone legal rule applicable in the cyber context, thus outside the context of international environmental law where the principle originally evolved.42 Several authors claim that the obligation not to allow one State’s territory to be used contrary to the rights of another State is now part of customary international law, even in relation to cyberspace.43 The *sic utere tuo* principle is often characterized as an obligation of due diligence nature.44 Under the due diligence standard, a State is responsible if it knew about a cyber operation carried out from its territory, where the operation was contrary to the rights of another State and it failed to take feasible measures to prevent it.45 That might in some situations ease the burden of the victim State to prove attribution as it would be enough to prove that the deceiving State’s territory was used for the false-flag operation and that the deceiving State must have been aware of that and failed to prevent such event.46 However, the application of the no-harm principle raises several questions, such as the identification of the harm caused to the victim State and whether the harm originates from the territory of the deceiving State.47 Can the causing of misattribution constitute a violation of the misled State’s rights and amount to harm? Or is it the eventual damage caused to the third (victim) State by retaliatory measures adopted by the misled State that can be seen as the harm? If the former is correct, this harm can be understood as originating from the territory of the deceiving State since its false-flag attack caused it. However, if the latter is correct, it has to be asked whether the harm caused by the retaliatory measures is to be understood as originating from the territory of the deceiving State since it is also the result of the sovereign decision of the *deceived* State (although caused by deception).\nFinally, one might also consider whether orchestration of the deception can or cannot amount to aggression. However, if the *false-flag attack that was used as a tool for deception* as such does not qualify as aggression due to the lack of use of armed force, then it can hardly be argued that the very act of deceiving a State into the commission of internationally wrongful conduct can be denoted as aggression either.48 Authorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

LEGAL EFFECTS OF MISATTRIBUTION CAUSED BY CYBER DECEPTION\nOne of the legal issues arising out of the misattribution caused by the deception is the legality of the retaliatory measures directed by the deceived State against the alleged wrongdoer. The legality of such measures depends on their legal character. If the deceived State responds with reciprocal measures, they may also qualify as a violation of the prohibition on intervention or the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other States.⁴⁹ However, retaliatory measures that are otherwise contrary to international obligations may be legal if they qualify as countermeasures or if they fulfil conditions of any of the (other) circumstances precluding wrongfulness.\nIt is the very first basic precondition of any countermeasure that it must be taken in response to a previous internationally wrongful act of another State and must be directed against that State.⁵⁰ This appears problematic in the case where technical evidence and intelligence information acquired by one State point towards another (victim) State as the wrongdoer, but in reality, the author of the false-flag cyber operation was different. Identification of the wrongdoer and attribution in the context of cyber operations is challenging because of the evidentiary and technical⁵¹ peculiarities of cyberspace that make it possible to hide identity and leave false traces.⁵² At the same time, the basic principle is that in bilateral disputes, the onus to establish responsibility lies on the injured State.⁵³ Together with the specific features of cyberspace, high demands are placed on the injured State in the process of attribution of harmful conduct.⁵⁴ Of course, retaliatory measures of the deceived State would also have to fulfil other requirements of countermeasures, namely a previous call upon the allegedly responsible State to fulfil its obligations and offer of negotiations.⁵⁵\n⁴⁹ See the analysis above.\n⁵⁰ Case Concerning the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary v Slovakia), Judgment (1997) para 83; Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 18) commentary to Rule 26, para 6.\n⁵¹ For an overview of possible technical methods of attribution, see Massimiliano Albanese et al., ‘Deceiving Attackers by Creating a Virtual Attack Surface’ in Sushil Jajodia et al. (eds), Cyber Deception: Building the Scientific Foundation  150–151.\n⁵² Robin Geiss and Henning Lahmann, ‘Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Shifting the Focus Away from Military Responses Towards Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention’ in Katharina Ziolkowski (ed), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace  625–626. At the same time, the basic principle is that in bilateral disputes, the onus to establish responsibility lies on the injured State. This places high demands on the injured State with respect to the process of attribution of a harmful conduct.\n⁵³ Draft Articles (n 22) commentary to Chapter V, para 8.\n⁵⁴ Carrying out in-depth investigation and gaining sufficiently convincing evidence may be time-consuming and take even years – see Geiss and Lahmann (n 52) 626. The more sophisticated the adversary, the longer the investigation may be to gain sufficient evidence – see Thomas Rid and Ben Buchanan, ‘Attributing Cyber Attacks’ (2015) 38 The Journal of Strategic Studies 1–2, 32. On the other hand, security and policy considerations may require prompt reaction to deter further cyber incidents.\n⁵⁵ For more details on function and preconditions of countermeasures in the domain of cyberspace, see Geiss and Lahmann (n 52) 628–644, and Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 18) Rules 20–25. Since countermeasures shall not affect the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force, it would also be necessary to assess whether the destruction of a critical infrastructure in State C could not amount to the use of force. See Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v United States of America), Judgment (1986) para 249; Draft Articles (n 22) art 50 para 1 letter a).\n\nThe question that is pertinent in the context of cyber deception is the relevance of the mistake of fact that led to misattribution. Mistake of fact plays a role in some areas of international law, such as international criminal law or the law of international treaties.56 With regard to the law of State responsibility, the relevance of mistake of fact can be discussed in relation to the criteria establishing State responsibility, circumstances precluding wrongfulness and arguably in relation to the determination of reparation.57 When considering criteria for the establishment of international responsibility (breach of an international obligation and attribution), a mistake of fact does not play any role since these criteria are objective in nature58 and any subjective considerations are not relevant.59 Once a breach of an international obligation is established and is attributable, it is prima facie sufficient to establish responsibility.60 Fault,61 culpa or dolus of the organs in question is not required unless otherwise provided for by the primary norm in question.62 The same applies to the question of the relevance of mistakes of fact with respect to circumstances precluding wrongfulness. First, a mistake of fact does not constitute a stand-alone circumstance precluding wrongfulness recognized in international law, including in cyberspace. Errors or mistakes of fact are absent from the authoritative list of circumstances precluding wrongfulness in the International Law Commission's (ILC) Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.63 Second, a mistake of fact also Authorized licensed use limited to: University College London. Downloaded on April 08,2025 at 20:51:56 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

In light of the above-described objective standard, this can hardly be the case if the victim State is not at all involved in the false-flag attack.

CONCLUSION Deception in cybersphere is a threat and a sophisticated challenge for international security. As this contribution has proven, it also constitutes a legal challenge. The analysis demonstrated that due to the lack of regulation of the issue in international law, it is problematic to identify international law rules that the deceptive action could violate. A possibly applicable principle, the no-harm rule, has been identified; however, its use appears problematic and deserves broader discussion. At the same time, the rules of international responsibility do not allow for the invocation of responsibility of a State that conducted deceptive action for the damage caused by the deceived State to the victim State. Moreover, a mistake of fact on the side of the misled State does not generally alleviate its responsibility for the retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer, since it does not qualify as a distinct circumstance precluding wrongfulness, nor is it relevant for the invocation of any of the recognized circumstances precluding wrongfulness.\nFrom the analysis, it seems apparent that a legal gap exists in international law. Rules of international responsibility address various forms of what is known as derived international responsibility, but deception does not fall into any of them. Legal consequences of misattribution in cyberspace are not sufficiently addressed in the doctrine and the topic appears to pose a challenge for the law of international responsibility. This outcome is not desirable since mistaken attribution may contribute to the destabilization of international peace and security.75 Therefore, States carry a great burden to use all efforts to properly investigate and assess the background of cyber operations they face, and they must very carefully balance the need to Delerue (n 36) 190.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

This article introduces the concept of cyber deception aimed at causing misattribution and damage to a victim State as a more advanced (in respect of a plurality of parties as well as technical sophistication) form of deception. Apart from the law of armed conflict, deception on the inter-state level is not regulated by international law and does not enjoy the attention of the doctrine of international law so far. However, deception in the cybersphere is a threat and sophisticated challenge for international security due to the technical specifics of this domain and the opportunities this tactic offers. Resorting to false-flag attacks is a matter of concern also for intelligence services¹ and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is committed to addressing modern cyber threats in general.² NATO CCDCOE also prepared a report on mitigation of risks arising from false-flag and no-flag cyber attacks.³ This paper, to the best of the knowledge of the authors, can be considered as one of the first academic legal works that address this phenomenon from the perspective of public international law. It aims to present and legally assess hypothetical deceptive cyber operations intended to damage another State and to initiate expert discussion on this emerging threat.\n\nCyber deception, as introduced in this contribution, refers to the tactics when a deceiving State launches a cyber operation against another State but orchestrates the attack in a way that points towards a third (victim) country as the wrongdoer. The deceived State may eventually launch retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer, who naturally denies any responsibility for the cyber attack. This can lead to destabilization and conflict between the deceived and the victim States at potentially little cost (political, material and legal) to the deceiving State, unless it is revealed. Confusion and exploitation of the so-called attribution problem may also be examples of the lawfare tactics in the broader hybrid warfare strategy.⁴ The following analysis focuses on the legality of the deceptive conduct orchestrated by the deceiving State with the intent of causing damage to the victim State. As part of that, rules for invocation of responsibility for the conduct of another State ¹ See, for example, the 2020 annual report of the Security Information Service (Czech intelligence and counterintelligence service), ‘Annual Report of the Security Information Service for 2020’ (2021) 18.

Then, the analysis addresses legal responsibility for cyber retaliation directed against the wrong target due to misattribution. Whether a mistake of fact can alleviate the international responsibility of the deceived State towards the victim State is examined. This paper does not focus in detail on the rules of attribution.5 The following analysis demonstrates that rules for international responsibility are not sufficient to invoke responsibility on a State that misled another State and caused damage to a victim State. The paper also shows that an error on the side of the misled State does not generally alleviate its responsibility for the retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer. The paper presents the view that the act of deception as such is not in contradiction with any of the established primary rules of general international law.\nBased on that, the contribution calls for further academic discussion and points to other legal concepts that might apply to the act of deception. As cyber threats and the tactics of their originators develop, so must international law keep moving and prevent exploitation of the rule of law by removing legal gaps surrounding deceptive actions.\n\n---\n\n## # 5. LEGAL EFFECTS OF MISATTRIBUTION CAUSED BY CYBER DECEPTION\n\nOne of the legal issues arising out of the misattribution caused by the deception is the legality of the retaliatory measures directed by the deceived State against the alleged wrongdoer. The legality of such measures depends on their legal character. If the deceived State responds with reciprocal measures, they may also qualify as a violation of the prohibition on intervention or the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other States.⁴⁹ However, retaliatory measures that are otherwise contrary to international obligations may be legal if they qualify as countermeasures or if they fulfil conditions of any of the (other) circumstances precluding wrongfulness.\nIt is the very first basic precondition of any countermeasure that it must be taken in response to a previous internationally wrongful act of another State and must be directed against that State.⁵⁰ This appears problematic in the case where technical evidence and intelligence information acquired by one State point towards another (victim) State as the wrongdoer, but in reality, the author of the false-flag cyber operation was different. Identification of the wrongdoer and attribution in the context of cyber operations is challenging because of the evidentiary and technical⁵¹ peculiarities of cyberspace that make it possible to hide identity and leave false traces.⁵² At the same time, the basic principle is that in bilateral disputes, the onus to establish responsibility lies on the injured State.⁵³ Together with the specific features of cyberspace, high demands are placed on the injured State in the process of attribution of harmful conduct.⁵⁴ Of course, retaliatory measures of the deceived State would also have to fulfil other requirements of countermeasures, namely a previous call upon the allegedly responsible State to fulfil its obligations and offer of negotiations.⁵⁵\n⁴⁹ See the analysis above.\n⁵⁰ Case Concerning the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary v Slovakia), Judgment (1997) para 83; Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 18) commentary to Rule 26, para 6.\n⁵¹ For an overview of possible technical methods of attribution, see Massimiliano Albanese et al., ‘Deceiving Attackers by Creating a Virtual Attack Surface’ in Sushil Jajodia et al. (eds), Cyber Deception: Building the Scientific Foundation  150–151.\n⁵² Robin Geiss and Henning Lahmann, ‘Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Shifting the Focus Away from Military Responses Towards Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention’ in Katharina Ziolkowski (ed), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace  625–626. At the same time, the basic principle is that in bilateral disputes, the onus to establish responsibility lies on the injured State. This places high demands on the injured State with respect to the process of attribution of a harmful conduct.\n⁵³ Draft Articles (n 22) commentary to Chapter V, para 8.\n⁵⁴ Carrying out in-depth investigation and gaining sufficiently convincing evidence may be time-consuming and take even years – see Geiss and Lahmann (n 52) 626. The more sophisticated the adversary, the longer the investigation may be to gain sufficient evidence – see Thomas Rid and Ben Buchanan, ‘Attributing Cyber Attacks’ (2015) 38 The Journal of Strategic Studies 1–2, 32. On the other hand, security and policy considerations may require prompt reaction to deter further cyber incidents.\n⁵⁵ For more details on function and preconditions of countermeasures in the domain of cyberspace, see Geiss and Lahmann (n 52) 628–644, and Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 18) Rules 20–25. Since countermeasures shall not affect the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force, it would also be necessary to assess whether the destruction of a critical infrastructure in State C could not amount to the use of force. See Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v United States of America), Judgment (1986) para 249; Draft Articles (n 22) art 50 para 1 letter a).\nThe question that is pertinent in the context of cyber deception is the relevance of the mistake of fact that led to misattribution. Mistake of fact plays a role in some areas of international law, such as international criminal law or the law of international treaties.56 With regard to the law of State responsibility, the relevance of mistake of fact can be discussed in relation to the criteria establishing State responsibility, circumstances precluding wrongfulness and arguably in relation to the determination of reparation.57 When considering criteria for the establishment of international responsibility (breach of an international obligation and attribution), a mistake of fact does not play any role since these criteria are objective in nature58 and any subjective considerations are not relevant.59 Once a breach of an international obligation is established and is attributable, it is prima facie sufficient to establish responsibility.60 Fault,61 culpa or dolus of the organs in question is not required unless otherwise provided for by the primary norm in question.62 The same applies to the question of the relevance of mistakes of fact with respect to circumstances precluding wrongfulness. First, a mistake of fact does not constitute a stand-alone circumstance precluding wrongfulness recognized in international law, including in cyberspace. Errors or mistakes of fact are absent from the authoritative list of circumstances precluding wrongfulness in the International Law Commission's (ILC) Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.63 Second, a mistake of fact also Authorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

LEGALITY OF THE ACT OF DECEPTION Deception can also be approached from a different perspective, when the focus is not on the question of international responsibility and retaliatory measures of the deceived State but on the legal assessment of the very act of deception. In other words, it can be asked whether misleading a State into the commission of an internationally wrongful act against another State may itself amount to a breach of international law. Answering this question is a challenging undertaking. Deception is a matter not, per se, regulated by international law. Thus, it appears problematic to identify the rules of general international law that such conduct may be in contradiction with.37 International law contains a principle according to which a State must not knowingly allow its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States (sic utere tuo (no-harm) principle).38 Max Huber even argued that a State bears the obligation to protect within its territory the rights of other States, including their integrity and inviolability.39 This principle is recognized as a limitation of State sovereignty40 and Authorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

CONCEPT OF CYBER DECEPTION\n\nDeceptions are commonly encountered in everyday life in economic interactions, sport, politics, diplomacy. Deception can be defined as an interaction between two parties in which the deceiver successfully causes the target to accept as true a specific incorrect version of reality, with the intent of causing the target to act in a way that benefits the deceiver.6\n\nOn various levels of inter-state relations, deception may also be utilized as a strategy by States pursuing their interests (be it on the level of diplomacy, negotiation, the conclusion of strategic agreements, etc.). Naturally, deception is also a method used for gaining a military advantage in the theatre of operations during hostilities. From a different angle, the concept of deception is also an important part of the cyber security defence strategies in the information technology sector.7 This article introduces and focuses on the concept of cyber deception aimed at causing misattribution and damage to a victim State as a more advanced (in respect of a plurality of parties as well as technical sophistication) form of deception.\n\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London. Downloaded on April 08,2025 at 20:51:56 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply.\n\n5 The issue of attribution is even more challenging in situations where a State uses non-state actors as proxies for the conduct of malicious cyber operations.\n\n6 Neil C Rowe and John E Custy, ‘Deception in Cyber-Attacks’ in Andrew Colarik and Lech Janczewski (eds), Cyber War and Cyber Terrorism (Idea Group 2007) 91.\n\n7 Kristin E Heckman et al. (eds), Cyber Denial, Deception and Counter Deception: A Framework for Supporting Active Cyber Defence (Springer 2015) – addressing deception as a strategy and technical method of resisting and eliminating cyber intrusions.",
    "In a hypothetical scenario, a deceiving State may decide to conduct a harmful cyber operation against another State and include deceptive elements to orchestrate wrongful attribution of this operation to a third, victim State. The aim of the deceiving State would be that misattribution of such a false-flag cyber operation would be followed by retaliatory measures of the deceived State against the victim State. If the desired consequences of the false-flag operation materialize, the deceived State can resort to various measures against the alleged wrongdoer, ranging from diplomatic and political actions, economic countermeasures, to retaliatory measures in cyberspace. This can lead to destabilization and conflict between the deceived and the victim States with potentially little cost (political, material and legal) for the deceiving State, unless it is revealed.\n\nThere are multiple technical methods of execution of this modus operandi. With respect to the target of the false-flag cyber operation, examples from the practice show that the malware used against the deceived State may be designed to cause significant damage, for example, to the State's critical infrastructures. An example of such damage comes from 2015 when Ukraine's electric power grid was hit by damage to servers and workstations of a national control centre and sub-centres. The preparation phase of the attack was devoted to the spear-phishing campaign, infecting relevant machines and opening a backdoor for the destructive malware by deleting critical system files, which finally resulted in temporary loss of control over the distribution of power across the country and local power outages.⁸ Targeting of infrastructures, such as the electric power grid, is especially perilous, as severe damage may lead to a chain of further consequences, such as the inoperability of essential State infrastructure or government services.\n\nConcerning the methods used for deception, the cyberspace domain offers various technical possibilities for concealment and deception.⁹ For this primarily legal study, it is sufficient to mention that the practice has already shown that malware used for false-flag cyber attack may be created in such a way as to point towards another State or actor. The deceiving State may include specific segments of codes and combine them in a way to allow the deceived State to identify false, but persuasive, traces leading to the victim State.¹⁰ The alleged origin of the cyber incident may also be indirectly supported by false information acquired by intelligence agencies and by the contextual elements (e.g. if the relations between the deceived and the victim States are unfriendly in general or if there has already been a real incident between them)\n\n⁸ See for example Kim Zetter, ‘Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid’ (Wired, 3 March 2016) <https: 03=\"\" 2016=\"\" inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 September 2021.\n\n⁹ See for example Florian Skopik and Timea Pahi, ‘Under false flag: using technical artifacts for cyber attack attribution’ (2020) 3 Cybersecurity <https: 10.1186=\"\" articles=\"\" cybersecurity.springeropen.com=\"\" s42400-020-00048-4=\"\"> accessed 10 January 2022.\n\n¹⁰ ibid 14.\n\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

    "as attribution in cyberspace is mainly based on technical analysis of the attack and all-source analysis.[11]\n\nDue to its design (where deception is successful) or because of the policy and security considerations of the targeted State that revealed the true origin of the false-flag attack, the frequency of incidents of false-flag attacks is hidden under the veil of mystery. However, as mentioned previously, the practice has already shown some relevant examples of cyber deception utilised by State or State-related actors that were made public. There are reported incidents where China or Russia designed their false-flag attack in such a way as to point to Iran $^{12}$  or a non-State actor. $^{13}$  Probably more publicly known is the Olympic Destroyer malware, which targeted computers used by officials, athletes and visitors during the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang. $^{14}$  The operation bore several features previously attributed to cyber espionage and sabotage actors allegedly based in or working for China and North Korea (known as the Lazarus group). $^{15}$  Subsequently, it was revealed that a Russian foreign military intelligence (GRU) unit was behind the operation. $^{16}$\n\nA successful deception operation and the materialization of its purpose consists of two distinct acts of two actors: the false-flag operation carried out by the deceiving State against the deceived State (incident 1) and possible retaliatory measures of the latter against the victim State as the alleged wrongdoer (incident 2).

    "# 3. LEGAL EFFECTS OF CYBER DECEPTION (INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONDUCT OF THE DECEIVED STATE)\n\nUnder current international law, it is only the law of armed conflict that addresses specific forms of deception. Article 37 of the Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions and Article 21 of the Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions state that ruses of war are not generally prohibited. However, these provisions and customary international law prohibit perfidy.[17]\n\nIn general, the question of legal consequences of a false-flag cyber operation must be divided into two separate questions: responsibility for the conduct against the deceived State (depending on the nature of the false-flag attack) and responsibility for the damage caused to the victim State.\n\nConcerning the former in cases of an attack against a power grid, launching a cyber operation that causes loss of control over the distribution of power across the territory of another State and local power outages can lead to the loss of functionality of that State's critical infrastructure and e-government systems, significantly reducing its capability to serve its inherently governmental functions and its ability to conduct its affairs freely. Such a cyber operation may therefore amount to a breach of the prohibition on intervention and the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other States.[18] According to some experts, the mere disruption and malfunctioning of the cyberinfrastructure of another State may already qualify as a violation of territorial sovereignty.[19] The fact that causation of physical consequences even by remote means can be inconsistent with these rules seems to be generally accepted.[20] Moreover, if an armed conflict exists between the two States, an extensive attack on the electric power grid may also result, depending on circumstance, in a violation of the law of armed conflict. However, a more challenging question arises as to whether the State orchestrating the deception may be internationally responsible for the wrongful conduct committed by the deceived State towards the victim State. In other words, is it possible, and if so, on what grounds, for the victim State to invoke the responsibility of the author of the deception for the consequences caused by the retaliatory measures of the deceived State? The rules on State responsibility contain legal constructions\n\n210\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London. Downloaded on April 08,2025 at 20:51:56 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

    "on how a State can incur responsibility in connection with the wrongful conduct of another State. These rules also apply to cyberspace.²¹\n\nAccording to the principle of independent responsibility, each State is responsible for its own internationally wrongful conduct.²² However, a joint or collective wrongful act may lead to a plurality of responsible States.²³ Moreover, a State may also be responsible for a wrongful act of another State if it is implicated in the conduct of that other State. International law recognizes several forms of derived international responsibility:²⁴ aid or assistance (to assist in the commission of a wrongful act by another State),²⁵ direction or control (over the commission of an internationally wrongful act of another State)²⁶ and coercion (of another State to commit an internationally wrongful act).²⁷ These forms of implication have in common that the specific nature of the relationship between the State that is the actual author of the unlawful act and the implicated State causes the incurrence of responsibility of the latter.²⁸ The assisting State will typically not be responsible for the assisted wrongful act,²⁹ but for a distinct wrongful act – that is, deliberately assisting another State in breaching an international obligation by which they are both bound.³⁰ In contrast, the exercise of direction and control or coercion by one State over the commission of an internationally wrongful act by another incurs responsibility for the (directed or coerced) act itself³¹ towards the injured State.³² The coerced State might benefit from force majeure if the requirements are met.³³ In that case, it would be only the State exerting coercion that would bear responsibility.³⁴\n\n²² James Crawford, *State Responsibility: The General Part* (CUP 2013) 333; Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 2001, vol.

    "The problem is that the commission of the deceptive false-flag cyber operation as described above does not fit any of the recognized forms of the implication of international responsibility for the conduct of the deceived State. The nature of the relationship between the deceiving and the deceived States does not qualify as aid or assistance since the deceived State was not aware of the origin of the false-flag operation and intent of the deceiving State. In the situation where the deceived State misattributes the false-flag attack, there is also probably no relationship of dependence that would amount to direction or control.35 Finally, that State is also not typically coerced to engage in retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer, as it was not deprived of its freedom of action.36 Consequently, the victim State cannot invoke the responsibility of the deceiving State for the consequences caused by the retaliatory measures of the deceived State.\n\n# 4. LEGALITY OF THE ACT OF DECEPTION\n\nDeception can also be approached from a different perspective, when the focus is not on the question of international responsibility and retaliatory measures of the deceived State but on the legal assessment of the very act of deception. In other words, it can be asked whether misleading a State into the commission of an internationally wrongful act against another State may itself amount to a breach of international law. Answering this question is a challenging undertaking. Deception is a matter not, per se, regulated by international law. Thus, it appears problematic to identify the rules of general international law that such conduct may be in contradiction with.37\n\nInternational law contains a principle according to which a State must not knowingly allow its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States (sic utere tuo (no-harm) principle).38 Max Huber even argued that a State bears the obligation to protect within its territory the rights of other States, including their integrity and inviolability.39 This principle is recognized as a limitation of State sovereignty40 and\n\n35 ibid 287–288. Notably, the mere incitement is not unlawful in the law of State responsibility.\n36 Derived responsibility may be relevant, for example, when a State knowingly provides its cyberinfrastructure to another State for the commission of a wrongful act by the latter may incur international responsibility for such assistance (Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 18) commentary to Rule 18, para 6). Derivative responsibility may also be relevant when cyber operation is conducted through computer networks infected and used remotely without the free will of the territorial State (e.g. botnets used against Estonia in 2007) – see François Delerue, Cyber Operations and International Law (CUP 2020) 307.\n37 Deception may constitute a breach of obligations existing between the States concerned, such as multilateral or bilateral treaties on friendship and cooperation, but the existence and content of such obligations may vary. This contribution, therefore, focuses on obligations stemming from general international law.\n38 The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania), Judgment (1949) para 22.\n39 Jutta Brunnée, ‘Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas’, in Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed) Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (Oxford University Press, updated March 2010) para 6, referring to Palmas Island Arbitration.\n40 ibid paras 1, 4, 9.\n\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

    "in specific areas (in particular in international environmental law) as a distinct legal norm.41 However, it is a question of whether this principle constitutes a stand-alone legal rule applicable in the cyber context, thus outside the context of international environmental law where the principle originally evolved.42 Several authors claim that the obligation not to allow one State’s territory to be used contrary to the rights of another State is now part of customary international law, even in relation to cyberspace.43\n\nThe *sic utere tuo* principle is often characterized as an obligation of due diligence nature.44 Under the due diligence standard, a State is responsible if it knew about a cyber operation carried out from its territory, where the operation was contrary to the rights of another State and it failed to take feasible measures to prevent it.45 That might in some situations ease the burden of the victim State to prove attribution as it would be enough to prove that the deceiving State’s territory was used for the false-flag operation and that the deceiving State must have been aware of that and failed to prevent such event.46\n\nHowever, the application of the no-harm principle raises several questions, such as the identification of the harm caused to the victim State and whether the harm originates from the territory of the deceiving State.47 Can the causing of misattribution constitute a violation of the misled State’s rights and amount to harm? Or is it the eventual damage caused to the third (victim) State by retaliatory measures adopted by the misled State that can be seen as the harm? If the former is correct, this harm can be understood as originating from the territory of the deceiving State since its false-flag attack caused it. However, if the latter is correct, it has to be asked whether the harm caused by the retaliatory measures is to be understood as originating from the territory of the deceiving State since it is also the result of the sovereign decision of the *deceived* State (although caused by deception).\n\nFinally, one might also consider whether orchestration of the deception can or cannot amount to aggression. However, if the *false-flag attack that was used as a tool for deception* as such does not qualify as aggression due to the lack of use of armed force, then it can hardly be argued that the very act of deceiving a State into the commission of internationally wrongful conduct can be denoted as aggression either.48\n\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

    "# 5. LEGAL EFFECTS OF MISATTRIBUTION CAUSED BY CYBER DECEPTION\n\nOne of the legal issues arising out of the misattribution caused by the deception is the legality of the retaliatory measures directed by the deceived State against the alleged wrongdoer. The legality of such measures depends on their legal character. If the deceived State responds with reciprocal measures, they may also qualify as a violation of the prohibition on intervention or the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other States.⁴⁹ However, retaliatory measures that are otherwise contrary to international obligations may be legal if they qualify as countermeasures or if they fulfil conditions of any of the (other) circumstances precluding wrongfulness.\n\nIt is the very first basic precondition of any countermeasure that it must be taken in response to a previous internationally wrongful act of another State and must be directed against that State.⁵⁰ This appears problematic in the case where technical evidence and intelligence information acquired by one State point towards another (victim) State as the wrongdoer, but in reality, the author of the false-flag cyber operation was different. Identification of the wrongdoer and attribution in the context of cyber operations is challenging because of the evidentiary and technical⁵¹ peculiarities of cyberspace that make it possible to hide identity and leave false traces.⁵² At the same time, the basic principle is that in bilateral disputes, the onus to establish responsibility lies on the injured State.⁵³ Together with the specific features of cyberspace, high demands are placed on the injured State in the process of attribution of harmful conduct.⁵⁴ Of course, retaliatory measures of the deceived State would also have to fulfil other requirements of countermeasures, namely a previous call upon the allegedly responsible State to fulfil its obligations and offer of negotiations.⁵⁵\n\n⁴⁹ See the analysis above.\n\n⁵⁰ Case Concerning the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary v Slovakia), Judgment (1997) para 83; Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 18) commentary to Rule 26, para 6.\n\n⁵¹ For an overview of possible technical methods of attribution, see Massimiliano Albanese et al., ‘Deceiving Attackers by Creating a Virtual Attack Surface’ in Sushil Jajodia et al.

At the same time, the basic principle is that in bilateral disputes, the onus to establish responsibility lies on the injured State. This places high demands on the injured State with respect to the process of attribution of a harmful conduct.\n\n⁵³ Draft Articles (n 22) commentary to Chapter V, para 8.\n\n⁵⁴ Carrying out in-depth investigation and gaining sufficiently convincing evidence may be time-consuming and take even years – see Geiss and Lahmann (n 52) 626.

    "The question that is pertinent in the context of cyber deception is the relevance of the mistake of fact that led to misattribution. Mistake of fact plays a role in some areas of international law, such as international criminal law or the law of international treaties.56 With regard to the law of State responsibility, the relevance of mistake of fact can be discussed in relation to the criteria establishing State responsibility, circumstances precluding wrongfulness and arguably in relation to the determination of reparation.57\n\nWhen considering criteria for the establishment of international responsibility (breach of an international obligation and attribution), a mistake of fact does not play any role since these criteria are objective in nature58 and any subjective considerations are not relevant.59 Once a breach of an international obligation is established and is attributable, it is prima facie sufficient to establish responsibility.60 Fault,61 culpa or dolus of the organs in question is not required unless otherwise provided for by the primary norm in question.62\n\nThe same applies to the question of the relevance of mistakes of fact with respect to circumstances precluding wrongfulness. First, a mistake of fact does not constitute a stand-alone circumstance precluding wrongfulness recognized in international law, including in cyberspace. Errors or mistakes of fact are absent from the authoritative list of circumstances precluding wrongfulness in the International Law Commission's (ILC) Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.63 Second, a mistake of fact also\n\n56 Marko Milanovic, ‘Mistakes of Fact When Using Lethal Force in International Law: Part I’ (EJIL: Talk!, 14 January 2020) <https: mistakes-of-fact-when-using-lethal-force-in-international-law-part-i=\"\" www.ejiltalk.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 27 January 2020, and the following parts.\n\n57 Art 39 of the Draft Articles reflects the rule that conduct of the injured State that contributed to its damage should be considered. Naturally, this does not apply to the wilful conduct or negligence of the wrongdoer (deceived State) and this rule probably cannot be extended to the scenario where it is a wilful act of a third State that contributed to the injury.\n\n58 There are some subjective elements in the realm of derivative responsibility discussed below (e.g. aid or assistance or coercion). See Crawford (n 22) 405.\n\n59 ibid 61; Draft Articles (n 22) commentary to art 2, para 3; Mary Ellen O’Connell, The Power &amp; Purpose of International Law: Insights from the Theory &amp; Practice of Enforcement (OUP 2008) 248.

There are few opinions that a mistake of fact might qualify as a circumstance precluding wrongfulness, but often they are not further elaborated on. See for example Second report on State responsibility, by Mr James Crawford, Special Rapporteur (1994, A/CN.4/498 and Add. 1–4) para 262. An error has significant legal relevance in some other sub-fields of international law, for example as a ground for invalidity of international treaties – see Article 48 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties from 1969, or in the context of international criminal law – see for example art 32 para 1 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court from 1998.

    "cannot serve as a ground for the invocation of any of the established circumstances precluding wrongfulness since none of them requires an inquiry into a subjective element, such as fault⁶⁴ or error.⁶⁵ Specifically, with respect to countermeasures, the law of State responsibility is based on an objective standard.⁶⁶ A State resorting to countermeasures does so at its own risk and on the basis of its unilateral assessment of the situation. An incorrect assessment, including in the event of misattribution of malicious cyber operations,⁶⁷ may result in the commission of a wrongful act by the State resorting to countermeasures for which that State would be internationally responsible.⁶⁸ Interestingly, according to the ILC, there is no difference between countermeasures and other circumstances precluding wrongfulness in this respect.⁶⁹ Similarly, also in the context of self-defence, mistake or error of fact is irrelevant as the requirements for invoking self-defence are ‘strict and objective’.⁷⁰\n\nDepending on the nature, timing and context, the illegality of actions of the deceived State taken against the alleged wrongdoer might in some situations be precluded by the reference to the state of necessity. The point is that actions taken with reference to the plea of necessity need not respond to an internationally wrongful act⁷¹ and can violate the rights of non-responsible States.⁷² However, necessity could only be invoked if it could be established that the reactive measure adopted by the misled State is the only means for the State to safeguard an essential interest (e.g. protection of an electric grid or critical infrastructure)⁷³ against a grave and imminent peril caused by the cyber threat. In light of the above-described objective standard, this can hardly be the case if the victim State is not at all involved in the false-flag attack. But one could imagine a different scenario where a computer network located in the victim State was exploited by the deceiving State and still remains an imminent threat to the critical infrastructure of the deceived State.⁷⁴\n\nConsequently, even when misattribution is caused by the wilful deception orchestrated by a deceiving State, conditions of international responsibility of the deceived State may be established due to their objective nature.

    "international responsibility (with some exceptions in Article 39 of the ILC's Draft Articles related to the determination of reparation once responsibility is established) do not contain any legal concepts that would take into account an excusable mistake caused by another State in the process of attribution. Various solutions to the consequences caused by wrongful attribution are of course possible if the deceived and the victim States reach a corresponding agreement (or the victim State does not invoke the responsibility of the deceived State). But that would require a constructive approach and clear establishment of the facts (including technical evidence), which might not be easy to achieve in some political contexts in combination with the complexity of the cybersphere.\n\n# 6. CONCLUSION\n\nDeception in cybersphere is a threat and a sophisticated challenge for international security. As this contribution has proven, it also constitutes a legal challenge. The analysis demonstrated that due to the lack of regulation of the issue in international law, it is problematic to identify international law rules that the deceptive action could violate. A possibly applicable principle, the no-harm rule, has been identified; however, its use appears problematic and deserves broader discussion. At the same time, the rules of international responsibility do not allow for the invocation of responsibility of a State that conducted deceptive action for the damage caused by the deceived State to the victim State. Moreover, a mistake of fact on the side of the misled State does not generally alleviate its responsibility for the retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer, since it does not qualify as a distinct circumstance precluding wrongfulness, nor is it relevant for the invocation of any of the recognized circumstances precluding wrongfulness.\n\nFrom the analysis, it seems apparent that a legal gap exists in international law. Rules of international responsibility address various forms of what is known as derived international responsibility, but deception does not fall into any of them. Legal consequences of misattribution in cyberspace are not sufficiently addressed in the doctrine and the topic appears to pose a challenge for the law of international responsibility. This outcome is not desirable since mistaken attribution may contribute to the destabilization of international peace and security.75 Therefore, States carry a great burden to use all efforts to properly investigate and assess the background of cyber operations they face, and they must very carefully balance the need to\n\nDelerue (n 36) 190.\n\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University College London.

Cyber deception refers to a situation when a State launches a false-flag cyber attack against another State but orchestrates the attack in a way that points towards a third (victim) country as the wrongdoer. The target State then launches retaliatory measures against the alleged wrongdoer. The legal analysis of the proposed contribution focuses on the legality of such deception and responsibility of both its author and the deceived State for damage caused to the victim State. The contribution demonstrates the gap in the rules of international responsibility for holding the orchestrator of deception responsible for the damage caused to a victim State as a consequence of misattribution. It also focuses on the legality of the deception as such. Misleading another State is a matter not per se regulated by international law, but it may result in a violation of the no-harm principle. This principle is recognized as a distinct legal norm in specific areas, but it is unclear whether and how it applies to the cyber domain. Finally, the contribution analyses whether the responsibility of the deceived State may be alleviated based on a mistake of fact that caused the misattribution.",
