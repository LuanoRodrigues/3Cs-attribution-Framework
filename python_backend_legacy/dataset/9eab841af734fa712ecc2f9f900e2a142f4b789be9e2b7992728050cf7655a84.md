This paper identifies an additional intelligence-centric impediment to cyber deterrence. Cyberattacks yield effects in a manner that is indirect, while offensive cyber operations are multi-stage and multipurpose. These characteristics complicate analytic judgments about the culpability of the attacker, whereas deterrence requires that states retaliate with measures which are timely, clear, and proportionate. The paper uses three cases studies—the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, WannaCry, and NotPetya—to illustrate how the indirectness and ambiguity of cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations obscure the motivations, goals, and culpability of the attacker. It concludes that these characteristics discourage states from adopting punishment-based deterrence strategies because they lengthen the temporal and epistemological requirements of attribution analysis.\nKeywords: Attribution, Deterrence, Cyberattack, Offensive Cyber Operations\n# Introduction\nOver the last decade, many scholars have argued that Cold War deterrence models are inapplicable to conflict dynamics in cyberspace (Libicki 2009; Gartzke &amp; Lindsay 2015; Nye 2017; Chesney et al. 2020). One prominent branch of that literature revolves around the ‘attribution problem’ (Libicki 2009; Boebert 2011; Healey 2012; Rid &amp; Buchanan 2015; Lin 2016). The attribution problem posits that the anonymity of cyberspace and the deniability of cyberattacks undermine deterrence by preventing victims from imposing reciprocal costs on the actor that launched the attack—a particular form of deterrence that political scientists refer to as deterrence by punishment.\nThis paper seeks to build on that branch of cyber deterrence research. Through a review of the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, WannaCry, and NotPetya, it suggests an additional intelligence-centric obstacle to deterrence in cyberspace. Due to the indirectness of cyberattacks and the multipurpose and multi-stage nature of offensive cyber operations, the motivations and goals of the perpetrator do not flow readily from the visible effects of an attack. This epistemological ambiguity complicates analytic judgements about the culpability of the attacker, whereas punishment strategies are predicated on responding to a wrong with a swift, clear, and proportionate punishment (Schelling 1968).\nJournal of Information Warfare (2022) 21.2: 64-76\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nThis ambiguity stems from two characteristics inherent to cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations. On one hand, the tactical and operational similarities between cyberattack and cyber-exploitation create a ‘ambiguity dilemma' for network defenders (Buchanan 2017). Therefore, in the event a culprit is identified before delivery of a final payload, defenders cannot be sure how serious a threat they posed.\nEven after payload delivery, cyberattacks operate indirectly, creating or manipulating a risk of harm as opposed to causing that harm directly (U.S. NRC 2009). As a result, the effects of a cyberattack hinge on factors outside the attacker's control, such as the competence of network defenders and the quicksilver interconnections of the devices, systems, and networks through which they travel (US NRC 2009; Farrell & Glaser 2017).\nThese aspects of cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations reduce the viability of punishment-based deterrence strategies in two ways. First, by extending the analytic requirements of post-attack analysis, they reinforce the predictive logic of the attribution problem. Deterrence requires speed and clarity, while attribution is painstaking and imprecise. It is just more painstaking and more imprecise than most realize.\nOn the other hand, they also complicate judgements about an attacker's culpability. How should states punish perpetrators for damage incurred but not intended or intended but not incurred? A deterrence strategy predicated on overt and proportionate punishments demands unambiguous evidence of an attacker's responsibility. Yet, the characteristics of cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations make these judgments harder to reach, and they render associated punishments harder to justify.\nThis paper develops this argument in two parts. First, it reviews existing literature on the attribution problem. Overwhelmingly, this scholarship has focused on questions of authorship, such as Who did it? or Who is to blame? These questions assume that a victim can devise an appropriate response to a cyberattack, if only it can identify the aggressor.\nNext, the paper examines the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, WannaCry, and NotPetya. It uses the cases to demonstrate how the ambiguity and unpredictability inherent to cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations render who-based attribution insufficient to deterrence by punishment. The paper concludes that these characteristics discourage states from adopting punishment-based deterrence strategies because they exacerbate the temporal and epistemological requirements of post-attack attribution analysis.\n## Literature Background\nAttribution refers to the process by which state and non-state actors identify the perpetrators of cyberattacks. In practice, however, the concept is somewhat fluid. Attribution can be applied to individual pieces of malware or an entire cyber operation. It ranges in specificity from operators at a keyboard, to a sub-state entity, to a state. Attribution can also be confidential or public. In each of these cases, attribution entails different evidentiary standards (Grindal, Kuerbis & Mueller 2019).\nThis paper focuses on the public attribution of cyberattacks or offensive cyber operations. Research into this variant of the attribution problem has been ongoing for years, yet it has evolved in response to advances in forensic technology and changing perceptions of cyberspace as a strategic\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\ndomain. Prior to 2013, many believed that the architecture of the Internet protected the anonymity of attackers (Boebert 2011). Unable to determine Who did it? experts proposed two solutions to the cyber deterrence problem (Lynn 2010). One group called for redesigning the Internet to make network attacks easier to trace (Landau &amp; Clarke 2011). A second advocated that network defenders instead focus on defence, or deterrence by denial (Libicki 2009).\nNew scholarship began to emerge after 2013, when a private-sector threat intelligence firm published a report attributing a vast swathe of intrusions to China's People's Liberation Army (FireEye 2013). The report illustrated that it was possible to use forensic tools available to the private sector to prove who was behind a digital intrusion.\nNonetheless, the use of proxy cyber forces in many of the most prominent state-sponsored cyberattacks up to that point raised questions about the value of attribution (Healey 2012). To identify the \"ultimately responsible party\" of an attack, scholars suggested, governments required alternative sources of intelligence (Rid &amp; Buchanan 2015). Understanding of the attribution problem thus evolved from a purely a technical issue to a politico-technical one: not Who did it? but Who to blame? (Lin 2016)\nThis most recent branch of scholarship accepts that some form of attribution is now within reach. However, it argues that deterrence by punishment remains elusive due to two factors. First, attribution is estimative, not probative. Though it is possible to trace an attack back to an originating network, or even a set of hackers, one is rarely able to prove that a state was involved in the operation, or how ((Healey 2012; Lin 2016). Second, attribution is \"painstaking\" (Rid &amp; Buchanan 2015). It demands expertise across a range of analytic and technical functions. Synthesizing those work-streams takes time. By contrast, deterrence demands speed and clarity. Through time, space, and deed, deterrers must communicate to perpetrators the link between offence and punishment.\nCurrent scholarship assumes that the only obstacle to deterrence lies in establishing the perpetrator's identity. However, the analytic process is also essential to interpreting the nature and gravity of a cyberattack. Because of their indirectness, cyberattacks can produce effects that exceed or underperform an attacker's intentions. Because of the multi-stage and multi-purpose nature of offensive cyber operations, an attacker's motives, methods, and intentions do not flow readily from the visible effects of an incident. Together, these factors complicate judgments about the responsibility of the perpetrator for the effects of an attack. In turn, they should discourage states from adopting punishment strategies, which are predicated on speed, clarity, and proportionality.\n## Case Selection\nExamining these cases in tandem may raise many a methodological eyebrow. The attacks involved different victims and different perpetrators. NotPetya and WannaCry entailed the compromise of data availability on IT systems. By contrast, the 2016 Russian election interference campaign involved information warfare through the subversion of data confidentiality. Arguably, it does not even represent a cyberattack.\nThe cases nonetheless provide firm methodological footing for exploring how the unpredictability and ambiguity of cyberattacks or offensive cyber operations affects deterrence in cyberspace. First, the attacks covered here received extensive coverage in a domain characterized by extreme secrecy. That coverage does not just provide a rare window into how these attacks unfolded. It\nJournal of Information Warfare\nalso manifests characteristics essential to deterrence yet often absent from state-sponsored cyber conflict (Chesney et al. 2020): the attacks compromised operational secrecy to produce an effect. In turn, that effect produced pressure for retaliation.\nSecond, the international community managed to identify the ‘ultimately responsible party' in each incident. The cases therefore control for successful attribution under the traditional definition of the term. As the victims of each case suffered few repercussions, they offer tentative support for the notion that who-based attribution is insufficient to deterrence by punishment.\nFinally, policymakers and analysts do not have the luxury of disregarding incidents that elude neat academic categories. To the extent the public treats an event as a ‘cyberattack', the weight of that perception will shape how policymakers interpret an event, formulate a response, and communicate it to the public. The cases are worth considering together because the public considered them together.\n## Russian Election Interference Campaign\nThe 2016 Russian election interference campaign offers strong, albeit anecdotal, evidence that who-based attribution is necessary but not sufficient to deterring state-authored cyberattacks. In fact, members of the United States intelligence and law enforcement communities began to attribute election-adjacent hacking and information operations to Russian affiliates as early as 2015. However, the administration failed to recognize any serious threat to the election until the last weeks of July 2016 (Sanger 2018). It took longer to devise a deterrent response.\nFour domain-specific characteristics of the campaign complicated analysis and deterrence of the Russian threat.\nFirst, the campaign cut across a vast swathe of digital and informational terrain subject to competing legal authorities for the U.S. intelligence community. Moreover, the persistent nature of its constituent operations presented something of a moving target: As the U.S. intelligence community concluded in a post-election assessment, Russia's goals evolved over time as it became more apparent that Donald Trump had better electoral chances than many realized (U.S. ODNI 2017).\nThe Russian interference comprised three parallel cyber or cyber-enabled operations. The first entailed misinformation and disinformation propagated by troll farms, like the Internet Research Agency, as well as official Russian media outlets and spokespeople. Second was the hack-and-leak operation targeting Clinton campaign staffers and later the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). The third and final campaign comprised the reconnaissance and targeting of U.S. election, or election-adjacent, infrastructure.\nNo single US intelligence entity had the legal authorities, let alone the capability, to investigate all the campaign's components at once. Yet, identifying Russia's role in individual operations would prove insufficient to grasping the overall threat.\nIn September of 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) determined that Russian state-sponsored hackers had breached the DNC. However, the FBI did not consider the threat to be serious and failed to communicate it to the White House. Policymakers in the Obama Administration claimed they first learned about the breach of the DNC in mid-June of 2016, following a revelation\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nfrom the *Washington Post* (US SSCI 2018). Likewise, throughout the year, officials across the US government must have noted Russia’s overt information campaigns, which began between June and December of 2015 (Maremont &amp; Barry 2017). Despite traditional attribution on these fronts, none of this information triggered the U.S. intelligence community to the severity of the threat.\nSecond, conditioned by past foreign espionage efforts, US intelligence officials failed to appreciate the dual threat posed by theft of sensitive information from US political actors and entities.\nMany Obama Administration officials later admitted that they were not overly alarmed when they first learned of the DNC hack because they regarded it as “traditional espionage” (US SSCI 2018, p. 5). According to the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s report on the 2016 Russian interference campaign, their familiarity with previous cyber-espionage campaigns inured them to the significance of the DNC breach:\n&gt; Witnesses interviewed by the Committee consistently said that Russian cyberactivity was a well-known issue within the administration, however hardly any administration officials had considered the threat of information collected through cyber espionage being weaponized when assessing the consequences of the Russian cyber intrusions into the Clinton campaign, the DNC, and the DCCC. (US SSCI 2018, p. 9).\nHence, as intelligence officials struggled to connect the dots on the Russian interference effort, they overlooked the dots that stood in plain sight.\nWhen it finally recognized the Russian threat to the election, the Obama Administration hesitated to craft a response. At that point, a third domain-specific intelligence challenge plagued officials: cyber-weapons must be kept secret to be effective, and the Obama Administration did not know whether the Russians had developed a capability to compromise vote tallies on election day. Ironically, while U.S. officials at first underestimated the Russian interference threat, they may have overestimated it by the end of the summer.\nBetween June and September of 2016, Russian hackers targeted U.S. election-related infrastructure in at least 21 states (US SSCI 2018, p. 5-12). According to subsequent reporting, however, the activity amounted mainly to “scanning and probing”—actions that did not necessarily reflect a willingness, let alone confer a capability, to swing the result on election day (US DHS 2016). Nonetheless, President Obama ordered a National Intelligence Estimate to ascertain how vulnerable the country’s election infrastructure was to compromise (Sanger 2018).\nCompleted later that summer, the National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the country’s election infrastructure was secure (Sanger 2018). Nonetheless, Obama Administration officials remained wary, reportedly “assum[ing] the worst-case scenario” with regards to Russia’s ability to manipulate vote tallies or voter registration data (US SSCI 2018, p. 20). As a result, the administration declined to impose high costs on the Russians before election day. President Obama feared that doing more might provoke Putin (US SSCI 2018).\nFourth, even after the election, uncertainty about how to measure the effects of the Russian campaign discouraged President Obama from issuing a harsher punishment.\nWhat percentage of American political polarization during the 2016 election stemmed from Russian interference, as opposed to domestic forces? Did those efforts change enough votes to swing,\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nor even to affect, the 2016 election? President Obama feared that by drawing too much attention to the interference campaign he would appear partisan, legitimizing some of the narratives propagated by the Russians and further undermining confidence (US SSCI 2018).\nOverall, in reacting to the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, US officials had to worry about far more than who was behind the campaign. To craft an effective deterrence strategy, they needed to determine the nature, purpose, and goals of the Russian threat. However, several features unique to the digital medium complicated that process.\nThe persistence, ambiguity, and breadth of the Russian interference campaign eluded analysis from one intelligence agency. The dual-use character of offensive cyber operations inured U.S. officials to a particular type of attack, while the secrecy inherent to cyber weapons may have made them overly concerned about another. And even after the election took place, the White House feared that any response might feed the perception that the campaign had inflicted more damage than it really had.\nThe Obama Administration finally woke up to the Russian threat in early August 2016, when information alleged to originate from a human intelligence asset in the Kremlin reached the White House (Brennan 2021). While little information is known about the asset or the intelligence he or she provided, the source and nature of the intelligence is telling.\nReporting from a high-placed source within the Russian government must have done more than confirm who was behind the ongoing interference efforts. In tying campaign back to the highest political authorities in Russia, the intelligence necessarily conveyed information about the nature, coordination, and scale of Russia's intentions. That was something the Obama Administration could not distil from who-based attribution alone.\n# WannaCry and NotPetya\nThe WannaCry and NotPetya cyberattacks present ideal test cases for the viability of deterrence in cyberspace. Both cyberattacks caused significant damage, crippling foreign computer systems, some in critical infrastructure sectors. In both cases, there was never much doubt about who the 'ultimately responsible party' was. Even though the U.S. government did not release official statements for several months after each attack, private security researchers identified the likely perpetrators within days. And unlike the Russian interference campaign, both left a quantifiable trail of damage. Shouldn't it be easy for states to punish the perpetrators behind a NotPetya or a WannaCry?\nClose review of the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks suggests two domain-specific factors that complicate a punishment strategy for cyberattacks. While the paper does not speculate whether these considerations shaped historical policy decisions surrounding these incidents, it argues that both render a punishment strategy less desirable than it otherwise might be.\nFirst, the unpredictability of cyberattacks makes it difficult to adjudicate how much damage the attackers bear responsibility for. This analytic hurdle is particularly challenging with cyberattacks that employ self-propagating mechanisms, such as WannaCry and NotPetya.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nBoth WannaCry and NotPetya yielded significant damage in a matter of hours. WannaCry infected 300,000 computers in 150 countries (Johnson 2018). The worm’s victims included major multinationals, such as FedEx and Telefonica, French automaker Renault, ministries in the Russian government, and Deutsche Bahn, a major German railway service. The worm also wrought havoc in the physical world. In the six days after WannaCry broke loose, the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) cancelled 19,000 appointments (Johnson 2018). Altogether, WannaCry incurred approximately $4 billion in damages (Berr 2017).\nNotPetya also spread widely, although the payload was first distributed through a software supply chain in wide use in Ukraine. As a result, it inflicted more localized damage. Within 24 hours, NotPetya hit four hospitals in Kiev, six power companies, two airports, and much of the federal government. According to one security firm, it wiped 10 percent of all computers in the country (Greenberg 2019).\nOutside Ukraine, NotPetya infected computers in 60 countries and caused significant financial losses for a slew of multinational corporations (Frenkel 2017). Maersk, the shipping conglomerate, suffered $275 million in damages; Merck, a pharmaceutical giant, totalled its losses at $870 million; TNT Expresses lost $400 million; Reckitt Benckiser, a British manufacturer, experienced $129 million in damages; and Mondelez, a food producer, took a $188 million hit (Greenberg 2019). According to estimates from the White House, NotPetya tallied $10 billion in total damages (White House 2018).\nOne may conclude that the attacks yielded sufficient damage to warrant a reciprocal punishment. But what should policymakers and analysts make of the damage that each attack could have caused but did not, or caused because of the panicked overreaction of network defenders? In the case of NotPetya and WannaCry, factors outside the attackers' control affected how much damage the attacks generated.\nFor example, hours after the WannaCry attack began to spread, an independent computer security researcher named Marcus Hutchins accidentally activated a kill-switch on the worm. Hutchins had been studying the WannaCry malware when he noticed the code called back to a curious-looking web domain. On a whim, Hutchins purchased it for $10. As it turns out, his handiwork stopped WannaCry from propagating hours or even days before it might have.\nNotPetya had no such universal kill-switch. Just the same, the actions of network defenders shaped how much damage it inflicted. For example, Merck’s IT administrators managed to shut down the company’s entire corporate network in roughly 90 seconds, sparing the company more extensive damage (Greenberg 2019). By contrast, the Ukrainian post office did not react quite as nimbly as Merck. It lost more than 70 percent of its computers to NotPetya (Greenberg 2019).\nChance factors also guided NotPetya in unpredictable directions. For example, during the attack, Maersk lost every one of its 150 domain controllers save one. The lone surviving domain controller, which allowed Maersk to restore its entire corporate network, was spared by dumb luck: it been knocked offline due to a local power outage (Greenberg 2019).\nOn the other hand, NotPetya may have come close to causing significant physical damage. It infected computers at the clean-up site of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor. Although the computers\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\ndealing with critical functions at the Chernobyl site were air-gapped from the Internet, the site's IT director had to disconnect thousands of Windows machines at the plant (Greenberg 2019).\nIf the unpredictability of cyberattacks raises questions about how to adjudicate the culpability of attackers, code and network forensics present a second, potentially more reliable tool of analysis as compared with impact assessment. However, technical analysis is not foolproof and doing it effectively takes time.\nFor example, WannaCry appeared to represent a form of ransomware: it promised to unlock infected systems so long as victims transmitted cryptocurrency to an attacker-controlled virtual wallet. However, WannaCry reined in a fraction of the money that it could have due to a coding error (Ivanov, Sinitsyn &amp; Mamedov 2017; Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology 2017; Johnson 2018). Was the error genuine? Or were the North Koreans trying to mask geopolitical motives behind financial ones?\nIn general, security researchers agree that the quality of WannaCry's code was \"very low\". For example, private security researchers discovered that WannaCry's encryption mechanism left many deleted files recoverable (Kaspersky 2017). In addition, the worm bore the shockingly simple kill-switch. Had the North Koreans designed it as a safety mechanism in case the malware spread out of control? Or was it an oversight?\nInterestingly, the White House's prepared statement on WannaCry avoided any definitive statement on whether North Korea's intentions were financial or geopolitical. During the question-and-answer section of the press conference, Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert indicated he \"thinks\" that the true purpose of the attack was to \"cause havoc and destruction\" (U.S. White House 2017). Bossert's answer suggests that the U.S. government could not confidently ascertain the true purposes of WannaCry, even with the benefits of six-months hindsight.\nIn like fashion, analysis of the NotPetya payload raises suggestive questions about the culpability of the attackers. While NotPetya used the same exploit as WannaCry to spread autonomously, the hackers behind NotPetya first distributed the payload through the update server of M.E.Doc, a Ukrainian accounting firm whose software was used by many companies in Ukraine.\nThe use of a software supply-chain with wide use within one country points to the geopolitical motivations of the NotPetya cyberattack. Indeed, in its statement on the NotPetya incident, the White House concluded that NotPetya was part of Russia's \"ongoing efforts to destabilize Ukraine\" (U.S. White House 2018). But the White House did not elaborate further, raising questions about what exactly that meant.\nForensic analysis performed by private security researchers found that close to  $10\\%$  of the computers infected by NotPetya were spared due to a file installed by the attackers (Greenberg 2018). The presence of the file suggests that the Russians anticipated how far the worm might spread. So, were all the companies hit outside Ukraine just collateral damage? As one security researcher has speculated, what if the Russian were trying to \"punish anyone who would dare even to maintain an office inside\" Ukraine (Greenberg 2018)?\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nQuestions about the subtleties of cyberattacks like WannaCry and NotPetya rarely make it on the front pages of newspaper in the aftermath of major incidents. But it is clear they factor into a government's decisions about how to respond to a cyberattack—or at least that they should.\nConsider: if you knew with certainty that the North Koreans had not intended WannaCry to spread as widely as it did, would you consider the attack less blameworthy? What if you knew the attack would have caused much more damage if the research community had failed to identify the kill-switch? Conversely, if you knew with certainty that the Russians intended for NotPetya to spread beyond Ukraine, would you consider the attack more blameworthy? And how would you mete out punishment to the 'ultimately responsible party' of a cyberattack if you determined that the performance of network defenders exacerbated the downstream impact of an attack?\nUltimately, WannaCry and NotPetya illustrate that attribution analysis is about far more than Who did it? or Who to Blame?. Because the impact of cyberattacks is shaped by factors outside the attacker's control, victims must peel beneath the visible effects of an attack to determine an attacker's culpability. Much as jurists adjudicate crime by navigating the ambiguous terrain of human intentions, so states must scrutinize an attack to determine the culpability of the perpetrator.\nMalware and forensic analysis offer one source of analytic clarity for victims. However, technical analysis requires a degree of rigor which may stress the timeframe demanded by policymakers. Even then, analysis cannot eliminate the epistemological ambiguity inherent to cyberattacks. Incidents involving malicious software that 'spun out of control' have sparked bitter debate when litigated in domestic courts (United States v. Morris 1991). If they do not already, similar questions about culpability should cloud the minds of analysts and policymakers keen on responding to state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n# Conclusion\nCurrent scholarship offers a compelling explanation as to why the limits of attribution analysis undermine cyber deterrence. However, it misses one key part of the puzzle. When it comes to cyberattacks, the challenge for states does not just consist in determining who is responsible for an incident, but what the adversary intended to do and how he or she expected to do it. This challenge does not alter the fundamental characteristics of the attribution problem. It exacerbates them.\nThe epistemological requirements of attribution analysis undermine punishment strategies for the deterrence of cyberattacks in two ways. First, they extend the requirements of post-attack analysis. Attribution is not just painstaking and imprecise. It is more painstaking and more imprecise than current scholarship acknowledges. As a result, decision makers may not be able to attain clarity about attacks within the timeframe demanded by deterrence strategies.\nSecond, the ambiguity and indirectness of cyberattacks introduce complicated political and ethical questions into the attribution-deterrence analytic. Yet, punishment strategies rely on the implementation of swift, clear, and proportionate responses. The gap between the possibilities of analysis and the demands of strategy theoretically lessens the appeal of overt punishment strategies for the deterrence of cyberattacks. Nonetheless, further social science research is needed to confirm the empirical basis of this relationship.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nThis research holds two further implications for international politics and intelligence practice. Regarding the former, the epistemological ambiguity inherent to cyberattacks may encourage states to adopt riskier behaviour in cyberspace. So long as states can plausibly deny their responsibility for the damage incurred by cyberattacks—and even those for which they are known to be responsible—they may feel emboldened to risk attacks ‘that leave something to chance’ (Schelling 1968; Farrell &amp; Glaser 2017).\nLikewise, disagreements about the relative wrongfulness of given incidents may themselves generate friction within the international community. The adjudication of cybersecurity incidents that ‘spun out of control’ have generated bitter disagreement in domestic contexts. Similar dynamics appear destined to repeat themselves in international fora, where stakeholders have less incentive to cooperate.\nWhen it comes to intelligence practice, this research suggests that analysts performing attribution analysis must go the extra mile to resist hindsight bias. Due to the unpredictability and ambiguity of cyberattacks, the impact of an attack may exceed or underperform an adversary’s expectations. Intelligence analysts must therefore assess what the adversary tried to make happen and how carefully or recklessly he or she pursued their objectives. Today, the pertinent questions are not just Who did this? or Who to blame? but What to blame them for? and Why?.",

Unable to determine Who did it? experts proposed two solutions to the cyber deterrence problem . One group called for redesigning the Internet to make network attacks easier to trace (Landau &amp; Clarke 2011). A second advocated that network defenders instead focus on defence, or deterrence by denial .\nNew scholarship began to emerge after 2013, when a private-sector threat intelligence firm published a report attributing a vast swathe of intrusions to China's People's Liberation Army . The report illustrated that it was possible to use forensic tools available to the private sector to prove who was behind a digital intrusion.\nNonetheless, the use of proxy cyber forces in many of the most prominent state-sponsored cyberattacks up to that point raised questions about the value of attribution . To identify the \"ultimately responsible party\" of an attack, scholars suggested, governments required alternative sources of intelligence (Rid &amp; Buchanan 2015). Understanding of the attribution problem thus evolved from a purely a technical issue to a politico-technical one: not Who did it? but Who to blame? This most recent branch of scholarship accepts that some form of attribution is now within reach. However, it argues that deterrence by punishment remains elusive due to two factors. First, attribution is estimative, not probative. Though it is possible to trace an attack back to an originating network, or even a set of hackers, one is rarely able to prove that a state was involved in the operation, or how (. Second, attribution is \"painstaking\" (Rid &amp; Buchanan 2015). It demands expertise across a range of analytic and technical functions. Synthesizing those work-streams takes time. By contrast, deterrence demands speed and clarity. Through time, space, and deed, deterrers must communicate to perpetrators the link between offence and punishment.\nCurrent scholarship assumes that the only obstacle to deterrence lies in establishing the perpetrator's identity. However, the analytic process is also essential to interpreting the nature and gravity of a cyberattack. Because of their indirectness, cyberattacks can produce effects that exceed or underperform an attacker's intentions. Because of the multi-stage and multi-purpose nature of offensive cyber operations, an attacker's motives, methods, and intentions do not flow readily from the visible effects of an incident. Together, these factors complicate judgments about the responsibility of the perpetrator for the effects of an attack. In turn, they should discourage states from adopting punishment strategies, which are predicated on speed, clarity, and proportionality.\n## Case Selection\nExamining these cases in tandem may raise many a methodological eyebrow. The attacks involved different victims and different perpetrators. NotPetya and WannaCry entailed the compromise of data availability on IT systems. By contrast, the 2016 Russian election interference campaign involved information warfare through the subversion of data confidentiality. Arguably, it does not even represent a cyberattack.\nThe cases nonetheless provide firm methodological footing for exploring how the unpredictability and ambiguity of cyberattacks or offensive cyber operations affects deterrence in cyberspace. First, the attacks covered here received extensive coverage in a domain characterized by extreme secrecy. That coverage does not just provide a rare window into how these attacks unfolded. It\nJournal of Information Warfare\nalso manifests characteristics essential to deterrence yet often absent from state-sponsored cyber conflict : the attacks compromised operational secrecy to produce an effect. In turn, that effect produced pressure for retaliation.\nSecond, the international community managed to identify the ‘ultimately responsible party' in each incident. The cases therefore control for successful attribution under the traditional definition of the term. As the victims of each case suffered few repercussions, they offer tentative support for the notion that who-based attribution is insufficient to deterrence by punishment.\nFinally, policymakers and analysts do not have the luxury of disregarding incidents that elude neat academic categories. To the extent the public treats an event as a ‘cyberattack', the weight of that perception will shape how policymakers interpret an event, formulate a response, and communicate it to the public. The cases are worth considering together because the public considered them together.\n## Russian Election Interference Campaign\nThe 2016 Russian election interference campaign offers strong, albeit anecdotal, evidence that who-based attribution is necessary but not sufficient to deterring state-authored cyberattacks. In fact, members of the United States intelligence and law enforcement communities began to attribute election-adjacent hacking and information operations to Russian affiliates as early as 2015. However, the administration failed to recognize any serious threat to the election until the last weeks of July 2016 . It took longer to devise a deterrent response.\nFour domain-specific characteristics of the campaign complicated analysis and deterrence of the Russian threat.\nFirst, the campaign cut across a vast swathe of digital and informational terrain subject to competing legal authorities for the U.S. intelligence community. Moreover, the persistent nature of its constituent operations presented something of a moving target: As the U.S. intelligence community concluded in a post-election assessment, Russia's goals evolved over time as it became more apparent that Donald Trump had better electoral chances than many realized (U.S. ODNI 2017).\nThe Russian interference comprised three parallel cyber or cyber-enabled operations. The first entailed misinformation and disinformation propagated by troll farms, like the Internet Research Agency, as well as official Russian media outlets and spokespeople. Second was the hack-and-leak operation targeting Clinton campaign staffers and later the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). The third and final campaign comprised the reconnaissance and targeting of U.S. election, or election-adjacent, infrastructure.\nNo single US intelligence entity had the legal authorities, let alone the capability, to investigate all the campaign's components at once. Yet, identifying Russia's role in individual operations would prove insufficient to grasping the overall threat.\nIn September of 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) determined that Russian state-sponsored hackers had breached the DNC. However, the FBI did not consider the threat to be serious and failed to communicate it to the White House. Policymakers in the Obama Administration claimed they first learned about the breach of the DNC in mid-June of 2016, following a revelation\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nfrom the *Washington Post* . Likewise, throughout the year, officials across the US government must have noted Russia’s overt information campaigns, which began between June and December of 2015 (Maremont &amp; Barry 2017). Despite traditional attribution on these fronts, none of this information triggered the U.S. intelligence community to the severity of the threat.\nSecond, conditioned by past foreign espionage efforts, US intelligence officials failed to appreciate the dual threat posed by theft of sensitive information from US political actors and entities.\nMany Obama Administration officials later admitted that they were not overly alarmed when they first learned of the DNC hack because they regarded it as “traditional espionage” . According to the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s report on the 2016 Russian interference campaign, their familiarity with previous cyber-espionage campaigns inured them to the significance of the DNC breach:\n&gt; Witnesses interviewed by the Committee consistently said that Russian cyberactivity was a well-known issue within the administration, however hardly any administration officials had considered the threat of information collected through cyber espionage being weaponized when assessing the consequences of the Russian cyber intrusions into the Clinton campaign, the DNC, and the DCCC. .\nHence, as intelligence officials struggled to connect the dots on the Russian interference effort, they overlooked the dots that stood in plain sight.\nWhen it finally recognized the Russian threat to the election, the Obama Administration hesitated to craft a response. At that point, a third domain-specific intelligence challenge plagued officials: cyber-weapons must be kept secret to be effective, and the Obama Administration did not know whether the Russians had developed a capability to compromise vote tallies on election day. Ironically, while U.S. officials at first underestimated the Russian interference threat, they may have overestimated it by the end of the summer.\nBetween June and September of 2016, Russian hackers targeted U.S. election-related infrastructure in at least 21 states . According to subsequent reporting, however, the activity amounted mainly to “scanning and probing”—actions that did not necessarily reflect a willingness, let alone confer a capability, to swing the result on election day . Nonetheless, President Obama ordered a National Intelligence Estimate to ascertain how vulnerable the country’s election infrastructure was to compromise .\nCompleted later that summer, the National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the country’s election infrastructure was secure . Nonetheless, Obama Administration officials remained wary, reportedly “assum[ing] the worst-case scenario” with regards to Russia’s ability to manipulate vote tallies or voter registration data . As a result, the administration declined to impose high costs on the Russians before election day. President Obama feared that doing more might provoke Putin .\nFourth, even after the election, uncertainty about how to measure the effects of the Russian campaign discouraged President Obama from issuing a harsher punishment.\nWhat percentage of American political polarization during the 2016 election stemmed from Russian interference, as opposed to domestic forces? Did those efforts change enough votes to swing,\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nor even to affect, the 2016 election? President Obama feared that by drawing too much attention to the interference campaign he would appear partisan, legitimizing some of the narratives propagated by the Russians and further undermining confidence .\nOverall, in reacting to the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, US officials had to worry about far more than who was behind the campaign. To craft an effective deterrence strategy, they needed to determine the nature, purpose, and goals of the Russian threat. However, several features unique to the digital medium complicated that process.\nThe persistence, ambiguity, and breadth of the Russian interference campaign eluded analysis from one intelligence agency. The dual-use character of offensive cyber operations inured U.S. officials to a particular type of attack, while the secrecy inherent to cyber weapons may have made them overly concerned about another. And even after the election took place, the White House feared that any response might feed the perception that the campaign had inflicted more damage than it really had.\nThe Obama Administration finally woke up to the Russian threat in early August 2016, when information alleged to originate from a human intelligence asset in the Kremlin reached the White House . While little information is known about the asset or the intelligence he or she provided, the source and nature of the intelligence is telling.\nReporting from a high-placed source within the Russian government must have done more than confirm who was behind the ongoing interference efforts. In tying campaign back to the highest political authorities in Russia, the intelligence necessarily conveyed information about the nature, coordination, and scale of Russia's intentions. That was something the Obama Administration could not distil from who-based attribution alone.\n# WannaCry and NotPetya\nThe WannaCry and NotPetya cyberattacks present ideal test cases for the viability of deterrence in cyberspace. Both cyberattacks caused significant damage, crippling foreign computer systems, some in critical infrastructure sectors. In both cases, there was never much doubt about who the 'ultimately responsible party' was. Even though the U.S. government did not release official statements for several months after each attack, private security researchers identified the likely perpetrators within days. And unlike the Russian interference campaign, both left a quantifiable trail of damage. Shouldn't it be easy for states to punish the perpetrators behind a NotPetya or a WannaCry?\nClose review of the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks suggests two domain-specific factors that complicate a punishment strategy for cyberattacks. While the paper does not speculate whether these considerations shaped historical policy decisions surrounding these incidents, it argues that both render a punishment strategy less desirable than it otherwise might be.\nFirst, the unpredictability of cyberattacks makes it difficult to adjudicate how much damage the attackers bear responsibility for. This analytic hurdle is particularly challenging with cyberattacks that employ self-propagating mechanisms, such as WannaCry and NotPetya.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nBoth WannaCry and NotPetya yielded significant damage in a matter of hours. WannaCry infected 300,000 computers in 150 countries . The worm’s victims included major multinationals, such as FedEx and Telefonica, French automaker Renault, ministries in the Russian government, and Deutsche Bahn, a major German railway service. The worm also wrought havoc in the physical world. In the six days after WannaCry broke loose, the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) cancelled 19,000 appointments . Altogether, WannaCry incurred approximately $4 billion in damages .\nNotPetya also spread widely, although the payload was first distributed through a software supply chain in wide use in Ukraine. As a result, it inflicted more localized damage. Within 24 hours, NotPetya hit four hospitals in Kiev, six power companies, two airports, and much of the federal government. According to one security firm, it wiped 10 percent of all computers in the country .\nOutside Ukraine, NotPetya infected computers in 60 countries and caused significant financial losses for a slew of multinational corporations . Maersk, the shipping conglomerate, suffered $275 million in damages; Merck, a pharmaceutical giant, totalled its losses at $870 million; TNT Expresses lost $400 million; Reckitt Benckiser, a British manufacturer, experienced $129 million in damages; and Mondelez, a food producer, took a $188 million hit . According to estimates from the White House, NotPetya tallied $10 billion in total damages (White House 2018).\nOne may conclude that the attacks yielded sufficient damage to warrant a reciprocal punishment. But what should policymakers and analysts make of the damage that each attack could have caused but did not, or caused because of the panicked overreaction of network defenders? In the case of NotPetya and WannaCry, factors outside the attackers' control affected how much damage the attacks generated.\nFor example, hours after the WannaCry attack began to spread, an independent computer security researcher named Marcus Hutchins accidentally activated a kill-switch on the worm. Hutchins had been studying the WannaCry malware when he noticed the code called back to a curious-looking web domain. On a whim, Hutchins purchased it for $10. As it turns out, his handiwork stopped WannaCry from propagating hours or even days before it might have.\nNotPetya had no such universal kill-switch. Just the same, the actions of network defenders shaped how much damage it inflicted. For example, Merck’s IT administrators managed to shut down the company’s entire corporate network in roughly 90 seconds, sparing the company more extensive damage . By contrast, the Ukrainian post office did not react quite as nimbly as Merck. It lost more than 70 percent of its computers to NotPetya .\nChance factors also guided NotPetya in unpredictable directions. For example, during the attack, Maersk lost every one of its 150 domain controllers save one. The lone surviving domain controller, which allowed Maersk to restore its entire corporate network, was spared by dumb luck: it been knocked offline due to a local power outage .\nOn the other hand, NotPetya may have come close to causing significant physical damage. It infected computers at the clean-up site of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor. Although the computers\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\ndealing with critical functions at the Chernobyl site were air-gapped from the Internet, the site's IT director had to disconnect thousands of Windows machines at the plant .\nIf the unpredictability of cyberattacks raises questions about how to adjudicate the culpability of attackers, code and network forensics present a second, potentially more reliable tool of analysis as compared with impact assessment. However, technical analysis is not foolproof and doing it effectively takes time.\nFor example, WannaCry appeared to represent a form of ransomware: it promised to unlock infected systems so long as victims transmitted cryptocurrency to an attacker-controlled virtual wallet. However, WannaCry reined in a fraction of the money that it could have due to a coding error (Ivanov, Sinitsyn &amp; Mamedov 2017; Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology 2017; Johnson 2018). Was the error genuine? Or were the North Koreans trying to mask geopolitical motives behind financial ones?\nIn general, security researchers agree that the quality of WannaCry's code was \"very low\". For example, private security researchers discovered that WannaCry's encryption mechanism left many deleted files recoverable . In addition, the worm bore the shockingly simple kill-switch. Had the North Koreans designed it as a safety mechanism in case the malware spread out of control? Or was it an oversight?\nInterestingly, the White House's prepared statement on WannaCry avoided any definitive statement on whether North Korea's intentions were financial or geopolitical. During the question-and-answer section of the press conference, Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert indicated he \"thinks\" that the true purpose of the attack was to \"cause havoc and destruction\" (U.S. White House 2017). Bossert's answer suggests that the U.S. government could not confidently ascertain the true purposes of WannaCry, even with the benefits of six-months hindsight.\nIn like fashion, analysis of the NotPetya payload raises suggestive questions about the culpability of the attackers. While NotPetya used the same exploit as WannaCry to spread autonomously, the hackers behind NotPetya first distributed the payload through the update server of M.E.Doc, a Ukrainian accounting firm whose software was used by many companies in Ukraine.\nThe use of a software supply-chain with wide use within one country points to the geopolitical motivations of the NotPetya cyberattack. Indeed, in its statement on the NotPetya incident, the White House concluded that NotPetya was part of Russia's \"ongoing efforts to destabilize Ukraine\" (U.S. White House 2018). But the White House did not elaborate further, raising questions about what exactly that meant.\nForensic analysis performed by private security researchers found that close to  $10\\%$  of the computers infected by NotPetya were spared due to a file installed by the attackers . The presence of the file suggests that the Russians anticipated how far the worm might spread. So, were all the companies hit outside Ukraine just collateral damage? As one security researcher has speculated, what if the Russian were trying to \"punish anyone who would dare even to maintain an office inside\" Ukraine ?\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nQuestions about the subtleties of cyberattacks like WannaCry and NotPetya rarely make it on the front pages of newspaper in the aftermath of major incidents. But it is clear they factor into a government's decisions about how to respond to a cyberattack—or at least that they should.\nConsider: if you knew with certainty that the North Koreans had not intended WannaCry to spread as widely as it did, would you consider the attack less blameworthy? What if you knew the attack would have caused much more damage if the research community had failed to identify the kill-switch? Conversely, if you knew with certainty that the Russians intended for NotPetya to spread beyond Ukraine, would you consider the attack more blameworthy? And how would you mete out punishment to the 'ultimately responsible party' of a cyberattack if you determined that the performance of network defenders exacerbated the downstream impact of an attack?\nUltimately, WannaCry and NotPetya illustrate that attribution analysis is about far more than Who did it? or Who to Blame?. Because the impact of cyberattacks is shaped by factors outside the attacker's control, victims must peel beneath the visible effects of an attack to determine an attacker's culpability. Much as jurists adjudicate crime by navigating the ambiguous terrain of human intentions, so states must scrutinize an attack to determine the culpability of the perpetrator.\nMalware and forensic analysis offer one source of analytic clarity for victims. However, technical analysis requires a degree of rigor which may stress the timeframe demanded by policymakers. Even then, analysis cannot eliminate the epistemological ambiguity inherent to cyberattacks. Incidents involving malicious software that 'spun out of control' have sparked bitter debate when litigated in domestic courts (United States v. Morris 1991). If they do not already, similar questions about culpability should cloud the minds of analysts and policymakers keen on responding to state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n# Conclusion\nCurrent scholarship offers a compelling explanation as to why the limits of attribution analysis undermine cyber deterrence. However, it misses one key part of the puzzle. When it comes to cyberattacks, the challenge for states does not just consist in determining who is responsible for an incident, but what the adversary intended to do and how he or she expected to do it. This challenge does not alter the fundamental characteristics of the attribution problem. It exacerbates them.\nThe epistemological requirements of attribution analysis undermine punishment strategies for the deterrence of cyberattacks in two ways. First, they extend the requirements of post-attack analysis. Attribution is not just painstaking and imprecise. It is more painstaking and more imprecise than current scholarship acknowledges. As a result, decision makers may not be able to attain clarity about attacks within the timeframe demanded by deterrence strategies.\nSecond, the ambiguity and indirectness of cyberattacks introduce complicated political and ethical questions into the attribution-deterrence analytic. Yet, punishment strategies rely on the implementation of swift, clear, and proportionate responses. The gap between the possibilities of analysis and the demands of strategy theoretically lessens the appeal of overt punishment strategies for the deterrence of cyberattacks. Nonetheless, further social science research is needed to confirm the empirical basis of this relationship.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nThis research holds two further implications for international politics and intelligence practice. Regarding the former, the epistemological ambiguity inherent to cyberattacks may encourage states to adopt riskier behaviour in cyberspace. So long as states can plausibly deny their responsibility for the damage incurred by cyberattacks—and even those for which they are known to be responsible—they may feel emboldened to risk attacks ‘that leave something to chance’ .\nLikewise, disagreements about the relative wrongfulness of given incidents may themselves generate friction within the international community. The adjudication of cybersecurity incidents that ‘spun out of control’ have generated bitter disagreement in domestic contexts. Similar dynamics appear destined to repeat themselves in international fora, where stakeholders have less incentive to cooperate.\nWhen it comes to intelligence practice, this research suggests that analysts performing attribution analysis must go the extra mile to resist hindsight bias. Due to the unpredictability and ambiguity of cyberattacks, the impact of an attack may exceed or underperform an adversary’s expectations. Intelligence analysts must therefore assess what the adversary tried to make happen and how carefully or recklessly he or she pursued their objectives. Today, the pertinent questions are not just Who did this? or Who to blame? but What to blame them for? and Why?.",

This paper identifies an additional intelligence-centric impediment to cyber deterrence. Cyberattacks yield effects in a manner that is indirect, while offensive cyber operations are multi-stage and multipurpose. These characteristics complicate analytic judgments about the culpability of the attacker, whereas deterrence requires that states retaliate with measures which are timely, clear, and proportionate. The paper uses three cases studies—the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, WannaCry, and NotPetya—to illustrate how the indirectness and ambiguity of cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations obscure the motivations, goals, and culpability of the attacker. It concludes that these characteristics discourage states from adopting punishment-based deterrence strategies because they lengthen the temporal and epistemological requirements of attribution analysis.\nKeywords: Attribution, Deterrence, Cyberattack, Offensive Cyber Operations",
    "# Introduction": "Over the last decade, many scholars have argued that Cold War deterrence models are inapplicable to conflict dynamics in cyberspace . One prominent branch of that literature revolves around the ‘attribution problem’ . The attribution problem posits that the anonymity of cyberspace and the deniability of cyberattacks undermine deterrence by preventing victims from imposing reciprocal costs on the actor that launched the attack—a particular form of deterrence that political scientists refer to as deterrence by punishment.\nThis paper seeks to build on that branch of cyber deterrence research. Through a review of the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, WannaCry, and NotPetya, it suggests an additional intelligence-centric obstacle to deterrence in cyberspace. Due to the indirectness of cyberattacks and the multipurpose and multi-stage nature of offensive cyber operations, the motivations and goals of the perpetrator do not flow readily from the visible effects of an attack. This epistemological ambiguity complicates analytic judgements about the culpability of the attacker, whereas punishment strategies are predicated on responding to a wrong with a swift, clear, and proportionate punishment .\nJournal of Information Warfare (2022) 21.2: 64-76\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nThis ambiguity stems from two characteristics inherent to cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations. On one hand, the tactical and operational similarities between cyberattack and cyber-exploitation create a ‘ambiguity dilemma' for network defenders . Therefore, in the event a culprit is identified before delivery of a final payload, defenders cannot be sure how serious a threat they posed.\nEven after payload delivery, cyberattacks operate indirectly, creating or manipulating a risk of harm as opposed to causing that harm directly (U.S. NRC 2009). As a result, the effects of a cyberattack hinge on factors outside the attacker's control, such as the competence of network defenders and the quicksilver interconnections of the devices, systems, and networks through which they travel .\nThese aspects of cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations reduce the viability of punishment-based deterrence strategies in two ways. First, by extending the analytic requirements of post-attack analysis, they reinforce the predictive logic of the attribution problem. Deterrence requires speed and clarity, while attribution is painstaking and imprecise. It is just more painstaking and more imprecise than most realize.\nOn the other hand, they also complicate judgements about an attacker's culpability. How should states punish perpetrators for damage incurred but not intended or intended but not incurred? A deterrence strategy predicated on overt and proportionate punishments demands unambiguous evidence of an attacker's responsibility. Yet, the characteristics of cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations make these judgments harder to reach, and they render associated punishments harder to justify.\nThis paper develops this argument in two parts. First, it reviews existing literature on the attribution problem. Overwhelmingly, this scholarship has focused on questions of authorship, such as Who did it? or Who is to blame? These questions assume that a victim can devise an appropriate response to a cyberattack, if only it can identify the aggressor.\nNext, the paper examines the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, WannaCry, and NotPetya. It uses the cases to demonstrate how the ambiguity and unpredictability inherent to cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations render who-based attribution insufficient to deterrence by punishment. The paper concludes that these characteristics discourage states from adopting punishment-based deterrence strategies because they exacerbate the temporal and epistemological requirements of post-attack attribution analysis.",

But the White House did not elaborate further, raising questions about what exactly that meant.\nForensic analysis performed by private security researchers found that close to  $10\\%$  of the computers infected by NotPetya were spared due to a file installed by the attackers . The presence of the file suggests that the Russians anticipated how far the worm might spread. So, were all the companies hit outside Ukraine just collateral damage? As one security researcher has speculated, what if the Russian were trying to \"punish anyone who would dare even to maintain an office inside\" Ukraine ?\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nQuestions about the subtleties of cyberattacks like WannaCry and NotPetya rarely make it on the front pages of newspaper in the aftermath of major incidents. But it is clear they factor into a government's decisions about how to respond to a cyberattack—or at least that they should.\nConsider: if you knew with certainty that the North Koreans had not intended WannaCry to spread as widely as it did, would you consider the attack less blameworthy? What if you knew the attack would have caused much more damage if the research community had failed to identify the kill-switch? Conversely, if you knew with certainty that the Russians intended for NotPetya to spread beyond Ukraine, would you consider the attack more blameworthy? And how would you mete out punishment to the 'ultimately responsible party' of a cyberattack if you determined that the performance of network defenders exacerbated the downstream impact of an attack?\nUltimately, WannaCry and NotPetya illustrate that attribution analysis is about far more than Who did it? or Who to Blame?. Because the impact of cyberattacks is shaped by factors outside the attacker's control, victims must peel beneath the visible effects of an attack to determine an attacker's culpability. Much as jurists adjudicate crime by navigating the ambiguous terrain of human intentions, so states must scrutinize an attack to determine the culpability of the perpetrator.\nMalware and forensic analysis offer one source of analytic clarity for victims. However, technical analysis requires a degree of rigor which may stress the timeframe demanded by policymakers. Even then, analysis cannot eliminate the epistemological ambiguity inherent to cyberattacks. Incidents involving malicious software that 'spun out of control' have sparked bitter debate when litigated in domestic courts (United States v. Morris 1991). If they do not already, similar questions about culpability should cloud the minds of analysts and policymakers keen on responding to state-sponsored cyberattacks.",
    "# Conclusion": "Current scholarship offers a compelling explanation as to why the limits of attribution analysis undermine cyber deterrence. However, it misses one key part of the puzzle. When it comes to cyberattacks, the challenge for states does not just consist in determining who is responsible for an incident, but what the adversary intended to do and how he or she expected to do it. This challenge does not alter the fundamental characteristics of the attribution problem. It exacerbates them.\nThe epistemological requirements of attribution analysis undermine punishment strategies for the deterrence of cyberattacks in two ways. First, they extend the requirements of post-attack analysis. Attribution is not just painstaking and imprecise. It is more painstaking and more imprecise than current scholarship acknowledges. As a result, decision makers may not be able to attain clarity about attacks within the timeframe demanded by deterrence strategies.\nSecond, the ambiguity and indirectness of cyberattacks introduce complicated political and ethical questions into the attribution-deterrence analytic. Yet, punishment strategies rely on the implementation of swift, clear, and proportionate responses. The gap between the possibilities of analysis and the demands of strategy theoretically lessens the appeal of overt punishment strategies for the deterrence of cyberattacks. Nonetheless, further social science research is needed to confirm the empirical basis of this relationship.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nThis research holds two further implications for international politics and intelligence practice. Regarding the former, the epistemological ambiguity inherent to cyberattacks may encourage states to adopt riskier behaviour in cyberspace. So long as states can plausibly deny their responsibility for the damage incurred by cyberattacks—and even those for which they are known to be responsible—they may feel emboldened to risk attacks ‘that leave something to chance’ .\nLikewise, disagreements about the relative wrongfulness of given incidents may themselves generate friction within the international community. The adjudication of cybersecurity incidents that ‘spun out of control’ have generated bitter disagreement in domestic contexts. Similar dynamics appear destined to repeat themselves in international fora, where stakeholders have less incentive to cooperate.\nWhen it comes to intelligence practice, this research suggests that analysts performing attribution analysis must go the extra mile to resist hindsight bias. Due to the unpredictability and ambiguity of cyberattacks, the impact of an attack may exceed or underperform an adversary’s expectations. Intelligence analysts must therefore assess what the adversary tried to make happen and how carefully or recklessly he or she pursued their objectives. Today, the pertinent questions are not just Who did this? or Who to blame? but What to blame them for? and Why?."

This paper identifies an additional intelligence-centric impediment to cyber deterrence. Cyberattacks yield effects in a manner that is indirect, while offensive cyber operations are multi-stage and multipurpose. These characteristics complicate analytic judgments about the culpability of the attacker, whereas deterrence requires that states retaliate with measures which are timely, clear, and proportionate. The paper uses three cases studies—the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, WannaCry, and NotPetya—to illustrate how the indirectness and ambiguity of cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations obscure the motivations, goals, and culpability of the attacker. It concludes that these characteristics discourage states from adopting punishment-based deterrence strategies because they lengthen the temporal and epistemological requirements of attribution analysis.\nKeywords: Attribution, Deterrence, Cyberattack, Offensive Cyber Operations\n# Introduction\nOver the last decade, many scholars have argued that Cold War deterrence models are inapplicable to conflict dynamics in cyberspace . One prominent branch of that literature revolves around the ‘attribution problem’ . The attribution problem posits that the anonymity of cyberspace and the deniability of cyberattacks undermine deterrence by preventing victims from imposing reciprocal costs on the actor that launched the attack—a particular form of deterrence that political scientists refer to as deterrence by punishment.\nThis paper seeks to build on that branch of cyber deterrence research. Through a review of the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, WannaCry, and NotPetya, it suggests an additional intelligence-centric obstacle to deterrence in cyberspace. Due to the indirectness of cyberattacks and the multipurpose and multi-stage nature of offensive cyber operations, the motivations and goals of the perpetrator do not flow readily from the visible effects of an attack. This epistemological ambiguity complicates analytic judgements about the culpability of the attacker, whereas punishment strategies are predicated on responding to a wrong with a swift, clear, and proportionate punishment .\nJournal of Information Warfare (2022) 21.2: 64-76\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nThis ambiguity stems from two characteristics inherent to cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations. On one hand, the tactical and operational similarities between cyberattack and cyber-exploitation create a ‘ambiguity dilemma' for network defenders . Therefore, in the event a culprit is identified before delivery of a final payload, defenders cannot be sure how serious a threat they posed.\nEven after payload delivery, cyberattacks operate indirectly, creating or manipulating a risk of harm as opposed to causing that harm directly (U.S. NRC 2009). As a result, the effects of a cyberattack hinge on factors outside the attacker's control, such as the competence of network defenders and the quicksilver interconnections of the devices, systems, and networks through which they travel .\nThese aspects of cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations reduce the viability of punishment-based deterrence strategies in two ways. First, by extending the analytic requirements of post-attack analysis, they reinforce the predictive logic of the attribution problem. Deterrence requires speed and clarity, while attribution is painstaking and imprecise. It is just more painstaking and more imprecise than most realize.\nOn the other hand, they also complicate judgements about an attacker's culpability. How should states punish perpetrators for damage incurred but not intended or intended but not incurred? A deterrence strategy predicated on overt and proportionate punishments demands unambiguous evidence of an attacker's responsibility. Yet, the characteristics of cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations make these judgments harder to reach, and they render associated punishments harder to justify.\nThis paper develops this argument in two parts. First, it reviews existing literature on the attribution problem. Overwhelmingly, this scholarship has focused on questions of authorship, such as Who did it? or Who is to blame? These questions assume that a victim can devise an appropriate response to a cyberattack, if only it can identify the aggressor.\nNext, the paper examines the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, WannaCry, and NotPetya. It uses the cases to demonstrate how the ambiguity and unpredictability inherent to cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations render who-based attribution insufficient to deterrence by punishment. The paper concludes that these characteristics discourage states from adopting punishment-based deterrence strategies because they exacerbate the temporal and epistemological requirements of post-attack attribution analysis.\n## Literature Background\nAttribution refers to the process by which state and non-state actors identify the perpetrators of cyberattacks. In practice, however, the concept is somewhat fluid. Attribution can be applied to individual pieces of malware or an entire cyber operation. It ranges in specificity from operators at a keyboard, to a sub-state entity, to a state. Attribution can also be confidential or public. In each of these cases, attribution entails different evidentiary standards (Grindal, Kuerbis & Mueller 2019).\nThis paper focuses on the public attribution of cyberattacks or offensive cyber operations. Research into this variant of the attribution problem has been ongoing for years, yet it has evolved in response to advances in forensic technology and changing perceptions of cyberspace as a strategic\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\ndomain. Prior to 2013, many believed that the architecture of the Internet protected the anonymity of attackers . Unable to determine Who did it? experts proposed two solutions to the cyber deterrence problem . One group called for redesigning the Internet to make network attacks easier to trace (Landau &amp; Clarke 2011). A second advocated that network defenders instead focus on defence, or deterrence by denial .\nNew scholarship began to emerge after 2013, when a private-sector threat intelligence firm published a report attributing a vast swathe of intrusions to China's People's Liberation Army . The report illustrated that it was possible to use forensic tools available to the private sector to prove who was behind a digital intrusion.\nNonetheless, the use of proxy cyber forces in many of the most prominent state-sponsored cyberattacks up to that point raised questions about the value of attribution . To identify the \"ultimately responsible party\" of an attack, scholars suggested, governments required alternative sources of intelligence (Rid &amp; Buchanan 2015). Understanding of the attribution problem thus evolved from a purely a technical issue to a politico-technical one: not Who did it? but Who to blame? This most recent branch of scholarship accepts that some form of attribution is now within reach. However, it argues that deterrence by punishment remains elusive due to two factors. First, attribution is estimative, not probative. Though it is possible to trace an attack back to an originating network, or even a set of hackers, one is rarely able to prove that a state was involved in the operation, or how (. Second, attribution is \"painstaking\" (Rid &amp; Buchanan 2015). It demands expertise across a range of analytic and technical functions. Synthesizing those work-streams takes time. By contrast, deterrence demands speed and clarity. Through time, space, and deed, deterrers must communicate to perpetrators the link between offence and punishment.\nCurrent scholarship assumes that the only obstacle to deterrence lies in establishing the perpetrator's identity. However, the analytic process is also essential to interpreting the nature and gravity of a cyberattack. Because of their indirectness, cyberattacks can produce effects that exceed or underperform an attacker's intentions. Because of the multi-stage and multi-purpose nature of offensive cyber operations, an attacker's motives, methods, and intentions do not flow readily from the visible effects of an incident. Together, these factors complicate judgments about the responsibility of the perpetrator for the effects of an attack. In turn, they should discourage states from adopting punishment strategies, which are predicated on speed, clarity, and proportionality.\n## Case Selection\nExamining these cases in tandem may raise many a methodological eyebrow. The attacks involved different victims and different perpetrators. NotPetya and WannaCry entailed the compromise of data availability on IT systems. By contrast, the 2016 Russian election interference campaign involved information warfare through the subversion of data confidentiality. Arguably, it does not even represent a cyberattack.\nThe cases nonetheless provide firm methodological footing for exploring how the unpredictability and ambiguity of cyberattacks or offensive cyber operations affects deterrence in cyberspace. First, the attacks covered here received extensive coverage in a domain characterized by extreme secrecy. That coverage does not just provide a rare window into how these attacks unfolded. It\nJournal of Information Warfare\nalso manifests characteristics essential to deterrence yet often absent from state-sponsored cyber conflict : the attacks compromised operational secrecy to produce an effect. In turn, that effect produced pressure for retaliation.\nSecond, the international community managed to identify the ‘ultimately responsible party' in each incident. The cases therefore control for successful attribution under the traditional definition of the term. As the victims of each case suffered few repercussions, they offer tentative support for the notion that who-based attribution is insufficient to deterrence by punishment.\nFinally, policymakers and analysts do not have the luxury of disregarding incidents that elude neat academic categories. To the extent the public treats an event as a ‘cyberattack', the weight of that perception will shape how policymakers interpret an event, formulate a response, and communicate it to the public. The cases are worth considering together because the public considered them together.\n## Russian Election Interference Campaign\nThe 2016 Russian election interference campaign offers strong, albeit anecdotal, evidence that who-based attribution is necessary but not sufficient to deterring state-authored cyberattacks. In fact, members of the United States intelligence and law enforcement communities began to attribute election-adjacent hacking and information operations to Russian affiliates as early as 2015. However, the administration failed to recognize any serious threat to the election until the last weeks of July 2016 . It took longer to devise a deterrent response.\nFour domain-specific characteristics of the campaign complicated analysis and deterrence of the Russian threat.\nFirst, the campaign cut across a vast swathe of digital and informational terrain subject to competing legal authorities for the U.S. intelligence community. Moreover, the persistent nature of its constituent operations presented something of a moving target: As the U.S. intelligence community concluded in a post-election assessment, Russia's goals evolved over time as it became more apparent that Donald Trump had better electoral chances than many realized (U.S. ODNI 2017).\nThe Russian interference comprised three parallel cyber or cyber-enabled operations. The first entailed misinformation and disinformation propagated by troll farms, like the Internet Research Agency, as well as official Russian media outlets and spokespeople. Second was the hack-and-leak operation targeting Clinton campaign staffers and later the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). The third and final campaign comprised the reconnaissance and targeting of U.S. election, or election-adjacent, infrastructure.\nNo single US intelligence entity had the legal authorities, let alone the capability, to investigate all the campaign's components at once. Yet, identifying Russia's role in individual operations would prove insufficient to grasping the overall threat.\nIn September of 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) determined that Russian state-sponsored hackers had breached the DNC. However, the FBI did not consider the threat to be serious and failed to communicate it to the White House. Policymakers in the Obama Administration claimed they first learned about the breach of the DNC in mid-June of 2016, following a revelation\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nfrom the *Washington Post* . Likewise, throughout the year, officials across the US government must have noted Russia’s overt information campaigns, which began between June and December of 2015 (Maremont &amp; Barry 2017). Despite traditional attribution on these fronts, none of this information triggered the U.S. intelligence community to the severity of the threat.\nSecond, conditioned by past foreign espionage efforts, US intelligence officials failed to appreciate the dual threat posed by theft of sensitive information from US political actors and entities.\nMany Obama Administration officials later admitted that they were not overly alarmed when they first learned of the DNC hack because they regarded it as “traditional espionage” . According to the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s report on the 2016 Russian interference campaign, their familiarity with previous cyber-espionage campaigns inured them to the significance of the DNC breach:\n&gt; Witnesses interviewed by the Committee consistently said that Russian cyberactivity was a well-known issue within the administration, however hardly any administration officials had considered the threat of information collected through cyber espionage being weaponized when assessing the consequences of the Russian cyber intrusions into the Clinton campaign, the DNC, and the DCCC. .\nHence, as intelligence officials struggled to connect the dots on the Russian interference effort, they overlooked the dots that stood in plain sight.\nWhen it finally recognized the Russian threat to the election, the Obama Administration hesitated to craft a response. At that point, a third domain-specific intelligence challenge plagued officials: cyber-weapons must be kept secret to be effective, and the Obama Administration did not know whether the Russians had developed a capability to compromise vote tallies on election day. Ironically, while U.S. officials at first underestimated the Russian interference threat, they may have overestimated it by the end of the summer.\nBetween June and September of 2016, Russian hackers targeted U.S. election-related infrastructure in at least 21 states . According to subsequent reporting, however, the activity amounted mainly to “scanning and probing”—actions that did not necessarily reflect a willingness, let alone confer a capability, to swing the result on election day . Nonetheless, President Obama ordered a National Intelligence Estimate to ascertain how vulnerable the country’s election infrastructure was to compromise .\nCompleted later that summer, the National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the country’s election infrastructure was secure . Nonetheless, Obama Administration officials remained wary, reportedly “assum[ing] the worst-case scenario” with regards to Russia’s ability to manipulate vote tallies or voter registration data . As a result, the administration declined to impose high costs on the Russians before election day. President Obama feared that doing more might provoke Putin .\nFourth, even after the election, uncertainty about how to measure the effects of the Russian campaign discouraged President Obama from issuing a harsher punishment.\nWhat percentage of American political polarization during the 2016 election stemmed from Russian interference, as opposed to domestic forces? Did those efforts change enough votes to swing,\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nor even to affect, the 2016 election? President Obama feared that by drawing too much attention to the interference campaign he would appear partisan, legitimizing some of the narratives propagated by the Russians and further undermining confidence .\nOverall, in reacting to the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, US officials had to worry about far more than who was behind the campaign. To craft an effective deterrence strategy, they needed to determine the nature, purpose, and goals of the Russian threat. However, several features unique to the digital medium complicated that process.\nThe persistence, ambiguity, and breadth of the Russian interference campaign eluded analysis from one intelligence agency. The dual-use character of offensive cyber operations inured U.S. officials to a particular type of attack, while the secrecy inherent to cyber weapons may have made them overly concerned about another. And even after the election took place, the White House feared that any response might feed the perception that the campaign had inflicted more damage than it really had.\nThe Obama Administration finally woke up to the Russian threat in early August 2016, when information alleged to originate from a human intelligence asset in the Kremlin reached the White House . While little information is known about the asset or the intelligence he or she provided, the source and nature of the intelligence is telling.\nReporting from a high-placed source within the Russian government must have done more than confirm who was behind the ongoing interference efforts. In tying campaign back to the highest political authorities in Russia, the intelligence necessarily conveyed information about the nature, coordination, and scale of Russia's intentions. That was something the Obama Administration could not distil from who-based attribution alone.\n# WannaCry and NotPetya\nThe WannaCry and NotPetya cyberattacks present ideal test cases for the viability of deterrence in cyberspace. Both cyberattacks caused significant damage, crippling foreign computer systems, some in critical infrastructure sectors. In both cases, there was never much doubt about who the 'ultimately responsible party' was. Even though the U.S. government did not release official statements for several months after each attack, private security researchers identified the likely perpetrators within days. And unlike the Russian interference campaign, both left a quantifiable trail of damage. Shouldn't it be easy for states to punish the perpetrators behind a NotPetya or a WannaCry?\nClose review of the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks suggests two domain-specific factors that complicate a punishment strategy for cyberattacks. While the paper does not speculate whether these considerations shaped historical policy decisions surrounding these incidents, it argues that both render a punishment strategy less desirable than it otherwise might be.\nFirst, the unpredictability of cyberattacks makes it difficult to adjudicate how much damage the attackers bear responsibility for. This analytic hurdle is particularly challenging with cyberattacks that employ self-propagating mechanisms, such as WannaCry and NotPetya.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nBoth WannaCry and NotPetya yielded significant damage in a matter of hours. WannaCry infected 300,000 computers in 150 countries . The worm’s victims included major multinationals, such as FedEx and Telefonica, French automaker Renault, ministries in the Russian government, and Deutsche Bahn, a major German railway service. The worm also wrought havoc in the physical world. In the six days after WannaCry broke loose, the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) cancelled 19,000 appointments . Altogether, WannaCry incurred approximately $4 billion in damages .\nNotPetya also spread widely, although the payload was first distributed through a software supply chain in wide use in Ukraine. As a result, it inflicted more localized damage. Within 24 hours, NotPetya hit four hospitals in Kiev, six power companies, two airports, and much of the federal government. According to one security firm, it wiped 10 percent of all computers in the country .\nOutside Ukraine, NotPetya infected computers in 60 countries and caused significant financial losses for a slew of multinational corporations . Maersk, the shipping conglomerate, suffered $275 million in damages; Merck, a pharmaceutical giant, totalled its losses at $870 million; TNT Expresses lost $400 million; Reckitt Benckiser, a British manufacturer, experienced $129 million in damages; and Mondelez, a food producer, took a $188 million hit . According to estimates from the White House, NotPetya tallied $10 billion in total damages (White House 2018).\nOne may conclude that the attacks yielded sufficient damage to warrant a reciprocal punishment. But what should policymakers and analysts make of the damage that each attack could have caused but did not, or caused because of the panicked overreaction of network defenders? In the case of NotPetya and WannaCry, factors outside the attackers' control affected how much damage the attacks generated.\nFor example, hours after the WannaCry attack began to spread, an independent computer security researcher named Marcus Hutchins accidentally activated a kill-switch on the worm. Hutchins had been studying the WannaCry malware when he noticed the code called back to a curious-looking web domain. On a whim, Hutchins purchased it for $10. As it turns out, his handiwork stopped WannaCry from propagating hours or even days before it might have.\nNotPetya had no such universal kill-switch. Just the same, the actions of network defenders shaped how much damage it inflicted. For example, Merck’s IT administrators managed to shut down the company’s entire corporate network in roughly 90 seconds, sparing the company more extensive damage . By contrast, the Ukrainian post office did not react quite as nimbly as Merck. It lost more than 70 percent of its computers to NotPetya .\nChance factors also guided NotPetya in unpredictable directions. For example, during the attack, Maersk lost every one of its 150 domain controllers save one. The lone surviving domain controller, which allowed Maersk to restore its entire corporate network, was spared by dumb luck: it been knocked offline due to a local power outage .\nOn the other hand, NotPetya may have come close to causing significant physical damage. It infected computers at the clean-up site of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor. Although the computers\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\ndealing with critical functions at the Chernobyl site were air-gapped from the Internet, the site's IT director had to disconnect thousands of Windows machines at the plant .\nIf the unpredictability of cyberattacks raises questions about how to adjudicate the culpability of attackers, code and network forensics present a second, potentially more reliable tool of analysis as compared with impact assessment. However, technical analysis is not foolproof and doing it effectively takes time.\nFor example, WannaCry appeared to represent a form of ransomware: it promised to unlock infected systems so long as victims transmitted cryptocurrency to an attacker-controlled virtual wallet. However, WannaCry reined in a fraction of the money that it could have due to a coding error (Ivanov, Sinitsyn &amp; Mamedov 2017; Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology 2017; Johnson 2018). Was the error genuine? Or were the North Koreans trying to mask geopolitical motives behind financial ones?\nIn general, security researchers agree that the quality of WannaCry's code was \"very low\". For example, private security researchers discovered that WannaCry's encryption mechanism left many deleted files recoverable . In addition, the worm bore the shockingly simple kill-switch. Had the North Koreans designed it as a safety mechanism in case the malware spread out of control? Or was it an oversight?\nInterestingly, the White House's prepared statement on WannaCry avoided any definitive statement on whether North Korea's intentions were financial or geopolitical. During the question-and-answer section of the press conference, Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert indicated he \"thinks\" that the true purpose of the attack was to \"cause havoc and destruction\" (U.S. White House 2017). Bossert's answer suggests that the U.S. government could not confidently ascertain the true purposes of WannaCry, even with the benefits of six-months hindsight.\nIn like fashion, analysis of the NotPetya payload raises suggestive questions about the culpability of the attackers. While NotPetya used the same exploit as WannaCry to spread autonomously, the hackers behind NotPetya first distributed the payload through the update server of M.E.Doc, a Ukrainian accounting firm whose software was used by many companies in Ukraine.\nThe use of a software supply-chain with wide use within one country points to the geopolitical motivations of the NotPetya cyberattack. Indeed, in its statement on the NotPetya incident, the White House concluded that NotPetya was part of Russia's \"ongoing efforts to destabilize Ukraine\" (U.S. White House 2018). But the White House did not elaborate further, raising questions about what exactly that meant.\nForensic analysis performed by private security researchers found that close to  $10\\%$  of the computers infected by NotPetya were spared due to a file installed by the attackers . The presence of the file suggests that the Russians anticipated how far the worm might spread. So, were all the companies hit outside Ukraine just collateral damage? As one security researcher has speculated, what if the Russian were trying to \"punish anyone who would dare even to maintain an office inside\" Ukraine ?\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nQuestions about the subtleties of cyberattacks like WannaCry and NotPetya rarely make it on the front pages of newspaper in the aftermath of major incidents. But it is clear they factor into a government's decisions about how to respond to a cyberattack—or at least that they should.\nConsider: if you knew with certainty that the North Koreans had not intended WannaCry to spread as widely as it did, would you consider the attack less blameworthy? What if you knew the attack would have caused much more damage if the research community had failed to identify the kill-switch? Conversely, if you knew with certainty that the Russians intended for NotPetya to spread beyond Ukraine, would you consider the attack more blameworthy? And how would you mete out punishment to the 'ultimately responsible party' of a cyberattack if you determined that the performance of network defenders exacerbated the downstream impact of an attack?\nUltimately, WannaCry and NotPetya illustrate that attribution analysis is about far more than Who did it? or Who to Blame?. Because the impact of cyberattacks is shaped by factors outside the attacker's control, victims must peel beneath the visible effects of an attack to determine an attacker's culpability. Much as jurists adjudicate crime by navigating the ambiguous terrain of human intentions, so states must scrutinize an attack to determine the culpability of the perpetrator.\nMalware and forensic analysis offer one source of analytic clarity for victims. However, technical analysis requires a degree of rigor which may stress the timeframe demanded by policymakers. Even then, analysis cannot eliminate the epistemological ambiguity inherent to cyberattacks. Incidents involving malicious software that 'spun out of control' have sparked bitter debate when litigated in domestic courts (United States v. Morris 1991). If they do not already, similar questions about culpability should cloud the minds of analysts and policymakers keen on responding to state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n# Conclusion\nCurrent scholarship offers a compelling explanation as to why the limits of attribution analysis undermine cyber deterrence. However, it misses one key part of the puzzle. When it comes to cyberattacks, the challenge for states does not just consist in determining who is responsible for an incident, but what the adversary intended to do and how he or she expected to do it. This challenge does not alter the fundamental characteristics of the attribution problem. It exacerbates them.\nThe epistemological requirements of attribution analysis undermine punishment strategies for the deterrence of cyberattacks in two ways. First, they extend the requirements of post-attack analysis. Attribution is not just painstaking and imprecise. It is more painstaking and more imprecise than current scholarship acknowledges. As a result, decision makers may not be able to attain clarity about attacks within the timeframe demanded by deterrence strategies.\nSecond, the ambiguity and indirectness of cyberattacks introduce complicated political and ethical questions into the attribution-deterrence analytic. Yet, punishment strategies rely on the implementation of swift, clear, and proportionate responses. The gap between the possibilities of analysis and the demands of strategy theoretically lessens the appeal of overt punishment strategies for the deterrence of cyberattacks. Nonetheless, further social science research is needed to confirm the empirical basis of this relationship.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nThis research holds two further implications for international politics and intelligence practice. Regarding the former, the epistemological ambiguity inherent to cyberattacks may encourage states to adopt riskier behaviour in cyberspace. So long as states can plausibly deny their responsibility for the damage incurred by cyberattacks—and even those for which they are known to be responsible—they may feel emboldened to risk attacks ‘that leave something to chance’ .\nLikewise, disagreements about the relative wrongfulness of given incidents may themselves generate friction within the international community. The adjudication of cybersecurity incidents that ‘spun out of control’ have generated bitter disagreement in domestic contexts. Similar dynamics appear destined to repeat themselves in international fora, where stakeholders have less incentive to cooperate.\nWhen it comes to intelligence practice, this research suggests that analysts performing attribution analysis must go the extra mile to resist hindsight bias. Due to the unpredictability and ambiguity of cyberattacks, the impact of an attack may exceed or underperform an adversary’s expectations. Intelligence analysts must therefore assess what the adversary tried to make happen and how carefully or recklessly he or she pursued their objectives. Today, the pertinent questions are not just Who did this? or Who to blame? but What to blame them for? and Why?.",

This paper identifies an additional intelligence-centric impediment to cyber deterrence. Cyberattacks yield effects in a manner that is indirect, while offensive cyber operations are multi-stage and multipurpose. These characteristics complicate analytic judgments about the culpability of the attacker, whereas deterrence requires that states retaliate with measures which are timely, clear, and proportionate. The paper uses three cases studies—the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, WannaCry, and NotPetya—to illustrate how the indirectness and ambiguity of cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations obscure the motivations, goals, and culpability of the attacker. It concludes that these characteristics discourage states from adopting punishment-based deterrence strategies because they lengthen the temporal and epistemological requirements of attribution analysis.\nKeywords: Attribution, Deterrence, Cyberattack, Offensive Cyber Operations\n# Introduction\nOver the last decade, many scholars have argued that Cold War deterrence models are inapplicable to conflict dynamics in cyberspace (Libicki 2009; Gartzke &amp; Lindsay 2015; Nye 2017; Chesney et al. 2020). One prominent branch of that literature revolves around the ‘attribution problem’ (Libicki 2009; Boebert 2011; Healey 2012; Rid &amp; Buchanan 2015; Lin 2016). The attribution problem posits that the anonymity of cyberspace and the deniability of cyberattacks undermine deterrence by preventing victims from imposing reciprocal costs on the actor that launched the attack—a particular form of deterrence that political scientists refer to as deterrence by punishment.\nThis paper seeks to build on that branch of cyber deterrence research. Through a review of the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, WannaCry, and NotPetya, it suggests an additional intelligence-centric obstacle to deterrence in cyberspace. Due to the indirectness of cyberattacks and the multipurpose and multi-stage nature of offensive cyber operations, the motivations and goals of the perpetrator do not flow readily from the visible effects of an attack. This epistemological ambiguity complicates analytic judgements about the culpability of the attacker, whereas punishment strategies are predicated on responding to a wrong with a swift, clear, and proportionate punishment (Schelling 1968).\nJournal of Information Warfare (2022) 21.2: 64-76\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nThis ambiguity stems from two characteristics inherent to cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations. On one hand, the tactical and operational similarities between cyberattack and cyber-exploitation create a ‘ambiguity dilemma' for network defenders (Buchanan 2017). Therefore, in the event a culprit is identified before delivery of a final payload, defenders cannot be sure how serious a threat they posed.\nEven after payload delivery, cyberattacks operate indirectly, creating or manipulating a risk of harm as opposed to causing that harm directly (U.S. NRC 2009). As a result, the effects of a cyberattack hinge on factors outside the attacker's control, such as the competence of network defenders and the quicksilver interconnections of the devices, systems, and networks through which they travel (US NRC 2009; Farrell & Glaser 2017).\nThese aspects of cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations reduce the viability of punishment-based deterrence strategies in two ways. First, by extending the analytic requirements of post-attack analysis, they reinforce the predictive logic of the attribution problem. Deterrence requires speed and clarity, while attribution is painstaking and imprecise. It is just more painstaking and more imprecise than most realize.\nOn the other hand, they also complicate judgements about an attacker's culpability. How should states punish perpetrators for damage incurred but not intended or intended but not incurred? A deterrence strategy predicated on overt and proportionate punishments demands unambiguous evidence of an attacker's responsibility. Yet, the characteristics of cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations make these judgments harder to reach, and they render associated punishments harder to justify.\nThis paper develops this argument in two parts. First, it reviews existing literature on the attribution problem. Overwhelmingly, this scholarship has focused on questions of authorship, such as Who did it? or Who is to blame? These questions assume that a victim can devise an appropriate response to a cyberattack, if only it can identify the aggressor.\nNext, the paper examines the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, WannaCry, and NotPetya. It uses the cases to demonstrate how the ambiguity and unpredictability inherent to cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations render who-based attribution insufficient to deterrence by punishment. The paper concludes that these characteristics discourage states from adopting punishment-based deterrence strategies because they exacerbate the temporal and epistemological requirements of post-attack attribution analysis.\n## Literature Background\nAttribution refers to the process by which state and non-state actors identify the perpetrators of cyberattacks. In practice, however, the concept is somewhat fluid. Attribution can be applied to individual pieces of malware or an entire cyber operation. It ranges in specificity from operators at a keyboard, to a sub-state entity, to a state. Attribution can also be confidential or public. In each of these cases, attribution entails different evidentiary standards (Grindal, Kuerbis & Mueller 2019).\nThis paper focuses on the public attribution of cyberattacks or offensive cyber operations. Research into this variant of the attribution problem has been ongoing for years, yet it has evolved in response to advances in forensic technology and changing perceptions of cyberspace as a strategic\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\ndomain. Prior to 2013, many believed that the architecture of the Internet protected the anonymity of attackers (Boebert 2011). Unable to determine Who did it? experts proposed two solutions to the cyber deterrence problem (Lynn 2010). One group called for redesigning the Internet to make network attacks easier to trace (Landau &amp; Clarke 2011). A second advocated that network defenders instead focus on defence, or deterrence by denial (Libicki 2009).\nNew scholarship began to emerge after 2013, when a private-sector threat intelligence firm published a report attributing a vast swathe of intrusions to China's People's Liberation Army (FireEye 2013). The report illustrated that it was possible to use forensic tools available to the private sector to prove who was behind a digital intrusion.\nNonetheless, the use of proxy cyber forces in many of the most prominent state-sponsored cyberattacks up to that point raised questions about the value of attribution (Healey 2012). To identify the \"ultimately responsible party\" of an attack, scholars suggested, governments required alternative sources of intelligence (Rid &amp; Buchanan 2015). Understanding of the attribution problem thus evolved from a purely a technical issue to a politico-technical one: not Who did it? but Who to blame? (Lin 2016)\nThis most recent branch of scholarship accepts that some form of attribution is now within reach. However, it argues that deterrence by punishment remains elusive due to two factors. First, attribution is estimative, not probative. Though it is possible to trace an attack back to an originating network, or even a set of hackers, one is rarely able to prove that a state was involved in the operation, or how ((Healey 2012; Lin 2016). Second, attribution is \"painstaking\" (Rid &amp; Buchanan 2015). It demands expertise across a range of analytic and technical functions. Synthesizing those work-streams takes time. By contrast, deterrence demands speed and clarity. Through time, space, and deed, deterrers must communicate to perpetrators the link between offence and punishment.\nCurrent scholarship assumes that the only obstacle to deterrence lies in establishing the perpetrator's identity. However, the analytic process is also essential to interpreting the nature and gravity of a cyberattack. Because of their indirectness, cyberattacks can produce effects that exceed or underperform an attacker's intentions. Because of the multi-stage and multi-purpose nature of offensive cyber operations, an attacker's motives, methods, and intentions do not flow readily from the visible effects of an incident. Together, these factors complicate judgments about the responsibility of the perpetrator for the effects of an attack. In turn, they should discourage states from adopting punishment strategies, which are predicated on speed, clarity, and proportionality.\n## Case Selection\nExamining these cases in tandem may raise many a methodological eyebrow. The attacks involved different victims and different perpetrators. NotPetya and WannaCry entailed the compromise of data availability on IT systems. By contrast, the 2016 Russian election interference campaign involved information warfare through the subversion of data confidentiality. Arguably, it does not even represent a cyberattack.\nThe cases nonetheless provide firm methodological footing for exploring how the unpredictability and ambiguity of cyberattacks or offensive cyber operations affects deterrence in cyberspace. First, the attacks covered here received extensive coverage in a domain characterized by extreme secrecy. That coverage does not just provide a rare window into how these attacks unfolded. It\nJournal of Information Warfare\nalso manifests characteristics essential to deterrence yet often absent from state-sponsored cyber conflict (Chesney et al. 2020): the attacks compromised operational secrecy to produce an effect. In turn, that effect produced pressure for retaliation.\nSecond, the international community managed to identify the ‘ultimately responsible party' in each incident. The cases therefore control for successful attribution under the traditional definition of the term. As the victims of each case suffered few repercussions, they offer tentative support for the notion that who-based attribution is insufficient to deterrence by punishment.\nFinally, policymakers and analysts do not have the luxury of disregarding incidents that elude neat academic categories. To the extent the public treats an event as a ‘cyberattack', the weight of that perception will shape how policymakers interpret an event, formulate a response, and communicate it to the public. The cases are worth considering together because the public considered them together.\n## Russian Election Interference Campaign\nThe 2016 Russian election interference campaign offers strong, albeit anecdotal, evidence that who-based attribution is necessary but not sufficient to deterring state-authored cyberattacks. In fact, members of the United States intelligence and law enforcement communities began to attribute election-adjacent hacking and information operations to Russian affiliates as early as 2015. However, the administration failed to recognize any serious threat to the election until the last weeks of July 2016 (Sanger 2018). It took longer to devise a deterrent response.\nFour domain-specific characteristics of the campaign complicated analysis and deterrence of the Russian threat.\nFirst, the campaign cut across a vast swathe of digital and informational terrain subject to competing legal authorities for the U.S. intelligence community. Moreover, the persistent nature of its constituent operations presented something of a moving target: As the U.S. intelligence community concluded in a post-election assessment, Russia's goals evolved over time as it became more apparent that Donald Trump had better electoral chances than many realized (U.S. ODNI 2017).\nThe Russian interference comprised three parallel cyber or cyber-enabled operations. The first entailed misinformation and disinformation propagated by troll farms, like the Internet Research Agency, as well as official Russian media outlets and spokespeople. Second was the hack-and-leak operation targeting Clinton campaign staffers and later the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). The third and final campaign comprised the reconnaissance and targeting of U.S. election, or election-adjacent, infrastructure.\nNo single US intelligence entity had the legal authorities, let alone the capability, to investigate all the campaign's components at once. Yet, identifying Russia's role in individual operations would prove insufficient to grasping the overall threat.\nIn September of 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) determined that Russian state-sponsored hackers had breached the DNC. However, the FBI did not consider the threat to be serious and failed to communicate it to the White House. Policymakers in the Obama Administration claimed they first learned about the breach of the DNC in mid-June of 2016, following a revelation\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nfrom the *Washington Post* (US SSCI 2018). Likewise, throughout the year, officials across the US government must have noted Russia’s overt information campaigns, which began between June and December of 2015 (Maremont &amp; Barry 2017). Despite traditional attribution on these fronts, none of this information triggered the U.S. intelligence community to the severity of the threat.\nSecond, conditioned by past foreign espionage efforts, US intelligence officials failed to appreciate the dual threat posed by theft of sensitive information from US political actors and entities.\nMany Obama Administration officials later admitted that they were not overly alarmed when they first learned of the DNC hack because they regarded it as “traditional espionage” (US SSCI 2018, p. 5). According to the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s report on the 2016 Russian interference campaign, their familiarity with previous cyber-espionage campaigns inured them to the significance of the DNC breach:\n&gt; Witnesses interviewed by the Committee consistently said that Russian cyberactivity was a well-known issue within the administration, however hardly any administration officials had considered the threat of information collected through cyber espionage being weaponized when assessing the consequences of the Russian cyber intrusions into the Clinton campaign, the DNC, and the DCCC. (US SSCI 2018, p. 9).\nHence, as intelligence officials struggled to connect the dots on the Russian interference effort, they overlooked the dots that stood in plain sight.\nWhen it finally recognized the Russian threat to the election, the Obama Administration hesitated to craft a response. At that point, a third domain-specific intelligence challenge plagued officials: cyber-weapons must be kept secret to be effective, and the Obama Administration did not know whether the Russians had developed a capability to compromise vote tallies on election day. Ironically, while U.S. officials at first underestimated the Russian interference threat, they may have overestimated it by the end of the summer.\nBetween June and September of 2016, Russian hackers targeted U.S. election-related infrastructure in at least 21 states (US SSCI 2018, p. 5-12). According to subsequent reporting, however, the activity amounted mainly to “scanning and probing”—actions that did not necessarily reflect a willingness, let alone confer a capability, to swing the result on election day (US DHS 2016). Nonetheless, President Obama ordered a National Intelligence Estimate to ascertain how vulnerable the country’s election infrastructure was to compromise (Sanger 2018).\nCompleted later that summer, the National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the country’s election infrastructure was secure (Sanger 2018). Nonetheless, Obama Administration officials remained wary, reportedly “assum[ing] the worst-case scenario” with regards to Russia’s ability to manipulate vote tallies or voter registration data (US SSCI 2018, p. 20). As a result, the administration declined to impose high costs on the Russians before election day. President Obama feared that doing more might provoke Putin (US SSCI 2018).\nFourth, even after the election, uncertainty about how to measure the effects of the Russian campaign discouraged President Obama from issuing a harsher punishment.\nWhat percentage of American political polarization during the 2016 election stemmed from Russian interference, as opposed to domestic forces? Did those efforts change enough votes to swing,\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nor even to affect, the 2016 election? President Obama feared that by drawing too much attention to the interference campaign he would appear partisan, legitimizing some of the narratives propagated by the Russians and further undermining confidence (US SSCI 2018).\nOverall, in reacting to the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, US officials had to worry about far more than who was behind the campaign. To craft an effective deterrence strategy, they needed to determine the nature, purpose, and goals of the Russian threat. However, several features unique to the digital medium complicated that process.\nThe persistence, ambiguity, and breadth of the Russian interference campaign eluded analysis from one intelligence agency. The dual-use character of offensive cyber operations inured U.S. officials to a particular type of attack, while the secrecy inherent to cyber weapons may have made them overly concerned about another. And even after the election took place, the White House feared that any response might feed the perception that the campaign had inflicted more damage than it really had.\nThe Obama Administration finally woke up to the Russian threat in early August 2016, when information alleged to originate from a human intelligence asset in the Kremlin reached the White House (Brennan 2021). While little information is known about the asset or the intelligence he or she provided, the source and nature of the intelligence is telling.\nReporting from a high-placed source within the Russian government must have done more than confirm who was behind the ongoing interference efforts. In tying campaign back to the highest political authorities in Russia, the intelligence necessarily conveyed information about the nature, coordination, and scale of Russia's intentions. That was something the Obama Administration could not distil from who-based attribution alone.\n# WannaCry and NotPetya\nThe WannaCry and NotPetya cyberattacks present ideal test cases for the viability of deterrence in cyberspace. Both cyberattacks caused significant damage, crippling foreign computer systems, some in critical infrastructure sectors. In both cases, there was never much doubt about who the 'ultimately responsible party' was. Even though the U.S. government did not release official statements for several months after each attack, private security researchers identified the likely perpetrators within days. And unlike the Russian interference campaign, both left a quantifiable trail of damage. Shouldn't it be easy for states to punish the perpetrators behind a NotPetya or a WannaCry?\nClose review of the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks suggests two domain-specific factors that complicate a punishment strategy for cyberattacks. While the paper does not speculate whether these considerations shaped historical policy decisions surrounding these incidents, it argues that both render a punishment strategy less desirable than it otherwise might be.\nFirst, the unpredictability of cyberattacks makes it difficult to adjudicate how much damage the attackers bear responsibility for. This analytic hurdle is particularly challenging with cyberattacks that employ self-propagating mechanisms, such as WannaCry and NotPetya.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nBoth WannaCry and NotPetya yielded significant damage in a matter of hours. WannaCry infected 300,000 computers in 150 countries (Johnson 2018). The worm’s victims included major multinationals, such as FedEx and Telefonica, French automaker Renault, ministries in the Russian government, and Deutsche Bahn, a major German railway service. The worm also wrought havoc in the physical world. In the six days after WannaCry broke loose, the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) cancelled 19,000 appointments (Johnson 2018). Altogether, WannaCry incurred approximately $4 billion in damages (Berr 2017).\nNotPetya also spread widely, although the payload was first distributed through a software supply chain in wide use in Ukraine. As a result, it inflicted more localized damage. Within 24 hours, NotPetya hit four hospitals in Kiev, six power companies, two airports, and much of the federal government. According to one security firm, it wiped 10 percent of all computers in the country (Greenberg 2019).\nOutside Ukraine, NotPetya infected computers in 60 countries and caused significant financial losses for a slew of multinational corporations (Frenkel 2017). Maersk, the shipping conglomerate, suffered $275 million in damages; Merck, a pharmaceutical giant, totalled its losses at $870 million; TNT Expresses lost $400 million; Reckitt Benckiser, a British manufacturer, experienced $129 million in damages; and Mondelez, a food producer, took a $188 million hit (Greenberg 2019). According to estimates from the White House, NotPetya tallied $10 billion in total damages (White House 2018).\nOne may conclude that the attacks yielded sufficient damage to warrant a reciprocal punishment. But what should policymakers and analysts make of the damage that each attack could have caused but did not, or caused because of the panicked overreaction of network defenders? In the case of NotPetya and WannaCry, factors outside the attackers' control affected how much damage the attacks generated.\nFor example, hours after the WannaCry attack began to spread, an independent computer security researcher named Marcus Hutchins accidentally activated a kill-switch on the worm. Hutchins had been studying the WannaCry malware when he noticed the code called back to a curious-looking web domain. On a whim, Hutchins purchased it for $10. As it turns out, his handiwork stopped WannaCry from propagating hours or even days before it might have.\nNotPetya had no such universal kill-switch. Just the same, the actions of network defenders shaped how much damage it inflicted. For example, Merck’s IT administrators managed to shut down the company’s entire corporate network in roughly 90 seconds, sparing the company more extensive damage (Greenberg 2019). By contrast, the Ukrainian post office did not react quite as nimbly as Merck. It lost more than 70 percent of its computers to NotPetya (Greenberg 2019).\nChance factors also guided NotPetya in unpredictable directions. For example, during the attack, Maersk lost every one of its 150 domain controllers save one. The lone surviving domain controller, which allowed Maersk to restore its entire corporate network, was spared by dumb luck: it been knocked offline due to a local power outage (Greenberg 2019).\nOn the other hand, NotPetya may have come close to causing significant physical damage. It infected computers at the clean-up site of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor. Although the computers\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\ndealing with critical functions at the Chernobyl site were air-gapped from the Internet, the site's IT director had to disconnect thousands of Windows machines at the plant (Greenberg 2019).\nIf the unpredictability of cyberattacks raises questions about how to adjudicate the culpability of attackers, code and network forensics present a second, potentially more reliable tool of analysis as compared with impact assessment. However, technical analysis is not foolproof and doing it effectively takes time.\nFor example, WannaCry appeared to represent a form of ransomware: it promised to unlock infected systems so long as victims transmitted cryptocurrency to an attacker-controlled virtual wallet. However, WannaCry reined in a fraction of the money that it could have due to a coding error (Ivanov, Sinitsyn &amp; Mamedov 2017; Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology 2017; Johnson 2018). Was the error genuine? Or were the North Koreans trying to mask geopolitical motives behind financial ones?\nIn general, security researchers agree that the quality of WannaCry's code was \"very low\". For example, private security researchers discovered that WannaCry's encryption mechanism left many deleted files recoverable (Kaspersky 2017). In addition, the worm bore the shockingly simple kill-switch. Had the North Koreans designed it as a safety mechanism in case the malware spread out of control? Or was it an oversight?\nInterestingly, the White House's prepared statement on WannaCry avoided any definitive statement on whether North Korea's intentions were financial or geopolitical. During the question-and-answer section of the press conference, Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert indicated he \"thinks\" that the true purpose of the attack was to \"cause havoc and destruction\" (U.S. White House 2017). Bossert's answer suggests that the U.S. government could not confidently ascertain the true purposes of WannaCry, even with the benefits of six-months hindsight.\nIn like fashion, analysis of the NotPetya payload raises suggestive questions about the culpability of the attackers. While NotPetya used the same exploit as WannaCry to spread autonomously, the hackers behind NotPetya first distributed the payload through the update server of M.E.Doc, a Ukrainian accounting firm whose software was used by many companies in Ukraine.\nThe use of a software supply-chain with wide use within one country points to the geopolitical motivations of the NotPetya cyberattack. Indeed, in its statement on the NotPetya incident, the White House concluded that NotPetya was part of Russia's \"ongoing efforts to destabilize Ukraine\" (U.S. White House 2018). But the White House did not elaborate further, raising questions about what exactly that meant.\nForensic analysis performed by private security researchers found that close to  $10\\%$  of the computers infected by NotPetya were spared due to a file installed by the attackers (Greenberg 2018). The presence of the file suggests that the Russians anticipated how far the worm might spread. So, were all the companies hit outside Ukraine just collateral damage? As one security researcher has speculated, what if the Russian were trying to \"punish anyone who would dare even to maintain an office inside\" Ukraine (Greenberg 2018)?\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nQuestions about the subtleties of cyberattacks like WannaCry and NotPetya rarely make it on the front pages of newspaper in the aftermath of major incidents. But it is clear they factor into a government's decisions about how to respond to a cyberattack—or at least that they should.\nConsider: if you knew with certainty that the North Koreans had not intended WannaCry to spread as widely as it did, would you consider the attack less blameworthy? What if you knew the attack would have caused much more damage if the research community had failed to identify the kill-switch? Conversely, if you knew with certainty that the Russians intended for NotPetya to spread beyond Ukraine, would you consider the attack more blameworthy? And how would you mete out punishment to the 'ultimately responsible party' of a cyberattack if you determined that the performance of network defenders exacerbated the downstream impact of an attack?\nUltimately, WannaCry and NotPetya illustrate that attribution analysis is about far more than Who did it? or Who to Blame?. Because the impact of cyberattacks is shaped by factors outside the attacker's control, victims must peel beneath the visible effects of an attack to determine an attacker's culpability. Much as jurists adjudicate crime by navigating the ambiguous terrain of human intentions, so states must scrutinize an attack to determine the culpability of the perpetrator.\nMalware and forensic analysis offer one source of analytic clarity for victims. However, technical analysis requires a degree of rigor which may stress the timeframe demanded by policymakers. Even then, analysis cannot eliminate the epistemological ambiguity inherent to cyberattacks. Incidents involving malicious software that 'spun out of control' have sparked bitter debate when litigated in domestic courts (United States v. Morris 1991). If they do not already, similar questions about culpability should cloud the minds of analysts and policymakers keen on responding to state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n# Conclusion\nCurrent scholarship offers a compelling explanation as to why the limits of attribution analysis undermine cyber deterrence. However, it misses one key part of the puzzle. When it comes to cyberattacks, the challenge for states does not just consist in determining who is responsible for an incident, but what the adversary intended to do and how he or she expected to do it. This challenge does not alter the fundamental characteristics of the attribution problem. It exacerbates them.\nThe epistemological requirements of attribution analysis undermine punishment strategies for the deterrence of cyberattacks in two ways. First, they extend the requirements of post-attack analysis. Attribution is not just painstaking and imprecise. It is more painstaking and more imprecise than current scholarship acknowledges. As a result, decision makers may not be able to attain clarity about attacks within the timeframe demanded by deterrence strategies.\nSecond, the ambiguity and indirectness of cyberattacks introduce complicated political and ethical questions into the attribution-deterrence analytic. Yet, punishment strategies rely on the implementation of swift, clear, and proportionate responses. The gap between the possibilities of analysis and the demands of strategy theoretically lessens the appeal of overt punishment strategies for the deterrence of cyberattacks. Nonetheless, further social science research is needed to confirm the empirical basis of this relationship.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nThis research holds two further implications for international politics and intelligence practice. Regarding the former, the epistemological ambiguity inherent to cyberattacks may encourage states to adopt riskier behaviour in cyberspace. So long as states can plausibly deny their responsibility for the damage incurred by cyberattacks—and even those for which they are known to be responsible—they may feel emboldened to risk attacks ‘that leave something to chance’ (Schelling 1968; Farrell &amp; Glaser 2017).\nLikewise, disagreements about the relative wrongfulness of given incidents may themselves generate friction within the international community. The adjudication of cybersecurity incidents that ‘spun out of control’ have generated bitter disagreement in domestic contexts. Similar dynamics appear destined to repeat themselves in international fora, where stakeholders have less incentive to cooperate.\nWhen it comes to intelligence practice, this research suggests that analysts performing attribution analysis must go the extra mile to resist hindsight bias. Due to the unpredictability and ambiguity of cyberattacks, the impact of an attack may exceed or underperform an adversary’s expectations. Intelligence analysts must therefore assess what the adversary tried to make happen and how carefully or recklessly he or she pursued their objectives. Today, the pertinent questions are not just Who did this? or Who to blame? but What to blame them for? and Why?."

This paper identifies an additional intelligence-centric impediment to cyber deterrence. Cyberattacks yield effects in a manner that is indirect, while offensive cyber operations are multi-stage and multipurpose. These characteristics complicate analytic judgments about the culpability of the attacker, whereas deterrence requires that states retaliate with measures which are timely, clear, and proportionate. The paper uses three cases studies—the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, WannaCry, and NotPetya—to illustrate how the indirectness and ambiguity of cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations obscure the motivations, goals, and culpability of the attacker. It concludes that these characteristics discourage states from adopting punishment-based deterrence strategies because they lengthen the temporal and epistemological requirements of attribution analysis.\nKeywords: Attribution, Deterrence, Cyberattack, Offensive Cyber Operations\n# Introduction\nOver the last decade, many scholars have argued that Cold War deterrence models are inapplicable to conflict dynamics in cyberspace (Libicki 2009; Gartzke &amp; Lindsay 2015; Nye 2017; Chesney et al. 2020). One prominent branch of that literature revolves around the ‘attribution problem’ (Libicki 2009; Boebert 2011; Healey 2012; Rid &amp; Buchanan 2015; Lin 2016). The attribution problem posits that the anonymity of cyberspace and the deniability of cyberattacks undermine deterrence by preventing victims from imposing reciprocal costs on the actor that launched the attack—a particular form of deterrence that political scientists refer to as deterrence by punishment.\nThis paper seeks to build on that branch of cyber deterrence research. Through a review of the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, WannaCry, and NotPetya, it suggests an additional intelligence-centric obstacle to deterrence in cyberspace. Due to the indirectness of cyberattacks and the multipurpose and multi-stage nature of offensive cyber operations, the motivations and goals of the perpetrator do not flow readily from the visible effects of an attack. This epistemological ambiguity complicates analytic judgements about the culpability of the attacker, whereas punishment strategies are predicated on responding to a wrong with a swift, clear, and proportionate punishment (Schelling 1968).\nJournal of Information Warfare (2022) 21.2: 64-76\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nThis ambiguity stems from two characteristics inherent to cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations. On one hand, the tactical and operational similarities between cyberattack and cyber-exploitation create a ‘ambiguity dilemma' for network defenders (Buchanan 2017). Therefore, in the event a culprit is identified before delivery of a final payload, defenders cannot be sure how serious a threat they posed.\nEven after payload delivery, cyberattacks operate indirectly, creating or manipulating a risk of harm as opposed to causing that harm directly (U.S. NRC 2009). As a result, the effects of a cyberattack hinge on factors outside the attacker's control, such as the competence of network defenders and the quicksilver interconnections of the devices, systems, and networks through which they travel (US NRC 2009; Farrell & Glaser 2017).\nThese aspects of cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations reduce the viability of punishment-based deterrence strategies in two ways. First, by extending the analytic requirements of post-attack analysis, they reinforce the predictive logic of the attribution problem. Deterrence requires speed and clarity, while attribution is painstaking and imprecise. It is just more painstaking and more imprecise than most realize.\nOn the other hand, they also complicate judgements about an attacker's culpability. How should states punish perpetrators for damage incurred but not intended or intended but not incurred? A deterrence strategy predicated on overt and proportionate punishments demands unambiguous evidence of an attacker's responsibility. Yet, the characteristics of cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations make these judgments harder to reach, and they render associated punishments harder to justify.\nThis paper develops this argument in two parts. First, it reviews existing literature on the attribution problem. Overwhelmingly, this scholarship has focused on questions of authorship, such as Who did it? or Who is to blame? These questions assume that a victim can devise an appropriate response to a cyberattack, if only it can identify the aggressor.\nNext, the paper examines the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, WannaCry, and NotPetya. It uses the cases to demonstrate how the ambiguity and unpredictability inherent to cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations render who-based attribution insufficient to deterrence by punishment. The paper concludes that these characteristics discourage states from adopting punishment-based deterrence strategies because they exacerbate the temporal and epistemological requirements of post-attack attribution analysis.\n## Literature Background\nAttribution refers to the process by which state and non-state actors identify the perpetrators of cyberattacks. In practice, however, the concept is somewhat fluid. Attribution can be applied to individual pieces of malware or an entire cyber operation. It ranges in specificity from operators at a keyboard, to a sub-state entity, to a state. Attribution can also be confidential or public. In each of these cases, attribution entails different evidentiary standards (Grindal, Kuerbis & Mueller 2019).\nThis paper focuses on the public attribution of cyberattacks or offensive cyber operations. Research into this variant of the attribution problem has been ongoing for years, yet it has evolved in response to advances in forensic technology and changing perceptions of cyberspace as a strategic\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\ndomain. Prior to 2013, many believed that the architecture of the Internet protected the anonymity of attackers (Boebert 2011). Unable to determine Who did it? experts proposed two solutions to the cyber deterrence problem (Lynn 2010). One group called for redesigning the Internet to make network attacks easier to trace (Landau &amp; Clarke 2011). A second advocated that network defenders instead focus on defence, or deterrence by denial (Libicki 2009).\nNew scholarship began to emerge after 2013, when a private-sector threat intelligence firm published a report attributing a vast swathe of intrusions to China's People's Liberation Army (FireEye 2013). The report illustrated that it was possible to use forensic tools available to the private sector to prove who was behind a digital intrusion.\nNonetheless, the use of proxy cyber forces in many of the most prominent state-sponsored cyberattacks up to that point raised questions about the value of attribution (Healey 2012). To identify the \"ultimately responsible party\" of an attack, scholars suggested, governments required alternative sources of intelligence (Rid &amp; Buchanan 2015). Understanding of the attribution problem thus evolved from a purely a technical issue to a politico-technical one: not Who did it? but Who to blame? (Lin 2016)\nThis most recent branch of scholarship accepts that some form of attribution is now within reach. However, it argues that deterrence by punishment remains elusive due to two factors. First, attribution is estimative, not probative. Though it is possible to trace an attack back to an originating network, or even a set of hackers, one is rarely able to prove that a state was involved in the operation, or how ((Healey 2012; Lin 2016). Second, attribution is \"painstaking\" (Rid &amp; Buchanan 2015). It demands expertise across a range of analytic and technical functions. Synthesizing those work-streams takes time. By contrast, deterrence demands speed and clarity. Through time, space, and deed, deterrers must communicate to perpetrators the link between offence and punishment.\nCurrent scholarship assumes that the only obstacle to deterrence lies in establishing the perpetrator's identity. However, the analytic process is also essential to interpreting the nature and gravity of a cyberattack. Because of their indirectness, cyberattacks can produce effects that exceed or underperform an attacker's intentions. Because of the multi-stage and multi-purpose nature of offensive cyber operations, an attacker's motives, methods, and intentions do not flow readily from the visible effects of an incident. Together, these factors complicate judgments about the responsibility of the perpetrator for the effects of an attack. In turn, they should discourage states from adopting punishment strategies, which are predicated on speed, clarity, and proportionality.\n## Case Selection\nExamining these cases in tandem may raise many a methodological eyebrow. The attacks involved different victims and different perpetrators. NotPetya and WannaCry entailed the compromise of data availability on IT systems. By contrast, the 2016 Russian election interference campaign involved information warfare through the subversion of data confidentiality. Arguably, it does not even represent a cyberattack.\nThe cases nonetheless provide firm methodological footing for exploring how the unpredictability and ambiguity of cyberattacks or offensive cyber operations affects deterrence in cyberspace. First, the attacks covered here received extensive coverage in a domain characterized by extreme secrecy. That coverage does not just provide a rare window into how these attacks unfolded. It\nJournal of Information Warfare\nalso manifests characteristics essential to deterrence yet often absent from state-sponsored cyber conflict (Chesney et al. 2020): the attacks compromised operational secrecy to produce an effect. In turn, that effect produced pressure for retaliation.\nSecond, the international community managed to identify the ‘ultimately responsible party' in each incident. The cases therefore control for successful attribution under the traditional definition of the term. As the victims of each case suffered few repercussions, they offer tentative support for the notion that who-based attribution is insufficient to deterrence by punishment.\nFinally, policymakers and analysts do not have the luxury of disregarding incidents that elude neat academic categories. To the extent the public treats an event as a ‘cyberattack', the weight of that perception will shape how policymakers interpret an event, formulate a response, and communicate it to the public. The cases are worth considering together because the public considered them together.\n## Russian Election Interference Campaign\nThe 2016 Russian election interference campaign offers strong, albeit anecdotal, evidence that who-based attribution is necessary but not sufficient to deterring state-authored cyberattacks. In fact, members of the United States intelligence and law enforcement communities began to attribute election-adjacent hacking and information operations to Russian affiliates as early as 2015. However, the administration failed to recognize any serious threat to the election until the last weeks of July 2016 (Sanger 2018). It took longer to devise a deterrent response.\nFour domain-specific characteristics of the campaign complicated analysis and deterrence of the Russian threat.\nFirst, the campaign cut across a vast swathe of digital and informational terrain subject to competing legal authorities for the U.S. intelligence community. Moreover, the persistent nature of its constituent operations presented something of a moving target: As the U.S. intelligence community concluded in a post-election assessment, Russia's goals evolved over time as it became more apparent that Donald Trump had better electoral chances than many realized (U.S. ODNI 2017).\nThe Russian interference comprised three parallel cyber or cyber-enabled operations. The first entailed misinformation and disinformation propagated by troll farms, like the Internet Research Agency, as well as official Russian media outlets and spokespeople. Second was the hack-and-leak operation targeting Clinton campaign staffers and later the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). The third and final campaign comprised the reconnaissance and targeting of U.S. election, or election-adjacent, infrastructure.\nNo single US intelligence entity had the legal authorities, let alone the capability, to investigate all the campaign's components at once. Yet, identifying Russia's role in individual operations would prove insufficient to grasping the overall threat.\nIn September of 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) determined that Russian state-sponsored hackers had breached the DNC. However, the FBI did not consider the threat to be serious and failed to communicate it to the White House. Policymakers in the Obama Administration claimed they first learned about the breach of the DNC in mid-June of 2016, following a revelation\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nfrom the *Washington Post* (US SSCI 2018). Likewise, throughout the year, officials across the US government must have noted Russia’s overt information campaigns, which began between June and December of 2015 (Maremont &amp; Barry 2017). Despite traditional attribution on these fronts, none of this information triggered the U.S. intelligence community to the severity of the threat.\nSecond, conditioned by past foreign espionage efforts, US intelligence officials failed to appreciate the dual threat posed by theft of sensitive information from US political actors and entities.\nMany Obama Administration officials later admitted that they were not overly alarmed when they first learned of the DNC hack because they regarded it as “traditional espionage” (US SSCI 2018, p. 5). According to the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s report on the 2016 Russian interference campaign, their familiarity with previous cyber-espionage campaigns inured them to the significance of the DNC breach:\n&gt; Witnesses interviewed by the Committee consistently said that Russian cyberactivity was a well-known issue within the administration, however hardly any administration officials had considered the threat of information collected through cyber espionage being weaponized when assessing the consequences of the Russian cyber intrusions into the Clinton campaign, the DNC, and the DCCC. (US SSCI 2018, p. 9).\nHence, as intelligence officials struggled to connect the dots on the Russian interference effort, they overlooked the dots that stood in plain sight.\nWhen it finally recognized the Russian threat to the election, the Obama Administration hesitated to craft a response. At that point, a third domain-specific intelligence challenge plagued officials: cyber-weapons must be kept secret to be effective, and the Obama Administration did not know whether the Russians had developed a capability to compromise vote tallies on election day. Ironically, while U.S. officials at first underestimated the Russian interference threat, they may have overestimated it by the end of the summer.\nBetween June and September of 2016, Russian hackers targeted U.S. election-related infrastructure in at least 21 states (US SSCI 2018, p. 5-12). According to subsequent reporting, however, the activity amounted mainly to “scanning and probing”—actions that did not necessarily reflect a willingness, let alone confer a capability, to swing the result on election day (US DHS 2016). Nonetheless, President Obama ordered a National Intelligence Estimate to ascertain how vulnerable the country’s election infrastructure was to compromise (Sanger 2018).\nCompleted later that summer, the National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the country’s election infrastructure was secure (Sanger 2018). Nonetheless, Obama Administration officials remained wary, reportedly “assum[ing] the worst-case scenario” with regards to Russia’s ability to manipulate vote tallies or voter registration data (US SSCI 2018, p. 20). As a result, the administration declined to impose high costs on the Russians before election day. President Obama feared that doing more might provoke Putin (US SSCI 2018).\nFourth, even after the election, uncertainty about how to measure the effects of the Russian campaign discouraged President Obama from issuing a harsher punishment.\nWhat percentage of American political polarization during the 2016 election stemmed from Russian interference, as opposed to domestic forces? Did those efforts change enough votes to swing,\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nor even to affect, the 2016 election? President Obama feared that by drawing too much attention to the interference campaign he would appear partisan, legitimizing some of the narratives propagated by the Russians and further undermining confidence (US SSCI 2018).\nOverall, in reacting to the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, US officials had to worry about far more than who was behind the campaign. To craft an effective deterrence strategy, they needed to determine the nature, purpose, and goals of the Russian threat. However, several features unique to the digital medium complicated that process.\nThe persistence, ambiguity, and breadth of the Russian interference campaign eluded analysis from one intelligence agency. The dual-use character of offensive cyber operations inured U.S. officials to a particular type of attack, while the secrecy inherent to cyber weapons may have made them overly concerned about another. And even after the election took place, the White House feared that any response might feed the perception that the campaign had inflicted more damage than it really had.\nThe Obama Administration finally woke up to the Russian threat in early August 2016, when information alleged to originate from a human intelligence asset in the Kremlin reached the White House (Brennan 2021). While little information is known about the asset or the intelligence he or she provided, the source and nature of the intelligence is telling.\nReporting from a high-placed source within the Russian government must have done more than confirm who was behind the ongoing interference efforts. In tying campaign back to the highest political authorities in Russia, the intelligence necessarily conveyed information about the nature, coordination, and scale of Russia's intentions. That was something the Obama Administration could not distil from who-based attribution alone.\n# WannaCry and NotPetya\nThe WannaCry and NotPetya cyberattacks present ideal test cases for the viability of deterrence in cyberspace. Both cyberattacks caused significant damage, crippling foreign computer systems, some in critical infrastructure sectors. In both cases, there was never much doubt about who the 'ultimately responsible party' was. Even though the U.S. government did not release official statements for several months after each attack, private security researchers identified the likely perpetrators within days. And unlike the Russian interference campaign, both left a quantifiable trail of damage. Shouldn't it be easy for states to punish the perpetrators behind a NotPetya or a WannaCry?\nClose review of the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks suggests two domain-specific factors that complicate a punishment strategy for cyberattacks. While the paper does not speculate whether these considerations shaped historical policy decisions surrounding these incidents, it argues that both render a punishment strategy less desirable than it otherwise might be.\nFirst, the unpredictability of cyberattacks makes it difficult to adjudicate how much damage the attackers bear responsibility for. This analytic hurdle is particularly challenging with cyberattacks that employ self-propagating mechanisms, such as WannaCry and NotPetya.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nBoth WannaCry and NotPetya yielded significant damage in a matter of hours. WannaCry infected 300,000 computers in 150 countries (Johnson 2018). The worm’s victims included major multinationals, such as FedEx and Telefonica, French automaker Renault, ministries in the Russian government, and Deutsche Bahn, a major German railway service. The worm also wrought havoc in the physical world. In the six days after WannaCry broke loose, the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) cancelled 19,000 appointments (Johnson 2018). Altogether, WannaCry incurred approximately $4 billion in damages (Berr 2017).\nNotPetya also spread widely, although the payload was first distributed through a software supply chain in wide use in Ukraine. As a result, it inflicted more localized damage. Within 24 hours, NotPetya hit four hospitals in Kiev, six power companies, two airports, and much of the federal government. According to one security firm, it wiped 10 percent of all computers in the country (Greenberg 2019).\nOutside Ukraine, NotPetya infected computers in 60 countries and caused significant financial losses for a slew of multinational corporations (Frenkel 2017). Maersk, the shipping conglomerate, suffered $275 million in damages; Merck, a pharmaceutical giant, totalled its losses at $870 million; TNT Expresses lost $400 million; Reckitt Benckiser, a British manufacturer, experienced $129 million in damages; and Mondelez, a food producer, took a $188 million hit (Greenberg 2019). According to estimates from the White House, NotPetya tallied $10 billion in total damages (White House 2018).\nOne may conclude that the attacks yielded sufficient damage to warrant a reciprocal punishment. But what should policymakers and analysts make of the damage that each attack could have caused but did not, or caused because of the panicked overreaction of network defenders? In the case of NotPetya and WannaCry, factors outside the attackers' control affected how much damage the attacks generated.\nFor example, hours after the WannaCry attack began to spread, an independent computer security researcher named Marcus Hutchins accidentally activated a kill-switch on the worm. Hutchins had been studying the WannaCry malware when he noticed the code called back to a curious-looking web domain. On a whim, Hutchins purchased it for $10. As it turns out, his handiwork stopped WannaCry from propagating hours or even days before it might have.\nNotPetya had no such universal kill-switch. Just the same, the actions of network defenders shaped how much damage it inflicted. For example, Merck’s IT administrators managed to shut down the company’s entire corporate network in roughly 90 seconds, sparing the company more extensive damage (Greenberg 2019). By contrast, the Ukrainian post office did not react quite as nimbly as Merck. It lost more than 70 percent of its computers to NotPetya (Greenberg 2019).\nChance factors also guided NotPetya in unpredictable directions. For example, during the attack, Maersk lost every one of its 150 domain controllers save one. The lone surviving domain controller, which allowed Maersk to restore its entire corporate network, was spared by dumb luck: it been knocked offline due to a local power outage (Greenberg 2019).\nOn the other hand, NotPetya may have come close to causing significant physical damage. It infected computers at the clean-up site of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor. Although the computers\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\ndealing with critical functions at the Chernobyl site were air-gapped from the Internet, the site's IT director had to disconnect thousands of Windows machines at the plant (Greenberg 2019).\nIf the unpredictability of cyberattacks raises questions about how to adjudicate the culpability of attackers, code and network forensics present a second, potentially more reliable tool of analysis as compared with impact assessment. However, technical analysis is not foolproof and doing it effectively takes time.\nFor example, WannaCry appeared to represent a form of ransomware: it promised to unlock infected systems so long as victims transmitted cryptocurrency to an attacker-controlled virtual wallet. However, WannaCry reined in a fraction of the money that it could have due to a coding error (Ivanov, Sinitsyn &amp; Mamedov 2017; Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology 2017; Johnson 2018). Was the error genuine? Or were the North Koreans trying to mask geopolitical motives behind financial ones?\nIn general, security researchers agree that the quality of WannaCry's code was \"very low\". For example, private security researchers discovered that WannaCry's encryption mechanism left many deleted files recoverable (Kaspersky 2017). In addition, the worm bore the shockingly simple kill-switch. Had the North Koreans designed it as a safety mechanism in case the malware spread out of control? Or was it an oversight?\nInterestingly, the White House's prepared statement on WannaCry avoided any definitive statement on whether North Korea's intentions were financial or geopolitical. During the question-and-answer section of the press conference, Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert indicated he \"thinks\" that the true purpose of the attack was to \"cause havoc and destruction\" (U.S. White House 2017). Bossert's answer suggests that the U.S. government could not confidently ascertain the true purposes of WannaCry, even with the benefits of six-months hindsight.\nIn like fashion, analysis of the NotPetya payload raises suggestive questions about the culpability of the attackers. While NotPetya used the same exploit as WannaCry to spread autonomously, the hackers behind NotPetya first distributed the payload through the update server of M.E.Doc, a Ukrainian accounting firm whose software was used by many companies in Ukraine.\nThe use of a software supply-chain with wide use within one country points to the geopolitical motivations of the NotPetya cyberattack. Indeed, in its statement on the NotPetya incident, the White House concluded that NotPetya was part of Russia's \"ongoing efforts to destabilize Ukraine\" (U.S. White House 2018). But the White House did not elaborate further, raising questions about what exactly that meant.\nForensic analysis performed by private security researchers found that close to  $10\\%$  of the computers infected by NotPetya were spared due to a file installed by the attackers (Greenberg 2018). The presence of the file suggests that the Russians anticipated how far the worm might spread. So, were all the companies hit outside Ukraine just collateral damage? As one security researcher has speculated, what if the Russian were trying to \"punish anyone who would dare even to maintain an office inside\" Ukraine (Greenberg 2018)?\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nQuestions about the subtleties of cyberattacks like WannaCry and NotPetya rarely make it on the front pages of newspaper in the aftermath of major incidents. But it is clear they factor into a government's decisions about how to respond to a cyberattack—or at least that they should.\nConsider: if you knew with certainty that the North Koreans had not intended WannaCry to spread as widely as it did, would you consider the attack less blameworthy? What if you knew the attack would have caused much more damage if the research community had failed to identify the kill-switch? Conversely, if you knew with certainty that the Russians intended for NotPetya to spread beyond Ukraine, would you consider the attack more blameworthy? And how would you mete out punishment to the 'ultimately responsible party' of a cyberattack if you determined that the performance of network defenders exacerbated the downstream impact of an attack?\nUltimately, WannaCry and NotPetya illustrate that attribution analysis is about far more than Who did it? or Who to Blame?. Because the impact of cyberattacks is shaped by factors outside the attacker's control, victims must peel beneath the visible effects of an attack to determine an attacker's culpability. Much as jurists adjudicate crime by navigating the ambiguous terrain of human intentions, so states must scrutinize an attack to determine the culpability of the perpetrator.\nMalware and forensic analysis offer one source of analytic clarity for victims. However, technical analysis requires a degree of rigor which may stress the timeframe demanded by policymakers. Even then, analysis cannot eliminate the epistemological ambiguity inherent to cyberattacks. Incidents involving malicious software that 'spun out of control' have sparked bitter debate when litigated in domestic courts (United States v. Morris 1991). If they do not already, similar questions about culpability should cloud the minds of analysts and policymakers keen on responding to state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n# Conclusion\nCurrent scholarship offers a compelling explanation as to why the limits of attribution analysis undermine cyber deterrence. However, it misses one key part of the puzzle. When it comes to cyberattacks, the challenge for states does not just consist in determining who is responsible for an incident, but what the adversary intended to do and how he or she expected to do it. This challenge does not alter the fundamental characteristics of the attribution problem. It exacerbates them.\nThe epistemological requirements of attribution analysis undermine punishment strategies for the deterrence of cyberattacks in two ways. First, they extend the requirements of post-attack analysis. Attribution is not just painstaking and imprecise. It is more painstaking and more imprecise than current scholarship acknowledges. As a result, decision makers may not be able to attain clarity about attacks within the timeframe demanded by deterrence strategies.\nSecond, the ambiguity and indirectness of cyberattacks introduce complicated political and ethical questions into the attribution-deterrence analytic. Yet, punishment strategies rely on the implementation of swift, clear, and proportionate responses. The gap between the possibilities of analysis and the demands of strategy theoretically lessens the appeal of overt punishment strategies for the deterrence of cyberattacks. Nonetheless, further social science research is needed to confirm the empirical basis of this relationship.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nThis research holds two further implications for international politics and intelligence practice. Regarding the former, the epistemological ambiguity inherent to cyberattacks may encourage states to adopt riskier behaviour in cyberspace. So long as states can plausibly deny their responsibility for the damage incurred by cyberattacks—and even those for which they are known to be responsible—they may feel emboldened to risk attacks ‘that leave something to chance’ (Schelling 1968; Farrell &amp; Glaser 2017).\nLikewise, disagreements about the relative wrongfulness of given incidents may themselves generate friction within the international community. The adjudication of cybersecurity incidents that ‘spun out of control’ have generated bitter disagreement in domestic contexts. Similar dynamics appear destined to repeat themselves in international fora, where stakeholders have less incentive to cooperate.\nWhen it comes to intelligence practice, this research suggests that analysts performing attribution analysis must go the extra mile to resist hindsight bias. Due to the unpredictability and ambiguity of cyberattacks, the impact of an attack may exceed or underperform an adversary’s expectations. Intelligence analysts must therefore assess what the adversary tried to make happen and how carefully or recklessly he or she pursued their objectives. Today, the pertinent questions are not just Who did this? or Who to blame? but What to blame them for? and Why?."

      "flat_text": "# Extending the ‘Attribution Problem’: Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nJN Sakellariadis\n2021-2022 Fulbright U.S. Student Research Grantee\nAthens, Greece\nE-mail: jns2164@columbia.edu\nAbstract: Current scholarship explains the shortcomings of cyber deterrence through the difficulty involved in proving who launched an attack—what scholars refer to as the ‘attribution problem’. This paper identifies an additional intelligence-centric impediment to cyber deterrence.

On one hand, the tactical and operational similarities between cyberattack and cyber-exploitation create a ‘ambiguity dilemma' for network defenders . Therefore, in the event a culprit is identified before delivery of a final payload, defenders cannot be sure how serious a threat they posed.\nEven after payload delivery, cyberattacks operate indirectly, creating or manipulating a risk of harm as opposed to causing that harm directly (U.S. NRC 2009).

A deterrence strategy predicated on overt and proportionate punishments demands unambiguous evidence of an attacker's responsibility. Yet, the characteristics of cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations make these judgments harder to reach, and they render associated punishments harder to justify.\nThis paper develops this argument in two parts. First, it reviews existing literature on the attribution problem. Overwhelmingly, this scholarship has focused on questions of authorship, such as Who did it? or Who is to blame? These questions assume that a victim can devise an appropriate response to a cyberattack, if only it can identify the aggressor.\nNext, the paper examines the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, WannaCry, and NotPetya. It uses the cases to demonstrate how the ambiguity and unpredictability inherent to cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations render who-based attribution insufficient to deterrence by punishment. The paper concludes that these characteristics discourage states from adopting punishment-based deterrence strategies because they exacerbate the temporal and epistemological requirements of post-attack attribution analysis.\n## Literature Background\nAttribution refers to the process by which state and non-state actors identify the perpetrators of cyberattacks. In practice, however, the concept is somewhat fluid. Attribution can be applied to individual pieces of malware or an entire cyber operation. It ranges in specificity from operators at a keyboard, to a sub-state entity, to a state. Attribution can also be confidential or public. In each of these cases, attribution entails different evidentiary standards (Grindal, Kuerbis & Mueller 2019).\nThis paper focuses on the public attribution of cyberattacks or offensive cyber operations. Research into this variant of the attribution problem has been ongoing for years, yet it has evolved in response to advances in forensic technology and changing perceptions of cyberspace as a strategic\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\ndomain. Prior to 2013, many believed that the architecture of the Internet protected the anonymity of attackers . Unable to determine Who did it? experts proposed two solutions to the cyber deterrence problem . One group called for redesigning the Internet to make network attacks easier to trace (Landau &amp; Clarke 2011). A second advocated that network defenders instead focus on defence, or deterrence by denial .\nNew scholarship began to emerge after 2013, when a private-sector threat intelligence firm published a report attributing a vast swathe of intrusions to China's People's Liberation Army . The report illustrated that it was possible to use forensic tools available to the private sector to prove who was behind a digital intrusion.\nNonetheless, the use of proxy cyber forces in many of the most prominent state-sponsored cyberattacks up to that point raised questions about the value of attribution . To identify the \"ultimately responsible party\" of an attack, scholars suggested, governments required alternative sources of intelligence (Rid &amp; Buchanan 2015). Understanding of the attribution problem thus evolved from a purely a technical issue to a politico-technical one: not Who did it? but Who to blame? This most recent branch of scholarship accepts that some form of attribution is now within reach. However, it argues that deterrence by punishment remains elusive due to two factors. First, attribution is estimative, not probative. Though it is possible to trace an attack back to an originating network, or even a set of hackers, one is rarely able to prove that a state was involved in the operation, or how (. Second, attribution is \"painstaking\" (Rid &amp; Buchanan 2015). It demands expertise across a range of analytic and technical functions. Synthesizing those work-streams takes time. By contrast, deterrence demands speed and clarity. Through time, space, and deed, deterrers must communicate to perpetrators the link between offence and punishment.\nCurrent scholarship assumes that the only obstacle to deterrence lies in establishing the perpetrator's identity. However, the analytic process is also essential to interpreting the nature and gravity of a cyberattack. Because of their indirectness, cyberattacks can produce effects that exceed or underperform an attacker's intentions. Because of the multi-stage and multi-purpose nature of offensive cyber operations, an attacker's motives, methods, and intentions do not flow readily from the visible effects of an incident. Together, these factors complicate judgments about the responsibility of the perpetrator for the effects of an attack. In turn, they should discourage states from adopting punishment strategies, which are predicated on speed, clarity, and proportionality.\n## Case Selection\nExamining these cases in tandem may raise many a methodological eyebrow. The attacks involved different victims and different perpetrators. NotPetya and WannaCry entailed the compromise of data availability on IT systems. By contrast, the 2016 Russian election interference campaign involved information warfare through the subversion of data confidentiality. Arguably, it does not even represent a cyberattack.\nThe cases nonetheless provide firm methodological footing for exploring how the unpredictability and ambiguity of cyberattacks or offensive cyber operations affects deterrence in cyberspace. First, the attacks covered here received extensive coverage in a domain characterized by extreme secrecy. That coverage does not just provide a rare window into how these attacks unfolded. It\nJournal of Information Warfare\nalso manifests characteristics essential to deterrence yet often absent from state-sponsored cyber conflict : the attacks compromised operational secrecy to produce an effect. In turn, that effect produced pressure for retaliation.\nSecond, the international community managed to identify the ‘ultimately responsible party' in each incident. The cases therefore control for successful attribution under the traditional definition of the term. As the victims of each case suffered few repercussions, they offer tentative support for the notion that who-based attribution is insufficient to deterrence by punishment.\nFinally, policymakers and analysts do not have the luxury of disregarding incidents that elude neat academic categories. To the extent the public treats an event as a ‘cyberattack', the weight of that perception will shape how policymakers interpret an event, formulate a response, and communicate it to the public. The cases are worth considering together because the public considered them together.\n## Russian Election Interference Campaign\nThe 2016 Russian election interference campaign offers strong, albeit anecdotal, evidence that who-based attribution is necessary but not sufficient to deterring state-authored cyberattacks. In fact, members of the United States intelligence and law enforcement communities began to attribute election-adjacent hacking and information operations to Russian affiliates as early as 2015. However, the administration failed to recognize any serious threat to the election until the last weeks of July 2016 . It took longer to devise a deterrent response.\nFour domain-specific characteristics of the campaign complicated analysis and deterrence of the Russian threat.\nFirst, the campaign cut across a vast swathe of digital and informational terrain subject to competing legal authorities for the U.S. intelligence community. Moreover, the persistent nature of its constituent operations presented something of a moving target: As the U.S. intelligence community concluded in a post-election assessment, Russia's goals evolved over time as it became more apparent that Donald Trump had better electoral chances than many realized (U.S. ODNI 2017).\nThe Russian interference comprised three parallel cyber or cyber-enabled operations. The first entailed misinformation and disinformation propagated by troll farms, like the Internet Research Agency, as well as official Russian media outlets and spokespeople. Second was the hack-and-leak operation targeting Clinton campaign staffers and later the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). The third and final campaign comprised the reconnaissance and targeting of U.S. election, or election-adjacent, infrastructure.\nNo single US intelligence entity had the legal authorities, let alone the capability, to investigate all the campaign's components at once. Yet, identifying Russia's role in individual operations would prove insufficient to grasping the overall threat.\nIn September of 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) determined that Russian state-sponsored hackers had breached the DNC. However, the FBI did not consider the threat to be serious and failed to communicate it to the White House. Policymakers in the Obama Administration claimed they first learned about the breach of the DNC in mid-June of 2016, following a revelation\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nfrom the *Washington Post* . Likewise, throughout the year, officials across the US government must have noted Russia’s overt information campaigns, which began between June and December of 2015 (Maremont &amp; Barry 2017). Despite traditional attribution on these fronts, none of this information triggered the U.S. intelligence community to the severity of the threat.\nSecond, conditioned by past foreign espionage efforts, US intelligence officials failed to appreciate the dual threat posed by theft of sensitive information from US political actors and entities.\nMany Obama Administration officials later admitted that they were not overly alarmed when they first learned of the DNC hack because they regarded it as “traditional espionage” . According to the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s report on the 2016 Russian interference campaign, their familiarity with previous cyber-espionage campaigns inured them to the significance of the DNC breach:\n&gt; Witnesses interviewed by the Committee consistently said that Russian cyberactivity was a well-known issue within the administration, however hardly any administration officials had considered the threat of information collected through cyber espionage being weaponized when assessing the consequences of the Russian cyber intrusions into the Clinton campaign, the DNC, and the DCCC. .\nHence, as intelligence officials struggled to connect the dots on the Russian interference effort, they overlooked the dots that stood in plain sight.\nWhen it finally recognized the Russian threat to the election, the Obama Administration hesitated to craft a response. At that point, a third domain-specific intelligence challenge plagued officials: cyber-weapons must be kept secret to be effective, and the Obama Administration did not know whether the Russians had developed a capability to compromise vote tallies on election day. Ironically, while U.S. officials at first underestimated the Russian interference threat, they may have overestimated it by the end of the summer.\nBetween June and September of 2016, Russian hackers targeted U.S. election-related infrastructure in at least 21 states . According to subsequent reporting, however, the activity amounted mainly to “scanning and probing”—actions that did not necessarily reflect a willingness, let alone confer a capability, to swing the result on election day . Nonetheless, President Obama ordered a National Intelligence Estimate to ascertain how vulnerable the country’s election infrastructure was to compromise .\nCompleted later that summer, the National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the country’s election infrastructure was secure . Nonetheless, Obama Administration officials remained wary, reportedly “assum[ing] the worst-case scenario” with regards to Russia’s ability to manipulate vote tallies or voter registration data . As a result, the administration declined to impose high costs on the Russians before election day. President Obama feared that doing more might provoke Putin .\nFourth, even after the election, uncertainty about how to measure the effects of the Russian campaign discouraged President Obama from issuing a harsher punishment.\nWhat percentage of American political polarization during the 2016 election stemmed from Russian interference, as opposed to domestic forces? Did those efforts change enough votes to swing,\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nor even to affect, the 2016 election? President Obama feared that by drawing too much attention to the interference campaign he would appear partisan, legitimizing some of the narratives propagated by the Russians and further undermining confidence .\nOverall, in reacting to the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, US officials had to worry about far more than who was behind the campaign. To craft an effective deterrence strategy, they needed to determine the nature, purpose, and goals of the Russian threat. However, several features unique to the digital medium complicated that process.\nThe persistence, ambiguity, and breadth of the Russian interference campaign eluded analysis from one intelligence agency. The dual-use character of offensive cyber operations inured U.S. officials to a particular type of attack, while the secrecy inherent to cyber weapons may have made them overly concerned about another. And even after the election took place, the White House feared that any response might feed the perception that the campaign had inflicted more damage than it really had.\nThe Obama Administration finally woke up to the Russian threat in early August 2016, when information alleged to originate from a human intelligence asset in the Kremlin reached the White House . While little information is known about the asset or the intelligence he or she provided, the source and nature of the intelligence is telling.\nReporting from a high-placed source within the Russian government must have done more than confirm who was behind the ongoing interference efforts. In tying campaign back to the highest political authorities in Russia, the intelligence necessarily conveyed information about the nature, coordination, and scale of Russia's intentions. That was something the Obama Administration could not distil from who-based attribution alone.\n# WannaCry and NotPetya\nThe WannaCry and NotPetya cyberattacks present ideal test cases for the viability of deterrence in cyberspace. Both cyberattacks caused significant damage, crippling foreign computer systems, some in critical infrastructure sectors. In both cases, there was never much doubt about who the 'ultimately responsible party' was. Even though the U.S. government did not release official statements for several months after each attack, private security researchers identified the likely perpetrators within days. And unlike the Russian interference campaign, both left a quantifiable trail of damage. Shouldn't it be easy for states to punish the perpetrators behind a NotPetya or a WannaCry?\nClose review of the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks suggests two domain-specific factors that complicate a punishment strategy for cyberattacks. While the paper does not speculate whether these considerations shaped historical policy decisions surrounding these incidents, it argues that both render a punishment strategy less desirable than it otherwise might be.\nFirst, the unpredictability of cyberattacks makes it difficult to adjudicate how much damage the attackers bear responsibility for. This analytic hurdle is particularly challenging with cyberattacks that employ self-propagating mechanisms, such as WannaCry and NotPetya.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nBoth WannaCry and NotPetya yielded significant damage in a matter of hours. WannaCry infected 300,000 computers in 150 countries . The worm’s victims included major multinationals, such as FedEx and Telefonica, French automaker Renault, ministries in the Russian government, and Deutsche Bahn, a major German railway service. The worm also wrought havoc in the physical world. In the six days after WannaCry broke loose, the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) cancelled 19,000 appointments . Altogether, WannaCry incurred approximately $4 billion in damages .\nNotPetya also spread widely, although the payload was first distributed through a software supply chain in wide use in Ukraine. As a result, it inflicted more localized damage. Within 24 hours, NotPetya hit four hospitals in Kiev, six power companies, two airports, and much of the federal government. According to one security firm, it wiped 10 percent of all computers in the country .\nOutside Ukraine, NotPetya infected computers in 60 countries and caused significant financial losses for a slew of multinational corporations . Maersk, the shipping conglomerate, suffered $275 million in damages; Merck, a pharmaceutical giant, totalled its losses at $870 million; TNT Expresses lost $400 million; Reckitt Benckiser, a British manufacturer, experienced $129 million in damages; and Mondelez, a food producer, took a $188 million hit . According to estimates from the White House, NotPetya tallied $10 billion in total damages (White House 2018).\nOne may conclude that the attacks yielded sufficient damage to warrant a reciprocal punishment. But what should policymakers and analysts make of the damage that each attack could have caused but did not, or caused because of the panicked overreaction of network defenders? In the case of NotPetya and WannaCry, factors outside the attackers' control affected how much damage the attacks generated.\nFor example, hours after the WannaCry attack began to spread, an independent computer security researcher named Marcus Hutchins accidentally activated a kill-switch on the worm. Hutchins had been studying the WannaCry malware when he noticed the code called back to a curious-looking web domain. On a whim, Hutchins purchased it for $10. As it turns out, his handiwork stopped WannaCry from propagating hours or even days before it might have.\nNotPetya had no such universal kill-switch. Just the same, the actions of network defenders shaped how much damage it inflicted. For example, Merck’s IT administrators managed to shut down the company’s entire corporate network in roughly 90 seconds, sparing the company more extensive damage . By contrast, the Ukrainian post office did not react quite as nimbly as Merck. It lost more than 70 percent of its computers to NotPetya .\nChance factors also guided NotPetya in unpredictable directions. For example, during the attack, Maersk lost every one of its 150 domain controllers save one. The lone surviving domain controller, which allowed Maersk to restore its entire corporate network, was spared by dumb luck: it been knocked offline due to a local power outage .\nOn the other hand, NotPetya may have come close to causing significant physical damage. It infected computers at the clean-up site of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor. Although the computers\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\ndealing with critical functions at the Chernobyl site were air-gapped from the Internet, the site's IT director had to disconnect thousands of Windows machines at the plant .\nIf the unpredictability of cyberattacks raises questions about how to adjudicate the culpability of attackers, code and network forensics present a second, potentially more reliable tool of analysis as compared with impact assessment. However, technical analysis is not foolproof and doing it effectively takes time.\nFor example, WannaCry appeared to represent a form of ransomware: it promised to unlock infected systems so long as victims transmitted cryptocurrency to an attacker-controlled virtual wallet. However, WannaCry reined in a fraction of the money that it could have due to a coding error (Ivanov, Sinitsyn &amp; Mamedov 2017; Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology 2017; Johnson 2018). Was the error genuine? Or were the North Koreans trying to mask geopolitical motives behind financial ones?\nIn general, security researchers agree that the quality of WannaCry's code was \"very low\". For example, private security researchers discovered that WannaCry's encryption mechanism left many deleted files recoverable . In addition, the worm bore the shockingly simple kill-switch. Had the North Koreans designed it as a safety mechanism in case the malware spread out of control? Or was it an oversight?\nInterestingly, the White House's prepared statement on WannaCry avoided any definitive statement on whether North Korea's intentions were financial or geopolitical. During the question-and-answer section of the press conference, Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert indicated he \"thinks\" that the true purpose of the attack was to \"cause havoc and destruction\" (U.S. White House 2017). Bossert's answer suggests that the U.S. government could not confidently ascertain the true purposes of WannaCry, even with the benefits of six-months hindsight.\nIn like fashion, analysis of the NotPetya payload raises suggestive questions about the culpability of the attackers. While NotPetya used the same exploit as WannaCry to spread autonomously, the hackers behind NotPetya first distributed the payload through the update server of M.E.Doc, a Ukrainian accounting firm whose software was used by many companies in Ukraine.\nThe use of a software supply-chain with wide use within one country points to the geopolitical motivations of the NotPetya cyberattack. Indeed, in its statement on the NotPetya incident, the White House concluded that NotPetya was part of Russia's \"ongoing efforts to destabilize Ukraine\" (U.S. White House 2018). But the White House did not elaborate further, raising questions about what exactly that meant.\nForensic analysis performed by private security researchers found that close to  $10\\%$  of the computers infected by NotPetya were spared due to a file installed by the attackers . The presence of the file suggests that the Russians anticipated how far the worm might spread. So, were all the companies hit outside Ukraine just collateral damage? As one security researcher has speculated, what if the Russian were trying to \"punish anyone who would dare even to maintain an office inside\" Ukraine ?\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nQuestions about the subtleties of cyberattacks like WannaCry and NotPetya rarely make it on the front pages of newspaper in the aftermath of major incidents. But it is clear they factor into a government's decisions about how to respond to a cyberattack—or at least that they should.\nConsider: if you knew with certainty that the North Koreans had not intended WannaCry to spread as widely as it did, would you consider the attack less blameworthy? What if you knew the attack would have caused much more damage if the research community had failed to identify the kill-switch? Conversely, if you knew with certainty that the Russians intended for NotPetya to spread beyond Ukraine, would you consider the attack more blameworthy? And how would you mete out punishment to the 'ultimately responsible party' of a cyberattack if you determined that the performance of network defenders exacerbated the downstream impact of an attack?\nUltimately, WannaCry and NotPetya illustrate that attribution analysis is about far more than Who did it? or Who to Blame?. Because the impact of cyberattacks is shaped by factors outside the attacker's control, victims must peel beneath the visible effects of an attack to determine an attacker's culpability. Much as jurists adjudicate crime by navigating the ambiguous terrain of human intentions, so states must scrutinize an attack to determine the culpability of the perpetrator.\nMalware and forensic analysis offer one source of analytic clarity for victims. However, technical analysis requires a degree of rigor which may stress the timeframe demanded by policymakers. Even then, analysis cannot eliminate the epistemological ambiguity inherent to cyberattacks. Incidents involving malicious software that 'spun out of control' have sparked bitter debate when litigated in domestic courts (United States v. Morris 1991). If they do not already, similar questions about culpability should cloud the minds of analysts and policymakers keen on responding to state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n# Conclusion\nCurrent scholarship offers a compelling explanation as to why the limits of attribution analysis undermine cyber deterrence. However, it misses one key part of the puzzle. When it comes to cyberattacks, the challenge for states does not just consist in determining who is responsible for an incident, but what the adversary intended to do and how he or she expected to do it. This challenge does not alter the fundamental characteristics of the attribution problem. It exacerbates them.\nThe epistemological requirements of attribution analysis undermine punishment strategies for the deterrence of cyberattacks in two ways. First, they extend the requirements of post-attack analysis. Attribution is not just painstaking and imprecise. It is more painstaking and more imprecise than current scholarship acknowledges. As a result, decision makers may not be able to attain clarity about attacks within the timeframe demanded by deterrence strategies.\nSecond, the ambiguity and indirectness of cyberattacks introduce complicated political and ethical questions into the attribution-deterrence analytic. Yet, punishment strategies rely on the implementation of swift, clear, and proportionate responses. The gap between the possibilities of analysis and the demands of strategy theoretically lessens the appeal of overt punishment strategies for the deterrence of cyberattacks. Nonetheless, further social science research is needed to confirm the empirical basis of this relationship.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nExtending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\nThis research holds two further implications for international politics and intelligence practice. Regarding the former, the epistemological ambiguity inherent to cyberattacks may encourage states to adopt riskier behaviour in cyberspace.

    "# Extending the ‘Attribution Problem’: Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\n\nJN Sakellariadis\n\n2021-2022 Fulbright U.S. Student Research Grantee\n\nAthens, Greece\n\nE-mail: jns2164@columbia.edu\n\nAbstract: Current scholarship explains the shortcomings of cyber deterrence through the difficulty involved in proving who launched an attack—what scholars refer to as the ‘attribution problem’. This paper identifies an additional intelligence-centric impediment to cyber deterrence. Cyberattacks yield effects in a manner that is indirect, while offensive cyber operations are multi-stage and multipurpose. These characteristics complicate analytic judgments about the culpability of the attacker, whereas deterrence requires that states retaliate with measures which are timely, clear, and proportionate. The paper uses three cases studies—the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, WannaCry, and NotPetya—to illustrate how the indirectness and ambiguity of cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations obscure the motivations, goals, and culpability of the attacker. It concludes that these characteristics discourage states from adopting punishment-based deterrence strategies because they lengthen the temporal and epistemological requirements of attribution analysis.\n\nKeywords: Attribution, Deterrence, Cyberattack, Offensive Cyber Operations\n\n# Introduction\n\nOver the last decade, many scholars have argued that Cold War deterrence models are inapplicable to conflict dynamics in cyberspace (Libicki 2009; Gartzke &amp; Lindsay 2015; Nye 2017; Chesney et al. 2020). One prominent branch of that literature revolves around the ‘attribution problem’ (Libicki 2009; Boebert 2011; Healey 2012; Rid &amp; Buchanan 2015; Lin 2016). The attribution problem posits that the anonymity of cyberspace and the deniability of cyberattacks undermine deterrence by preventing victims from imposing reciprocal costs on the actor that launched the attack—a particular form of deterrence that political scientists refer to as deterrence by punishment.\n\nThis paper seeks to build on that branch of cyber deterrence research. Through a review of the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, WannaCry, and NotPetya, it suggests an additional intelligence-centric obstacle to deterrence in cyberspace. Due to the indirectness of cyberattacks and the multipurpose and multi-stage nature of offensive cyber operations, the motivations and goals of the perpetrator do not flow readily from the visible effects of an attack. This epistemological ambiguity complicates analytic judgements about the culpability of the attacker, whereas punishment strategies are predicated on responding to a wrong with a swift, clear, and proportionate punishment (Schelling 1968).\n\nJournal of Information Warfare (2022) 21.2: 64-76\n\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online",
    "This ambiguity stems from two characteristics inherent to cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations. On one hand, the tactical and operational similarities between cyberattack and cyber-exploitation create a ‘ambiguity dilemma' for network defenders (Buchanan 2017). Therefore, in the event a culprit is identified before delivery of a final payload, defenders cannot be sure how serious a threat they posed.\n\nEven after payload delivery, cyberattacks operate indirectly, creating or manipulating a risk of harm as opposed to causing that harm directly (U.S. NRC 2009). As a result, the effects of a cyberattack hinge on factors outside the attacker's control, such as the competence of network defenders and the quicksilver interconnections of the devices, systems, and networks through which they travel (US NRC 2009; Farrell & Glaser 2017).\n\nThese aspects of cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations reduce the viability of punishment-based deterrence strategies in two ways. First, by extending the analytic requirements of post-attack analysis, they reinforce the predictive logic of the attribution problem. Deterrence requires speed and clarity, while attribution is painstaking and imprecise. It is just more painstaking and more imprecise than most realize.\n\nOn the other hand, they also complicate judgements about an attacker's culpability. How should states punish perpetrators for damage incurred but not intended or intended but not incurred? A deterrence strategy predicated on overt and proportionate punishments demands unambiguous evidence of an attacker's responsibility. Yet, the characteristics of cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations make these judgments harder to reach, and they render associated punishments harder to justify.\n\nThis paper develops this argument in two parts. First, it reviews existing literature on the attribution problem. Overwhelmingly, this scholarship has focused on questions of authorship, such as Who did it? or Who is to blame? These questions assume that a victim can devise an appropriate response to a cyberattack, if only it can identify the aggressor.\n\nNext, the paper examines the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, WannaCry, and NotPetya. It uses the cases to demonstrate how the ambiguity and unpredictability inherent to cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations render who-based attribution insufficient to deterrence by punishment. The paper concludes that these characteristics discourage states from adopting punishment-based deterrence strategies because they exacerbate the temporal and epistemological requirements of post-attack attribution analysis.\n\n## Literature Background\n\nAttribution refers to the process by which state and non-state actors identify the perpetrators of cyberattacks. In practice, however, the concept is somewhat fluid. Attribution can be applied to individual pieces of malware or an entire cyber operation. It ranges in specificity from operators at a keyboard, to a sub-state entity, to a state. Attribution can also be confidential or public. In each of these cases, attribution entails different evidentiary standards (Grindal, Kuerbis & Mueller 2019).\n\nThis paper focuses on the public attribution of cyberattacks or offensive cyber operations. Research into this variant of the attribution problem has been ongoing for years, yet it has evolved in response to advances in forensic technology and changing perceptions of cyberspace as a strategic",
    "Extending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\n\ndomain. Prior to 2013, many believed that the architecture of the Internet protected the anonymity of attackers (Boebert 2011). Unable to determine Who did it? experts proposed two solutions to the cyber deterrence problem (Lynn 2010). One group called for redesigning the Internet to make network attacks easier to trace (Landau &amp; Clarke 2011). A second advocated that network defenders instead focus on defence, or deterrence by denial (Libicki 2009).\n\nNew scholarship began to emerge after 2013, when a private-sector threat intelligence firm published a report attributing a vast swathe of intrusions to China's People's Liberation Army (FireEye 2013). The report illustrated that it was possible to use forensic tools available to the private sector to prove who was behind a digital intrusion.\n\nNonetheless, the use of proxy cyber forces in many of the most prominent state-sponsored cyberattacks up to that point raised questions about the value of attribution (Healey 2012). To identify the \"ultimately responsible party\" of an attack, scholars suggested, governments required alternative sources of intelligence (Rid &amp; Buchanan 2015). Understanding of the attribution problem thus evolved from a purely a technical issue to a politico-technical one: not Who did it? but Who to blame? (Lin 2016)\n\nThis most recent branch of scholarship accepts that some form of attribution is now within reach. However, it argues that deterrence by punishment remains elusive due to two factors. First, attribution is estimative, not probative. Though it is possible to trace an attack back to an originating network, or even a set of hackers, one is rarely able to prove that a state was involved in the operation, or how ((Healey 2012; Lin 2016). Second, attribution is \"painstaking\" (Rid &amp; Buchanan 2015). It demands expertise across a range of analytic and technical functions. Synthesizing those work-streams takes time. By contrast, deterrence demands speed and clarity. Through time, space, and deed, deterrers must communicate to perpetrators the link between offence and punishment.\n\nCurrent scholarship assumes that the only obstacle to deterrence lies in establishing the perpetrator's identity. However, the analytic process is also essential to interpreting the nature and gravity of a cyberattack. Because of their indirectness, cyberattacks can produce effects that exceed or underperform an attacker's intentions. Because of the multi-stage and multi-purpose nature of offensive cyber operations, an attacker's motives, methods, and intentions do not flow readily from the visible effects of an incident. Together, these factors complicate judgments about the responsibility of the perpetrator for the effects of an attack. In turn, they should discourage states from adopting punishment strategies, which are predicated on speed, clarity, and proportionality.\n\n## Case Selection\n\nExamining these cases in tandem may raise many a methodological eyebrow. The attacks involved different victims and different perpetrators. NotPetya and WannaCry entailed the compromise of data availability on IT systems. By contrast, the 2016 Russian election interference campaign involved information warfare through the subversion of data confidentiality. Arguably, it does not even represent a cyberattack.\n\nThe cases nonetheless provide firm methodological footing for exploring how the unpredictability and ambiguity of cyberattacks or offensive cyber operations affects deterrence in cyberspace. First, the attacks covered here received extensive coverage in a domain characterized by extreme secrecy. That coverage does not just provide a rare window into how these attacks unfolded. It\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",
    "also manifests characteristics essential to deterrence yet often absent from state-sponsored cyber conflict (Chesney et al. 2020): the attacks compromised operational secrecy to produce an effect. In turn, that effect produced pressure for retaliation.\n\nSecond, the international community managed to identify the ‘ultimately responsible party' in each incident. The cases therefore control for successful attribution under the traditional definition of the term. As the victims of each case suffered few repercussions, they offer tentative support for the notion that who-based attribution is insufficient to deterrence by punishment.\n\nFinally, policymakers and analysts do not have the luxury of disregarding incidents that elude neat academic categories. To the extent the public treats an event as a ‘cyberattack', the weight of that perception will shape how policymakers interpret an event, formulate a response, and communicate it to the public. The cases are worth considering together because the public considered them together.\n\n## Russian Election Interference Campaign\n\nThe 2016 Russian election interference campaign offers strong, albeit anecdotal, evidence that who-based attribution is necessary but not sufficient to deterring state-authored cyberattacks. In fact, members of the United States intelligence and law enforcement communities began to attribute election-adjacent hacking and information operations to Russian affiliates as early as 2015. However, the administration failed to recognize any serious threat to the election until the last weeks of July 2016 (Sanger 2018). It took longer to devise a deterrent response.\n\nFour domain-specific characteristics of the campaign complicated analysis and deterrence of the Russian threat.\n\nFirst, the campaign cut across a vast swathe of digital and informational terrain subject to competing legal authorities for the U.S. intelligence community. Moreover, the persistent nature of its constituent operations presented something of a moving target: As the U.S. intelligence community concluded in a post-election assessment, Russia's goals evolved over time as it became more apparent that Donald Trump had better electoral chances than many realized (U.S. ODNI 2017).\n\nThe Russian interference comprised three parallel cyber or cyber-enabled operations. The first entailed misinformation and disinformation propagated by troll farms, like the Internet Research Agency, as well as official Russian media outlets and spokespeople. Second was the hack-and-leak operation targeting Clinton campaign staffers and later the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). The third and final campaign comprised the reconnaissance and targeting of U.S. election, or election-adjacent, infrastructure.\n\nNo single US intelligence entity had the legal authorities, let alone the capability, to investigate all the campaign's components at once. Yet, identifying Russia's role in individual operations would prove insufficient to grasping the overall threat.\n\nIn September of 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) determined that Russian state-sponsored hackers had breached the DNC. However, the FBI did not consider the threat to be serious and failed to communicate it to the White House. Policymakers in the Obama Administration claimed they first learned about the breach of the DNC in mid-June of 2016, following a revelation",
    "Extending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\n\nfrom the *Washington Post* (US SSCI 2018). Likewise, throughout the year, officials across the US government must have noted Russia’s overt information campaigns, which began between June and December of 2015 (Maremont &amp; Barry 2017). Despite traditional attribution on these fronts, none of this information triggered the U.S. intelligence community to the severity of the threat.\n\nSecond, conditioned by past foreign espionage efforts, US intelligence officials failed to appreciate the dual threat posed by theft of sensitive information from US political actors and entities.\n\nMany Obama Administration officials later admitted that they were not overly alarmed when they first learned of the DNC hack because they regarded it as “traditional espionage” (US SSCI 2018, p. 5). According to the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s report on the 2016 Russian interference campaign, their familiarity with previous cyber-espionage campaigns inured them to the significance of the DNC breach:\n\n&gt; Witnesses interviewed by the Committee consistently said that Russian cyberactivity was a well-known issue within the administration, however hardly any administration officials had considered the threat of information collected through cyber espionage being weaponized when assessing the consequences of the Russian cyber intrusions into the Clinton campaign, the DNC, and the DCCC. (US SSCI 2018, p. 9).\n\nHence, as intelligence officials struggled to connect the dots on the Russian interference effort, they overlooked the dots that stood in plain sight.\n\nWhen it finally recognized the Russian threat to the election, the Obama Administration hesitated to craft a response. At that point, a third domain-specific intelligence challenge plagued officials: cyber-weapons must be kept secret to be effective, and the Obama Administration did not know whether the Russians had developed a capability to compromise vote tallies on election day. Ironically, while U.S. officials at first underestimated the Russian interference threat, they may have overestimated it by the end of the summer.\n\nBetween June and September of 2016, Russian hackers targeted U.S. election-related infrastructure in at least 21 states (US SSCI 2018, p. 5-12). According to subsequent reporting, however, the activity amounted mainly to “scanning and probing”—actions that did not necessarily reflect a willingness, let alone confer a capability, to swing the result on election day (US DHS 2016). Nonetheless, President Obama ordered a National Intelligence Estimate to ascertain how vulnerable the country’s election infrastructure was to compromise (Sanger 2018).\n\nCompleted later that summer, the National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the country’s election infrastructure was secure (Sanger 2018). Nonetheless, Obama Administration officials remained wary, reportedly “assum[ing] the worst-case scenario” with regards to Russia’s ability to manipulate vote tallies or voter registration data (US SSCI 2018, p. 20). As a result, the administration declined to impose high costs on the Russians before election day. President Obama feared that doing more might provoke Putin (US SSCI 2018).\n\nFourth, even after the election, uncertainty about how to measure the effects of the Russian campaign discouraged President Obama from issuing a harsher punishment.\n\nWhat percentage of American political polarization during the 2016 election stemmed from Russian interference, as opposed to domestic forces? Did those efforts change enough votes to swing,\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",
    "Extending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\n\nor even to affect, the 2016 election? President Obama feared that by drawing too much attention to the interference campaign he would appear partisan, legitimizing some of the narratives propagated by the Russians and further undermining confidence (US SSCI 2018).\n\nOverall, in reacting to the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, US officials had to worry about far more than who was behind the campaign. To craft an effective deterrence strategy, they needed to determine the nature, purpose, and goals of the Russian threat. However, several features unique to the digital medium complicated that process.\n\nThe persistence, ambiguity, and breadth of the Russian interference campaign eluded analysis from one intelligence agency. The dual-use character of offensive cyber operations inured U.S. officials to a particular type of attack, while the secrecy inherent to cyber weapons may have made them overly concerned about another. And even after the election took place, the White House feared that any response might feed the perception that the campaign had inflicted more damage than it really had.\n\nThe Obama Administration finally woke up to the Russian threat in early August 2016, when information alleged to originate from a human intelligence asset in the Kremlin reached the White House (Brennan 2021). While little information is known about the asset or the intelligence he or she provided, the source and nature of the intelligence is telling.\n\nReporting from a high-placed source within the Russian government must have done more than confirm who was behind the ongoing interference efforts. In tying campaign back to the highest political authorities in Russia, the intelligence necessarily conveyed information about the nature, coordination, and scale of Russia's intentions. That was something the Obama Administration could not distil from who-based attribution alone.\n\n# WannaCry and NotPetya\n\nThe WannaCry and NotPetya cyberattacks present ideal test cases for the viability of deterrence in cyberspace. Both cyberattacks caused significant damage, crippling foreign computer systems, some in critical infrastructure sectors. In both cases, there was never much doubt about who the 'ultimately responsible party' was. Even though the U.S. government did not release official statements for several months after each attack, private security researchers identified the likely perpetrators within days. And unlike the Russian interference campaign, both left a quantifiable trail of damage. Shouldn't it be easy for states to punish the perpetrators behind a NotPetya or a WannaCry?\n\nClose review of the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks suggests two domain-specific factors that complicate a punishment strategy for cyberattacks. While the paper does not speculate whether these considerations shaped historical policy decisions surrounding these incidents, it argues that both render a punishment strategy less desirable than it otherwise might be.\n\nFirst, the unpredictability of cyberattacks makes it difficult to adjudicate how much damage the attackers bear responsibility for. This analytic hurdle is particularly challenging with cyberattacks that employ self-propagating mechanisms, such as WannaCry and NotPetya.\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",
    "Extending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\n\nBoth WannaCry and NotPetya yielded significant damage in a matter of hours. WannaCry infected 300,000 computers in 150 countries (Johnson 2018). The worm’s victims included major multinationals, such as FedEx and Telefonica, French automaker Renault, ministries in the Russian government, and Deutsche Bahn, a major German railway service. The worm also wrought havoc in the physical world. In the six days after WannaCry broke loose, the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) cancelled 19,000 appointments (Johnson 2018). Altogether, WannaCry incurred approximately $4 billion in damages (Berr 2017).\n\nNotPetya also spread widely, although the payload was first distributed through a software supply chain in wide use in Ukraine. As a result, it inflicted more localized damage. Within 24 hours, NotPetya hit four hospitals in Kiev, six power companies, two airports, and much of the federal government. According to one security firm, it wiped 10 percent of all computers in the country (Greenberg 2019).\n\nOutside Ukraine, NotPetya infected computers in 60 countries and caused significant financial losses for a slew of multinational corporations (Frenkel 2017). Maersk, the shipping conglomerate, suffered $275 million in damages; Merck, a pharmaceutical giant, totalled its losses at $870 million; TNT Expresses lost $400 million; Reckitt Benckiser, a British manufacturer, experienced $129 million in damages; and Mondelez, a food producer, took a $188 million hit (Greenberg 2019). According to estimates from the White House, NotPetya tallied $10 billion in total damages (White House 2018).\n\nOne may conclude that the attacks yielded sufficient damage to warrant a reciprocal punishment. But what should policymakers and analysts make of the damage that each attack could have caused but did not, or caused because of the panicked overreaction of network defenders? In the case of NotPetya and WannaCry, factors outside the attackers' control affected how much damage the attacks generated.\n\nFor example, hours after the WannaCry attack began to spread, an independent computer security researcher named Marcus Hutchins accidentally activated a kill-switch on the worm. Hutchins had been studying the WannaCry malware when he noticed the code called back to a curious-looking web domain. On a whim, Hutchins purchased it for $10. As it turns out, his handiwork stopped WannaCry from propagating hours or even days before it might have.\n\nNotPetya had no such universal kill-switch. Just the same, the actions of network defenders shaped how much damage it inflicted. For example, Merck’s IT administrators managed to shut down the company’s entire corporate network in roughly 90 seconds, sparing the company more extensive damage (Greenberg 2019). By contrast, the Ukrainian post office did not react quite as nimbly as Merck. It lost more than 70 percent of its computers to NotPetya (Greenberg 2019).\n\nChance factors also guided NotPetya in unpredictable directions. For example, during the attack, Maersk lost every one of its 150 domain controllers save one. The lone surviving domain controller, which allowed Maersk to restore its entire corporate network, was spared by dumb luck: it been knocked offline due to a local power outage (Greenberg 2019).\n\nOn the other hand, NotPetya may have come close to causing significant physical damage. It infected computers at the clean-up site of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor. Although the computers\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",
    "Extending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\n\ndealing with critical functions at the Chernobyl site were air-gapped from the Internet, the site's IT director had to disconnect thousands of Windows machines at the plant (Greenberg 2019).\n\nIf the unpredictability of cyberattacks raises questions about how to adjudicate the culpability of attackers, code and network forensics present a second, potentially more reliable tool of analysis as compared with impact assessment. However, technical analysis is not foolproof and doing it effectively takes time.\n\nFor example, WannaCry appeared to represent a form of ransomware: it promised to unlock infected systems so long as victims transmitted cryptocurrency to an attacker-controlled virtual wallet. However, WannaCry reined in a fraction of the money that it could have due to a coding error (Ivanov, Sinitsyn &amp; Mamedov 2017; Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology 2017; Johnson 2018). Was the error genuine? Or were the North Koreans trying to mask geopolitical motives behind financial ones?\n\nIn general, security researchers agree that the quality of WannaCry's code was \"very low\". For example, private security researchers discovered that WannaCry's encryption mechanism left many deleted files recoverable (Kaspersky 2017). In addition, the worm bore the shockingly simple kill-switch. Had the North Koreans designed it as a safety mechanism in case the malware spread out of control? Or was it an oversight?\n\nInterestingly, the White House's prepared statement on WannaCry avoided any definitive statement on whether North Korea's intentions were financial or geopolitical. During the question-and-answer section of the press conference, Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert indicated he \"thinks\" that the true purpose of the attack was to \"cause havoc and destruction\" (U.S. White House 2017). Bossert's answer suggests that the U.S. government could not confidently ascertain the true purposes of WannaCry, even with the benefits of six-months hindsight.\n\nIn like fashion, analysis of the NotPetya payload raises suggestive questions about the culpability of the attackers. While NotPetya used the same exploit as WannaCry to spread autonomously, the hackers behind NotPetya first distributed the payload through the update server of M.E.Doc, a Ukrainian accounting firm whose software was used by many companies in Ukraine.\n\nThe use of a software supply-chain with wide use within one country points to the geopolitical motivations of the NotPetya cyberattack. Indeed, in its statement on the NotPetya incident, the White House concluded that NotPetya was part of Russia's \"ongoing efforts to destabilize Ukraine\" (U.S. White House 2018). But the White House did not elaborate further, raising questions about what exactly that meant.\n\nForensic analysis performed by private security researchers found that close to  $10\\%$  of the computers infected by NotPetya were spared due to a file installed by the attackers (Greenberg 2018). The presence of the file suggests that the Russians anticipated how far the worm might spread. So, were all the companies hit outside Ukraine just collateral damage? As one security researcher has speculated, what if the Russian were trying to \"punish anyone who would dare even to maintain an office inside\" Ukraine (Greenberg 2018)?\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",
    "Extending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\n\nQuestions about the subtleties of cyberattacks like WannaCry and NotPetya rarely make it on the front pages of newspaper in the aftermath of major incidents. But it is clear they factor into a government's decisions about how to respond to a cyberattack—or at least that they should.\n\nConsider: if you knew with certainty that the North Koreans had not intended WannaCry to spread as widely as it did, would you consider the attack less blameworthy? What if you knew the attack would have caused much more damage if the research community had failed to identify the kill-switch? Conversely, if you knew with certainty that the Russians intended for NotPetya to spread beyond Ukraine, would you consider the attack more blameworthy? And how would you mete out punishment to the 'ultimately responsible party' of a cyberattack if you determined that the performance of network defenders exacerbated the downstream impact of an attack?\n\nUltimately, WannaCry and NotPetya illustrate that attribution analysis is about far more than Who did it? or Who to Blame?. Because the impact of cyberattacks is shaped by factors outside the attacker's control, victims must peel beneath the visible effects of an attack to determine an attacker's culpability. Much as jurists adjudicate crime by navigating the ambiguous terrain of human intentions, so states must scrutinize an attack to determine the culpability of the perpetrator.\n\nMalware and forensic analysis offer one source of analytic clarity for victims. However, technical analysis requires a degree of rigor which may stress the timeframe demanded by policymakers. Even then, analysis cannot eliminate the epistemological ambiguity inherent to cyberattacks. Incidents involving malicious software that 'spun out of control' have sparked bitter debate when litigated in domestic courts (United States v. Morris 1991). If they do not already, similar questions about culpability should cloud the minds of analysts and policymakers keen on responding to state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nCurrent scholarship offers a compelling explanation as to why the limits of attribution analysis undermine cyber deterrence. However, it misses one key part of the puzzle. When it comes to cyberattacks, the challenge for states does not just consist in determining who is responsible for an incident, but what the adversary intended to do and how he or she expected to do it. This challenge does not alter the fundamental characteristics of the attribution problem. It exacerbates them.\n\nThe epistemological requirements of attribution analysis undermine punishment strategies for the deterrence of cyberattacks in two ways. First, they extend the requirements of post-attack analysis. Attribution is not just painstaking and imprecise. It is more painstaking and more imprecise than current scholarship acknowledges. As a result, decision makers may not be able to attain clarity about attacks within the timeframe demanded by deterrence strategies.\n\nSecond, the ambiguity and indirectness of cyberattacks introduce complicated political and ethical questions into the attribution-deterrence analytic. Yet, punishment strategies rely on the implementation of swift, clear, and proportionate responses. The gap between the possibilities of analysis and the demands of strategy theoretically lessens the appeal of overt punishment strategies for the deterrence of cyberattacks. Nonetheless, further social science research is needed to confirm the empirical basis of this relationship.\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",
    "Extending the 'Attribution Problem': Why Who-Based Attribution Is Insufficient to Deterring Cyberattacks\n\nThis research holds two further implications for international politics and intelligence practice. Regarding the former, the epistemological ambiguity inherent to cyberattacks may encourage states to adopt riskier behaviour in cyberspace. So long as states can plausibly deny their responsibility for the damage incurred by cyberattacks—and even those for which they are known to be responsible—they may feel emboldened to risk attacks ‘that leave something to chance’ (Schelling 1968; Farrell &amp; Glaser 2017).\n\nLikewise, disagreements about the relative wrongfulness of given incidents may themselves generate friction within the international community. The adjudication of cybersecurity incidents that ‘spun out of control’ have generated bitter disagreement in domestic contexts. Similar dynamics appear destined to repeat themselves in international fora, where stakeholders have less incentive to cooperate.\n\nWhen it comes to intelligence practice, this research suggests that analysts performing attribution analysis must go the extra mile to resist hindsight bias. Due to the unpredictability and ambiguity of cyberattacks, the impact of an attack may exceed or underperform an adversary’s expectations. Intelligence analysts must therefore assess what the adversary tried to make happen and how carefully or recklessly he or she pursued their objectives.

    "abstract": "Current scholarship explains the shortcomings of cyber deterrence through the difficulty involved in proving who launched an attack—what scholars refer to as the ‘attribution problem’. This paper identifies an additional intelligence-centric impediment to cyber deterrence. Cyberattacks yield effects in a manner that is indirect, while offensive cyber operations are multi-stage and multipurpose. These characteristics complicate analytic judgments about the culpability of the attacker, whereas deterrence requires that states retaliate with measures which are timely, clear, and proportionate. The paper uses three cases studies—the 2016 Russian election interference campaign, WannaCry, and NotPetya—to illustrate how the indirectness and ambiguity of cyberattacks and offensive cyber operations obscure the motivations, goals, and culpability of the attacker. It concludes that these characteristics discourage states from adopting punishment-based deterrence strategies because they lengthen the temporal and epistemological requirements of attribution analysis.",
