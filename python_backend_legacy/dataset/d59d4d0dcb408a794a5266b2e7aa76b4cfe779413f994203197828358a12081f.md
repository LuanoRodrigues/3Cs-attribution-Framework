Delegating these actions to proxies is one strategy states use to retain plausible deniability and limit escalation risks. Yet, proxies often have strong ties to sponsoring states, raising questions about their ability to influence blame and demands for retaliation. This paper tests these effects by analyzing American responses to hypothetical attacks by Chinese, Russian, and Iranian actors through experiments administered on three surveys. The results show that using proxies for these attacks modestly reduced how much Americans blamed the respective foreign governments, while also limiting demands that their senior leadership be sanctioned. However, the use of proxies did not affect Americans' attitudes toward more forceful responses by the US government. These findings contribute to understanding of how proxies shape plausible deniability and escalation risks in international conflicts.\n# Keywords\nconflict management, domestic politics, foreign policy, interstate conflict\n$^{1}$ Department of Social and Political Sciences, Bocconi University, Milano, Italy\n# Corresponding Author:\nScott Williamson, Department of Social and Political Sciences, Bocconi University, Via Sarfatti, 25, Milano 20136, Italy.\nEmail: scott.williamson@unibocconi.it\nIntroduction\nIn February 2018, Syrian and Russian forces attacked an American outpost in Syria. The assault dragged on for more than four hours, during which hundreds of the attacking soldiers were killed. Despite fears the incident could trigger conflict between Russian and American forces in Syria, escalation did not occur. The Russian government quickly distanced itself from the attack by claiming they had no control over the soldiers, who were not part of the Russian military. Instead, they were employees of a private military company called the Wagner Group (Gibbons-Neff 2018). This company has often served as a Russian proxy in conflicts where the government has not wished to involve itself openly, including in Libya, Ukraine, Venezuela, and Syria (Rabin 2019).\nCovert actions such as these are a common feature of international affairs, with states frequently attempting to disguise aspects of their foreign policies. Scholars have proposed that this emphasis on secrecy can contribute to stability within the international system by reducing the likelihood of conflict escalation (Carnegie and Carson 2018; Carson 2016; Joseph and Poznansky 2018; Yarhi-Milo 2013). This advantage is thought to occur in part because adversaries who engage each other secretly should be less likely to trigger domestic pressures that push them to increase the scope of the conflict (Carson 2016; Fearon 1994; Tomz et al. 2020).\nDelegating to their non-state proxies is one strategy states use when trying to preserve secrecy around their involvement in hostile actions (Groh 2019). In theory, the proxy's ability to claim independence from the chain of command can provide the state with more plausible deniability about their lack of responsibility. If this strategy is effective, it follows that public opinion in a targeted country should respond differently to denials of responsibility for hostile actions carried out by a state's proxies rather than its military or other security institutions. Specifically, this delegation should weaken attributions of blame against the attacking government while limiting demands for retaliation, thus mitigating pressures on the targeted government to respond. However, there are reasons to doubt whether proxies make deniability more plausible, since they frequently demonstrate strong ties to their patrons, which should undermine the credibility of claims that their decision-making is independent. Returning to the Russian Wagner Group, for example, the company's founder has a personal relationship with President Putin, and the company is known to receive funding, training, and equipment from the Russian military and intelligence apparatus (Rabin 2019). This relationship has become even more publicly apparent since the Russian invasion of Ukraine (Kirby 2023).\nTo date, there has been relatively little research on public opinion toward secrecy in international politics (Carnegie 2021; Myrick 2019), including whether and how delegating hostile actions to proxies shapes public opinion. I evaluate whether this delegation can influence attributions of blame and demands for retaliation by implementing seven vignette experiments across three surveys of American adults. The vignettes address hypothetical attacks against US targets by Russian, Chinese, and\nIranian actors, with these countries' governments denying involvement in the attacks. Respondents are randomly assigned to read that the attackers were part of a military unit or proxy group tied to the foreign government, after which they assess responsibility for the incident and evaluate possible US responses. These countries were chosen not only because their governments rely frequently on covert action, but also because their authoritarian political systems and their unpopularity with the American public should create a hard test of the hypothesized relationships.\nThe results show that respondents become less likely to attribute responsibility to the adversarial governments when attacks were carried out by proxies. The effects are small, however, suggesting that the use of proxies with known ties to the sponsor may marginally strengthen a government's plausible deniability of involvement in an attack without substantially altering the extent to which citizens in the targeted state blame that government. The results also provide mixed support for the ability of covert action to mitigate demands for escalation. Respondents in the proxy treatment groups are substantially less likely to support sanctioning the senior leadership of the adversarial governments instead of subordinate individuals involved directly in the attacks, and this effect is partially mediated by the treatment's effects on respondents' attributions of blame. However, respondents are not less likely to support forceful, retaliatory attacks by the US government that would reflect a clear escalation of the conflict. One interpretation of these findings is that delegation to proxies may help reduce escalation risks by increasing the likelihood that the targeted public prefers to retaliate against the proxy itself, but is less likely to influence citizens' views on their government responding to hostilities with coercive and forceful forms of retaliation.\nThese findings contribute to international relations research on secrecy by providing experimental evidence that both reinforces and expands on existing theories about the effects of covert action and plausible deniability on conflict, insofar as they provide some evidence that acting covertly through proxies can reduce a government's exposure to blame and shape how citizens in a targeted country think about the appropriate response (e.g. Carnegie and Carson 2018; Carson 2016; Hedgecock and Sukin 2023; Joseph and Poznansky 2018). They also extend a nascent body of work on public opinion toward the role of non-state proxies in international politics (e.g. Plana 2020). In addition, by showing that authoritarian regimes can reduce their exposure to blame in international conflicts by delegating to non-state proxies, the findings contribute to a large literature on blame avoidance that has to date focused primarily on domestic politics and democratic political systems (Baekkeskov and Rubin 2016).\nThis article proceeds as follows. It first reviews literature on covert action and secrecy in international politics before outlining expectations about the effects of proxies on attributions of responsibility and demands for retaliation. It then discusses the selected cases and research design for the experiments, before presenting the results. The article concludes with a discussion of external validity and implications for international relations research.\n##\nSecrecy, Delegation, and Conflict Escalation\nSecrecy is a common feature of international politics (Carnegie 2021), and a growing literature seeks to explain why states might attempt to conceal outcomes ranging from military alliances to the resolution of international legal disputes or crises (Hafner-Burton and Victor 2016; Kuo 2020; Kurizaki 2007). Covert action reflects one aspect of secrecy in the international system, whereby states attempt to obscure their involvement in hostile activities targeting another state or political entity. Well-known examples include the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba by US-backed Cuban exiles, or participation by Soviet pilots in the Korean War against the United States. As with these examples, covert operations or their outcomes tend to be visible publicly, and the objective is not to keep the acts themselves secret, but rather to conceal or create doubt about who was involved (DeVine 2022).\nThe identity of the responsible actor does not always stay secret to other states, whose governments often have the intelligence capacity to make reasonable determinations about who is behind an attack. Even so, the costs and risks associated with covert operations can prove useful by signaling resolve to the observing states (Carson and Yarhi-Milo 2017). Furthermore, covert action is more likely to succeed at concealing the identity of the responsible actor from the public. As a result, states may rely on it to obscure aspects of their foreign policy that would damage their reputations domestically or abroad (Joseph and Poznansky 2018). For example, democracies may use covert action against other democracies to avoid domestic backlash for violating the expectation that they remain on good terms with democratic governments (Crandall et al. 2018). Relatedly, governments may delegate violence against civilians to non-state actors to obscure their involvement from international audiences who would respond negatively to human rights violations (Carey et al. 2015).\nBy providing plausible deniability that conceals responsibility for hostile activities from the public, covert action has been theorized to help adversarial states reduce the risks of conflict escalation. Research indicates that political and military leaders are susceptible to pressure from public opinion when deciding whether and how to deploy military force (Chu and Recchia 2022; Lin-Greenberg 2021; Tomz et al. 2020). Keeping hostilities on the “backstage” and out of the public eye should help states to avoid pressures from hawkish domestic constituencies who wish to expand the scope of the conflict, while allowing states to signal to each other that they do not want to escalate (Carson 2016, 2018; Joseph and Poznansky 2018). In other words, by obscuring their involvement, states may be able to limit escalation risks in part by decreasing the likelihood that citizens in the targeted country demand a response from their own government that would escalate the conflict. As an example of this mechanism in action, Carson (2018, 21) notes how Nazi Germany monitored foreign reactions to its involvement in the Spanish Civil War and “...carefully calibrated covert German combat participation in light of hawkish domestic sentiment in London and Paris.”\nBecause the point of covert action is to obscure the identity of the responsible actor, states often pursue these operations through their proxies, whether corporations, informal militias, or “volunteer” fighters. Research on blame attributions and accountability implies that this strategy of delegating to proxies should be effective at creating plausible deniability that influences perceptions of responsibility in the targeted state. People are more likely to believe an actor is responsible for an outcome when they have direct control over the decision-making process that produces the outcome (Hood 2011). In cases where delegation occurs and multiple decision-makers are involved, clarity of responsibility is diminished and political actors are more capable of avoiding blame (Martin and Raffler 2021; Powell and Whitten 1993). Experimental research suggests these blame avoidance benefits can occur even when people know the delegator and delegatee share the same interests (Bartling and Fischbacher 2012). In terms of international relations, proxies such as militias or corporations are entities separate from the state apparatus, and, at least in theory, they can make decisions more independently than a military or intelligence unit. This potential independence should make it harder for citizens in the targeted state to determine whether an action occurred because of directives from the sponsor or because of the proxy's own initiative. As a result, delegating to proxies should increase plausible deniability and help the sponsor to limit how much it is held responsible by citizens of the targeted state.\nAs noted in the literature on covert action, governments may benefit from this redirection of perceived responsibility for several reasons, including protecting their political support domestically and their soft power internationally if their involvement in the hostile acts would be viewed negatively (Joseph and Poznansky 2018). Of primary interest to this article is that shifting blame through covert operations may also help governments to reduce the likelihood of citizens in the targeted country demanding retaliation that escalates the conflict (Carson 2018). The blame avoidance literature provides a framework for understanding why delegating to proxies could shape attitudes toward retaliation as well. Because blame helps people to identify who should be held accountable for a problematic outcome, those who limit their exposure to blame should face fewer demands that they be punished (Hood 2014). Thus, if delegating to a proxy can reduce how many people in the targeted country blame the sponsoring state for a hostile action, it follows that these people may also become less likely to want their government to hold that state accountable by retaliating against it. In other words, using proxies to conduct covert actions could weaken domestic pressure on the targeted government to expand the conflict, which would reduce escalation risks by limiting incentives for political and military leaders to respond forcefully (Carson 2016; Tomz et al. 2020).\nFrom this theoretical framework, I expect the following when hostile actions are known to be conducted by a state's proxies rather than its own military forces. First, when a proxy is involved, I expect that respondents will be more likely to believe a foreign government's denials of responsibility -- i.e. they will blame the government less. Second, because respondents attribute less blame to the foreign government, I\nexpect that they will be less likely to support retaliation against that government as well.\nHowever, there are also reasons to expect that delegating to proxies may have little effect on attributions of responsibility or attitudes toward retaliation. First, proxies often lack credible separation from their sponsors. If the proxy is a domestic entity with legal status within the sponsoring country, it may be constrained in its ability to pursue foreign policy objectives that contradict those of the government. This limitation is especially likely to apply in authoritarian regimes, where the government controls most domestic organizations closely to ensure that they do not work against the authorities. Foreign proxies of a government might have more credible claims to independence, since they exist outside that government's legal and coercive apparatus. Nonetheless, in these cases, journalists and foreign governments often go to great lengths to publicize ties between the proxy and its sponsor. If people do not believe that the proxy has genuine independence to operate, they are unlikely to absolve the sponsoring state of blame.\nSecond, if citizens in the targeted state dislike the sponsor government intensely and are primed to distrust it, they may discount claims of separation from the proxy. This reaction may be particularly likely in contexts where two states have a history of poor relations -- i.e. the contexts in which hostile covert actions are most likely to be conducted. Finally, citizens of a targeted state may blame the sponsor of an attacking proxy for failing to control their proxy, even if the sponsors did not intend for the attack to happen.\n## Research Design\nTo test how covert action by proxies influences attributions of blame and demands for retaliation, I implemented seven vignette experiments across three surveys administered online in the United States. Experiments have become increasingly common in the international relations literature, and they are particularly useful for studying IR theories that involve public opinion (Hyde 2015) -- including issues of secrecy and covert action (e.g. Myrick 2019). The following sections provide further details about the design.\n### Samples\nThe first survey was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 1299 American adults recruited by the firm Lucid in April 2019. Each respondent read and answered outcome questions for two vignettes: one involving China, and the other involving Russia. The survey was designed with the expectations about delegation, blame, and escalation in mind but was exploratory and not pre-registered.\nThe second survey was pre-registered. I specified hypotheses and analyses that would indicate replication of findings from the first survey, and I expanded the experiment by adding additional outcome questions in line with the theoretical\nexpectations. This second survey was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 3053 respondents recruited by Lucid in March 2021. Each respondent on the second survey saw the same China and Russia vignettes used on the first survey. In addition, they also read and responded to questions about a vignette involving Iran.\nThe third survey was intended to provide an additional replication check, while also facilitating exploratory analysis of patterns identified in the second survey. It was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 2007 American adults recruited by Lucid in May 2021. This survey used the Russia and Iran vignettes but dropped the China vignette due to time constraints. All three surveys were representative on age, gender, income, ethnicity, and US region. Summary statistics can be found in the SI.\n### Case Selection\nI chose to center my vignettes around hostile actions attributed to Chinese, Russian, and Iranian actors. These three cases are useful for several reasons. The first is that all three countries are relatively unpopular in the United States due to a history of adversarial relations. My survey data highlights these unfavorable perceptions among American adults. In the first survey in 2019, 15% of respondents reported a favorable view of Russia and 16% said the same about China. In the second survey in 2021, only 25% of respondents said they had a favorable view of China, 20% reported a favorable view of Russia, and 11% claimed to have a favorable view of Iran. These negative attitudes should make it less likely that respondents would give these governments the benefit of the doubt when they deny involvement in hostile actions carried out by their proxies. The second reason is that all three countries are governed by authoritarian regimes. China's government operates a massive surveillance state that exercises extensive control over the population. Russia and Iran also control their societies closely. These political systems make it less likely that proxy groups are operating independently of the authorities, which should reduce the credibility of delegation and make it less likely that people believe that the proxy's sponsor was not involved. These first two reasons suggest the countries provide a hard test of the hypothesized effects.\nFinally, the third reason is that all three countries regularly engage in covert action to advance their foreign policy objectives, and they frequently do so by delegating to non-state proxies that are believed to provide a degree of plausible deniability. As such, the survey vignettes should be highly relevant to real-world events. In the following paragraphs, I briefly discuss examples from each case.\nChina: As cyber activities have become increasingly important for global politics, China has invested heavily in its cyber capabilities to gather political and economic intelligence (Beecroft 2021). The Chinese government has used a variety of actors to conduct cyberattacks, including military personnel. In 2020, the US government charged four members of the People's Liberation Army for hacking the credit agency Equifax and acquiring data on tens of millions of Americans (US Department of Justice 2020). This case reflected a long history of Chinese state hackers conducting economic espionage against American corporations (Dorfman 2020). At the same time, the\ngovernment also works through proxies, including Chinese corporations and hacking groups. Chinese technology companies such as Huawei have been linked to espionage, with their equipment used to facilitate cyber intrusions (Robertson and Tarabay 2021), monitor the domestic population (Dou 2021), and process stolen data (Dorfman 2020). Chinese security officers have also established front companies to conduct cyberattacks. In a criminal case against four Chinese citizens accused of economic espionage, the US government alleged that the individuals were Chinese security officials in a provincial branch of the Ministry of State Security (MSS) who had “sought to obfuscate the Chinese government's role in such theft by establishing a front company, Hainan Xiandun Technology Department Co. Ltd” (US Department of Justice 2021).\nSeveral hacking groups have also been identified as proxies conducting cyberattacks on behalf of the Chinese government. An attack on Microsoft Exchange in 2021 was attributed to a group given the name Hafnium, which has been linked to the MSS by Western governments (Corera 2021). Another operation, known as Cloud Hopper, was attributed to the group APT10, which has also been connected to the MSS (Sabbagh 2021). While Western governments have attributed responsibility for the actions of these groups to the Chinese government, some ambiguity remains about the nature of the relationship. For instance, there is evidence that APT10 has also conducted cyberattacks to steal information for personal gain, raising questions about whether the group “enjoys protections that enable it to conduct its own for-profit activities” or “has simply evaded scrutiny from Chinese authorities” (Taylor 2019).\nRussia: The Russian government has made extensive use of proxies to achieve its foreign policy objectives. In Ukraine, prior to the invasion of 2022, it encouraged and then supported separatist groups in their attempts to establish independent states tied closely to Russia (International Crisis Group 2019), a tactic it has used to expand its influence in other countries including Georgia and Moldova (Cornell and Shaffer 2020). Russia has also increasingly turned to private military companies to advance its interests abroad (Hoffman and Orner 2021), the most well-known of which is the Wagner Group that has already been mentioned. These organizations have participated in conflicts in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe, receiving private gains while also extending Russia's influence. In Sudan, the Wagner Group was deployed in 2017 to help repress uprisings against Omar Al-Bashir. As payment, the company's owner was given exclusive rights to mine gold in the country, and the Russian government was later offered a naval base on the Red Sea before Al-Bashir was overthrown in 2019 (Fasanotti 2022). These companies exist in a legal gray area under Russian law and are technically separate from the state, even as they are owned and directed by individuals with close ties to President Putin and the security elite (Stronski 2020; Rondeaux 2019).\nWhile the connections are clear between Moscow and the proxies discussed above, debate has continued about how closely the Russian government controls them. Regarding private military companies like the Wagner Group, the extent to which they are “simply patriotic volunteers as the Kremlin claims...on official assignment for Russia's GRU intelligence service...mercenaries, corporate warriors, or frontline\nsoldiers” remains unclear (Rondeaux 2019). All of these identities may be true at different moments, fostering uncertainty about their role in specific conflicts or time periods. Analysts have argued that this ambiguity provides enough plausible deniability to help Russia avoid accountability for human rights violations and limit escalation risks in the conflicts in which these organizations are involved (Cornell and Shaffer 2020; Fasanotti 2022; Rondeaux 2019; Stronski 2020).\nIran: The use of proxy groups to extend its influence in the Middle East has been a central component of Iran's foreign policy for decades. The Iranian government maintains close ties with militant organizations and political movements in countries including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine, Pakistan, Syria, and Yemen (Jones 2019; Lane 2021). These organizations have received financial support, weapons, and training from Iran and often work closely with the Revolutionary Guard to advance the country's regional interests. They include Hezbollah in Lebanon, which operates a successful political party and a well-armed militia that has fought alongside the Syrian and Iranian governments in the Syrian civil war. They also include several militias in Iraq that have a formal relationship with the Iraqi armed forces (Azizi 2022), such as Kata'ib Hizballah, Asaib Ahl Al-Haq, and Harakat Hezbollah Al-Nujaba (Lane 2021). These groups participate openly in the political system, where they have worked to pull Iraq closer to Iran, and they have also taken part in armed attacks on US and Saudi targets (Malik 2020).\nDespite their close ties to Iran, most of these groups have their own domestic political interests and are not controlled fully from Tehran. In Yemen, Iranian support for the Houthis does not outweigh the group's own interests in fighting its domestic opponents and their international backers (Juneau 2016). While Iran does at times exercise direct influence over the decision-making of Hezbollah in Lebanon, its influence is usually indirect and decisions are made by Hezbollah's leaders (DeVore 2012). Likewise, the Iranian-aligned militias in Iraq are involved in Iraqi politics and frequently pursue their own political interests (Loveluck and Salim 2021). Though they coordinate militant activities closely with Iran's Revolutionary Guard, they are not entirely beholden to them and often act independently. For example, the failed assassination attempt against Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi in 2021 was suspected to have been carried out by one of the Iranian-aligned militias without approval from Iran (Khalid 2021). In addition, the militias have often attacked US forces even at moments when Iran is attempting to deescalate relations with the United States (Yuan 2021). The fact that these groups will act in their own interest can create ambiguity about the extent of Iranian involvement.\n### Vignettes\nFor each vignette in my surveys, respondents were provided with information about an attack linked to an adversarial foreign power against US interests. All details of the situation were held constant, except for the identity of the organization alleged to have carried out the attack. Respondents were told that the vignettes were hypothetical to\nensure no deception about events that could cause anger toward a foreign country. However, the content of the vignettes was selected to reflect real-world political developments discussed in the cases above. Respondents were told that the actor involved in the attack had been identified, and the attacker was randomized to be a military unit or proxy of the foreign government. The vignettes always noted that the relevant foreign government had denied foreknowledge of the attack and blamed it on a rogue operation. Because I am interested in how delegation to proxies affects public opinion by giving the government greater plausible deniability or not, it was important to be clear that the foreign government had denied involvement across the treatment groups. These scenarios reflect real-world use of covert action, where the attack is usually observed by everyone, there are attempts by government officials, journalists, and researchers to figure out who was directly involved, and the government on which the most suspicion is cast publicly denies responsibility.\nIn the first survey, the identity of the attacking organization was said to be determined by US officials. In the second and third surveys, I randomized whether the identity was determined by US officials or journalists. I included this additional randomization to account for the possibility that the source of information would shape responses to the proxy versus military treatments. It is possible that respondents would perceive US officials attributing blame to a proxy rather than the military as a signal that the US government did not wish to escalate the conflict, rather than as an objective statement about who was directly involved in the attack. In this case, respondents might attribute less blame to the foreign government and demand less escalation not because they believed the foreign government was less directly involved, but because they trusted the US government had good reasons to avoid escalation. However, I do not find any meaningful or consistent differences based on this randomization.\nThe China vignette discussed a cyberattack that stole valuable technology from a US company. The vignette randomized whether the attack was attributed to a Chinese military unit, private corporation, or state-run corporation. The state-run corporation should create less plausible deniability than the private corporation; however, its distance from the chain of command could strengthen that plausibility relative to the military unit. As discussed above, Chinese hackers linked to both state institutions and private companies have previously stolen sensitive technologies from American companies (Dofman 2020; Sullivan and Schuknect 2019).\nThe Russia vignette involved an attack on US soldiers in Syria by Russian forces. The attack was attributed either to soldiers in a Russian military unit or a Russian private military company. Throughout the Syrian civil war, American soldiers have been involved in clashes with Russian military forces but also members of the private Russian military companies that are used as proxy forces (Gibbons-Neff 2018; Schmitt 2020).\nFinally, the Iran vignette detailed an attack on US forces in Iraq by actors linked to Iran. Respondents were randomly assigned to read that the attack was connected to an Iranian military unit or an Iraqi militia with ties to Iran. These incidents have also occurred frequently since the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. As noted above, the attacks are often linked to Iranian-sponsored militias (Khaleel and Arraf 2021), but Iranian forces have been involved directly as well (Branigin 2011).\nThe full text of the vignettes are below:China Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that a Chinese (military unit/state-owned corporation/private corporation) was behind a major cyber attack on a US energy company, in which hackers stole valuable technological plans for a new renewable energy source. The Chinese government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on a rogue operation by hackers in the (military unit/state-owned corporation/private corporation).Russia Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that soldiers from a Russian (military unit/private security company) were behind an attack on US forces in Syria that killed two American soldiers. The Russian government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on officers in the (military unit/private security company) on the ground in Syria.Iran Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that soldiers from (an Iranian military unit/an Iraqi militia with ties to Iran) were behind a rocket attack on US forces in Iraq that killed two American soldiers. The Iranian government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on rogue officers in the (military unit/militia) in Iraq.\nAll randomizations within each scenario occurred with equal probability. Balance tests are reported in the SI.\nAn important motive for using multiple scenarios was to assess whether the effects of delegating to proxies would generalize to different situations in which covert action is commonly used. The scenarios reflect different types of attacks (cyber vs kinetic), different foreign governments (China, Russia, and Iran), and different proxies (corporations and militias). My expectation was that delegation would have similar effects across the scenarios, as the theoretical logic -- more credible independence of the proxy reducing attributions of blame and therefore demands for retaliation -- should apply even as the specific details vary. However, it is possible that these different scenarios would produce variation in responses. For example, cyber attacks may affect public opinion differently than kinetic attacks by limiting demands for forceful retaliation (e.g. Kreps and Schneider 2019). I explore generalizability further while discussing the results.\nOutcomes\nFollowing each vignette, respondents were asked outcome questions to assess their attributions of responsibility for the attacks and their views about how the US government should respond.\nRegarding responsibility, respondents on all three surveys were asked if the foreign governments should be blamed for the attacks. The question was worded “Do you agree or disagree that the [relevant] government should be blamed for this attack?” On the second and third surveys, respondents were also asked about who had ordered the attack, with the question “Do you think it is likely or unlikely senior officials in the [relevant] government ordered this attack?” This question provided a more direct assessment of whether respondents believed high-level officials were directly involved in -- and therefore responsible for -- the action. Answers for both questions ranged from strongly agree to strongly disagree on a 7 point Likert scale, with stronger attributions of responsibility coded as higher values. If respondents in the proxy treatment groups became less likely to blame the foreign governments and less likely to believe they ordered the attacks, it would provide support for the expectation that delegating to proxies can strengthen plausible deniability and help governments avoid blame in targeted states.\nRegarding the US response, respondents on the first and second surveys were asked if the US government should pursue targeted sanctions against the lower-level officials in the relevant proxies or military units, or if the US government should implement sanctions against senior officials in the respective governments. The question was worded as follows: “The US government is deciding how to respond to the attack. Which option do you see as a more appropriate response?” Respondents could then choose that “The US government responds by sanctioning the officers in charge of the [military unit/corporation/militia] or that “The US government responds by sanctioning senior officials in the [relevant] government. This latter option would be more likely to escalate conflict and deepen tensions between the two countries, since it reflects a direct attempt to punish the most important decision-makers in the foreign state. For example, the Chinese government responded angrily to US sanctions on senior Chinese officials over its Hong Kong policies (Wadhams 2020). In other words, respondents were forced to choose between a response that would hold accountable only those individuals involved directly in the event, or a stronger, more escalatory response that would hold accountable the top levels of the foreign government.\nOn the second survey, respondents were also asked if they would support US retaliation involving attacks on the respective countries, with answers ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree on a 7 point Likert scale. The first part of the question stated that “The US government is also deciding whether to retaliate by...” The remainder of the question specified actions including a “hacking attack that cuts off electricity to a major Chinese city” for the Chinese vignette, an attack “targeting several Russian soldiers in Syria” for the Russia vignette, and “bombing military targets in Iran” for the Iran vignette. In each case, the proposed US response was designed to\nappear escalatory. Cutting power to a major Chinese city would reflect an escalation over stealing technology; killing “several” Russian soldiers implies a higher cost on Russia than the two US soldiers killed; and bombing Iran would reflect an escalation from the tit-for-tat conflict between the two countries in Iraq.\nOne possible limitation of the second question is that respondents were not asked directly whether they would prefer to escalate, and some respondents may not have viewed the retaliatory options as escalatory. As a result, for the Iran and Russia vignettes included on the third survey, I used an outcome question designed to follow up on patterns identified in the first and second surveys by asking respondents directly about their attitudes toward escalation. The question stated that “The US government is deciding how to respond to the attack. Which option do you see as the most appropriate response?” Respondents could then choose between three options: that the US government “decides to deescalate by not targeting any [relevant government] soldiers,” that the US government “decides to respond proportionally by targeting and killing two [relevant government] soldiers, or that the US government “decides to escalate by targeting and killing twenty [relevant government] soldiers.” Because time was more limited on the third survey, I was unable to include the other two outcome questions about how the US government should respond to the attack.\nIf respondents in the proxy treatment group became more likely to prefer targeted sanctions, less likely to support a retaliatory attack, and less likely to approve explicitly of escalation, it would be consistent with delegation to proxies reducing pressure on the targeted government to escalate the conflict.\nTable 1 reports the mean and standard deviation for each outcome measure. It also illustrates which questions were asked for which country vignette on which surveys. In general, respondents are somewhat likely to blame the foreign government for the attacks and to believe that senior officials ordered them. Regarding the sanction outcome, respondents tend to be roughly split on whether sanctions should target higher-level authorities or the specific individuals involved in the attacks. Support for retaliating with force is lower, with respondents neutral on average about the retaliatory attack outcome, and with respondents mostly split between the US government either deescalating or responding proportionally -- but not escalating -- for the escalation outcome.\n## Results\nI use two approaches to report treatment effects. First, I aggregate data across the three scenarios on the three surveys, creating a single proxy treatment indicator for respondents assigned to the Chinese corporation, Russian private security company, or Iranian-aligned Iraqi militia treatments in each of the experiments. I use OLS to regress the outcomes on the proxy treatment. Dummy variables for the scenarios are included to account for different baseline responses in the military conditions, and I cluster standard errors by respondent, since each respondent completed more than one scenario on the same survey (Hainmueller et al. 2014). Analyzing the\nWilliamson\n335\nTable I.

Second, I then provide treatment effects for each of the scenarios on each survey to assess consistency. These effects are also analyzed with OLS regression, using models that control for age, gender, education, political interest, partisanship, foreign policy orientation, and region of residence. These controls were also pre-registered. They are relevant to foreign policy attitudes, are correlated with the outcomes, and were measured pre-treatment, so they can help to increase precision (Gerber and Green 2012). Results without control variables are consistent and are reported in the SI.\nTable 2 reports main effects for the proxy treatment in the aggregated data. The first two columns show results for the outcomes related to attributions of responsibility, with the first showing the effect of the treatment on perceptions that the foreign government should be blamed for the attack, and the second showing the effect on beliefs that senior officials in the foreign government ordered the attack. For both outcomes, assignment to the proxy treatment reduces attributions of responsibility by 0.14 on the seven point scale  $(p &lt; 0.001)$ . This effect is equivalent to a shift of approximately one-tenth of a standard deviation, indicating a modest impact on how respondents attribute responsibility for the hostilities. This small decrease occurred from relatively high levels of blame directed at the foreign government in the military treatments, where the\nJournal of Conflict Resolution 68(2-3)\nTable 2.

The effect of the proxy treatment on the sanctions outcome is substantively large. Respondents assigned to the proxy groups are 9 percentage points less likely to prefer sanctioning senior government officials over officials in the specific unit involved in the attack  $(p &lt; 0.001)$ . This effect reflects a shift of approximately two-fifths of a standard deviation and reduces support for the more escalatory sanctions below a majority of respondents. However, the proxy treatment did not have any influence on the other two response outcomes. Though coefficients were negative in both cases, they were near zero and statistically insignificant. In other words, respondents who read that proxies conducted the hostilities were not less likely to support retaliatory attacks by the United States against the relevant foreign country, and they were not less likely to support a response directly described as escalatory.\nNext, I report the effects for the proxy treatment in each scenario across the three surveys. These effects are displayed in Figures 1 and 2. The former addresses the attribution outcomes and the latter shows the response outcomes.\nFor the attribution outcomes, the treatment effects point in a consistent direction that reflects the negative effect in the aggregated results. Regarding blame, respondents in the first and second surveys who read that the hacking attack was carried out by a Chinese private corporation were 0.22 ( $p &lt; 0.05$ ) and 0.10 ( $p &lt; 0.10$ ) less likely to attribute responsibility to the Chinese government compared to respondents in the military treatment. On the other hand, the coefficients for the Chinese state corporation were negative but statistically insignificant in both surveys. Relative to the military treatment in the Russia scenario, the private security treatment reduced blame directed at the Russian government by 0.15 ( $p &lt; 0.10$ ) in the first survey, by 0.18 ( $p &lt; 0.001$ ) in the second survey, and by 0.13 ( $p &lt; 0.05$ ) in the third survey. Finally, for the Iran scenario, the militia treatment decreased blame relative to the military treatment by 0.20\nWilliamson\n337\nFigure 1. Treatment effects for responsibility outcomes. Note: Plot displays coefficients for treatment effects from surveys 1, 2, and 3, with effects estimated by OLS regression with control variables for age, gender, education, political interest, partisanship, foreign policy orientation, and region of residence.\n$(p &lt; 0.001)$ in the second survey, and it was negative but insignificant in the third survey.\nFor the ordered outcome, respondents on the second survey were less likely to believe the attack was carried out on orders of senior officials in the foreign government by 0.16 $(p &lt; 0.01)$ when exposed to the Chinese private corporation treatment. Again, however, the effect of the state corporation was negative but not statistically significant. For the second survey, the private security treatment reduced the Russian government's perceived role by 0.12 $(p &lt; 0.05)$, while the Iraqi militia treatment reduced the Iranian government's perceived role in ordering the attacks by 0.21 $(p &lt; 0.001)$. On the third survey, the Russia treatment lost significance but the Iran treatment continued to reduce the perceived role by 0.10 $(p &lt; 0.10)$.\nWhile there is some variation across the scenarios and surveys, these effects are consistent with the aggregate data. They suggest that individuals may be less likely to attribute responsibility to foreign governments that have denied involvement in an attack when that attack is conducted by proxies, and this pattern appears with different countries and different types of hostilities. However, the modest effect sizes also imply that delegating to proxies is unlikely to substantially transform public perceptions of blame in these scenarios. In terms of\nJournal of Conflict Resolution 68(2-3)\nvariation across the treatments, the Chinese state-run corporation effect was consistently insignificant and weaker than the others. Though the difference is small, it reflects the expectation that plausible deniability should be stronger when the proxies have more credible separation from the sponsoring state.\nFor the response outcomes shown in Figure 2, the results are generally consistent as well. Proxies strongly reduce support for sanctioning senior government officials but produce limited to no effects on attitudes toward retaliatory attacks that could escalate the conflict.\nRegarding the sanctions outcome, respondents in the proxy treatment groups were consistently less likely to prefer sanctions against senior government officials over more targeted sanctions against lower-level officials in the organization that conducted the attack. In contrast to the responsibility outcomes, this finding applied to both Chinese corporation treatments. In the first and second surveys, the Chinese private corporation reduced the preference for senior-level sanctions by  $12(p &lt; 0.001)$  and  $16(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points, while the state-run corporation reduced this preference by  $12(p &lt; 0.001)$  and  $14(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points. Likewise, the Russian security company reduced support for sanctioning senior officials by  $8(p &lt; 0.01)$  and  $10(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points in the first and second surveys. The effect for the Iraqi militia treatment was smaller, reducing support for sanctions on senior Iranian officials by approximately 4 percentage points  $(p &lt; 0.05)$ .\nFor the retaliate and escalate outcomes, however, the proxy treatment produced effects that were inconsistent in their direction and for the most part statistically insignificant. For retaliate, the Chinese state corporation treatment slightly increased\nFigure 2. Treatment effects for response outcomes. Note: Plot displays coefficients for treatment effects from surveys 1, 2, and 3, with effects estimated by OLS regression with control variables for age, gender, education, political interest, partisanship, foreign policy orientation, and region of residence.\nsupport for the hacking attack on the electrical grid of a Chinese city, though the effect was insignificant. The Chinese private corporation and the Russian security company produced very small, negative effects that failed to attain statistical significance. The Iraqi militia treatment slightly reduced support for bombing military targets in Iran, by 0.10 (p < 0.10). Respondents in the military treatments were split on whether the US government should pursue these retaliatory actions against the Chinese, Russian, and Iranian governments, with average responses of approximately 4 on the 7-point scale, and the proxy treatments had no discernible impact on these attitudes.\nThe third survey was intended to explore further the discrepancy between the sanction and retaliation outcomes by incorporating a new outcome question that asked respondents explicitly whether they wished the US government to deescalate, respond proportionally, or escalate (taking values of 0, 1, and 2 respectively). However, the proxy treatments also did not produce consistent effects on attitudes toward this escalate outcome. The Russian private security company did have a small, negative effect of 0.05 (p < 0.05) on the 3-point scale, compared to the Russian military treatment. On the other hand, the Iraqi militia returned a positive but insignificant effect compared to the Iranian military unit. In both scenarios, most respondents in the control group were split between preferring a deescalatory or proportional response: few wanted to escalate the conflict by striking back harder against the foreign country, and the proxy treatments did not have a substantial or consistent impact on these views.\nAs reported in the SI, the source identifying the involved actor -- whether US officials or journalists -- did not have a significant effect on the outcomes. In addition, the SI shows that effects of the proxy treatment did not vary consistently based on pre-existing attitudes toward China, Russia, and Iran.\n## Discussion\nThe results show a modest impact of the proxy treatments on respondents' attributions of blame and inconsistent effects on their views of how the US government should respond. Regarding the latter, respondents in the proxy treatments became less likely to prefer sanctioning senior government officials rather than individuals from the unit directly engaged in the hostilities; however, they did not become less likely to prefer retaliatory attacks against the foreign country, and they did not become less likely to support a response explicitly described as escalatory.\nTwo possible explanations may account for this divergence between the different response outcomes. One possibility is that delegation to proxies affects whom people prefer their governments to retaliate against, without necessarily affecting levels of support for the government to retaliate in some fashion. When forced to choose between the options of punishing senior government leaders or lower-level officials in the military unit or proxy organization, respondents in the proxy treatment groups were more likely to favor the latter. In other words, they preferred to retaliate against the proxy rather than the government itself. On the other hand, when confronted with outcomes that asked whether they would support retaliatory responses against the\nforeign country directly or not, without the option of targeting the proxy instead, their attitudes did not shift. This divergence could indicate that delegation may redirect pressure for retaliation toward the proxy, without necessarily limiting demands for the targeted government to respond in some way. In this case, using proxies could help to limit escalation risks, since public opinion preferring to retaliate against the proxy rather than the government should be less likely to trigger a spiral of intensifying conflict between the two adversaries.\nAnother possibility is that delegating to proxies may influence attitudes toward retaliatory options that are viewed as less risky, without shifting public opinion toward potentially costly responses involving direct attacks on powerful foreign adversaries. Sanctions are unlikely to trigger a major, destructive conflict between two countries, even if they deepen tensions. As a result, citizens in a targeted country may shift their views on the kinds of sanctions that are appropriate for responding to a provocation without needing to worry that their country will get dragged into a war. In this case, whether a proxy conducted the attack may influence the public's preferred response. With retaliation that involves significant cyber attacks or killing foreign soldiers, however, it becomes more probable that serious conflict could result. Citizens may have more entrenched views about whether it is worth risking such a conflict, such that their attitudes toward these forms of retaliation are less likely to shift due to a modest strengthening of plausible deniability that results from delegating to a proxy.\nThe article's theoretical framework suggests that delegating to proxies should reduce demands for retaliation by citizens in the targeted state because they are less likely to hold the adversarial government responsible for the attack. As expected, the proxy treatment did have an effect on respondents' attributions of blame for the hostile actions. However, the theoretical link breaks for the retaliate and escalate outcomes, since the proxy treatment did not affect support for these responses. As was just discussed, this discrepancy could be explained by respondents holding relatively entrenched views about the circumstances under which the US government should respond with violence to an adversarial state, with these attitudes unlikely to be affected by modest changes in perceptions of the foreign government's responsibility.\nDid the theoretical link hold for the sanctions outcome, with respondents in the proxy treatment less willing to sanction senior government officials because they blamed them less when the proxies conducted the attacks? Consistent with theoretical expectations, mediation analysis indicates that respondents' attributions of responsibility mediated approximately 14% of the proxy treatment's effects on preferences toward whom to sanction (Imai et al. 2011). However, this result also suggests the proxy treatment influenced the sanctions outcome through other mechanisms. One possibility is that respondents view the decision to use the proxy as a signal of the foreign government's desire to keep the conflict limited, so they become less willing to impose more punitive sanctions on that government's leadership in response. This mechanism could be explored in future research.\nEven if there is only a modest connection between how the public in a targeted country attributes responsibility for hostile actions and how they want their own\ngovernment to respond, attacking states may still benefit in other ways from relying on proxies to reduce their exposure to blame. It is likely that when a state is viewed as more responsible for an attack by its target's citizens, its reputation among the public in that country will decline. This declining reputation could have negative consequences for the public's willingness to engage or trade with the opposing state, resulting in political or economic costs for the attacker. As a result, states may still delegate to proxies in an effort to limit their exposure to blame for hostile actions, even if the primary motivation differs from trying to control escalation risks.\nAt the same time, the small magnitude of the effects on respondents' attributions of blame suggests that the use of proxies is unlikely to cause dramatic shifts in how people in targeted states think about responsibility for hostile acts. If a non-state actor is known to have strong ties to a foreign government, many people appear likely to assume that its activities are linked to its sponsor's goals and directives. However, it is possible the effect sizes represent a lower bound for how public opinion would react in real-world situations. First, the vignettes were designed to provide hard tests of the hypothesized relationships by relying on countries with authoritarian governments disliked by majorities of Americans. It is possible that delegating to proxies would have stronger effects when used by democracies or between states where citizens have more neutral views of the opposing governments. Second, it is plausible that the hypothetical -- and low-stakes -- nature of the vignettes made respondents less responsive to the treatments and more willing to record negative answers about countries they dislike. The vignettes were designed to reflect actual situations in which states have sought to obscure aspects of their foreign policies by delegating to proxies, and research comparing survey experiments to actual political attitudes suggests they do a reasonable job of generalizing to real political developments (e.g. Hainmueller et al. 2015). However, compared to real-world attacks, respondents may have felt less uncertainty about assigning blame to the foreign government in the survey.\nRegarding generalizability, the three scenarios produced relatively consistent results. The proxy treatments reduced attributions of blame and perceptions of high-level orders for the attacks with similarly-sized treatment effects for the three non-state actors in the China, Russia, and Iran incidents. The treatments also had similar effects on preferences toward sanctions, though the magnitude was smaller for Iran. One possible explanation for this difference is that sanctioning Iran had already been part of a prominent political debate for years by the time the surveys were implemented, resulting in more fixed attitudes on this question. Finally, for the retaliate and escalate outcomes, responses varied somewhat in their direction; however, the magnitudes were consistently small in all cases. These patterns suggest that how the public responds to attacks carried out by proxies may be relatively similar across different types of attacks and when linked to different sponsors.\nHowever, other issues of external validity suggest avenues for future research. First, the language used in the vignettes could be varied to create more or less contestation over responsibility. On the one hand, US officials or journalists could use softer language in their attributions, perhaps“suspecting” certain actors to be responsible for\nthe attack rather than “concluding” that they were. In certain cases, US officials may not even comment at all, and journalists or researchers may not have enough evidence to publish, leaving the public with little more than speculation about which foreign actor should be blamed. In these cases, the use of proxies may produce stronger plausible deniability. On the other hand, government officials or journalists could bring actual evidence to bear in their assertions of responsibility, while also directly calling into question the opposing government's denials of involvement, which could leave them more exposed to blame. Both approaches reflect real-world engagement around covert actions. Sometimes, both government and private sources tread cautiously in how they attribute responsibility. At other times, they release detailed reports along with evidence such as satellite imagery that are capable of shifting public opinion effectively (Lin-Greenberg and Milonopoulos 2021). It seems plausible that public opinion would respond differently based on the kinds of language and arguments used by private and public actors to shape perceptions of responsibility for covert action, and future research could explore this variation. In addition, it may be the case that people in countries outside the United States would react differently to attacks by proxies, particularly if these countries have more or less trustworthy media environments and political leaders, or if they have different historical experiences with conflict. Future research could evaluate how the results generalize to other countries.\n## Conclusion\nGovernments frequently rely on proxies to pursue their foreign policy objectives while maintaining plausible deniability of their involvement. This secrecy has been theorized to reduce risks of conflict escalation, in part by limiting domestic pressures on adversaries to retaliate. Yet, proxies often have well-documented and publicized ties to their sponsors, raising questions about the extent to which delegation to proxies can reduce escalation risks by shaping public opinion about responsibility for -- and responses to -- hostile acts.\nThe experiments discussed in this paper suggest that delegating to proxies can influence how people attribute responsibility for an attack on their country's interests, though the reported effect sizes are modest and imply that proxies may only strengthen plausible deniability on the margins. The modest effects could indicate that other factors will often provide stronger motives for governments to delegate to proxies, whether related to lower costs, their knowledge of local conditions, or signaling a lack of interest in escalation (Carson 2018; Eck 2015). Respondents in the proxy treatment were also substantially more supportive of limited sanctions rather than those targeting senior leadership of the sponsor government, indicating some effect on citizens' views of how their own government should respond to hostilities. These findings contribute to a growing literature on secrecy in international relations by implying that delegation can contribute modestly to plausible deniability while shaping preferences about whom to retaliate against, even in cases where proxies are closely controlled by their sponsors and the credibility of their independence should be relatively low. On the other hand,\nthe proxy treatment did not affect respondents' views of whether the US government should respond with more coercive and escalatory forms of retaliation, such as a major cyber attack on a Chinese city, killing Russian soldiers, or bombing targets in Iran. These null effects could result from respondents' holding more fixed attitudes about the contexts in which the United States should use force against adversarial states, with modest shifts in plausible deniability unlikely to change these views.\n## Acknowledgements\nI thank Bridging the Gap's New Era Workshop for motivating the project.

Delegating these actions to proxies is one strategy states use to retain plausible deniability and limit escalation risks. Yet, proxies often have strong ties to sponsoring states, raising questions about their ability to influence blame and demands for retaliation. This paper tests these effects by analyzing American responses to hypothetical attacks by Chinese, Russian, and Iranian actors through experiments administered on three surveys. The results show that using proxies for these attacks modestly reduced how much Americans blamed the respective foreign governments, while also limiting demands that their senior leadership be sanctioned. However, the use of proxies did not affect Americans' attitudes toward more forceful responses by the US government. These findings contribute to understanding of how proxies shape plausible deniability and escalation risks in international conflicts.\n# Keywords\nconflict management, domestic politics, foreign policy, interstate conflict\n$^{1}$ Department of Social and Political Sciences, Bocconi University, Milano, Italy\n# Corresponding Author:\nScott Williamson, Department of Social and Political Sciences, Bocconi University, Via Sarfatti, 25, Milano 20136, Italy.\nEmail: scott.williamson@unibocconi.it\nIntroduction\nIn February 2018, Syrian and Russian forces attacked an American outpost in Syria. The assault dragged on for more than four hours, during which hundreds of the attacking soldiers were killed. Despite fears the incident could trigger conflict between Russian and American forces in Syria, escalation did not occur. The Russian government quickly distanced itself from the attack by claiming they had no control over the soldiers, who were not part of the Russian military. Instead, they were employees of a private military company called the Wagner Group . This company has often served as a Russian proxy in conflicts where the government has not wished to involve itself openly, including in Libya, Ukraine, Venezuela, and Syria .\nCovert actions such as these are a common feature of international affairs, with states frequently attempting to disguise aspects of their foreign policies. Scholars have proposed that this emphasis on secrecy can contribute to stability within the international system by reducing the likelihood of conflict escalation . This advantage is thought to occur in part because adversaries who engage each other secretly should be less likely to trigger domestic pressures that push them to increase the scope of the conflict .\nDelegating to their non-state proxies is one strategy states use when trying to preserve secrecy around their involvement in hostile actions . In theory, the proxy's ability to claim independence from the chain of command can provide the state with more plausible deniability about their lack of responsibility. If this strategy is effective, it follows that public opinion in a targeted country should respond differently to denials of responsibility for hostile actions carried out by a state's proxies rather than its military or other security institutions. Specifically, this delegation should weaken attributions of blame against the attacking government while limiting demands for retaliation, thus mitigating pressures on the targeted government to respond. However, there are reasons to doubt whether proxies make deniability more plausible, since they frequently demonstrate strong ties to their patrons, which should undermine the credibility of claims that their decision-making is independent. Returning to the Russian Wagner Group, for example, the company's founder has a personal relationship with President Putin, and the company is known to receive funding, training, and equipment from the Russian military and intelligence apparatus . This relationship has become even more publicly apparent since the Russian invasion of Ukraine .\nTo date, there has been relatively little research on public opinion toward secrecy in international politics , including whether and how delegating hostile actions to proxies shapes public opinion. I evaluate whether this delegation can influence attributions of blame and demands for retaliation by implementing seven vignette experiments across three surveys of American adults. The vignettes address hypothetical attacks against US targets by Russian, Chinese, and\nIranian actors, with these countries' governments denying involvement in the attacks. Respondents are randomly assigned to read that the attackers were part of a military unit or proxy group tied to the foreign government, after which they assess responsibility for the incident and evaluate possible US responses. These countries were chosen not only because their governments rely frequently on covert action, but also because their authoritarian political systems and their unpopularity with the American public should create a hard test of the hypothesized relationships.\nThe results show that respondents become less likely to attribute responsibility to the adversarial governments when attacks were carried out by proxies. The effects are small, however, suggesting that the use of proxies with known ties to the sponsor may marginally strengthen a government's plausible deniability of involvement in an attack without substantially altering the extent to which citizens in the targeted state blame that government. The results also provide mixed support for the ability of covert action to mitigate demands for escalation. Respondents in the proxy treatment groups are substantially less likely to support sanctioning the senior leadership of the adversarial governments instead of subordinate individuals involved directly in the attacks, and this effect is partially mediated by the treatment's effects on respondents' attributions of blame. However, respondents are not less likely to support forceful, retaliatory attacks by the US government that would reflect a clear escalation of the conflict. One interpretation of these findings is that delegation to proxies may help reduce escalation risks by increasing the likelihood that the targeted public prefers to retaliate against the proxy itself, but is less likely to influence citizens' views on their government responding to hostilities with coercive and forceful forms of retaliation.\nThese findings contribute to international relations research on secrecy by providing experimental evidence that both reinforces and expands on existing theories about the effects of covert action and plausible deniability on conflict, insofar as they provide some evidence that acting covertly through proxies can reduce a government's exposure to blame and shape how citizens in a targeted country think about the appropriate response (e.g. Carnegie and Carson 2018; Carson 2016; Hedgecock and Sukin 2023; Joseph and Poznansky 2018). They also extend a nascent body of work on public opinion toward the role of non-state proxies in international politics (e.g. Plana 2020). In addition, by showing that authoritarian regimes can reduce their exposure to blame in international conflicts by delegating to non-state proxies, the findings contribute to a large literature on blame avoidance that has to date focused primarily on domestic politics and democratic political systems .\nThis article proceeds as follows. It first reviews literature on covert action and secrecy in international politics before outlining expectations about the effects of proxies on attributions of responsibility and demands for retaliation. It then discusses the selected cases and research design for the experiments, before presenting the results. The article concludes with a discussion of external validity and implications for international relations research.\n##\nSecrecy, Delegation, and Conflict Escalation\nSecrecy is a common feature of international politics , and a growing literature seeks to explain why states might attempt to conceal outcomes ranging from military alliances to the resolution of international legal disputes or crises . Covert action reflects one aspect of secrecy in the international system, whereby states attempt to obscure their involvement in hostile activities targeting another state or political entity. Well-known examples include the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba by US-backed Cuban exiles, or participation by Soviet pilots in the Korean War against the United States. As with these examples, covert operations or their outcomes tend to be visible publicly, and the objective is not to keep the acts themselves secret, but rather to conceal or create doubt about who was involved .\nThe identity of the responsible actor does not always stay secret to other states, whose governments often have the intelligence capacity to make reasonable determinations about who is behind an attack. Even so, the costs and risks associated with covert operations can prove useful by signaling resolve to the observing states . Furthermore, covert action is more likely to succeed at concealing the identity of the responsible actor from the public. As a result, states may rely on it to obscure aspects of their foreign policy that would damage their reputations domestically or abroad . For example, democracies may use covert action against other democracies to avoid domestic backlash for violating the expectation that they remain on good terms with democratic governments . Relatedly, governments may delegate violence against civilians to non-state actors to obscure their involvement from international audiences who would respond negatively to human rights violations .\nBy providing plausible deniability that conceals responsibility for hostile activities from the public, covert action has been theorized to help adversarial states reduce the risks of conflict escalation. Research indicates that political and military leaders are susceptible to pressure from public opinion when deciding whether and how to deploy military force . Keeping hostilities on the “backstage” and out of the public eye should help states to avoid pressures from hawkish domestic constituencies who wish to expand the scope of the conflict, while allowing states to signal to each other that they do not want to escalate . In other words, by obscuring their involvement, states may be able to limit escalation risks in part by decreasing the likelihood that citizens in the targeted country demand a response from their own government that would escalate the conflict. As an example of this mechanism in action, Carson (2018, 21) notes how Nazi Germany monitored foreign reactions to its involvement in the Spanish Civil War and “...carefully calibrated covert German combat participation in light of hawkish domestic sentiment in London and Paris.”\nBecause the point of covert action is to obscure the identity of the responsible actor, states often pursue these operations through their proxies, whether corporations, informal militias, or “volunteer” fighters. Research on blame attributions and accountability implies that this strategy of delegating to proxies should be effective at creating plausible deniability that influences perceptions of responsibility in the targeted state. People are more likely to believe an actor is responsible for an outcome when they have direct control over the decision-making process that produces the outcome . In cases where delegation occurs and multiple decision-makers are involved, clarity of responsibility is diminished and political actors are more capable of avoiding blame . Experimental research suggests these blame avoidance benefits can occur even when people know the delegator and delegatee share the same interests . In terms of international relations, proxies such as militias or corporations are entities separate from the state apparatus, and, at least in theory, they can make decisions more independently than a military or intelligence unit. This potential independence should make it harder for citizens in the targeted state to determine whether an action occurred because of directives from the sponsor or because of the proxy's own initiative. As a result, delegating to proxies should increase plausible deniability and help the sponsor to limit how much it is held responsible by citizens of the targeted state.\nAs noted in the literature on covert action, governments may benefit from this redirection of perceived responsibility for several reasons, including protecting their political support domestically and their soft power internationally if their involvement in the hostile acts would be viewed negatively . Of primary interest to this article is that shifting blame through covert operations may also help governments to reduce the likelihood of citizens in the targeted country demanding retaliation that escalates the conflict . The blame avoidance literature provides a framework for understanding why delegating to proxies could shape attitudes toward retaliation as well. Because blame helps people to identify who should be held accountable for a problematic outcome, those who limit their exposure to blame should face fewer demands that they be punished . Thus, if delegating to a proxy can reduce how many people in the targeted country blame the sponsoring state for a hostile action, it follows that these people may also become less likely to want their government to hold that state accountable by retaliating against it. In other words, using proxies to conduct covert actions could weaken domestic pressure on the targeted government to expand the conflict, which would reduce escalation risks by limiting incentives for political and military leaders to respond forcefully .\nFrom this theoretical framework, I expect the following when hostile actions are known to be conducted by a state's proxies rather than its own military forces. First, when a proxy is involved, I expect that respondents will be more likely to believe a foreign government's denials of responsibility -- i.e. they will blame the government less. Second, because respondents attribute less blame to the foreign government, I\nexpect that they will be less likely to support retaliation against that government as well.\nHowever, there are also reasons to expect that delegating to proxies may have little effect on attributions of responsibility or attitudes toward retaliation. First, proxies often lack credible separation from their sponsors. If the proxy is a domestic entity with legal status within the sponsoring country, it may be constrained in its ability to pursue foreign policy objectives that contradict those of the government. This limitation is especially likely to apply in authoritarian regimes, where the government controls most domestic organizations closely to ensure that they do not work against the authorities. Foreign proxies of a government might have more credible claims to independence, since they exist outside that government's legal and coercive apparatus. Nonetheless, in these cases, journalists and foreign governments often go to great lengths to publicize ties between the proxy and its sponsor. If people do not believe that the proxy has genuine independence to operate, they are unlikely to absolve the sponsoring state of blame.\nSecond, if citizens in the targeted state dislike the sponsor government intensely and are primed to distrust it, they may discount claims of separation from the proxy. This reaction may be particularly likely in contexts where two states have a history of poor relations -- i.e. the contexts in which hostile covert actions are most likely to be conducted. Finally, citizens of a targeted state may blame the sponsor of an attacking proxy for failing to control their proxy, even if the sponsors did not intend for the attack to happen.\n## Research Design\nTo test how covert action by proxies influences attributions of blame and demands for retaliation, I implemented seven vignette experiments across three surveys administered online in the United States. Experiments have become increasingly common in the international relations literature, and they are particularly useful for studying IR theories that involve public opinion  -- including issues of secrecy and covert action (e.g. Myrick 2019). The following sections provide further details about the design.\n### Samples\nThe first survey was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 1299 American adults recruited by the firm Lucid in April 2019. Each respondent read and answered outcome questions for two vignettes: one involving China, and the other involving Russia. The survey was designed with the expectations about delegation, blame, and escalation in mind but was exploratory and not pre-registered.\nThe second survey was pre-registered. I specified hypotheses and analyses that would indicate replication of findings from the first survey, and I expanded the experiment by adding additional outcome questions in line with the theoretical\nexpectations. This second survey was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 3053 respondents recruited by Lucid in March 2021. Each respondent on the second survey saw the same China and Russia vignettes used on the first survey. In addition, they also read and responded to questions about a vignette involving Iran.\nThe third survey was intended to provide an additional replication check, while also facilitating exploratory analysis of patterns identified in the second survey. It was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 2007 American adults recruited by Lucid in May 2021. This survey used the Russia and Iran vignettes but dropped the China vignette due to time constraints. All three surveys were representative on age, gender, income, ethnicity, and US region. Summary statistics can be found in the SI.\n### Case Selection\nI chose to center my vignettes around hostile actions attributed to Chinese, Russian, and Iranian actors. These three cases are useful for several reasons. The first is that all three countries are relatively unpopular in the United States due to a history of adversarial relations. My survey data highlights these unfavorable perceptions among American adults. In the first survey in 2019, 15% of respondents reported a favorable view of Russia and 16% said the same about China. In the second survey in 2021, only 25% of respondents said they had a favorable view of China, 20% reported a favorable view of Russia, and 11% claimed to have a favorable view of Iran. These negative attitudes should make it less likely that respondents would give these governments the benefit of the doubt when they deny involvement in hostile actions carried out by their proxies. The second reason is that all three countries are governed by authoritarian regimes. China's government operates a massive surveillance state that exercises extensive control over the population. Russia and Iran also control their societies closely. These political systems make it less likely that proxy groups are operating independently of the authorities, which should reduce the credibility of delegation and make it less likely that people believe that the proxy's sponsor was not involved. These first two reasons suggest the countries provide a hard test of the hypothesized effects.\nFinally, the third reason is that all three countries regularly engage in covert action to advance their foreign policy objectives, and they frequently do so by delegating to non-state proxies that are believed to provide a degree of plausible deniability. As such, the survey vignettes should be highly relevant to real-world events. In the following paragraphs, I briefly discuss examples from each case.\nChina: As cyber activities have become increasingly important for global politics, China has invested heavily in its cyber capabilities to gather political and economic intelligence . The Chinese government has used a variety of actors to conduct cyberattacks, including military personnel. In 2020, the US government charged four members of the People's Liberation Army for hacking the credit agency Equifax and acquiring data on tens of millions of Americans (US Department of Justice 2020). This case reflected a long history of Chinese state hackers conducting economic espionage against American corporations . At the same time, the\ngovernment also works through proxies, including Chinese corporations and hacking groups. Chinese technology companies such as Huawei have been linked to espionage, with their equipment used to facilitate cyber intrusions , monitor the domestic population , and process stolen data . Chinese security officers have also established front companies to conduct cyberattacks. In a criminal case against four Chinese citizens accused of economic espionage, the US government alleged that the individuals were Chinese security officials in a provincial branch of the Ministry of State Security (MSS) who had “sought to obfuscate the Chinese government's role in such theft by establishing a front company, Hainan Xiandun Technology Department Co. Ltd” (US Department of Justice 2021).\nSeveral hacking groups have also been identified as proxies conducting cyberattacks on behalf of the Chinese government. An attack on Microsoft Exchange in 2021 was attributed to a group given the name Hafnium, which has been linked to the MSS by Western governments . Another operation, known as Cloud Hopper, was attributed to the group APT10, which has also been connected to the MSS . While Western governments have attributed responsibility for the actions of these groups to the Chinese government, some ambiguity remains about the nature of the relationship. For instance, there is evidence that APT10 has also conducted cyberattacks to steal information for personal gain, raising questions about whether the group “enjoys protections that enable it to conduct its own for-profit activities” or “has simply evaded scrutiny from Chinese authorities” .\nRussia: The Russian government has made extensive use of proxies to achieve its foreign policy objectives. In Ukraine, prior to the invasion of 2022, it encouraged and then supported separatist groups in their attempts to establish independent states tied closely to Russia (International Crisis Group 2019), a tactic it has used to expand its influence in other countries including Georgia and Moldova . Russia has also increasingly turned to private military companies to advance its interests abroad , the most well-known of which is the Wagner Group that has already been mentioned. These organizations have participated in conflicts in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe, receiving private gains while also extending Russia's influence. In Sudan, the Wagner Group was deployed in 2017 to help repress uprisings against Omar Al-Bashir. As payment, the company's owner was given exclusive rights to mine gold in the country, and the Russian government was later offered a naval base on the Red Sea before Al-Bashir was overthrown in 2019 . These companies exist in a legal gray area under Russian law and are technically separate from the state, even as they are owned and directed by individuals with close ties to President Putin and the security elite .\nWhile the connections are clear between Moscow and the proxies discussed above, debate has continued about how closely the Russian government controls them. Regarding private military companies like the Wagner Group, the extent to which they are “simply patriotic volunteers as the Kremlin claims...on official assignment for Russia's GRU intelligence service...mercenaries, corporate warriors, or frontline\nsoldiers” remains unclear . All of these identities may be true at different moments, fostering uncertainty about their role in specific conflicts or time periods. Analysts have argued that this ambiguity provides enough plausible deniability to help Russia avoid accountability for human rights violations and limit escalation risks in the conflicts in which these organizations are involved .\nIran: The use of proxy groups to extend its influence in the Middle East has been a central component of Iran's foreign policy for decades. The Iranian government maintains close ties with militant organizations and political movements in countries including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine, Pakistan, Syria, and Yemen . These organizations have received financial support, weapons, and training from Iran and often work closely with the Revolutionary Guard to advance the country's regional interests. They include Hezbollah in Lebanon, which operates a successful political party and a well-armed militia that has fought alongside the Syrian and Iranian governments in the Syrian civil war. They also include several militias in Iraq that have a formal relationship with the Iraqi armed forces , such as Kata'ib Hizballah, Asaib Ahl Al-Haq, and Harakat Hezbollah Al-Nujaba . These groups participate openly in the political system, where they have worked to pull Iraq closer to Iran, and they have also taken part in armed attacks on US and Saudi targets .\nDespite their close ties to Iran, most of these groups have their own domestic political interests and are not controlled fully from Tehran. In Yemen, Iranian support for the Houthis does not outweigh the group's own interests in fighting its domestic opponents and their international backers . While Iran does at times exercise direct influence over the decision-making of Hezbollah in Lebanon, its influence is usually indirect and decisions are made by Hezbollah's leaders . Likewise, the Iranian-aligned militias in Iraq are involved in Iraqi politics and frequently pursue their own political interests . Though they coordinate militant activities closely with Iran's Revolutionary Guard, they are not entirely beholden to them and often act independently. For example, the failed assassination attempt against Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi in 2021 was suspected to have been carried out by one of the Iranian-aligned militias without approval from Iran . In addition, the militias have often attacked US forces even at moments when Iran is attempting to deescalate relations with the United States . The fact that these groups will act in their own interest can create ambiguity about the extent of Iranian involvement.\n### Vignettes\nFor each vignette in my surveys, respondents were provided with information about an attack linked to an adversarial foreign power against US interests. All details of the situation were held constant, except for the identity of the organization alleged to have carried out the attack. Respondents were told that the vignettes were hypothetical to\nensure no deception about events that could cause anger toward a foreign country. However, the content of the vignettes was selected to reflect real-world political developments discussed in the cases above. Respondents were told that the actor involved in the attack had been identified, and the attacker was randomized to be a military unit or proxy of the foreign government. The vignettes always noted that the relevant foreign government had denied foreknowledge of the attack and blamed it on a rogue operation. Because I am interested in how delegation to proxies affects public opinion by giving the government greater plausible deniability or not, it was important to be clear that the foreign government had denied involvement across the treatment groups. These scenarios reflect real-world use of covert action, where the attack is usually observed by everyone, there are attempts by government officials, journalists, and researchers to figure out who was directly involved, and the government on which the most suspicion is cast publicly denies responsibility.\nIn the first survey, the identity of the attacking organization was said to be determined by US officials. In the second and third surveys, I randomized whether the identity was determined by US officials or journalists. I included this additional randomization to account for the possibility that the source of information would shape responses to the proxy versus military treatments. It is possible that respondents would perceive US officials attributing blame to a proxy rather than the military as a signal that the US government did not wish to escalate the conflict, rather than as an objective statement about who was directly involved in the attack. In this case, respondents might attribute less blame to the foreign government and demand less escalation not because they believed the foreign government was less directly involved, but because they trusted the US government had good reasons to avoid escalation. However, I do not find any meaningful or consistent differences based on this randomization.\nThe China vignette discussed a cyberattack that stole valuable technology from a US company. The vignette randomized whether the attack was attributed to a Chinese military unit, private corporation, or state-run corporation. The state-run corporation should create less plausible deniability than the private corporation; however, its distance from the chain of command could strengthen that plausibility relative to the military unit. As discussed above, Chinese hackers linked to both state institutions and private companies have previously stolen sensitive technologies from American companies .\nThe Russia vignette involved an attack on US soldiers in Syria by Russian forces. The attack was attributed either to soldiers in a Russian military unit or a Russian private military company. Throughout the Syrian civil war, American soldiers have been involved in clashes with Russian military forces but also members of the private Russian military companies that are used as proxy forces .\nFinally, the Iran vignette detailed an attack on US forces in Iraq by actors linked to Iran. Respondents were randomly assigned to read that the attack was connected to an Iranian military unit or an Iraqi militia with ties to Iran. These incidents have also occurred frequently since the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. As noted above, the attacks are often linked to Iranian-sponsored militias , but Iranian forces have been involved directly as well .\nThe full text of the vignettes are below:China Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that a Chinese (military unit/state-owned corporation/private corporation) was behind a major cyber attack on a US energy company, in which hackers stole valuable technological plans for a new renewable energy source. The Chinese government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on a rogue operation by hackers in the (military unit/state-owned corporation/private corporation).Russia Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that soldiers from a Russian (military unit/private security company) were behind an attack on US forces in Syria that killed two American soldiers. The Russian government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on officers in the (military unit/private security company) on the ground in Syria.Iran Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that soldiers from (an Iranian military unit/an Iraqi militia with ties to Iran) were behind a rocket attack on US forces in Iraq that killed two American soldiers. The Iranian government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on rogue officers in the (military unit/militia) in Iraq.\nAll randomizations within each scenario occurred with equal probability. Balance tests are reported in the SI.\nAn important motive for using multiple scenarios was to assess whether the effects of delegating to proxies would generalize to different situations in which covert action is commonly used. The scenarios reflect different types of attacks (cyber vs kinetic), different foreign governments (China, Russia, and Iran), and different proxies (corporations and militias). My expectation was that delegation would have similar effects across the scenarios, as the theoretical logic -- more credible independence of the proxy reducing attributions of blame and therefore demands for retaliation -- should apply even as the specific details vary. However, it is possible that these different scenarios would produce variation in responses. For example, cyber attacks may affect public opinion differently than kinetic attacks by limiting demands for forceful retaliation (e.g. Kreps and Schneider 2019). I explore generalizability further while discussing the results.\nOutcomes\nFollowing each vignette, respondents were asked outcome questions to assess their attributions of responsibility for the attacks and their views about how the US government should respond.\nRegarding responsibility, respondents on all three surveys were asked if the foreign governments should be blamed for the attacks. The question was worded “Do you agree or disagree that the [relevant] government should be blamed for this attack?” On the second and third surveys, respondents were also asked about who had ordered the attack, with the question “Do you think it is likely or unlikely senior officials in the [relevant] government ordered this attack?” This question provided a more direct assessment of whether respondents believed high-level officials were directly involved in -- and therefore responsible for -- the action. Answers for both questions ranged from strongly agree to strongly disagree on a 7 point Likert scale, with stronger attributions of responsibility coded as higher values. If respondents in the proxy treatment groups became less likely to blame the foreign governments and less likely to believe they ordered the attacks, it would provide support for the expectation that delegating to proxies can strengthen plausible deniability and help governments avoid blame in targeted states.\nRegarding the US response, respondents on the first and second surveys were asked if the US government should pursue targeted sanctions against the lower-level officials in the relevant proxies or military units, or if the US government should implement sanctions against senior officials in the respective governments. The question was worded as follows: “The US government is deciding how to respond to the attack. Which option do you see as a more appropriate response?” Respondents could then choose that “The US government responds by sanctioning the officers in charge of the [military unit/corporation/militia] or that “The US government responds by sanctioning senior officials in the [relevant] government. This latter option would be more likely to escalate conflict and deepen tensions between the two countries, since it reflects a direct attempt to punish the most important decision-makers in the foreign state. For example, the Chinese government responded angrily to US sanctions on senior Chinese officials over its Hong Kong policies . In other words, respondents were forced to choose between a response that would hold accountable only those individuals involved directly in the event, or a stronger, more escalatory response that would hold accountable the top levels of the foreign government.\nOn the second survey, respondents were also asked if they would support US retaliation involving attacks on the respective countries, with answers ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree on a 7 point Likert scale. The first part of the question stated that “The US government is also deciding whether to retaliate by...” The remainder of the question specified actions including a “hacking attack that cuts off electricity to a major Chinese city” for the Chinese vignette, an attack “targeting several Russian soldiers in Syria” for the Russia vignette, and “bombing military targets in Iran” for the Iran vignette. In each case, the proposed US response was designed to\nappear escalatory. Cutting power to a major Chinese city would reflect an escalation over stealing technology; killing “several” Russian soldiers implies a higher cost on Russia than the two US soldiers killed; and bombing Iran would reflect an escalation from the tit-for-tat conflict between the two countries in Iraq.\nOne possible limitation of the second question is that respondents were not asked directly whether they would prefer to escalate, and some respondents may not have viewed the retaliatory options as escalatory. As a result, for the Iran and Russia vignettes included on the third survey, I used an outcome question designed to follow up on patterns identified in the first and second surveys by asking respondents directly about their attitudes toward escalation. The question stated that “The US government is deciding how to respond to the attack. Which option do you see as the most appropriate response?” Respondents could then choose between three options: that the US government “decides to deescalate by not targeting any [relevant government] soldiers,” that the US government “decides to respond proportionally by targeting and killing two [relevant government] soldiers, or that the US government “decides to escalate by targeting and killing twenty [relevant government] soldiers.” Because time was more limited on the third survey, I was unable to include the other two outcome questions about how the US government should respond to the attack.\nIf respondents in the proxy treatment group became more likely to prefer targeted sanctions, less likely to support a retaliatory attack, and less likely to approve explicitly of escalation, it would be consistent with delegation to proxies reducing pressure on the targeted government to escalate the conflict.\nTable 1 reports the mean and standard deviation for each outcome measure. It also illustrates which questions were asked for which country vignette on which surveys. In general, respondents are somewhat likely to blame the foreign government for the attacks and to believe that senior officials ordered them. Regarding the sanction outcome, respondents tend to be roughly split on whether sanctions should target higher-level authorities or the specific individuals involved in the attacks. Support for retaliating with force is lower, with respondents neutral on average about the retaliatory attack outcome, and with respondents mostly split between the US government either deescalating or responding proportionally -- but not escalating -- for the escalation outcome.\n## Results\nI use two approaches to report treatment effects. First, I aggregate data across the three scenarios on the three surveys, creating a single proxy treatment indicator for respondents assigned to the Chinese corporation, Russian private security company, or Iranian-aligned Iraqi militia treatments in each of the experiments. I use OLS to regress the outcomes on the proxy treatment. Dummy variables for the scenarios are included to account for different baseline responses in the military conditions, and I cluster standard errors by respondent, since each respondent completed more than one scenario on the same survey . Analyzing the\nWilliamson\n\n|  Variable - Country | Survey 1 | Survey 2 | Survey 3  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Blame - China | 5.18 (1.46) | 5.18 (1.46) |   |\n|  Blame - Russia | 5.15 (1.52) | 5.16 (1.47) | 5.09 (1.44)  |\n|  Blame - Iran |  | 5.31 (1.44) | 5.27 (1.40)  |\n|  Ordered - China |  | 5.42 (1.43) |   |\n|  Ordered - Russia |  | 5.27 (1.48) | 5.25 (1.43)  |\n|  Ordered - Iran |  | 5.42 (1.44) | 5.43 (1.40)  |\n|  Sanction - China | 0.51 (0.50) | 0.47 (0.50) |   |\n|  Sanction - Russia | 0.55 (0.50) | 0.46 (0.50) |   |\n|  Sanction - Iran |  | 0.49 (0.50) |   |\n|  Retaliate - China |  | 4.04 (1.85) |   |\n|  Retaliate - Russia |  | 4.26 (1.75) |   |\n|  Retaliate - Iran |  | 4.54 (1.73) |   |\n|  Escalate - China |  |  |   |\n|  Escalate - Russia |  |  | 0.42 (0.63)  |\n|  Escalate - Iran |  |  | 0.54 (0.72)  |\nMean (SD) reported for each outcome measure.\nRange for blame, ordered, attack: 1-7.\nRange for sanction: 0-1; Range for escalate: 0-2.\naggregated data, which was pre-registered with the pre-analysis plan for the second survey, is useful for providing an overall assessment of how delegating to proxies affected responses to the different outcomes across multiple surveys and scenarios. Second, I then provide treatment effects for each of the scenarios on each survey to assess consistency. These effects are also analyzed with OLS regression, using models that control for age, gender, education, political interest, partisanship, foreign policy orientation, and region of residence. These controls were also pre-registered. They are relevant to foreign policy attitudes, are correlated with the outcomes, and were measured pre-treatment, so they can help to increase precision . Results without control variables are consistent and are reported in the SI.\nTable 2 reports main effects for the proxy treatment in the aggregated data. The first two columns show results for the outcomes related to attributions of responsibility, with the first showing the effect of the treatment on perceptions that the foreign government should be blamed for the attack, and the second showing the effect on beliefs that senior officials in the foreign government ordered the attack. For both outcomes, assignment to the proxy treatment reduces attributions of responsibility by 0.14 on the seven point scale  $(p &lt; 0.001)$ . This effect is equivalent to a shift of approximately one-tenth of a standard deviation, indicating a modest impact on how respondents attribute responsibility for the hostilities. This small decrease occurred from relatively high levels of blame directed at the foreign government in the military treatments, where the\nJournal of Conflict Resolution 68(2-3)\nTable 2.

The effect of the proxy treatment on the sanctions outcome is substantively large. Respondents assigned to the proxy groups are 9 percentage points less likely to prefer sanctioning senior government officials over officials in the specific unit involved in the attack  $(p &lt; 0.001)$ . This effect reflects a shift of approximately two-fifths of a standard deviation and reduces support for the more escalatory sanctions below a majority of respondents. However, the proxy treatment did not have any influence on the other two response outcomes. Though coefficients were negative in both cases, they were near zero and statistically insignificant. In other words, respondents who read that proxies conducted the hostilities were not less likely to support retaliatory attacks by the United States against the relevant foreign country, and they were not less likely to support a response directly described as escalatory.\nNext, I report the effects for the proxy treatment in each scenario across the three surveys. These effects are displayed in Figures 1 and 2. The former addresses the attribution outcomes and the latter shows the response outcomes.\nFor the attribution outcomes, the treatment effects point in a consistent direction that reflects the negative effect in the aggregated results. Regarding blame, respondents in the first and second surveys who read that the hacking attack was carried out by a Chinese private corporation were 0.22 ( $p &lt; 0.05$ ) and 0.10 ( $p &lt; 0.10$ ) less likely to attribute responsibility to the Chinese government compared to respondents in the military treatment. On the other hand, the coefficients for the Chinese state corporation were negative but statistically insignificant in both surveys. Relative to the military treatment in the Russia scenario, the private security treatment reduced blame directed at the Russian government by 0.15 ( $p &lt; 0.10$ ) in the first survey, by 0.18 ( $p &lt; 0.001$ ) in the second survey, and by 0.13 ( $p &lt; 0.05$ ) in the third survey. Finally, for the Iran scenario, the militia treatment decreased blame relative to the military treatment by 0.20\nWilliamson\n\n$(p &lt; 0.001)$ in the second survey, and it was negative but insignificant in the third survey.\nFor the ordered outcome, respondents on the second survey were less likely to believe the attack was carried out on orders of senior officials in the foreign government by 0.16 $(p &lt; 0.01)$ when exposed to the Chinese private corporation treatment. Again, however, the effect of the state corporation was negative but not statistically significant. For the second survey, the private security treatment reduced the Russian government's perceived role by 0.12 $(p &lt; 0.05)$, while the Iraqi militia treatment reduced the Iranian government's perceived role in ordering the attacks by 0.21 $(p &lt; 0.001)$. On the third survey, the Russia treatment lost significance but the Iran treatment continued to reduce the perceived role by 0.10 $(p &lt; 0.10)$.\nWhile there is some variation across the scenarios and surveys, these effects are consistent with the aggregate data. They suggest that individuals may be less likely to attribute responsibility to foreign governments that have denied involvement in an attack when that attack is conducted by proxies, and this pattern appears with different countries and different types of hostilities. However, the modest effect sizes also imply that delegating to proxies is unlikely to substantially transform public perceptions of blame in these scenarios. In terms of\nJournal of Conflict Resolution 68(2-3)\nvariation across the treatments, the Chinese state-run corporation effect was consistently insignificant and weaker than the others. Though the difference is small, it reflects the expectation that plausible deniability should be stronger when the proxies have more credible separation from the sponsoring state.\nFor the response outcomes shown in Figure 2, the results are generally consistent as well. Proxies strongly reduce support for sanctioning senior government officials but produce limited to no effects on attitudes toward retaliatory attacks that could escalate the conflict.\nRegarding the sanctions outcome, respondents in the proxy treatment groups were consistently less likely to prefer sanctions against senior government officials over more targeted sanctions against lower-level officials in the organization that conducted the attack. In contrast to the responsibility outcomes, this finding applied to both Chinese corporation treatments. In the first and second surveys, the Chinese private corporation reduced the preference for senior-level sanctions by  $12(p &lt; 0.001)$  and  $16(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points, while the state-run corporation reduced this preference by  $12(p &lt; 0.001)$  and  $14(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points. Likewise, the Russian security company reduced support for sanctioning senior officials by  $8(p &lt; 0.01)$  and  $10(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points in the first and second surveys. The effect for the Iraqi militia treatment was smaller, reducing support for sanctions on senior Iranian officials by approximately 4 percentage points  $(p &lt; 0.05)$ .\nFor the retaliate and escalate outcomes, however, the proxy treatment produced effects that were inconsistent in their direction and for the most part statistically insignificant. For retaliate, the Chinese state corporation treatment slightly increased\nFigure 2. Treatment effects for response outcomes. Note: Plot displays coefficients for treatment effects from surveys 1, 2, and 3, with effects estimated by OLS regression with control variables for age, gender, education, political interest, partisanship, foreign policy orientation, and region of residence.\nsupport for the hacking attack on the electrical grid of a Chinese city, though the effect was insignificant. The Chinese private corporation and the Russian security company produced very small, negative effects that failed to attain statistical significance. The Iraqi militia treatment slightly reduced support for bombing military targets in Iran, by 0.10 (p < 0.10). Respondents in the military treatments were split on whether the US government should pursue these retaliatory actions against the Chinese, Russian, and Iranian governments, with average responses of approximately 4 on the 7-point scale, and the proxy treatments had no discernible impact on these attitudes.\nThe third survey was intended to explore further the discrepancy between the sanction and retaliation outcomes by incorporating a new outcome question that asked respondents explicitly whether they wished the US government to deescalate, respond proportionally, or escalate (taking values of 0, 1, and 2 respectively). However, the proxy treatments also did not produce consistent effects on attitudes toward this escalate outcome. The Russian private security company did have a small, negative effect of 0.05 (p < 0.05) on the 3-point scale, compared to the Russian military treatment. On the other hand, the Iraqi militia returned a positive but insignificant effect compared to the Iranian military unit. In both scenarios, most respondents in the control group were split between preferring a deescalatory or proportional response: few wanted to escalate the conflict by striking back harder against the foreign country, and the proxy treatments did not have a substantial or consistent impact on these views.\nAs reported in the SI, the source identifying the involved actor -- whether US officials or journalists -- did not have a significant effect on the outcomes. In addition, the SI shows that effects of the proxy treatment did not vary consistently based on pre-existing attitudes toward China, Russia, and Iran.\n## Discussion\nThe results show a modest impact of the proxy treatments on respondents' attributions of blame and inconsistent effects on their views of how the US government should respond. Regarding the latter, respondents in the proxy treatments became less likely to prefer sanctioning senior government officials rather than individuals from the unit directly engaged in the hostilities; however, they did not become less likely to prefer retaliatory attacks against the foreign country, and they did not become less likely to support a response explicitly described as escalatory.\nTwo possible explanations may account for this divergence between the different response outcomes. One possibility is that delegation to proxies affects whom people prefer their governments to retaliate against, without necessarily affecting levels of support for the government to retaliate in some fashion. When forced to choose between the options of punishing senior government leaders or lower-level officials in the military unit or proxy organization, respondents in the proxy treatment groups were more likely to favor the latter. In other words, they preferred to retaliate against the proxy rather than the government itself. On the other hand, when confronted with outcomes that asked whether they would support retaliatory responses against the\nforeign country directly or not, without the option of targeting the proxy instead, their attitudes did not shift. This divergence could indicate that delegation may redirect pressure for retaliation toward the proxy, without necessarily limiting demands for the targeted government to respond in some way. In this case, using proxies could help to limit escalation risks, since public opinion preferring to retaliate against the proxy rather than the government should be less likely to trigger a spiral of intensifying conflict between the two adversaries.\nAnother possibility is that delegating to proxies may influence attitudes toward retaliatory options that are viewed as less risky, without shifting public opinion toward potentially costly responses involving direct attacks on powerful foreign adversaries. Sanctions are unlikely to trigger a major, destructive conflict between two countries, even if they deepen tensions. As a result, citizens in a targeted country may shift their views on the kinds of sanctions that are appropriate for responding to a provocation without needing to worry that their country will get dragged into a war. In this case, whether a proxy conducted the attack may influence the public's preferred response. With retaliation that involves significant cyber attacks or killing foreign soldiers, however, it becomes more probable that serious conflict could result. Citizens may have more entrenched views about whether it is worth risking such a conflict, such that their attitudes toward these forms of retaliation are less likely to shift due to a modest strengthening of plausible deniability that results from delegating to a proxy.\nThe article's theoretical framework suggests that delegating to proxies should reduce demands for retaliation by citizens in the targeted state because they are less likely to hold the adversarial government responsible for the attack. As expected, the proxy treatment did have an effect on respondents' attributions of blame for the hostile actions. However, the theoretical link breaks for the retaliate and escalate outcomes, since the proxy treatment did not affect support for these responses. As was just discussed, this discrepancy could be explained by respondents holding relatively entrenched views about the circumstances under which the US government should respond with violence to an adversarial state, with these attitudes unlikely to be affected by modest changes in perceptions of the foreign government's responsibility.\nDid the theoretical link hold for the sanctions outcome, with respondents in the proxy treatment less willing to sanction senior government officials because they blamed them less when the proxies conducted the attacks? Consistent with theoretical expectations, mediation analysis indicates that respondents' attributions of responsibility mediated approximately 14% of the proxy treatment's effects on preferences toward whom to sanction . However, this result also suggests the proxy treatment influenced the sanctions outcome through other mechanisms. One possibility is that respondents view the decision to use the proxy as a signal of the foreign government's desire to keep the conflict limited, so they become less willing to impose more punitive sanctions on that government's leadership in response. This mechanism could be explored in future research.\nEven if there is only a modest connection between how the public in a targeted country attributes responsibility for hostile actions and how they want their own\ngovernment to respond, attacking states may still benefit in other ways from relying on proxies to reduce their exposure to blame. It is likely that when a state is viewed as more responsible for an attack by its target's citizens, its reputation among the public in that country will decline. This declining reputation could have negative consequences for the public's willingness to engage or trade with the opposing state, resulting in political or economic costs for the attacker. As a result, states may still delegate to proxies in an effort to limit their exposure to blame for hostile actions, even if the primary motivation differs from trying to control escalation risks.\nAt the same time, the small magnitude of the effects on respondents' attributions of blame suggests that the use of proxies is unlikely to cause dramatic shifts in how people in targeted states think about responsibility for hostile acts. If a non-state actor is known to have strong ties to a foreign government, many people appear likely to assume that its activities are linked to its sponsor's goals and directives. However, it is possible the effect sizes represent a lower bound for how public opinion would react in real-world situations. First, the vignettes were designed to provide hard tests of the hypothesized relationships by relying on countries with authoritarian governments disliked by majorities of Americans. It is possible that delegating to proxies would have stronger effects when used by democracies or between states where citizens have more neutral views of the opposing governments. Second, it is plausible that the hypothetical -- and low-stakes -- nature of the vignettes made respondents less responsive to the treatments and more willing to record negative answers about countries they dislike. The vignettes were designed to reflect actual situations in which states have sought to obscure aspects of their foreign policies by delegating to proxies, and research comparing survey experiments to actual political attitudes suggests they do a reasonable job of generalizing to real political developments (e.g. Hainmueller et al. 2015). However, compared to real-world attacks, respondents may have felt less uncertainty about assigning blame to the foreign government in the survey.\nRegarding generalizability, the three scenarios produced relatively consistent results. The proxy treatments reduced attributions of blame and perceptions of high-level orders for the attacks with similarly-sized treatment effects for the three non-state actors in the China, Russia, and Iran incidents. The treatments also had similar effects on preferences toward sanctions, though the magnitude was smaller for Iran. One possible explanation for this difference is that sanctioning Iran had already been part of a prominent political debate for years by the time the surveys were implemented, resulting in more fixed attitudes on this question. Finally, for the retaliate and escalate outcomes, responses varied somewhat in their direction; however, the magnitudes were consistently small in all cases. These patterns suggest that how the public responds to attacks carried out by proxies may be relatively similar across different types of attacks and when linked to different sponsors.\nHowever, other issues of external validity suggest avenues for future research. First, the language used in the vignettes could be varied to create more or less contestation over responsibility. On the one hand, US officials or journalists could use softer language in their attributions, perhaps“suspecting” certain actors to be responsible for\nthe attack rather than “concluding” that they were. In certain cases, US officials may not even comment at all, and journalists or researchers may not have enough evidence to publish, leaving the public with little more than speculation about which foreign actor should be blamed. In these cases, the use of proxies may produce stronger plausible deniability. On the other hand, government officials or journalists could bring actual evidence to bear in their assertions of responsibility, while also directly calling into question the opposing government's denials of involvement, which could leave them more exposed to blame. Both approaches reflect real-world engagement around covert actions. Sometimes, both government and private sources tread cautiously in how they attribute responsibility. At other times, they release detailed reports along with evidence such as satellite imagery that are capable of shifting public opinion effectively . It seems plausible that public opinion would respond differently based on the kinds of language and arguments used by private and public actors to shape perceptions of responsibility for covert action, and future research could explore this variation. In addition, it may be the case that people in countries outside the United States would react differently to attacks by proxies, particularly if these countries have more or less trustworthy media environments and political leaders, or if they have different historical experiences with conflict. Future research could evaluate how the results generalize to other countries.\n## Conclusion\nGovernments frequently rely on proxies to pursue their foreign policy objectives while maintaining plausible deniability of their involvement. This secrecy has been theorized to reduce risks of conflict escalation, in part by limiting domestic pressures on adversaries to retaliate. Yet, proxies often have well-documented and publicized ties to their sponsors, raising questions about the extent to which delegation to proxies can reduce escalation risks by shaping public opinion about responsibility for -- and responses to -- hostile acts.\nThe experiments discussed in this paper suggest that delegating to proxies can influence how people attribute responsibility for an attack on their country's interests, though the reported effect sizes are modest and imply that proxies may only strengthen plausible deniability on the margins. The modest effects could indicate that other factors will often provide stronger motives for governments to delegate to proxies, whether related to lower costs, their knowledge of local conditions, or signaling a lack of interest in escalation . Respondents in the proxy treatment were also substantially more supportive of limited sanctions rather than those targeting senior leadership of the sponsor government, indicating some effect on citizens' views of how their own government should respond to hostilities. These findings contribute to a growing literature on secrecy in international relations by implying that delegation can contribute modestly to plausible deniability while shaping preferences about whom to retaliate against, even in cases where proxies are closely controlled by their sponsors and the credibility of their independence should be relatively low. On the other hand,\nthe proxy treatment did not affect respondents' views of whether the US government should respond with more coercive and escalatory forms of retaliation, such as a major cyber attack on a Chinese city, killing Russian soldiers, or bombing targets in Iran. These null effects could result from respondents' holding more fixed attitudes about the contexts in which the United States should use force against adversarial states, with modest shifts in plausible deniability unlikely to change these views.\n## Acknowledgements\nI thank Bridging the Gap's New Era Workshop for motivating the project.

The assault dragged on for more than four hours, during which hundreds of the attacking soldiers were killed. Despite fears the incident could trigger conflict between Russian and American forces in Syria, escalation did not occur. The Russian government quickly distanced itself from the attack by claiming they had no control over the soldiers, who were not part of the Russian military. Instead, they were employees of a private military company called the Wagner Group . This company has often served as a Russian proxy in conflicts where the government has not wished to involve itself openly, including in Libya, Ukraine, Venezuela, and Syria .\nCovert actions such as these are a common feature of international affairs, with states frequently attempting to disguise aspects of their foreign policies. Scholars have proposed that this emphasis on secrecy can contribute to stability within the international system by reducing the likelihood of conflict escalation . This advantage is thought to occur in part because adversaries who engage each other secretly should be less likely to trigger domestic pressures that push them to increase the scope of the conflict .\nDelegating to their non-state proxies is one strategy states use when trying to preserve secrecy around their involvement in hostile actions . In theory, the proxy's ability to claim independence from the chain of command can provide the state with more plausible deniability about their lack of responsibility. If this strategy is effective, it follows that public opinion in a targeted country should respond differently to denials of responsibility for hostile actions carried out by a state's proxies rather than its military or other security institutions. Specifically, this delegation should weaken attributions of blame against the attacking government while limiting demands for retaliation, thus mitigating pressures on the targeted government to respond. However, there are reasons to doubt whether proxies make deniability more plausible, since they frequently demonstrate strong ties to their patrons, which should undermine the credibility of claims that their decision-making is independent. Returning to the Russian Wagner Group, for example, the company's founder has a personal relationship with President Putin, and the company is known to receive funding, training, and equipment from the Russian military and intelligence apparatus . This relationship has become even more publicly apparent since the Russian invasion of Ukraine .\nTo date, there has been relatively little research on public opinion toward secrecy in international politics , including whether and how delegating hostile actions to proxies shapes public opinion. I evaluate whether this delegation can influence attributions of blame and demands for retaliation by implementing seven vignette experiments across three surveys of American adults. The vignettes address hypothetical attacks against US targets by Russian, Chinese, and\nIranian actors, with these countries' governments denying involvement in the attacks. Respondents are randomly assigned to read that the attackers were part of a military unit or proxy group tied to the foreign government, after which they assess responsibility for the incident and evaluate possible US responses. These countries were chosen not only because their governments rely frequently on covert action, but also because their authoritarian political systems and their unpopularity with the American public should create a hard test of the hypothesized relationships.\nThe results show that respondents become less likely to attribute responsibility to the adversarial governments when attacks were carried out by proxies. The effects are small, however, suggesting that the use of proxies with known ties to the sponsor may marginally strengthen a government's plausible deniability of involvement in an attack without substantially altering the extent to which citizens in the targeted state blame that government. The results also provide mixed support for the ability of covert action to mitigate demands for escalation. Respondents in the proxy treatment groups are substantially less likely to support sanctioning the senior leadership of the adversarial governments instead of subordinate individuals involved directly in the attacks, and this effect is partially mediated by the treatment's effects on respondents' attributions of blame. However, respondents are not less likely to support forceful, retaliatory attacks by the US government that would reflect a clear escalation of the conflict. One interpretation of these findings is that delegation to proxies may help reduce escalation risks by increasing the likelihood that the targeted public prefers to retaliate against the proxy itself, but is less likely to influence citizens' views on their government responding to hostilities with coercive and forceful forms of retaliation.\nThese findings contribute to international relations research on secrecy by providing experimental evidence that both reinforces and expands on existing theories about the effects of covert action and plausible deniability on conflict, insofar as they provide some evidence that acting covertly through proxies can reduce a government's exposure to blame and shape how citizens in a targeted country think about the appropriate response (e.g. Carnegie and Carson 2018; Carson 2016; Hedgecock and Sukin 2023; Joseph and Poznansky 2018). They also extend a nascent body of work on public opinion toward the role of non-state proxies in international politics (e.g. Plana 2020). In addition, by showing that authoritarian regimes can reduce their exposure to blame in international conflicts by delegating to non-state proxies, the findings contribute to a large literature on blame avoidance that has to date focused primarily on domestic politics and democratic political systems .\nThis article proceeds as follows. It first reviews literature on covert action and secrecy in international politics before outlining expectations about the effects of proxies on attributions of responsibility and demands for retaliation. It then discusses the selected cases and research design for the experiments, before presenting the results. The article concludes with a discussion of external validity and implications for international relations research.\n##\nSecrecy, Delegation, and Conflict Escalation\nSecrecy is a common feature of international politics , and a growing literature seeks to explain why states might attempt to conceal outcomes ranging from military alliances to the resolution of international legal disputes or crises . Covert action reflects one aspect of secrecy in the international system, whereby states attempt to obscure their involvement in hostile activities targeting another state or political entity. Well-known examples include the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba by US-backed Cuban exiles, or participation by Soviet pilots in the Korean War against the United States. As with these examples, covert operations or their outcomes tend to be visible publicly, and the objective is not to keep the acts themselves secret, but rather to conceal or create doubt about who was involved .\nThe identity of the responsible actor does not always stay secret to other states, whose governments often have the intelligence capacity to make reasonable determinations about who is behind an attack. Even so, the costs and risks associated with covert operations can prove useful by signaling resolve to the observing states . Furthermore, covert action is more likely to succeed at concealing the identity of the responsible actor from the public. As a result, states may rely on it to obscure aspects of their foreign policy that would damage their reputations domestically or abroad . For example, democracies may use covert action against other democracies to avoid domestic backlash for violating the expectation that they remain on good terms with democratic governments . Relatedly, governments may delegate violence against civilians to non-state actors to obscure their involvement from international audiences who would respond negatively to human rights violations .\nBy providing plausible deniability that conceals responsibility for hostile activities from the public, covert action has been theorized to help adversarial states reduce the risks of conflict escalation. Research indicates that political and military leaders are susceptible to pressure from public opinion when deciding whether and how to deploy military force . Keeping hostilities on the “backstage” and out of the public eye should help states to avoid pressures from hawkish domestic constituencies who wish to expand the scope of the conflict, while allowing states to signal to each other that they do not want to escalate . In other words, by obscuring their involvement, states may be able to limit escalation risks in part by decreasing the likelihood that citizens in the targeted country demand a response from their own government that would escalate the conflict. As an example of this mechanism in action, Carson (2018, 21) notes how Nazi Germany monitored foreign reactions to its involvement in the Spanish Civil War and “...carefully calibrated covert German combat participation in light of hawkish domestic sentiment in London and Paris.”\nBecause the point of covert action is to obscure the identity of the responsible actor, states often pursue these operations through their proxies, whether corporations, informal militias, or “volunteer” fighters. Research on blame attributions and accountability implies that this strategy of delegating to proxies should be effective at creating plausible deniability that influences perceptions of responsibility in the targeted state. People are more likely to believe an actor is responsible for an outcome when they have direct control over the decision-making process that produces the outcome . In cases where delegation occurs and multiple decision-makers are involved, clarity of responsibility is diminished and political actors are more capable of avoiding blame . Experimental research suggests these blame avoidance benefits can occur even when people know the delegator and delegatee share the same interests . In terms of international relations, proxies such as militias or corporations are entities separate from the state apparatus, and, at least in theory, they can make decisions more independently than a military or intelligence unit. This potential independence should make it harder for citizens in the targeted state to determine whether an action occurred because of directives from the sponsor or because of the proxy's own initiative. As a result, delegating to proxies should increase plausible deniability and help the sponsor to limit how much it is held responsible by citizens of the targeted state.\nAs noted in the literature on covert action, governments may benefit from this redirection of perceived responsibility for several reasons, including protecting their political support domestically and their soft power internationally if their involvement in the hostile acts would be viewed negatively . Of primary interest to this article is that shifting blame through covert operations may also help governments to reduce the likelihood of citizens in the targeted country demanding retaliation that escalates the conflict . The blame avoidance literature provides a framework for understanding why delegating to proxies could shape attitudes toward retaliation as well. Because blame helps people to identify who should be held accountable for a problematic outcome, those who limit their exposure to blame should face fewer demands that they be punished . Thus, if delegating to a proxy can reduce how many people in the targeted country blame the sponsoring state for a hostile action, it follows that these people may also become less likely to want their government to hold that state accountable by retaliating against it. In other words, using proxies to conduct covert actions could weaken domestic pressure on the targeted government to expand the conflict, which would reduce escalation risks by limiting incentives for political and military leaders to respond forcefully .\nFrom this theoretical framework, I expect the following when hostile actions are known to be conducted by a state's proxies rather than its own military forces. First, when a proxy is involved, I expect that respondents will be more likely to believe a foreign government's denials of responsibility -- i.e. they will blame the government less. Second, because respondents attribute less blame to the foreign government, I\nexpect that they will be less likely to support retaliation against that government as well.\nHowever, there are also reasons to expect that delegating to proxies may have little effect on attributions of responsibility or attitudes toward retaliation. First, proxies often lack credible separation from their sponsors. If the proxy is a domestic entity with legal status within the sponsoring country, it may be constrained in its ability to pursue foreign policy objectives that contradict those of the government. This limitation is especially likely to apply in authoritarian regimes, where the government controls most domestic organizations closely to ensure that they do not work against the authorities. Foreign proxies of a government might have more credible claims to independence, since they exist outside that government's legal and coercive apparatus. Nonetheless, in these cases, journalists and foreign governments often go to great lengths to publicize ties between the proxy and its sponsor. If people do not believe that the proxy has genuine independence to operate, they are unlikely to absolve the sponsoring state of blame.\nSecond, if citizens in the targeted state dislike the sponsor government intensely and are primed to distrust it, they may discount claims of separation from the proxy. This reaction may be particularly likely in contexts where two states have a history of poor relations -- i.e. the contexts in which hostile covert actions are most likely to be conducted. Finally, citizens of a targeted state may blame the sponsor of an attacking proxy for failing to control their proxy, even if the sponsors did not intend for the attack to happen.\n## Research Design\nTo test how covert action by proxies influences attributions of blame and demands for retaliation, I implemented seven vignette experiments across three surveys administered online in the United States. Experiments have become increasingly common in the international relations literature, and they are particularly useful for studying IR theories that involve public opinion  -- including issues of secrecy and covert action (e.g. Myrick 2019). The following sections provide further details about the design.\n### Samples\nThe first survey was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 1299 American adults recruited by the firm Lucid in April 2019. Each respondent read and answered outcome questions for two vignettes: one involving China, and the other involving Russia. The survey was designed with the expectations about delegation, blame, and escalation in mind but was exploratory and not pre-registered.\nThe second survey was pre-registered. I specified hypotheses and analyses that would indicate replication of findings from the first survey, and I expanded the experiment by adding additional outcome questions in line with the theoretical\nexpectations. This second survey was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 3053 respondents recruited by Lucid in March 2021. Each respondent on the second survey saw the same China and Russia vignettes used on the first survey. In addition, they also read and responded to questions about a vignette involving Iran.\nThe third survey was intended to provide an additional replication check, while also facilitating exploratory analysis of patterns identified in the second survey. It was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 2007 American adults recruited by Lucid in May 2021. This survey used the Russia and Iran vignettes but dropped the China vignette due to time constraints. All three surveys were representative on age, gender, income, ethnicity, and US region. Summary statistics can be found in the SI.\n### Case Selection\nI chose to center my vignettes around hostile actions attributed to Chinese, Russian, and Iranian actors. These three cases are useful for several reasons. The first is that all three countries are relatively unpopular in the United States due to a history of adversarial relations. My survey data highlights these unfavorable perceptions among American adults. In the first survey in 2019, 15% of respondents reported a favorable view of Russia and 16% said the same about China. In the second survey in 2021, only 25% of respondents said they had a favorable view of China, 20% reported a favorable view of Russia, and 11% claimed to have a favorable view of Iran. These negative attitudes should make it less likely that respondents would give these governments the benefit of the doubt when they deny involvement in hostile actions carried out by their proxies. The second reason is that all three countries are governed by authoritarian regimes. China's government operates a massive surveillance state that exercises extensive control over the population. Russia and Iran also control their societies closely. These political systems make it less likely that proxy groups are operating independently of the authorities, which should reduce the credibility of delegation and make it less likely that people believe that the proxy's sponsor was not involved. These first two reasons suggest the countries provide a hard test of the hypothesized effects.\nFinally, the third reason is that all three countries regularly engage in covert action to advance their foreign policy objectives, and they frequently do so by delegating to non-state proxies that are believed to provide a degree of plausible deniability. As such, the survey vignettes should be highly relevant to real-world events. In the following paragraphs, I briefly discuss examples from each case.\nChina: As cyber activities have become increasingly important for global politics, China has invested heavily in its cyber capabilities to gather political and economic intelligence . The Chinese government has used a variety of actors to conduct cyberattacks, including military personnel. In 2020, the US government charged four members of the People's Liberation Army for hacking the credit agency Equifax and acquiring data on tens of millions of Americans (US Department of Justice 2020). This case reflected a long history of Chinese state hackers conducting economic espionage against American corporations . At the same time, the\ngovernment also works through proxies, including Chinese corporations and hacking groups. Chinese technology companies such as Huawei have been linked to espionage, with their equipment used to facilitate cyber intrusions , monitor the domestic population , and process stolen data . Chinese security officers have also established front companies to conduct cyberattacks. In a criminal case against four Chinese citizens accused of economic espionage, the US government alleged that the individuals were Chinese security officials in a provincial branch of the Ministry of State Security (MSS) who had “sought to obfuscate the Chinese government's role in such theft by establishing a front company, Hainan Xiandun Technology Department Co. Ltd” (US Department of Justice 2021).\nSeveral hacking groups have also been identified as proxies conducting cyberattacks on behalf of the Chinese government. An attack on Microsoft Exchange in 2021 was attributed to a group given the name Hafnium, which has been linked to the MSS by Western governments . Another operation, known as Cloud Hopper, was attributed to the group APT10, which has also been connected to the MSS . While Western governments have attributed responsibility for the actions of these groups to the Chinese government, some ambiguity remains about the nature of the relationship. For instance, there is evidence that APT10 has also conducted cyberattacks to steal information for personal gain, raising questions about whether the group “enjoys protections that enable it to conduct its own for-profit activities” or “has simply evaded scrutiny from Chinese authorities” .\nRussia: The Russian government has made extensive use of proxies to achieve its foreign policy objectives. In Ukraine, prior to the invasion of 2022, it encouraged and then supported separatist groups in their attempts to establish independent states tied closely to Russia (International Crisis Group 2019), a tactic it has used to expand its influence in other countries including Georgia and Moldova . Russia has also increasingly turned to private military companies to advance its interests abroad , the most well-known of which is the Wagner Group that has already been mentioned. These organizations have participated in conflicts in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe, receiving private gains while also extending Russia's influence. In Sudan, the Wagner Group was deployed in 2017 to help repress uprisings against Omar Al-Bashir. As payment, the company's owner was given exclusive rights to mine gold in the country, and the Russian government was later offered a naval base on the Red Sea before Al-Bashir was overthrown in 2019 . These companies exist in a legal gray area under Russian law and are technically separate from the state, even as they are owned and directed by individuals with close ties to President Putin and the security elite .\nWhile the connections are clear between Moscow and the proxies discussed above, debate has continued about how closely the Russian government controls them. Regarding private military companies like the Wagner Group, the extent to which they are “simply patriotic volunteers as the Kremlin claims...on official assignment for Russia's GRU intelligence service...mercenaries, corporate warriors, or frontline\nsoldiers” remains unclear . All of these identities may be true at different moments, fostering uncertainty about their role in specific conflicts or time periods. Analysts have argued that this ambiguity provides enough plausible deniability to help Russia avoid accountability for human rights violations and limit escalation risks in the conflicts in which these organizations are involved .\nIran: The use of proxy groups to extend its influence in the Middle East has been a central component of Iran's foreign policy for decades. The Iranian government maintains close ties with militant organizations and political movements in countries including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine, Pakistan, Syria, and Yemen . These organizations have received financial support, weapons, and training from Iran and often work closely with the Revolutionary Guard to advance the country's regional interests. They include Hezbollah in Lebanon, which operates a successful political party and a well-armed militia that has fought alongside the Syrian and Iranian governments in the Syrian civil war. They also include several militias in Iraq that have a formal relationship with the Iraqi armed forces , such as Kata'ib Hizballah, Asaib Ahl Al-Haq, and Harakat Hezbollah Al-Nujaba . These groups participate openly in the political system, where they have worked to pull Iraq closer to Iran, and they have also taken part in armed attacks on US and Saudi targets .\nDespite their close ties to Iran, most of these groups have their own domestic political interests and are not controlled fully from Tehran. In Yemen, Iranian support for the Houthis does not outweigh the group's own interests in fighting its domestic opponents and their international backers . While Iran does at times exercise direct influence over the decision-making of Hezbollah in Lebanon, its influence is usually indirect and decisions are made by Hezbollah's leaders . Likewise, the Iranian-aligned militias in Iraq are involved in Iraqi politics and frequently pursue their own political interests . Though they coordinate militant activities closely with Iran's Revolutionary Guard, they are not entirely beholden to them and often act independently. For example, the failed assassination attempt against Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi in 2021 was suspected to have been carried out by one of the Iranian-aligned militias without approval from Iran . In addition, the militias have often attacked US forces even at moments when Iran is attempting to deescalate relations with the United States . The fact that these groups will act in their own interest can create ambiguity about the extent of Iranian involvement.\n### Vignettes\nFor each vignette in my surveys, respondents were provided with information about an attack linked to an adversarial foreign power against US interests. All details of the situation were held constant, except for the identity of the organization alleged to have carried out the attack. Respondents were told that the vignettes were hypothetical to\nensure no deception about events that could cause anger toward a foreign country. However, the content of the vignettes was selected to reflect real-world political developments discussed in the cases above. Respondents were told that the actor involved in the attack had been identified, and the attacker was randomized to be a military unit or proxy of the foreign government. The vignettes always noted that the relevant foreign government had denied foreknowledge of the attack and blamed it on a rogue operation. Because I am interested in how delegation to proxies affects public opinion by giving the government greater plausible deniability or not, it was important to be clear that the foreign government had denied involvement across the treatment groups. These scenarios reflect real-world use of covert action, where the attack is usually observed by everyone, there are attempts by government officials, journalists, and researchers to figure out who was directly involved, and the government on which the most suspicion is cast publicly denies responsibility.\nIn the first survey, the identity of the attacking organization was said to be determined by US officials. In the second and third surveys, I randomized whether the identity was determined by US officials or journalists. I included this additional randomization to account for the possibility that the source of information would shape responses to the proxy versus military treatments. It is possible that respondents would perceive US officials attributing blame to a proxy rather than the military as a signal that the US government did not wish to escalate the conflict, rather than as an objective statement about who was directly involved in the attack. In this case, respondents might attribute less blame to the foreign government and demand less escalation not because they believed the foreign government was less directly involved, but because they trusted the US government had good reasons to avoid escalation. However, I do not find any meaningful or consistent differences based on this randomization.\nThe China vignette discussed a cyberattack that stole valuable technology from a US company. The vignette randomized whether the attack was attributed to a Chinese military unit, private corporation, or state-run corporation. The state-run corporation should create less plausible deniability than the private corporation; however, its distance from the chain of command could strengthen that plausibility relative to the military unit. As discussed above, Chinese hackers linked to both state institutions and private companies have previously stolen sensitive technologies from American companies .\nThe Russia vignette involved an attack on US soldiers in Syria by Russian forces. The attack was attributed either to soldiers in a Russian military unit or a Russian private military company. Throughout the Syrian civil war, American soldiers have been involved in clashes with Russian military forces but also members of the private Russian military companies that are used as proxy forces .\nFinally, the Iran vignette detailed an attack on US forces in Iraq by actors linked to Iran. Respondents were randomly assigned to read that the attack was connected to an Iranian military unit or an Iraqi militia with ties to Iran. These incidents have also occurred frequently since the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. As noted above, the attacks are often linked to Iranian-sponsored militias , but Iranian forces have been involved directly as well .\nThe full text of the vignettes are below:China Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that a Chinese (military unit/state-owned corporation/private corporation) was behind a major cyber attack on a US energy company, in which hackers stole valuable technological plans for a new renewable energy source. The Chinese government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on a rogue operation by hackers in the (military unit/state-owned corporation/private corporation).Russia Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that soldiers from a Russian (military unit/private security company) were behind an attack on US forces in Syria that killed two American soldiers. The Russian government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on officers in the (military unit/private security company) on the ground in Syria.Iran Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that soldiers from (an Iranian military unit/an Iraqi militia with ties to Iran) were behind a rocket attack on US forces in Iraq that killed two American soldiers. The Iranian government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on rogue officers in the (military unit/militia) in Iraq.\nAll randomizations within each scenario occurred with equal probability. Balance tests are reported in the SI.\nAn important motive for using multiple scenarios was to assess whether the effects of delegating to proxies would generalize to different situations in which covert action is commonly used. The scenarios reflect different types of attacks (cyber vs kinetic), different foreign governments (China, Russia, and Iran), and different proxies (corporations and militias). My expectation was that delegation would have similar effects across the scenarios, as the theoretical logic -- more credible independence of the proxy reducing attributions of blame and therefore demands for retaliation -- should apply even as the specific details vary. However, it is possible that these different scenarios would produce variation in responses. For example, cyber attacks may affect public opinion differently than kinetic attacks by limiting demands for forceful retaliation (e.g. Kreps and Schneider 2019). I explore generalizability further while discussing the results.\nOutcomes\nFollowing each vignette, respondents were asked outcome questions to assess their attributions of responsibility for the attacks and their views about how the US government should respond.\nRegarding responsibility, respondents on all three surveys were asked if the foreign governments should be blamed for the attacks. The question was worded “Do you agree or disagree that the [relevant] government should be blamed for this attack?” On the second and third surveys, respondents were also asked about who had ordered the attack, with the question “Do you think it is likely or unlikely senior officials in the [relevant] government ordered this attack?” This question provided a more direct assessment of whether respondents believed high-level officials were directly involved in -- and therefore responsible for -- the action. Answers for both questions ranged from strongly agree to strongly disagree on a 7 point Likert scale, with stronger attributions of responsibility coded as higher values. If respondents in the proxy treatment groups became less likely to blame the foreign governments and less likely to believe they ordered the attacks, it would provide support for the expectation that delegating to proxies can strengthen plausible deniability and help governments avoid blame in targeted states.\nRegarding the US response, respondents on the first and second surveys were asked if the US government should pursue targeted sanctions against the lower-level officials in the relevant proxies or military units, or if the US government should implement sanctions against senior officials in the respective governments. The question was worded as follows: “The US government is deciding how to respond to the attack. Which option do you see as a more appropriate response?” Respondents could then choose that “The US government responds by sanctioning the officers in charge of the [military unit/corporation/militia] or that “The US government responds by sanctioning senior officials in the [relevant] government. This latter option would be more likely to escalate conflict and deepen tensions between the two countries, since it reflects a direct attempt to punish the most important decision-makers in the foreign state. For example, the Chinese government responded angrily to US sanctions on senior Chinese officials over its Hong Kong policies . In other words, respondents were forced to choose between a response that would hold accountable only those individuals involved directly in the event, or a stronger, more escalatory response that would hold accountable the top levels of the foreign government.\nOn the second survey, respondents were also asked if they would support US retaliation involving attacks on the respective countries, with answers ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree on a 7 point Likert scale. The first part of the question stated that “The US government is also deciding whether to retaliate by...” The remainder of the question specified actions including a “hacking attack that cuts off electricity to a major Chinese city” for the Chinese vignette, an attack “targeting several Russian soldiers in Syria” for the Russia vignette, and “bombing military targets in Iran” for the Iran vignette. In each case, the proposed US response was designed to\nappear escalatory. Cutting power to a major Chinese city would reflect an escalation over stealing technology; killing “several” Russian soldiers implies a higher cost on Russia than the two US soldiers killed; and bombing Iran would reflect an escalation from the tit-for-tat conflict between the two countries in Iraq.\nOne possible limitation of the second question is that respondents were not asked directly whether they would prefer to escalate, and some respondents may not have viewed the retaliatory options as escalatory. As a result, for the Iran and Russia vignettes included on the third survey, I used an outcome question designed to follow up on patterns identified in the first and second surveys by asking respondents directly about their attitudes toward escalation. The question stated that “The US government is deciding how to respond to the attack. Which option do you see as the most appropriate response?” Respondents could then choose between three options: that the US government “decides to deescalate by not targeting any [relevant government] soldiers,” that the US government “decides to respond proportionally by targeting and killing two [relevant government] soldiers, or that the US government “decides to escalate by targeting and killing twenty [relevant government] soldiers.” Because time was more limited on the third survey, I was unable to include the other two outcome questions about how the US government should respond to the attack.\nIf respondents in the proxy treatment group became more likely to prefer targeted sanctions, less likely to support a retaliatory attack, and less likely to approve explicitly of escalation, it would be consistent with delegation to proxies reducing pressure on the targeted government to escalate the conflict.\nTable 1 reports the mean and standard deviation for each outcome measure. It also illustrates which questions were asked for which country vignette on which surveys. In general, respondents are somewhat likely to blame the foreign government for the attacks and to believe that senior officials ordered them. Regarding the sanction outcome, respondents tend to be roughly split on whether sanctions should target higher-level authorities or the specific individuals involved in the attacks. Support for retaliating with force is lower, with respondents neutral on average about the retaliatory attack outcome, and with respondents mostly split between the US government either deescalating or responding proportionally -- but not escalating -- for the escalation outcome.\n## Results\nI use two approaches to report treatment effects. First, I aggregate data across the three scenarios on the three surveys, creating a single proxy treatment indicator for respondents assigned to the Chinese corporation, Russian private security company, or Iranian-aligned Iraqi militia treatments in each of the experiments. I use OLS to regress the outcomes on the proxy treatment. Dummy variables for the scenarios are included to account for different baseline responses in the military conditions, and I cluster standard errors by respondent, since each respondent completed more than one scenario on the same survey .

Second, I then provide treatment effects for each of the scenarios on each survey to assess consistency. These effects are also analyzed with OLS regression, using models that control for age, gender, education, political interest, partisanship, foreign policy orientation, and region of residence. These controls were also pre-registered. They are relevant to foreign policy attitudes, are correlated with the outcomes, and were measured pre-treatment, so they can help to increase precision . Results without control variables are consistent and are reported in the SI.\nTable 2 reports main effects for the proxy treatment in the aggregated data. The first two columns show results for the outcomes related to attributions of responsibility, with the first showing the effect of the treatment on perceptions that the foreign government should be blamed for the attack, and the second showing the effect on beliefs that senior officials in the foreign government ordered the attack. For both outcomes, assignment to the proxy treatment reduces attributions of responsibility by 0.14 on the seven point scale  $(p &lt; 0.001)$ . This effect is equivalent to a shift of approximately one-tenth of a standard deviation, indicating a modest impact on how respondents attribute responsibility for the hostilities. This small decrease occurred from relatively high levels of blame directed at the foreign government in the military treatments, where the\nJournal of Conflict Resolution 68(2-3)\nTable 2.

The effect of the proxy treatment on the sanctions outcome is substantively large. Respondents assigned to the proxy groups are 9 percentage points less likely to prefer sanctioning senior government officials over officials in the specific unit involved in the attack  $(p &lt; 0.001)$ . This effect reflects a shift of approximately two-fifths of a standard deviation and reduces support for the more escalatory sanctions below a majority of respondents. However, the proxy treatment did not have any influence on the other two response outcomes. Though coefficients were negative in both cases, they were near zero and statistically insignificant. In other words, respondents who read that proxies conducted the hostilities were not less likely to support retaliatory attacks by the United States against the relevant foreign country, and they were not less likely to support a response directly described as escalatory.\nNext, I report the effects for the proxy treatment in each scenario across the three surveys. These effects are displayed in Figures 1 and 2. The former addresses the attribution outcomes and the latter shows the response outcomes.\nFor the attribution outcomes, the treatment effects point in a consistent direction that reflects the negative effect in the aggregated results. Regarding blame, respondents in the first and second surveys who read that the hacking attack was carried out by a Chinese private corporation were 0.22 ( $p &lt; 0.05$ ) and 0.10 ( $p &lt; 0.10$ ) less likely to attribute responsibility to the Chinese government compared to respondents in the military treatment. On the other hand, the coefficients for the Chinese state corporation were negative but statistically insignificant in both surveys. Relative to the military treatment in the Russia scenario, the private security treatment reduced blame directed at the Russian government by 0.15 ( $p &lt; 0.10$ ) in the first survey, by 0.18 ( $p &lt; 0.001$ ) in the second survey, and by 0.13 ( $p &lt; 0.05$ ) in the third survey. Finally, for the Iran scenario, the militia treatment decreased blame relative to the military treatment by 0.20\nWilliamson\n$(p &lt; 0.001)$ in the second survey, and it was negative but insignificant in the third survey.\nFor the ordered outcome, respondents on the second survey were less likely to believe the attack was carried out on orders of senior officials in the foreign government by 0.16 $(p &lt; 0.01)$ when exposed to the Chinese private corporation treatment. Again, however, the effect of the state corporation was negative but not statistically significant. For the second survey, the private security treatment reduced the Russian government's perceived role by 0.12 $(p &lt; 0.05)$, while the Iraqi militia treatment reduced the Iranian government's perceived role in ordering the attacks by 0.21 $(p &lt; 0.001)$. On the third survey, the Russia treatment lost significance but the Iran treatment continued to reduce the perceived role by 0.10 $(p &lt; 0.10)$.\nWhile there is some variation across the scenarios and surveys, these effects are consistent with the aggregate data. They suggest that individuals may be less likely to attribute responsibility to foreign governments that have denied involvement in an attack when that attack is conducted by proxies, and this pattern appears with different countries and different types of hostilities. However, the modest effect sizes also imply that delegating to proxies is unlikely to substantially transform public perceptions of blame in these scenarios. In terms of\nJournal of Conflict Resolution 68(2-3)\nvariation across the treatments, the Chinese state-run corporation effect was consistently insignificant and weaker than the others. Though the difference is small, it reflects the expectation that plausible deniability should be stronger when the proxies have more credible separation from the sponsoring state.\nFor the response outcomes shown in Figure 2, the results are generally consistent as well. Proxies strongly reduce support for sanctioning senior government officials but produce limited to no effects on attitudes toward retaliatory attacks that could escalate the conflict.\nRegarding the sanctions outcome, respondents in the proxy treatment groups were consistently less likely to prefer sanctions against senior government officials over more targeted sanctions against lower-level officials in the organization that conducted the attack. In contrast to the responsibility outcomes, this finding applied to both Chinese corporation treatments. In the first and second surveys, the Chinese private corporation reduced the preference for senior-level sanctions by  $12(p &lt; 0.001)$  and  $16(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points, while the state-run corporation reduced this preference by  $12(p &lt; 0.001)$  and  $14(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points. Likewise, the Russian security company reduced support for sanctioning senior officials by  $8(p &lt; 0.01)$  and  $10(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points in the first and second surveys. The effect for the Iraqi militia treatment was smaller, reducing support for sanctions on senior Iranian officials by approximately 4 percentage points  $(p &lt; 0.05)$ .\nFor the retaliate and escalate outcomes, however, the proxy treatment produced effects that were inconsistent in their direction and for the most part statistically insignificant. For retaliate, the Chinese state corporation treatment slightly increased\nFigure 2. Treatment effects for response outcomes. Note: Plot displays coefficients for treatment effects from surveys 1, 2, and 3, with effects estimated by OLS regression with control variables for age, gender, education, political interest, partisanship, foreign policy orientation, and region of residence.\nsupport for the hacking attack on the electrical grid of a Chinese city, though the effect was insignificant. The Chinese private corporation and the Russian security company produced very small, negative effects that failed to attain statistical significance. The Iraqi militia treatment slightly reduced support for bombing military targets in Iran, by 0.10 (p < 0.10). Respondents in the military treatments were split on whether the US government should pursue these retaliatory actions against the Chinese, Russian, and Iranian governments, with average responses of approximately 4 on the 7-point scale, and the proxy treatments had no discernible impact on these attitudes.\nThe third survey was intended to explore further the discrepancy between the sanction and retaliation outcomes by incorporating a new outcome question that asked respondents explicitly whether they wished the US government to deescalate, respond proportionally, or escalate (taking values of 0, 1, and 2 respectively). However, the proxy treatments also did not produce consistent effects on attitudes toward this escalate outcome. The Russian private security company did have a small, negative effect of 0.05 (p < 0.05) on the 3-point scale, compared to the Russian military treatment. On the other hand, the Iraqi militia returned a positive but insignificant effect compared to the Iranian military unit. In both scenarios, most respondents in the control group were split between preferring a deescalatory or proportional response: few wanted to escalate the conflict by striking back harder against the foreign country, and the proxy treatments did not have a substantial or consistent impact on these views.\nAs reported in the SI, the source identifying the involved actor -- whether US officials or journalists -- did not have a significant effect on the outcomes. In addition, the SI shows that effects of the proxy treatment did not vary consistently based on pre-existing attitudes toward China, Russia, and Iran.\n## Discussion\nThe results show a modest impact of the proxy treatments on respondents' attributions of blame and inconsistent effects on their views of how the US government should respond. Regarding the latter, respondents in the proxy treatments became less likely to prefer sanctioning senior government officials rather than individuals from the unit directly engaged in the hostilities; however, they did not become less likely to prefer retaliatory attacks against the foreign country, and they did not become less likely to support a response explicitly described as escalatory.\nTwo possible explanations may account for this divergence between the different response outcomes. One possibility is that delegation to proxies affects whom people prefer their governments to retaliate against, without necessarily affecting levels of support for the government to retaliate in some fashion. When forced to choose between the options of punishing senior government leaders or lower-level officials in the military unit or proxy organization, respondents in the proxy treatment groups were more likely to favor the latter. In other words, they preferred to retaliate against the proxy rather than the government itself. On the other hand, when confronted with outcomes that asked whether they would support retaliatory responses against the\nforeign country directly or not, without the option of targeting the proxy instead, their attitudes did not shift. This divergence could indicate that delegation may redirect pressure for retaliation toward the proxy, without necessarily limiting demands for the targeted government to respond in some way. In this case, using proxies could help to limit escalation risks, since public opinion preferring to retaliate against the proxy rather than the government should be less likely to trigger a spiral of intensifying conflict between the two adversaries.\nAnother possibility is that delegating to proxies may influence attitudes toward retaliatory options that are viewed as less risky, without shifting public opinion toward potentially costly responses involving direct attacks on powerful foreign adversaries. Sanctions are unlikely to trigger a major, destructive conflict between two countries, even if they deepen tensions. As a result, citizens in a targeted country may shift their views on the kinds of sanctions that are appropriate for responding to a provocation without needing to worry that their country will get dragged into a war. In this case, whether a proxy conducted the attack may influence the public's preferred response. With retaliation that involves significant cyber attacks or killing foreign soldiers, however, it becomes more probable that serious conflict could result. Citizens may have more entrenched views about whether it is worth risking such a conflict, such that their attitudes toward these forms of retaliation are less likely to shift due to a modest strengthening of plausible deniability that results from delegating to a proxy.\nThe article's theoretical framework suggests that delegating to proxies should reduce demands for retaliation by citizens in the targeted state because they are less likely to hold the adversarial government responsible for the attack. As expected, the proxy treatment did have an effect on respondents' attributions of blame for the hostile actions. However, the theoretical link breaks for the retaliate and escalate outcomes, since the proxy treatment did not affect support for these responses. As was just discussed, this discrepancy could be explained by respondents holding relatively entrenched views about the circumstances under which the US government should respond with violence to an adversarial state, with these attitudes unlikely to be affected by modest changes in perceptions of the foreign government's responsibility.\nDid the theoretical link hold for the sanctions outcome, with respondents in the proxy treatment less willing to sanction senior government officials because they blamed them less when the proxies conducted the attacks? Consistent with theoretical expectations, mediation analysis indicates that respondents' attributions of responsibility mediated approximately 14% of the proxy treatment's effects on preferences toward whom to sanction . However, this result also suggests the proxy treatment influenced the sanctions outcome through other mechanisms. One possibility is that respondents view the decision to use the proxy as a signal of the foreign government's desire to keep the conflict limited, so they become less willing to impose more punitive sanctions on that government's leadership in response. This mechanism could be explored in future research.\nEven if there is only a modest connection between how the public in a targeted country attributes responsibility for hostile actions and how they want their own\ngovernment to respond, attacking states may still benefit in other ways from relying on proxies to reduce their exposure to blame. It is likely that when a state is viewed as more responsible for an attack by its target's citizens, its reputation among the public in that country will decline. This declining reputation could have negative consequences for the public's willingness to engage or trade with the opposing state, resulting in political or economic costs for the attacker. As a result, states may still delegate to proxies in an effort to limit their exposure to blame for hostile actions, even if the primary motivation differs from trying to control escalation risks.\nAt the same time, the small magnitude of the effects on respondents' attributions of blame suggests that the use of proxies is unlikely to cause dramatic shifts in how people in targeted states think about responsibility for hostile acts. If a non-state actor is known to have strong ties to a foreign government, many people appear likely to assume that its activities are linked to its sponsor's goals and directives. However, it is possible the effect sizes represent a lower bound for how public opinion would react in real-world situations. First, the vignettes were designed to provide hard tests of the hypothesized relationships by relying on countries with authoritarian governments disliked by majorities of Americans. It is possible that delegating to proxies would have stronger effects when used by democracies or between states where citizens have more neutral views of the opposing governments. Second, it is plausible that the hypothetical -- and low-stakes -- nature of the vignettes made respondents less responsive to the treatments and more willing to record negative answers about countries they dislike. The vignettes were designed to reflect actual situations in which states have sought to obscure aspects of their foreign policies by delegating to proxies, and research comparing survey experiments to actual political attitudes suggests they do a reasonable job of generalizing to real political developments (e.g. Hainmueller et al. 2015). However, compared to real-world attacks, respondents may have felt less uncertainty about assigning blame to the foreign government in the survey.\nRegarding generalizability, the three scenarios produced relatively consistent results. The proxy treatments reduced attributions of blame and perceptions of high-level orders for the attacks with similarly-sized treatment effects for the three non-state actors in the China, Russia, and Iran incidents. The treatments also had similar effects on preferences toward sanctions, though the magnitude was smaller for Iran. One possible explanation for this difference is that sanctioning Iran had already been part of a prominent political debate for years by the time the surveys were implemented, resulting in more fixed attitudes on this question. Finally, for the retaliate and escalate outcomes, responses varied somewhat in their direction; however, the magnitudes were consistently small in all cases. These patterns suggest that how the public responds to attacks carried out by proxies may be relatively similar across different types of attacks and when linked to different sponsors.\nHowever, other issues of external validity suggest avenues for future research. First, the language used in the vignettes could be varied to create more or less contestation over responsibility. On the one hand, US officials or journalists could use softer language in their attributions, perhaps“suspecting” certain actors to be responsible for\nthe attack rather than “concluding” that they were. In certain cases, US officials may not even comment at all, and journalists or researchers may not have enough evidence to publish, leaving the public with little more than speculation about which foreign actor should be blamed. In these cases, the use of proxies may produce stronger plausible deniability. On the other hand, government officials or journalists could bring actual evidence to bear in their assertions of responsibility, while also directly calling into question the opposing government's denials of involvement, which could leave them more exposed to blame. Both approaches reflect real-world engagement around covert actions. Sometimes, both government and private sources tread cautiously in how they attribute responsibility. At other times, they release detailed reports along with evidence such as satellite imagery that are capable of shifting public opinion effectively . It seems plausible that public opinion would respond differently based on the kinds of language and arguments used by private and public actors to shape perceptions of responsibility for covert action, and future research could explore this variation. In addition, it may be the case that people in countries outside the United States would react differently to attacks by proxies, particularly if these countries have more or less trustworthy media environments and political leaders, or if they have different historical experiences with conflict. Future research could evaluate how the results generalize to other countries.",
    "## Conclusion": "Governments frequently rely on proxies to pursue their foreign policy objectives while maintaining plausible deniability of their involvement. This secrecy has been theorized to reduce risks of conflict escalation, in part by limiting domestic pressures on adversaries to retaliate. Yet, proxies often have well-documented and publicized ties to their sponsors, raising questions about the extent to which delegation to proxies can reduce escalation risks by shaping public opinion about responsibility for -- and responses to -- hostile acts.\nThe experiments discussed in this paper suggest that delegating to proxies can influence how people attribute responsibility for an attack on their country's interests, though the reported effect sizes are modest and imply that proxies may only strengthen plausible deniability on the margins. The modest effects could indicate that other factors will often provide stronger motives for governments to delegate to proxies, whether related to lower costs, their knowledge of local conditions, or signaling a lack of interest in escalation . Respondents in the proxy treatment were also substantially more supportive of limited sanctions rather than those targeting senior leadership of the sponsor government, indicating some effect on citizens' views of how their own government should respond to hostilities. These findings contribute to a growing literature on secrecy in international relations by implying that delegation can contribute modestly to plausible deniability while shaping preferences about whom to retaliate against, even in cases where proxies are closely controlled by their sponsors and the credibility of their independence should be relatively low. On the other hand,\nthe proxy treatment did not affect respondents' views of whether the US government should respond with more coercive and escalatory forms of retaliation, such as a major cyber attack on a Chinese city, killing Russian soldiers, or bombing targets in Iran. These null effects could result from respondents' holding more fixed attitudes about the contexts in which the United States should use force against adversarial states, with modest shifts in plausible deniability unlikely to change these views.",

    "## Notes\n1. Carson (2016) also argues that covert intervention reduces pressure from other allied states.\n2. Because covert activities are often not observed for some time by the citizens of the state pursuing them, they raise tricky problems for democratic governance (Spaniel and Poznansky 2018), though citizens of democracies do not appear to punish their government for pursuing foreign policy objectives secretly (Myrick 2019).\n3.

Delegating these actions to proxies is one strategy states use to retain plausible deniability and limit escalation risks. Yet, proxies often have strong ties to sponsoring states, raising questions about their ability to influence blame and demands for retaliation. This paper tests these effects by analyzing American responses to hypothetical attacks by Chinese, Russian, and Iranian actors through experiments administered on three surveys. The results show that using proxies for these attacks modestly reduced how much Americans blamed the respective foreign governments, while also limiting demands that their senior leadership be sanctioned. However, the use of proxies did not affect Americans' attitudes toward more forceful responses by the US government. These findings contribute to understanding of how proxies shape plausible deniability and escalation risks in international conflicts.\n# Keywords\nconflict management, domestic politics, foreign policy, interstate conflict\n$^{1}$ Department of Social and Political Sciences, Bocconi University, Milano, Italy\n# Corresponding Author:\nScott Williamson, Department of Social and Political Sciences, Bocconi University, Via Sarfatti, 25, Milano 20136, Italy.\nEmail: scott.williamson@unibocconi.it\nIntroduction\nIn February 2018, Syrian and Russian forces attacked an American outpost in Syria. The assault dragged on for more than four hours, during which hundreds of the attacking soldiers were killed. Despite fears the incident could trigger conflict between Russian and American forces in Syria, escalation did not occur. The Russian government quickly distanced itself from the attack by claiming they had no control over the soldiers, who were not part of the Russian military. Instead, they were employees of a private military company called the Wagner Group . This company has often served as a Russian proxy in conflicts where the government has not wished to involve itself openly, including in Libya, Ukraine, Venezuela, and Syria .\nCovert actions such as these are a common feature of international affairs, with states frequently attempting to disguise aspects of their foreign policies. Scholars have proposed that this emphasis on secrecy can contribute to stability within the international system by reducing the likelihood of conflict escalation . This advantage is thought to occur in part because adversaries who engage each other secretly should be less likely to trigger domestic pressures that push them to increase the scope of the conflict .\nDelegating to their non-state proxies is one strategy states use when trying to preserve secrecy around their involvement in hostile actions . In theory, the proxy's ability to claim independence from the chain of command can provide the state with more plausible deniability about their lack of responsibility. If this strategy is effective, it follows that public opinion in a targeted country should respond differently to denials of responsibility for hostile actions carried out by a state's proxies rather than its military or other security institutions. Specifically, this delegation should weaken attributions of blame against the attacking government while limiting demands for retaliation, thus mitigating pressures on the targeted government to respond. However, there are reasons to doubt whether proxies make deniability more plausible, since they frequently demonstrate strong ties to their patrons, which should undermine the credibility of claims that their decision-making is independent. Returning to the Russian Wagner Group, for example, the company's founder has a personal relationship with President Putin, and the company is known to receive funding, training, and equipment from the Russian military and intelligence apparatus . This relationship has become even more publicly apparent since the Russian invasion of Ukraine .\nTo date, there has been relatively little research on public opinion toward secrecy in international politics , including whether and how delegating hostile actions to proxies shapes public opinion. I evaluate whether this delegation can influence attributions of blame and demands for retaliation by implementing seven vignette experiments across three surveys of American adults. The vignettes address hypothetical attacks against US targets by Russian, Chinese, and\nIranian actors, with these countries' governments denying involvement in the attacks. Respondents are randomly assigned to read that the attackers were part of a military unit or proxy group tied to the foreign government, after which they assess responsibility for the incident and evaluate possible US responses. These countries were chosen not only because their governments rely frequently on covert action, but also because their authoritarian political systems and their unpopularity with the American public should create a hard test of the hypothesized relationships.\nThe results show that respondents become less likely to attribute responsibility to the adversarial governments when attacks were carried out by proxies. The effects are small, however, suggesting that the use of proxies with known ties to the sponsor may marginally strengthen a government's plausible deniability of involvement in an attack without substantially altering the extent to which citizens in the targeted state blame that government. The results also provide mixed support for the ability of covert action to mitigate demands for escalation. Respondents in the proxy treatment groups are substantially less likely to support sanctioning the senior leadership of the adversarial governments instead of subordinate individuals involved directly in the attacks, and this effect is partially mediated by the treatment's effects on respondents' attributions of blame. However, respondents are not less likely to support forceful, retaliatory attacks by the US government that would reflect a clear escalation of the conflict. One interpretation of these findings is that delegation to proxies may help reduce escalation risks by increasing the likelihood that the targeted public prefers to retaliate against the proxy itself, but is less likely to influence citizens' views on their government responding to hostilities with coercive and forceful forms of retaliation.\nThese findings contribute to international relations research on secrecy by providing experimental evidence that both reinforces and expands on existing theories about the effects of covert action and plausible deniability on conflict, insofar as they provide some evidence that acting covertly through proxies can reduce a government's exposure to blame and shape how citizens in a targeted country think about the appropriate response (e.g. Carnegie and Carson 2018; Carson 2016; Hedgecock and Sukin 2023; Joseph and Poznansky 2018). They also extend a nascent body of work on public opinion toward the role of non-state proxies in international politics (e.g. Plana 2020). In addition, by showing that authoritarian regimes can reduce their exposure to blame in international conflicts by delegating to non-state proxies, the findings contribute to a large literature on blame avoidance that has to date focused primarily on domestic politics and democratic political systems .\nThis article proceeds as follows. It first reviews literature on covert action and secrecy in international politics before outlining expectations about the effects of proxies on attributions of responsibility and demands for retaliation. It then discusses the selected cases and research design for the experiments, before presenting the results. The article concludes with a discussion of external validity and implications for international relations research.\n##\nSecrecy, Delegation, and Conflict Escalation\nSecrecy is a common feature of international politics , and a growing literature seeks to explain why states might attempt to conceal outcomes ranging from military alliances to the resolution of international legal disputes or crises . Covert action reflects one aspect of secrecy in the international system, whereby states attempt to obscure their involvement in hostile activities targeting another state or political entity. Well-known examples include the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba by US-backed Cuban exiles, or participation by Soviet pilots in the Korean War against the United States. As with these examples, covert operations or their outcomes tend to be visible publicly, and the objective is not to keep the acts themselves secret, but rather to conceal or create doubt about who was involved .\nThe identity of the responsible actor does not always stay secret to other states, whose governments often have the intelligence capacity to make reasonable determinations about who is behind an attack. Even so, the costs and risks associated with covert operations can prove useful by signaling resolve to the observing states . Furthermore, covert action is more likely to succeed at concealing the identity of the responsible actor from the public. As a result, states may rely on it to obscure aspects of their foreign policy that would damage their reputations domestically or abroad . For example, democracies may use covert action against other democracies to avoid domestic backlash for violating the expectation that they remain on good terms with democratic governments . Relatedly, governments may delegate violence against civilians to non-state actors to obscure their involvement from international audiences who would respond negatively to human rights violations .\nBy providing plausible deniability that conceals responsibility for hostile activities from the public, covert action has been theorized to help adversarial states reduce the risks of conflict escalation. Research indicates that political and military leaders are susceptible to pressure from public opinion when deciding whether and how to deploy military force . Keeping hostilities on the “backstage” and out of the public eye should help states to avoid pressures from hawkish domestic constituencies who wish to expand the scope of the conflict, while allowing states to signal to each other that they do not want to escalate . In other words, by obscuring their involvement, states may be able to limit escalation risks in part by decreasing the likelihood that citizens in the targeted country demand a response from their own government that would escalate the conflict. As an example of this mechanism in action, Carson (2018, 21) notes how Nazi Germany monitored foreign reactions to its involvement in the Spanish Civil War and “...carefully calibrated covert German combat participation in light of hawkish domestic sentiment in London and Paris.”\nBecause the point of covert action is to obscure the identity of the responsible actor, states often pursue these operations through their proxies, whether corporations, informal militias, or “volunteer” fighters. Research on blame attributions and accountability implies that this strategy of delegating to proxies should be effective at creating plausible deniability that influences perceptions of responsibility in the targeted state. People are more likely to believe an actor is responsible for an outcome when they have direct control over the decision-making process that produces the outcome . In cases where delegation occurs and multiple decision-makers are involved, clarity of responsibility is diminished and political actors are more capable of avoiding blame . Experimental research suggests these blame avoidance benefits can occur even when people know the delegator and delegatee share the same interests . In terms of international relations, proxies such as militias or corporations are entities separate from the state apparatus, and, at least in theory, they can make decisions more independently than a military or intelligence unit. This potential independence should make it harder for citizens in the targeted state to determine whether an action occurred because of directives from the sponsor or because of the proxy's own initiative. As a result, delegating to proxies should increase plausible deniability and help the sponsor to limit how much it is held responsible by citizens of the targeted state.\nAs noted in the literature on covert action, governments may benefit from this redirection of perceived responsibility for several reasons, including protecting their political support domestically and their soft power internationally if their involvement in the hostile acts would be viewed negatively . Of primary interest to this article is that shifting blame through covert operations may also help governments to reduce the likelihood of citizens in the targeted country demanding retaliation that escalates the conflict . The blame avoidance literature provides a framework for understanding why delegating to proxies could shape attitudes toward retaliation as well. Because blame helps people to identify who should be held accountable for a problematic outcome, those who limit their exposure to blame should face fewer demands that they be punished . Thus, if delegating to a proxy can reduce how many people in the targeted country blame the sponsoring state for a hostile action, it follows that these people may also become less likely to want their government to hold that state accountable by retaliating against it. In other words, using proxies to conduct covert actions could weaken domestic pressure on the targeted government to expand the conflict, which would reduce escalation risks by limiting incentives for political and military leaders to respond forcefully .\nFrom this theoretical framework, I expect the following when hostile actions are known to be conducted by a state's proxies rather than its own military forces. First, when a proxy is involved, I expect that respondents will be more likely to believe a foreign government's denials of responsibility -- i.e. they will blame the government less. Second, because respondents attribute less blame to the foreign government, I\nexpect that they will be less likely to support retaliation against that government as well.\nHowever, there are also reasons to expect that delegating to proxies may have little effect on attributions of responsibility or attitudes toward retaliation. First, proxies often lack credible separation from their sponsors. If the proxy is a domestic entity with legal status within the sponsoring country, it may be constrained in its ability to pursue foreign policy objectives that contradict those of the government. This limitation is especially likely to apply in authoritarian regimes, where the government controls most domestic organizations closely to ensure that they do not work against the authorities. Foreign proxies of a government might have more credible claims to independence, since they exist outside that government's legal and coercive apparatus. Nonetheless, in these cases, journalists and foreign governments often go to great lengths to publicize ties between the proxy and its sponsor. If people do not believe that the proxy has genuine independence to operate, they are unlikely to absolve the sponsoring state of blame.\nSecond, if citizens in the targeted state dislike the sponsor government intensely and are primed to distrust it, they may discount claims of separation from the proxy. This reaction may be particularly likely in contexts where two states have a history of poor relations -- i.e. the contexts in which hostile covert actions are most likely to be conducted. Finally, citizens of a targeted state may blame the sponsor of an attacking proxy for failing to control their proxy, even if the sponsors did not intend for the attack to happen.\n## Research Design\nTo test how covert action by proxies influences attributions of blame and demands for retaliation, I implemented seven vignette experiments across three surveys administered online in the United States. Experiments have become increasingly common in the international relations literature, and they are particularly useful for studying IR theories that involve public opinion  -- including issues of secrecy and covert action (e.g. Myrick 2019). The following sections provide further details about the design.\n### Samples\nThe first survey was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 1299 American adults recruited by the firm Lucid in April 2019. Each respondent read and answered outcome questions for two vignettes: one involving China, and the other involving Russia. The survey was designed with the expectations about delegation, blame, and escalation in mind but was exploratory and not pre-registered.\nThe second survey was pre-registered. I specified hypotheses and analyses that would indicate replication of findings from the first survey, and I expanded the experiment by adding additional outcome questions in line with the theoretical\nexpectations. This second survey was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 3053 respondents recruited by Lucid in March 2021. Each respondent on the second survey saw the same China and Russia vignettes used on the first survey. In addition, they also read and responded to questions about a vignette involving Iran.\nThe third survey was intended to provide an additional replication check, while also facilitating exploratory analysis of patterns identified in the second survey. It was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 2007 American adults recruited by Lucid in May 2021. This survey used the Russia and Iran vignettes but dropped the China vignette due to time constraints. All three surveys were representative on age, gender, income, ethnicity, and US region. Summary statistics can be found in the SI.\n### Case Selection\nI chose to center my vignettes around hostile actions attributed to Chinese, Russian, and Iranian actors. These three cases are useful for several reasons. The first is that all three countries are relatively unpopular in the United States due to a history of adversarial relations. My survey data highlights these unfavorable perceptions among American adults. In the first survey in 2019, 15% of respondents reported a favorable view of Russia and 16% said the same about China. In the second survey in 2021, only 25% of respondents said they had a favorable view of China, 20% reported a favorable view of Russia, and 11% claimed to have a favorable view of Iran. These negative attitudes should make it less likely that respondents would give these governments the benefit of the doubt when they deny involvement in hostile actions carried out by their proxies. The second reason is that all three countries are governed by authoritarian regimes. China's government operates a massive surveillance state that exercises extensive control over the population. Russia and Iran also control their societies closely. These political systems make it less likely that proxy groups are operating independently of the authorities, which should reduce the credibility of delegation and make it less likely that people believe that the proxy's sponsor was not involved. These first two reasons suggest the countries provide a hard test of the hypothesized effects.\nFinally, the third reason is that all three countries regularly engage in covert action to advance their foreign policy objectives, and they frequently do so by delegating to non-state proxies that are believed to provide a degree of plausible deniability. As such, the survey vignettes should be highly relevant to real-world events. In the following paragraphs, I briefly discuss examples from each case.\nChina: As cyber activities have become increasingly important for global politics, China has invested heavily in its cyber capabilities to gather political and economic intelligence . The Chinese government has used a variety of actors to conduct cyberattacks, including military personnel. In 2020, the US government charged four members of the People's Liberation Army for hacking the credit agency Equifax and acquiring data on tens of millions of Americans (US Department of Justice 2020). This case reflected a long history of Chinese state hackers conducting economic espionage against American corporations . At the same time, the\ngovernment also works through proxies, including Chinese corporations and hacking groups. Chinese technology companies such as Huawei have been linked to espionage, with their equipment used to facilitate cyber intrusions , monitor the domestic population , and process stolen data . Chinese security officers have also established front companies to conduct cyberattacks. In a criminal case against four Chinese citizens accused of economic espionage, the US government alleged that the individuals were Chinese security officials in a provincial branch of the Ministry of State Security (MSS) who had “sought to obfuscate the Chinese government's role in such theft by establishing a front company, Hainan Xiandun Technology Department Co. Ltd” (US Department of Justice 2021).\nSeveral hacking groups have also been identified as proxies conducting cyberattacks on behalf of the Chinese government. An attack on Microsoft Exchange in 2021 was attributed to a group given the name Hafnium, which has been linked to the MSS by Western governments . Another operation, known as Cloud Hopper, was attributed to the group APT10, which has also been connected to the MSS . While Western governments have attributed responsibility for the actions of these groups to the Chinese government, some ambiguity remains about the nature of the relationship. For instance, there is evidence that APT10 has also conducted cyberattacks to steal information for personal gain, raising questions about whether the group “enjoys protections that enable it to conduct its own for-profit activities” or “has simply evaded scrutiny from Chinese authorities” .\nRussia: The Russian government has made extensive use of proxies to achieve its foreign policy objectives. In Ukraine, prior to the invasion of 2022, it encouraged and then supported separatist groups in their attempts to establish independent states tied closely to Russia (International Crisis Group 2019), a tactic it has used to expand its influence in other countries including Georgia and Moldova . Russia has also increasingly turned to private military companies to advance its interests abroad , the most well-known of which is the Wagner Group that has already been mentioned. These organizations have participated in conflicts in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe, receiving private gains while also extending Russia's influence. In Sudan, the Wagner Group was deployed in 2017 to help repress uprisings against Omar Al-Bashir. As payment, the company's owner was given exclusive rights to mine gold in the country, and the Russian government was later offered a naval base on the Red Sea before Al-Bashir was overthrown in 2019 . These companies exist in a legal gray area under Russian law and are technically separate from the state, even as they are owned and directed by individuals with close ties to President Putin and the security elite .\nWhile the connections are clear between Moscow and the proxies discussed above, debate has continued about how closely the Russian government controls them. Regarding private military companies like the Wagner Group, the extent to which they are “simply patriotic volunteers as the Kremlin claims...on official assignment for Russia's GRU intelligence service...mercenaries, corporate warriors, or frontline\nsoldiers” remains unclear . All of these identities may be true at different moments, fostering uncertainty about their role in specific conflicts or time periods. Analysts have argued that this ambiguity provides enough plausible deniability to help Russia avoid accountability for human rights violations and limit escalation risks in the conflicts in which these organizations are involved .\nIran: The use of proxy groups to extend its influence in the Middle East has been a central component of Iran's foreign policy for decades. The Iranian government maintains close ties with militant organizations and political movements in countries including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine, Pakistan, Syria, and Yemen . These organizations have received financial support, weapons, and training from Iran and often work closely with the Revolutionary Guard to advance the country's regional interests. They include Hezbollah in Lebanon, which operates a successful political party and a well-armed militia that has fought alongside the Syrian and Iranian governments in the Syrian civil war. They also include several militias in Iraq that have a formal relationship with the Iraqi armed forces , such as Kata'ib Hizballah, Asaib Ahl Al-Haq, and Harakat Hezbollah Al-Nujaba . These groups participate openly in the political system, where they have worked to pull Iraq closer to Iran, and they have also taken part in armed attacks on US and Saudi targets .\nDespite their close ties to Iran, most of these groups have their own domestic political interests and are not controlled fully from Tehran. In Yemen, Iranian support for the Houthis does not outweigh the group's own interests in fighting its domestic opponents and their international backers . While Iran does at times exercise direct influence over the decision-making of Hezbollah in Lebanon, its influence is usually indirect and decisions are made by Hezbollah's leaders . Likewise, the Iranian-aligned militias in Iraq are involved in Iraqi politics and frequently pursue their own political interests . Though they coordinate militant activities closely with Iran's Revolutionary Guard, they are not entirely beholden to them and often act independently. For example, the failed assassination attempt against Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi in 2021 was suspected to have been carried out by one of the Iranian-aligned militias without approval from Iran . In addition, the militias have often attacked US forces even at moments when Iran is attempting to deescalate relations with the United States . The fact that these groups will act in their own interest can create ambiguity about the extent of Iranian involvement.\n### Vignettes\nFor each vignette in my surveys, respondents were provided with information about an attack linked to an adversarial foreign power against US interests. All details of the situation were held constant, except for the identity of the organization alleged to have carried out the attack. Respondents were told that the vignettes were hypothetical to\nensure no deception about events that could cause anger toward a foreign country. However, the content of the vignettes was selected to reflect real-world political developments discussed in the cases above. Respondents were told that the actor involved in the attack had been identified, and the attacker was randomized to be a military unit or proxy of the foreign government. The vignettes always noted that the relevant foreign government had denied foreknowledge of the attack and blamed it on a rogue operation. Because I am interested in how delegation to proxies affects public opinion by giving the government greater plausible deniability or not, it was important to be clear that the foreign government had denied involvement across the treatment groups. These scenarios reflect real-world use of covert action, where the attack is usually observed by everyone, there are attempts by government officials, journalists, and researchers to figure out who was directly involved, and the government on which the most suspicion is cast publicly denies responsibility.\nIn the first survey, the identity of the attacking organization was said to be determined by US officials. In the second and third surveys, I randomized whether the identity was determined by US officials or journalists. I included this additional randomization to account for the possibility that the source of information would shape responses to the proxy versus military treatments. It is possible that respondents would perceive US officials attributing blame to a proxy rather than the military as a signal that the US government did not wish to escalate the conflict, rather than as an objective statement about who was directly involved in the attack. In this case, respondents might attribute less blame to the foreign government and demand less escalation not because they believed the foreign government was less directly involved, but because they trusted the US government had good reasons to avoid escalation. However, I do not find any meaningful or consistent differences based on this randomization.\nThe China vignette discussed a cyberattack that stole valuable technology from a US company. The vignette randomized whether the attack was attributed to a Chinese military unit, private corporation, or state-run corporation. The state-run corporation should create less plausible deniability than the private corporation; however, its distance from the chain of command could strengthen that plausibility relative to the military unit. As discussed above, Chinese hackers linked to both state institutions and private companies have previously stolen sensitive technologies from American companies .\nThe Russia vignette involved an attack on US soldiers in Syria by Russian forces. The attack was attributed either to soldiers in a Russian military unit or a Russian private military company. Throughout the Syrian civil war, American soldiers have been involved in clashes with Russian military forces but also members of the private Russian military companies that are used as proxy forces .\nFinally, the Iran vignette detailed an attack on US forces in Iraq by actors linked to Iran. Respondents were randomly assigned to read that the attack was connected to an Iranian military unit or an Iraqi militia with ties to Iran. These incidents have also occurred frequently since the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. As noted above, the attacks are often linked to Iranian-sponsored militias , but Iranian forces have been involved directly as well .\nThe full text of the vignettes are below:China Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that a Chinese (military unit/state-owned corporation/private corporation) was behind a major cyber attack on a US energy company, in which hackers stole valuable technological plans for a new renewable energy source. The Chinese government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on a rogue operation by hackers in the (military unit/state-owned corporation/private corporation).Russia Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that soldiers from a Russian (military unit/private security company) were behind an attack on US forces in Syria that killed two American soldiers. The Russian government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on officers in the (military unit/private security company) on the ground in Syria.Iran Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that soldiers from (an Iranian military unit/an Iraqi militia with ties to Iran) were behind a rocket attack on US forces in Iraq that killed two American soldiers. The Iranian government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on rogue officers in the (military unit/militia) in Iraq.\nAll randomizations within each scenario occurred with equal probability. Balance tests are reported in the SI.\nAn important motive for using multiple scenarios was to assess whether the effects of delegating to proxies would generalize to different situations in which covert action is commonly used. The scenarios reflect different types of attacks (cyber vs kinetic), different foreign governments (China, Russia, and Iran), and different proxies (corporations and militias). My expectation was that delegation would have similar effects across the scenarios, as the theoretical logic -- more credible independence of the proxy reducing attributions of blame and therefore demands for retaliation -- should apply even as the specific details vary. However, it is possible that these different scenarios would produce variation in responses. For example, cyber attacks may affect public opinion differently than kinetic attacks by limiting demands for forceful retaliation (e.g. Kreps and Schneider 2019). I explore generalizability further while discussing the results.\nOutcomes\nFollowing each vignette, respondents were asked outcome questions to assess their attributions of responsibility for the attacks and their views about how the US government should respond.\nRegarding responsibility, respondents on all three surveys were asked if the foreign governments should be blamed for the attacks. The question was worded “Do you agree or disagree that the [relevant] government should be blamed for this attack?” On the second and third surveys, respondents were also asked about who had ordered the attack, with the question “Do you think it is likely or unlikely senior officials in the [relevant] government ordered this attack?” This question provided a more direct assessment of whether respondents believed high-level officials were directly involved in -- and therefore responsible for -- the action. Answers for both questions ranged from strongly agree to strongly disagree on a 7 point Likert scale, with stronger attributions of responsibility coded as higher values. If respondents in the proxy treatment groups became less likely to blame the foreign governments and less likely to believe they ordered the attacks, it would provide support for the expectation that delegating to proxies can strengthen plausible deniability and help governments avoid blame in targeted states.\nRegarding the US response, respondents on the first and second surveys were asked if the US government should pursue targeted sanctions against the lower-level officials in the relevant proxies or military units, or if the US government should implement sanctions against senior officials in the respective governments. The question was worded as follows: “The US government is deciding how to respond to the attack. Which option do you see as a more appropriate response?” Respondents could then choose that “The US government responds by sanctioning the officers in charge of the [military unit/corporation/militia] or that “The US government responds by sanctioning senior officials in the [relevant] government. This latter option would be more likely to escalate conflict and deepen tensions between the two countries, since it reflects a direct attempt to punish the most important decision-makers in the foreign state. For example, the Chinese government responded angrily to US sanctions on senior Chinese officials over its Hong Kong policies . In other words, respondents were forced to choose between a response that would hold accountable only those individuals involved directly in the event, or a stronger, more escalatory response that would hold accountable the top levels of the foreign government.\nOn the second survey, respondents were also asked if they would support US retaliation involving attacks on the respective countries, with answers ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree on a 7 point Likert scale. The first part of the question stated that “The US government is also deciding whether to retaliate by...” The remainder of the question specified actions including a “hacking attack that cuts off electricity to a major Chinese city” for the Chinese vignette, an attack “targeting several Russian soldiers in Syria” for the Russia vignette, and “bombing military targets in Iran” for the Iran vignette. In each case, the proposed US response was designed to\nappear escalatory. Cutting power to a major Chinese city would reflect an escalation over stealing technology; killing “several” Russian soldiers implies a higher cost on Russia than the two US soldiers killed; and bombing Iran would reflect an escalation from the tit-for-tat conflict between the two countries in Iraq.\nOne possible limitation of the second question is that respondents were not asked directly whether they would prefer to escalate, and some respondents may not have viewed the retaliatory options as escalatory. As a result, for the Iran and Russia vignettes included on the third survey, I used an outcome question designed to follow up on patterns identified in the first and second surveys by asking respondents directly about their attitudes toward escalation. The question stated that “The US government is deciding how to respond to the attack. Which option do you see as the most appropriate response?” Respondents could then choose between three options: that the US government “decides to deescalate by not targeting any [relevant government] soldiers,” that the US government “decides to respond proportionally by targeting and killing two [relevant government] soldiers, or that the US government “decides to escalate by targeting and killing twenty [relevant government] soldiers.” Because time was more limited on the third survey, I was unable to include the other two outcome questions about how the US government should respond to the attack.\nIf respondents in the proxy treatment group became more likely to prefer targeted sanctions, less likely to support a retaliatory attack, and less likely to approve explicitly of escalation, it would be consistent with delegation to proxies reducing pressure on the targeted government to escalate the conflict.\nTable 1 reports the mean and standard deviation for each outcome measure. It also illustrates which questions were asked for which country vignette on which surveys. In general, respondents are somewhat likely to blame the foreign government for the attacks and to believe that senior officials ordered them. Regarding the sanction outcome, respondents tend to be roughly split on whether sanctions should target higher-level authorities or the specific individuals involved in the attacks. Support for retaliating with force is lower, with respondents neutral on average about the retaliatory attack outcome, and with respondents mostly split between the US government either deescalating or responding proportionally -- but not escalating -- for the escalation outcome.\n## Results\nI use two approaches to report treatment effects. First, I aggregate data across the three scenarios on the three surveys, creating a single proxy treatment indicator for respondents assigned to the Chinese corporation, Russian private security company, or Iranian-aligned Iraqi militia treatments in each of the experiments. I use OLS to regress the outcomes on the proxy treatment. Dummy variables for the scenarios are included to account for different baseline responses in the military conditions, and I cluster standard errors by respondent, since each respondent completed more than one scenario on the same survey .

Second, I then provide treatment effects for each of the scenarios on each survey to assess consistency. These effects are also analyzed with OLS regression, using models that control for age, gender, education, political interest, partisanship, foreign policy orientation, and region of residence. These controls were also pre-registered. They are relevant to foreign policy attitudes, are correlated with the outcomes, and were measured pre-treatment, so they can help to increase precision . Results without control variables are consistent and are reported in the SI.\nTable 2 reports main effects for the proxy treatment in the aggregated data. The first two columns show results for the outcomes related to attributions of responsibility, with the first showing the effect of the treatment on perceptions that the foreign government should be blamed for the attack, and the second showing the effect on beliefs that senior officials in the foreign government ordered the attack. For both outcomes, assignment to the proxy treatment reduces attributions of responsibility by 0.14 on the seven point scale  $(p &lt; 0.001)$ . This effect is equivalent to a shift of approximately one-tenth of a standard deviation, indicating a modest impact on how respondents attribute responsibility for the hostilities. This small decrease occurred from relatively high levels of blame directed at the foreign government in the military treatments, where the\nJournal of Conflict Resolution 68(2-3)\nTable 2.

The effect of the proxy treatment on the sanctions outcome is substantively large. Respondents assigned to the proxy groups are 9 percentage points less likely to prefer sanctioning senior government officials over officials in the specific unit involved in the attack  $(p &lt; 0.001)$ . This effect reflects a shift of approximately two-fifths of a standard deviation and reduces support for the more escalatory sanctions below a majority of respondents. However, the proxy treatment did not have any influence on the other two response outcomes. Though coefficients were negative in both cases, they were near zero and statistically insignificant. In other words, respondents who read that proxies conducted the hostilities were not less likely to support retaliatory attacks by the United States against the relevant foreign country, and they were not less likely to support a response directly described as escalatory.\nNext, I report the effects for the proxy treatment in each scenario across the three surveys. These effects are displayed in Figures 1 and 2. The former addresses the attribution outcomes and the latter shows the response outcomes.\nFor the attribution outcomes, the treatment effects point in a consistent direction that reflects the negative effect in the aggregated results. Regarding blame, respondents in the first and second surveys who read that the hacking attack was carried out by a Chinese private corporation were 0.22 ( $p &lt; 0.05$ ) and 0.10 ( $p &lt; 0.10$ ) less likely to attribute responsibility to the Chinese government compared to respondents in the military treatment. On the other hand, the coefficients for the Chinese state corporation were negative but statistically insignificant in both surveys. Relative to the military treatment in the Russia scenario, the private security treatment reduced blame directed at the Russian government by 0.15 ( $p &lt; 0.10$ ) in the first survey, by 0.18 ( $p &lt; 0.001$ ) in the second survey, and by 0.13 ( $p &lt; 0.05$ ) in the third survey. Finally, for the Iran scenario, the militia treatment decreased blame relative to the military treatment by 0.20\nWilliamson\n\n$(p &lt; 0.001)$ in the second survey, and it was negative but insignificant in the third survey.\nFor the ordered outcome, respondents on the second survey were less likely to believe the attack was carried out on orders of senior officials in the foreign government by 0.16 $(p &lt; 0.01)$ when exposed to the Chinese private corporation treatment. Again, however, the effect of the state corporation was negative but not statistically significant. For the second survey, the private security treatment reduced the Russian government's perceived role by 0.12 $(p &lt; 0.05)$, while the Iraqi militia treatment reduced the Iranian government's perceived role in ordering the attacks by 0.21 $(p &lt; 0.001)$. On the third survey, the Russia treatment lost significance but the Iran treatment continued to reduce the perceived role by 0.10 $(p &lt; 0.10)$.\nWhile there is some variation across the scenarios and surveys, these effects are consistent with the aggregate data. They suggest that individuals may be less likely to attribute responsibility to foreign governments that have denied involvement in an attack when that attack is conducted by proxies, and this pattern appears with different countries and different types of hostilities. However, the modest effect sizes also imply that delegating to proxies is unlikely to substantially transform public perceptions of blame in these scenarios. In terms of\nJournal of Conflict Resolution 68(2-3)\nvariation across the treatments, the Chinese state-run corporation effect was consistently insignificant and weaker than the others. Though the difference is small, it reflects the expectation that plausible deniability should be stronger when the proxies have more credible separation from the sponsoring state.\nFor the response outcomes shown in Figure 2, the results are generally consistent as well. Proxies strongly reduce support for sanctioning senior government officials but produce limited to no effects on attitudes toward retaliatory attacks that could escalate the conflict.\nRegarding the sanctions outcome, respondents in the proxy treatment groups were consistently less likely to prefer sanctions against senior government officials over more targeted sanctions against lower-level officials in the organization that conducted the attack. In contrast to the responsibility outcomes, this finding applied to both Chinese corporation treatments. In the first and second surveys, the Chinese private corporation reduced the preference for senior-level sanctions by  $12(p &lt; 0.001)$  and  $16(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points, while the state-run corporation reduced this preference by  $12(p &lt; 0.001)$  and  $14(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points. Likewise, the Russian security company reduced support for sanctioning senior officials by  $8(p &lt; 0.01)$  and  $10(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points in the first and second surveys. The effect for the Iraqi militia treatment was smaller, reducing support for sanctions on senior Iranian officials by approximately 4 percentage points  $(p &lt; 0.05)$ .\nFor the retaliate and escalate outcomes, however, the proxy treatment produced effects that were inconsistent in their direction and for the most part statistically insignificant. For retaliate, the Chinese state corporation treatment slightly increased\nFigure 2. Treatment effects for response outcomes. Note: Plot displays coefficients for treatment effects from surveys 1, 2, and 3, with effects estimated by OLS regression with control variables for age, gender, education, political interest, partisanship, foreign policy orientation, and region of residence.\nsupport for the hacking attack on the electrical grid of a Chinese city, though the effect was insignificant. The Chinese private corporation and the Russian security company produced very small, negative effects that failed to attain statistical significance. The Iraqi militia treatment slightly reduced support for bombing military targets in Iran, by 0.10 (p < 0.10). Respondents in the military treatments were split on whether the US government should pursue these retaliatory actions against the Chinese, Russian, and Iranian governments, with average responses of approximately 4 on the 7-point scale, and the proxy treatments had no discernible impact on these attitudes.\nThe third survey was intended to explore further the discrepancy between the sanction and retaliation outcomes by incorporating a new outcome question that asked respondents explicitly whether they wished the US government to deescalate, respond proportionally, or escalate (taking values of 0, 1, and 2 respectively). However, the proxy treatments also did not produce consistent effects on attitudes toward this escalate outcome. The Russian private security company did have a small, negative effect of 0.05 (p < 0.05) on the 3-point scale, compared to the Russian military treatment. On the other hand, the Iraqi militia returned a positive but insignificant effect compared to the Iranian military unit. In both scenarios, most respondents in the control group were split between preferring a deescalatory or proportional response: few wanted to escalate the conflict by striking back harder against the foreign country, and the proxy treatments did not have a substantial or consistent impact on these views.\nAs reported in the SI, the source identifying the involved actor -- whether US officials or journalists -- did not have a significant effect on the outcomes. In addition, the SI shows that effects of the proxy treatment did not vary consistently based on pre-existing attitudes toward China, Russia, and Iran.\n## Discussion\nThe results show a modest impact of the proxy treatments on respondents' attributions of blame and inconsistent effects on their views of how the US government should respond. Regarding the latter, respondents in the proxy treatments became less likely to prefer sanctioning senior government officials rather than individuals from the unit directly engaged in the hostilities; however, they did not become less likely to prefer retaliatory attacks against the foreign country, and they did not become less likely to support a response explicitly described as escalatory.\nTwo possible explanations may account for this divergence between the different response outcomes. One possibility is that delegation to proxies affects whom people prefer their governments to retaliate against, without necessarily affecting levels of support for the government to retaliate in some fashion. When forced to choose between the options of punishing senior government leaders or lower-level officials in the military unit or proxy organization, respondents in the proxy treatment groups were more likely to favor the latter. In other words, they preferred to retaliate against the proxy rather than the government itself. On the other hand, when confronted with outcomes that asked whether they would support retaliatory responses against the\nforeign country directly or not, without the option of targeting the proxy instead, their attitudes did not shift. This divergence could indicate that delegation may redirect pressure for retaliation toward the proxy, without necessarily limiting demands for the targeted government to respond in some way. In this case, using proxies could help to limit escalation risks, since public opinion preferring to retaliate against the proxy rather than the government should be less likely to trigger a spiral of intensifying conflict between the two adversaries.\nAnother possibility is that delegating to proxies may influence attitudes toward retaliatory options that are viewed as less risky, without shifting public opinion toward potentially costly responses involving direct attacks on powerful foreign adversaries. Sanctions are unlikely to trigger a major, destructive conflict between two countries, even if they deepen tensions. As a result, citizens in a targeted country may shift their views on the kinds of sanctions that are appropriate for responding to a provocation without needing to worry that their country will get dragged into a war. In this case, whether a proxy conducted the attack may influence the public's preferred response. With retaliation that involves significant cyber attacks or killing foreign soldiers, however, it becomes more probable that serious conflict could result. Citizens may have more entrenched views about whether it is worth risking such a conflict, such that their attitudes toward these forms of retaliation are less likely to shift due to a modest strengthening of plausible deniability that results from delegating to a proxy.\nThe article's theoretical framework suggests that delegating to proxies should reduce demands for retaliation by citizens in the targeted state because they are less likely to hold the adversarial government responsible for the attack. As expected, the proxy treatment did have an effect on respondents' attributions of blame for the hostile actions. However, the theoretical link breaks for the retaliate and escalate outcomes, since the proxy treatment did not affect support for these responses. As was just discussed, this discrepancy could be explained by respondents holding relatively entrenched views about the circumstances under which the US government should respond with violence to an adversarial state, with these attitudes unlikely to be affected by modest changes in perceptions of the foreign government's responsibility.\nDid the theoretical link hold for the sanctions outcome, with respondents in the proxy treatment less willing to sanction senior government officials because they blamed them less when the proxies conducted the attacks? Consistent with theoretical expectations, mediation analysis indicates that respondents' attributions of responsibility mediated approximately 14% of the proxy treatment's effects on preferences toward whom to sanction . However, this result also suggests the proxy treatment influenced the sanctions outcome through other mechanisms. One possibility is that respondents view the decision to use the proxy as a signal of the foreign government's desire to keep the conflict limited, so they become less willing to impose more punitive sanctions on that government's leadership in response. This mechanism could be explored in future research.\nEven if there is only a modest connection between how the public in a targeted country attributes responsibility for hostile actions and how they want their own\ngovernment to respond, attacking states may still benefit in other ways from relying on proxies to reduce their exposure to blame. It is likely that when a state is viewed as more responsible for an attack by its target's citizens, its reputation among the public in that country will decline. This declining reputation could have negative consequences for the public's willingness to engage or trade with the opposing state, resulting in political or economic costs for the attacker. As a result, states may still delegate to proxies in an effort to limit their exposure to blame for hostile actions, even if the primary motivation differs from trying to control escalation risks.\nAt the same time, the small magnitude of the effects on respondents' attributions of blame suggests that the use of proxies is unlikely to cause dramatic shifts in how people in targeted states think about responsibility for hostile acts. If a non-state actor is known to have strong ties to a foreign government, many people appear likely to assume that its activities are linked to its sponsor's goals and directives. However, it is possible the effect sizes represent a lower bound for how public opinion would react in real-world situations. First, the vignettes were designed to provide hard tests of the hypothesized relationships by relying on countries with authoritarian governments disliked by majorities of Americans. It is possible that delegating to proxies would have stronger effects when used by democracies or between states where citizens have more neutral views of the opposing governments. Second, it is plausible that the hypothetical -- and low-stakes -- nature of the vignettes made respondents less responsive to the treatments and more willing to record negative answers about countries they dislike. The vignettes were designed to reflect actual situations in which states have sought to obscure aspects of their foreign policies by delegating to proxies, and research comparing survey experiments to actual political attitudes suggests they do a reasonable job of generalizing to real political developments (e.g. Hainmueller et al. 2015). However, compared to real-world attacks, respondents may have felt less uncertainty about assigning blame to the foreign government in the survey.\nRegarding generalizability, the three scenarios produced relatively consistent results. The proxy treatments reduced attributions of blame and perceptions of high-level orders for the attacks with similarly-sized treatment effects for the three non-state actors in the China, Russia, and Iran incidents. The treatments also had similar effects on preferences toward sanctions, though the magnitude was smaller for Iran. One possible explanation for this difference is that sanctioning Iran had already been part of a prominent political debate for years by the time the surveys were implemented, resulting in more fixed attitudes on this question. Finally, for the retaliate and escalate outcomes, responses varied somewhat in their direction; however, the magnitudes were consistently small in all cases. These patterns suggest that how the public responds to attacks carried out by proxies may be relatively similar across different types of attacks and when linked to different sponsors.\nHowever, other issues of external validity suggest avenues for future research. First, the language used in the vignettes could be varied to create more or less contestation over responsibility. On the one hand, US officials or journalists could use softer language in their attributions, perhaps“suspecting” certain actors to be responsible for\nthe attack rather than “concluding” that they were. In certain cases, US officials may not even comment at all, and journalists or researchers may not have enough evidence to publish, leaving the public with little more than speculation about which foreign actor should be blamed. In these cases, the use of proxies may produce stronger plausible deniability. On the other hand, government officials or journalists could bring actual evidence to bear in their assertions of responsibility, while also directly calling into question the opposing government's denials of involvement, which could leave them more exposed to blame. Both approaches reflect real-world engagement around covert actions. Sometimes, both government and private sources tread cautiously in how they attribute responsibility. At other times, they release detailed reports along with evidence such as satellite imagery that are capable of shifting public opinion effectively . It seems plausible that public opinion would respond differently based on the kinds of language and arguments used by private and public actors to shape perceptions of responsibility for covert action, and future research could explore this variation. In addition, it may be the case that people in countries outside the United States would react differently to attacks by proxies, particularly if these countries have more or less trustworthy media environments and political leaders, or if they have different historical experiences with conflict. Future research could evaluate how the results generalize to other countries.\n## Conclusion\nGovernments frequently rely on proxies to pursue their foreign policy objectives while maintaining plausible deniability of their involvement. This secrecy has been theorized to reduce risks of conflict escalation, in part by limiting domestic pressures on adversaries to retaliate. Yet, proxies often have well-documented and publicized ties to their sponsors, raising questions about the extent to which delegation to proxies can reduce escalation risks by shaping public opinion about responsibility for -- and responses to -- hostile acts.\nThe experiments discussed in this paper suggest that delegating to proxies can influence how people attribute responsibility for an attack on their country's interests, though the reported effect sizes are modest and imply that proxies may only strengthen plausible deniability on the margins. The modest effects could indicate that other factors will often provide stronger motives for governments to delegate to proxies, whether related to lower costs, their knowledge of local conditions, or signaling a lack of interest in escalation . Respondents in the proxy treatment were also substantially more supportive of limited sanctions rather than those targeting senior leadership of the sponsor government, indicating some effect on citizens' views of how their own government should respond to hostilities. These findings contribute to a growing literature on secrecy in international relations by implying that delegation can contribute modestly to plausible deniability while shaping preferences about whom to retaliate against, even in cases where proxies are closely controlled by their sponsors and the credibility of their independence should be relatively low. On the other hand,\nthe proxy treatment did not affect respondents' views of whether the US government should respond with more coercive and escalatory forms of retaliation, such as a major cyber attack on a Chinese city, killing Russian soldiers, or bombing targets in Iran. These null effects could result from respondents' holding more fixed attitudes about the contexts in which the United States should use force against adversarial states, with modest shifts in plausible deniability unlikely to change these views.\n## Acknowledgements\nI thank Bridging the Gap's New Era Workshop for motivating the project.

Delegating these actions to proxies is one strategy states use to retain plausible deniability and limit escalation risks. Yet, proxies often have strong ties to sponsoring states, raising questions about their ability to influence blame and demands for retaliation. This paper tests these effects by analyzing American responses to hypothetical attacks by Chinese, Russian, and Iranian actors through experiments administered on three surveys. The results show that using proxies for these attacks modestly reduced how much Americans blamed the respective foreign governments, while also limiting demands that their senior leadership be sanctioned. However, the use of proxies did not affect Americans' attitudes toward more forceful responses by the US government. These findings contribute to understanding of how proxies shape plausible deniability and escalation risks in international conflicts.\n# Keywords\nconflict management, domestic politics, foreign policy, interstate conflict\n$^{1}$ Department of Social and Political Sciences, Bocconi University, Milano, Italy\n# Corresponding Author:\nScott Williamson, Department of Social and Political Sciences, Bocconi University, Via Sarfatti, 25, Milano 20136, Italy.\nEmail: scott.williamson@unibocconi.it\nIntroduction\nIn February 2018, Syrian and Russian forces attacked an American outpost in Syria. The assault dragged on for more than four hours, during which hundreds of the attacking soldiers were killed. Despite fears the incident could trigger conflict between Russian and American forces in Syria, escalation did not occur. The Russian government quickly distanced itself from the attack by claiming they had no control over the soldiers, who were not part of the Russian military. Instead, they were employees of a private military company called the Wagner Group (Gibbons-Neff 2018). This company has often served as a Russian proxy in conflicts where the government has not wished to involve itself openly, including in Libya, Ukraine, Venezuela, and Syria (Rabin 2019).\nCovert actions such as these are a common feature of international affairs, with states frequently attempting to disguise aspects of their foreign policies. Scholars have proposed that this emphasis on secrecy can contribute to stability within the international system by reducing the likelihood of conflict escalation (Carnegie and Carson 2018; Carson 2016; Joseph and Poznansky 2018; Yarhi-Milo 2013). This advantage is thought to occur in part because adversaries who engage each other secretly should be less likely to trigger domestic pressures that push them to increase the scope of the conflict (Carson 2016; Fearon 1994; Tomz et al. 2020).\nDelegating to their non-state proxies is one strategy states use when trying to preserve secrecy around their involvement in hostile actions (Groh 2019). In theory, the proxy's ability to claim independence from the chain of command can provide the state with more plausible deniability about their lack of responsibility. If this strategy is effective, it follows that public opinion in a targeted country should respond differently to denials of responsibility for hostile actions carried out by a state's proxies rather than its military or other security institutions. Specifically, this delegation should weaken attributions of blame against the attacking government while limiting demands for retaliation, thus mitigating pressures on the targeted government to respond. However, there are reasons to doubt whether proxies make deniability more plausible, since they frequently demonstrate strong ties to their patrons, which should undermine the credibility of claims that their decision-making is independent. Returning to the Russian Wagner Group, for example, the company's founder has a personal relationship with President Putin, and the company is known to receive funding, training, and equipment from the Russian military and intelligence apparatus (Rabin 2019). This relationship has become even more publicly apparent since the Russian invasion of Ukraine (Kirby 2023).\nTo date, there has been relatively little research on public opinion toward secrecy in international politics (Carnegie 2021; Myrick 2019), including whether and how delegating hostile actions to proxies shapes public opinion. I evaluate whether this delegation can influence attributions of blame and demands for retaliation by implementing seven vignette experiments across three surveys of American adults. The vignettes address hypothetical attacks against US targets by Russian, Chinese, and\nIranian actors, with these countries' governments denying involvement in the attacks. Respondents are randomly assigned to read that the attackers were part of a military unit or proxy group tied to the foreign government, after which they assess responsibility for the incident and evaluate possible US responses. These countries were chosen not only because their governments rely frequently on covert action, but also because their authoritarian political systems and their unpopularity with the American public should create a hard test of the hypothesized relationships.\nThe results show that respondents become less likely to attribute responsibility to the adversarial governments when attacks were carried out by proxies. The effects are small, however, suggesting that the use of proxies with known ties to the sponsor may marginally strengthen a government's plausible deniability of involvement in an attack without substantially altering the extent to which citizens in the targeted state blame that government. The results also provide mixed support for the ability of covert action to mitigate demands for escalation. Respondents in the proxy treatment groups are substantially less likely to support sanctioning the senior leadership of the adversarial governments instead of subordinate individuals involved directly in the attacks, and this effect is partially mediated by the treatment's effects on respondents' attributions of blame. However, respondents are not less likely to support forceful, retaliatory attacks by the US government that would reflect a clear escalation of the conflict. One interpretation of these findings is that delegation to proxies may help reduce escalation risks by increasing the likelihood that the targeted public prefers to retaliate against the proxy itself, but is less likely to influence citizens' views on their government responding to hostilities with coercive and forceful forms of retaliation.\nThese findings contribute to international relations research on secrecy by providing experimental evidence that both reinforces and expands on existing theories about the effects of covert action and plausible deniability on conflict, insofar as they provide some evidence that acting covertly through proxies can reduce a government's exposure to blame and shape how citizens in a targeted country think about the appropriate response (e.g. Carnegie and Carson 2018; Carson 2016; Hedgecock and Sukin 2023; Joseph and Poznansky 2018). They also extend a nascent body of work on public opinion toward the role of non-state proxies in international politics (e.g. Plana 2020). In addition, by showing that authoritarian regimes can reduce their exposure to blame in international conflicts by delegating to non-state proxies, the findings contribute to a large literature on blame avoidance that has to date focused primarily on domestic politics and democratic political systems (Baekkeskov and Rubin 2016).\nThis article proceeds as follows. It first reviews literature on covert action and secrecy in international politics before outlining expectations about the effects of proxies on attributions of responsibility and demands for retaliation. It then discusses the selected cases and research design for the experiments, before presenting the results. The article concludes with a discussion of external validity and implications for international relations research.\n##\nSecrecy, Delegation, and Conflict Escalation\nSecrecy is a common feature of international politics (Carnegie 2021), and a growing literature seeks to explain why states might attempt to conceal outcomes ranging from military alliances to the resolution of international legal disputes or crises (Hafner-Burton and Victor 2016; Kuo 2020; Kurizaki 2007). Covert action reflects one aspect of secrecy in the international system, whereby states attempt to obscure their involvement in hostile activities targeting another state or political entity. Well-known examples include the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba by US-backed Cuban exiles, or participation by Soviet pilots in the Korean War against the United States. As with these examples, covert operations or their outcomes tend to be visible publicly, and the objective is not to keep the acts themselves secret, but rather to conceal or create doubt about who was involved (DeVine 2022).\nThe identity of the responsible actor does not always stay secret to other states, whose governments often have the intelligence capacity to make reasonable determinations about who is behind an attack. Even so, the costs and risks associated with covert operations can prove useful by signaling resolve to the observing states (Carson and Yarhi-Milo 2017). Furthermore, covert action is more likely to succeed at concealing the identity of the responsible actor from the public. As a result, states may rely on it to obscure aspects of their foreign policy that would damage their reputations domestically or abroad (Joseph and Poznansky 2018). For example, democracies may use covert action against other democracies to avoid domestic backlash for violating the expectation that they remain on good terms with democratic governments (Crandall et al. 2018). Relatedly, governments may delegate violence against civilians to non-state actors to obscure their involvement from international audiences who would respond negatively to human rights violations (Carey et al. 2015).\nBy providing plausible deniability that conceals responsibility for hostile activities from the public, covert action has been theorized to help adversarial states reduce the risks of conflict escalation. Research indicates that political and military leaders are susceptible to pressure from public opinion when deciding whether and how to deploy military force (Chu and Recchia 2022; Lin-Greenberg 2021; Tomz et al. 2020). Keeping hostilities on the “backstage” and out of the public eye should help states to avoid pressures from hawkish domestic constituencies who wish to expand the scope of the conflict, while allowing states to signal to each other that they do not want to escalate (Carson 2016, 2018; Joseph and Poznansky 2018). In other words, by obscuring their involvement, states may be able to limit escalation risks in part by decreasing the likelihood that citizens in the targeted country demand a response from their own government that would escalate the conflict. As an example of this mechanism in action, Carson (2018, 21) notes how Nazi Germany monitored foreign reactions to its involvement in the Spanish Civil War and “...carefully calibrated covert German combat participation in light of hawkish domestic sentiment in London and Paris.”\nBecause the point of covert action is to obscure the identity of the responsible actor, states often pursue these operations through their proxies, whether corporations, informal militias, or “volunteer” fighters. Research on blame attributions and accountability implies that this strategy of delegating to proxies should be effective at creating plausible deniability that influences perceptions of responsibility in the targeted state. People are more likely to believe an actor is responsible for an outcome when they have direct control over the decision-making process that produces the outcome (Hood 2011). In cases where delegation occurs and multiple decision-makers are involved, clarity of responsibility is diminished and political actors are more capable of avoiding blame (Martin and Raffler 2021; Powell and Whitten 1993). Experimental research suggests these blame avoidance benefits can occur even when people know the delegator and delegatee share the same interests (Bartling and Fischbacher 2012). In terms of international relations, proxies such as militias or corporations are entities separate from the state apparatus, and, at least in theory, they can make decisions more independently than a military or intelligence unit. This potential independence should make it harder for citizens in the targeted state to determine whether an action occurred because of directives from the sponsor or because of the proxy's own initiative. As a result, delegating to proxies should increase plausible deniability and help the sponsor to limit how much it is held responsible by citizens of the targeted state.\nAs noted in the literature on covert action, governments may benefit from this redirection of perceived responsibility for several reasons, including protecting their political support domestically and their soft power internationally if their involvement in the hostile acts would be viewed negatively (Joseph and Poznansky 2018). Of primary interest to this article is that shifting blame through covert operations may also help governments to reduce the likelihood of citizens in the targeted country demanding retaliation that escalates the conflict (Carson 2018). The blame avoidance literature provides a framework for understanding why delegating to proxies could shape attitudes toward retaliation as well. Because blame helps people to identify who should be held accountable for a problematic outcome, those who limit their exposure to blame should face fewer demands that they be punished (Hood 2014). Thus, if delegating to a proxy can reduce how many people in the targeted country blame the sponsoring state for a hostile action, it follows that these people may also become less likely to want their government to hold that state accountable by retaliating against it. In other words, using proxies to conduct covert actions could weaken domestic pressure on the targeted government to expand the conflict, which would reduce escalation risks by limiting incentives for political and military leaders to respond forcefully (Carson 2016; Tomz et al. 2020).\nFrom this theoretical framework, I expect the following when hostile actions are known to be conducted by a state's proxies rather than its own military forces. First, when a proxy is involved, I expect that respondents will be more likely to believe a foreign government's denials of responsibility -- i.e. they will blame the government less. Second, because respondents attribute less blame to the foreign government, I\nexpect that they will be less likely to support retaliation against that government as well.\nHowever, there are also reasons to expect that delegating to proxies may have little effect on attributions of responsibility or attitudes toward retaliation. First, proxies often lack credible separation from their sponsors. If the proxy is a domestic entity with legal status within the sponsoring country, it may be constrained in its ability to pursue foreign policy objectives that contradict those of the government. This limitation is especially likely to apply in authoritarian regimes, where the government controls most domestic organizations closely to ensure that they do not work against the authorities. Foreign proxies of a government might have more credible claims to independence, since they exist outside that government's legal and coercive apparatus. Nonetheless, in these cases, journalists and foreign governments often go to great lengths to publicize ties between the proxy and its sponsor. If people do not believe that the proxy has genuine independence to operate, they are unlikely to absolve the sponsoring state of blame.\nSecond, if citizens in the targeted state dislike the sponsor government intensely and are primed to distrust it, they may discount claims of separation from the proxy. This reaction may be particularly likely in contexts where two states have a history of poor relations -- i.e. the contexts in which hostile covert actions are most likely to be conducted. Finally, citizens of a targeted state may blame the sponsor of an attacking proxy for failing to control their proxy, even if the sponsors did not intend for the attack to happen.\n## Research Design\nTo test how covert action by proxies influences attributions of blame and demands for retaliation, I implemented seven vignette experiments across three surveys administered online in the United States. Experiments have become increasingly common in the international relations literature, and they are particularly useful for studying IR theories that involve public opinion (Hyde 2015) -- including issues of secrecy and covert action (e.g. Myrick 2019). The following sections provide further details about the design.\n### Samples\nThe first survey was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 1299 American adults recruited by the firm Lucid in April 2019. Each respondent read and answered outcome questions for two vignettes: one involving China, and the other involving Russia. The survey was designed with the expectations about delegation, blame, and escalation in mind but was exploratory and not pre-registered.\nThe second survey was pre-registered. I specified hypotheses and analyses that would indicate replication of findings from the first survey, and I expanded the experiment by adding additional outcome questions in line with the theoretical\nexpectations. This second survey was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 3053 respondents recruited by Lucid in March 2021. Each respondent on the second survey saw the same China and Russia vignettes used on the first survey. In addition, they also read and responded to questions about a vignette involving Iran.\nThe third survey was intended to provide an additional replication check, while also facilitating exploratory analysis of patterns identified in the second survey. It was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 2007 American adults recruited by Lucid in May 2021. This survey used the Russia and Iran vignettes but dropped the China vignette due to time constraints. All three surveys were representative on age, gender, income, ethnicity, and US region. Summary statistics can be found in the SI.\n### Case Selection\nI chose to center my vignettes around hostile actions attributed to Chinese, Russian, and Iranian actors. These three cases are useful for several reasons. The first is that all three countries are relatively unpopular in the United States due to a history of adversarial relations. My survey data highlights these unfavorable perceptions among American adults. In the first survey in 2019, 15% of respondents reported a favorable view of Russia and 16% said the same about China. In the second survey in 2021, only 25% of respondents said they had a favorable view of China, 20% reported a favorable view of Russia, and 11% claimed to have a favorable view of Iran. These negative attitudes should make it less likely that respondents would give these governments the benefit of the doubt when they deny involvement in hostile actions carried out by their proxies. The second reason is that all three countries are governed by authoritarian regimes. China's government operates a massive surveillance state that exercises extensive control over the population. Russia and Iran also control their societies closely. These political systems make it less likely that proxy groups are operating independently of the authorities, which should reduce the credibility of delegation and make it less likely that people believe that the proxy's sponsor was not involved. These first two reasons suggest the countries provide a hard test of the hypothesized effects.\nFinally, the third reason is that all three countries regularly engage in covert action to advance their foreign policy objectives, and they frequently do so by delegating to non-state proxies that are believed to provide a degree of plausible deniability. As such, the survey vignettes should be highly relevant to real-world events. In the following paragraphs, I briefly discuss examples from each case.\nChina: As cyber activities have become increasingly important for global politics, China has invested heavily in its cyber capabilities to gather political and economic intelligence (Beecroft 2021). The Chinese government has used a variety of actors to conduct cyberattacks, including military personnel. In 2020, the US government charged four members of the People's Liberation Army for hacking the credit agency Equifax and acquiring data on tens of millions of Americans (US Department of Justice 2020). This case reflected a long history of Chinese state hackers conducting economic espionage against American corporations (Dorfman 2020). At the same time, the\ngovernment also works through proxies, including Chinese corporations and hacking groups. Chinese technology companies such as Huawei have been linked to espionage, with their equipment used to facilitate cyber intrusions (Robertson and Tarabay 2021), monitor the domestic population (Dou 2021), and process stolen data (Dorfman 2020). Chinese security officers have also established front companies to conduct cyberattacks. In a criminal case against four Chinese citizens accused of economic espionage, the US government alleged that the individuals were Chinese security officials in a provincial branch of the Ministry of State Security (MSS) who had “sought to obfuscate the Chinese government's role in such theft by establishing a front company, Hainan Xiandun Technology Department Co. Ltd” (US Department of Justice 2021).\nSeveral hacking groups have also been identified as proxies conducting cyberattacks on behalf of the Chinese government. An attack on Microsoft Exchange in 2021 was attributed to a group given the name Hafnium, which has been linked to the MSS by Western governments (Corera 2021). Another operation, known as Cloud Hopper, was attributed to the group APT10, which has also been connected to the MSS (Sabbagh 2021). While Western governments have attributed responsibility for the actions of these groups to the Chinese government, some ambiguity remains about the nature of the relationship. For instance, there is evidence that APT10 has also conducted cyberattacks to steal information for personal gain, raising questions about whether the group “enjoys protections that enable it to conduct its own for-profit activities” or “has simply evaded scrutiny from Chinese authorities” (Taylor 2019).\nRussia: The Russian government has made extensive use of proxies to achieve its foreign policy objectives. In Ukraine, prior to the invasion of 2022, it encouraged and then supported separatist groups in their attempts to establish independent states tied closely to Russia (International Crisis Group 2019), a tactic it has used to expand its influence in other countries including Georgia and Moldova (Cornell and Shaffer 2020). Russia has also increasingly turned to private military companies to advance its interests abroad (Hoffman and Orner 2021), the most well-known of which is the Wagner Group that has already been mentioned. These organizations have participated in conflicts in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe, receiving private gains while also extending Russia's influence. In Sudan, the Wagner Group was deployed in 2017 to help repress uprisings against Omar Al-Bashir. As payment, the company's owner was given exclusive rights to mine gold in the country, and the Russian government was later offered a naval base on the Red Sea before Al-Bashir was overthrown in 2019 (Fasanotti 2022). These companies exist in a legal gray area under Russian law and are technically separate from the state, even as they are owned and directed by individuals with close ties to President Putin and the security elite (Stronski 2020; Rondeaux 2019).\nWhile the connections are clear between Moscow and the proxies discussed above, debate has continued about how closely the Russian government controls them. Regarding private military companies like the Wagner Group, the extent to which they are “simply patriotic volunteers as the Kremlin claims...on official assignment for Russia's GRU intelligence service...mercenaries, corporate warriors, or frontline\nsoldiers” remains unclear (Rondeaux 2019). All of these identities may be true at different moments, fostering uncertainty about their role in specific conflicts or time periods. Analysts have argued that this ambiguity provides enough plausible deniability to help Russia avoid accountability for human rights violations and limit escalation risks in the conflicts in which these organizations are involved (Cornell and Shaffer 2020; Fasanotti 2022; Rondeaux 2019; Stronski 2020).\nIran: The use of proxy groups to extend its influence in the Middle East has been a central component of Iran's foreign policy for decades. The Iranian government maintains close ties with militant organizations and political movements in countries including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine, Pakistan, Syria, and Yemen (Jones 2019; Lane 2021). These organizations have received financial support, weapons, and training from Iran and often work closely with the Revolutionary Guard to advance the country's regional interests. They include Hezbollah in Lebanon, which operates a successful political party and a well-armed militia that has fought alongside the Syrian and Iranian governments in the Syrian civil war. They also include several militias in Iraq that have a formal relationship with the Iraqi armed forces (Azizi 2022), such as Kata'ib Hizballah, Asaib Ahl Al-Haq, and Harakat Hezbollah Al-Nujaba (Lane 2021). These groups participate openly in the political system, where they have worked to pull Iraq closer to Iran, and they have also taken part in armed attacks on US and Saudi targets (Malik 2020).\nDespite their close ties to Iran, most of these groups have their own domestic political interests and are not controlled fully from Tehran. In Yemen, Iranian support for the Houthis does not outweigh the group's own interests in fighting its domestic opponents and their international backers (Juneau 2016). While Iran does at times exercise direct influence over the decision-making of Hezbollah in Lebanon, its influence is usually indirect and decisions are made by Hezbollah's leaders (DeVore 2012). Likewise, the Iranian-aligned militias in Iraq are involved in Iraqi politics and frequently pursue their own political interests (Loveluck and Salim 2021). Though they coordinate militant activities closely with Iran's Revolutionary Guard, they are not entirely beholden to them and often act independently. For example, the failed assassination attempt against Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi in 2021 was suspected to have been carried out by one of the Iranian-aligned militias without approval from Iran (Khalid 2021). In addition, the militias have often attacked US forces even at moments when Iran is attempting to deescalate relations with the United States (Yuan 2021). The fact that these groups will act in their own interest can create ambiguity about the extent of Iranian involvement.\n### Vignettes\nFor each vignette in my surveys, respondents were provided with information about an attack linked to an adversarial foreign power against US interests. All details of the situation were held constant, except for the identity of the organization alleged to have carried out the attack. Respondents were told that the vignettes were hypothetical to\nensure no deception about events that could cause anger toward a foreign country. However, the content of the vignettes was selected to reflect real-world political developments discussed in the cases above. Respondents were told that the actor involved in the attack had been identified, and the attacker was randomized to be a military unit or proxy of the foreign government. The vignettes always noted that the relevant foreign government had denied foreknowledge of the attack and blamed it on a rogue operation. Because I am interested in how delegation to proxies affects public opinion by giving the government greater plausible deniability or not, it was important to be clear that the foreign government had denied involvement across the treatment groups. These scenarios reflect real-world use of covert action, where the attack is usually observed by everyone, there are attempts by government officials, journalists, and researchers to figure out who was directly involved, and the government on which the most suspicion is cast publicly denies responsibility.\nIn the first survey, the identity of the attacking organization was said to be determined by US officials. In the second and third surveys, I randomized whether the identity was determined by US officials or journalists. I included this additional randomization to account for the possibility that the source of information would shape responses to the proxy versus military treatments. It is possible that respondents would perceive US officials attributing blame to a proxy rather than the military as a signal that the US government did not wish to escalate the conflict, rather than as an objective statement about who was directly involved in the attack. In this case, respondents might attribute less blame to the foreign government and demand less escalation not because they believed the foreign government was less directly involved, but because they trusted the US government had good reasons to avoid escalation. However, I do not find any meaningful or consistent differences based on this randomization.\nThe China vignette discussed a cyberattack that stole valuable technology from a US company. The vignette randomized whether the attack was attributed to a Chinese military unit, private corporation, or state-run corporation. The state-run corporation should create less plausible deniability than the private corporation; however, its distance from the chain of command could strengthen that plausibility relative to the military unit. As discussed above, Chinese hackers linked to both state institutions and private companies have previously stolen sensitive technologies from American companies (Dofman 2020; Sullivan and Schuknect 2019).\nThe Russia vignette involved an attack on US soldiers in Syria by Russian forces. The attack was attributed either to soldiers in a Russian military unit or a Russian private military company. Throughout the Syrian civil war, American soldiers have been involved in clashes with Russian military forces but also members of the private Russian military companies that are used as proxy forces (Gibbons-Neff 2018; Schmitt 2020).\nFinally, the Iran vignette detailed an attack on US forces in Iraq by actors linked to Iran. Respondents were randomly assigned to read that the attack was connected to an Iranian military unit or an Iraqi militia with ties to Iran. These incidents have also occurred frequently since the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. As noted above, the attacks are often linked to Iranian-sponsored militias (Khaleel and Arraf 2021), but Iranian forces have been involved directly as well (Branigin 2011).\nThe full text of the vignettes are below:China Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that a Chinese (military unit/state-owned corporation/private corporation) was behind a major cyber attack on a US energy company, in which hackers stole valuable technological plans for a new renewable energy source. The Chinese government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on a rogue operation by hackers in the (military unit/state-owned corporation/private corporation).Russia Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that soldiers from a Russian (military unit/private security company) were behind an attack on US forces in Syria that killed two American soldiers. The Russian government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on officers in the (military unit/private security company) on the ground in Syria.Iran Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that soldiers from (an Iranian military unit/an Iraqi militia with ties to Iran) were behind a rocket attack on US forces in Iraq that killed two American soldiers. The Iranian government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on rogue officers in the (military unit/militia) in Iraq.\nAll randomizations within each scenario occurred with equal probability. Balance tests are reported in the SI.\nAn important motive for using multiple scenarios was to assess whether the effects of delegating to proxies would generalize to different situations in which covert action is commonly used. The scenarios reflect different types of attacks (cyber vs kinetic), different foreign governments (China, Russia, and Iran), and different proxies (corporations and militias). My expectation was that delegation would have similar effects across the scenarios, as the theoretical logic -- more credible independence of the proxy reducing attributions of blame and therefore demands for retaliation -- should apply even as the specific details vary. However, it is possible that these different scenarios would produce variation in responses. For example, cyber attacks may affect public opinion differently than kinetic attacks by limiting demands for forceful retaliation (e.g. Kreps and Schneider 2019). I explore generalizability further while discussing the results.\nOutcomes\nFollowing each vignette, respondents were asked outcome questions to assess their attributions of responsibility for the attacks and their views about how the US government should respond.\nRegarding responsibility, respondents on all three surveys were asked if the foreign governments should be blamed for the attacks. The question was worded “Do you agree or disagree that the [relevant] government should be blamed for this attack?” On the second and third surveys, respondents were also asked about who had ordered the attack, with the question “Do you think it is likely or unlikely senior officials in the [relevant] government ordered this attack?” This question provided a more direct assessment of whether respondents believed high-level officials were directly involved in -- and therefore responsible for -- the action. Answers for both questions ranged from strongly agree to strongly disagree on a 7 point Likert scale, with stronger attributions of responsibility coded as higher values. If respondents in the proxy treatment groups became less likely to blame the foreign governments and less likely to believe they ordered the attacks, it would provide support for the expectation that delegating to proxies can strengthen plausible deniability and help governments avoid blame in targeted states.\nRegarding the US response, respondents on the first and second surveys were asked if the US government should pursue targeted sanctions against the lower-level officials in the relevant proxies or military units, or if the US government should implement sanctions against senior officials in the respective governments. The question was worded as follows: “The US government is deciding how to respond to the attack. Which option do you see as a more appropriate response?” Respondents could then choose that “The US government responds by sanctioning the officers in charge of the [military unit/corporation/militia] or that “The US government responds by sanctioning senior officials in the [relevant] government. This latter option would be more likely to escalate conflict and deepen tensions between the two countries, since it reflects a direct attempt to punish the most important decision-makers in the foreign state. For example, the Chinese government responded angrily to US sanctions on senior Chinese officials over its Hong Kong policies (Wadhams 2020). In other words, respondents were forced to choose between a response that would hold accountable only those individuals involved directly in the event, or a stronger, more escalatory response that would hold accountable the top levels of the foreign government.\nOn the second survey, respondents were also asked if they would support US retaliation involving attacks on the respective countries, with answers ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree on a 7 point Likert scale. The first part of the question stated that “The US government is also deciding whether to retaliate by...” The remainder of the question specified actions including a “hacking attack that cuts off electricity to a major Chinese city” for the Chinese vignette, an attack “targeting several Russian soldiers in Syria” for the Russia vignette, and “bombing military targets in Iran” for the Iran vignette. In each case, the proposed US response was designed to\nappear escalatory. Cutting power to a major Chinese city would reflect an escalation over stealing technology; killing “several” Russian soldiers implies a higher cost on Russia than the two US soldiers killed; and bombing Iran would reflect an escalation from the tit-for-tat conflict between the two countries in Iraq.\nOne possible limitation of the second question is that respondents were not asked directly whether they would prefer to escalate, and some respondents may not have viewed the retaliatory options as escalatory. As a result, for the Iran and Russia vignettes included on the third survey, I used an outcome question designed to follow up on patterns identified in the first and second surveys by asking respondents directly about their attitudes toward escalation. The question stated that “The US government is deciding how to respond to the attack. Which option do you see as the most appropriate response?” Respondents could then choose between three options: that the US government “decides to deescalate by not targeting any [relevant government] soldiers,” that the US government “decides to respond proportionally by targeting and killing two [relevant government] soldiers, or that the US government “decides to escalate by targeting and killing twenty [relevant government] soldiers.” Because time was more limited on the third survey, I was unable to include the other two outcome questions about how the US government should respond to the attack.\nIf respondents in the proxy treatment group became more likely to prefer targeted sanctions, less likely to support a retaliatory attack, and less likely to approve explicitly of escalation, it would be consistent with delegation to proxies reducing pressure on the targeted government to escalate the conflict.\nTable 1 reports the mean and standard deviation for each outcome measure. It also illustrates which questions were asked for which country vignette on which surveys. In general, respondents are somewhat likely to blame the foreign government for the attacks and to believe that senior officials ordered them. Regarding the sanction outcome, respondents tend to be roughly split on whether sanctions should target higher-level authorities or the specific individuals involved in the attacks. Support for retaliating with force is lower, with respondents neutral on average about the retaliatory attack outcome, and with respondents mostly split between the US government either deescalating or responding proportionally -- but not escalating -- for the escalation outcome.\n## Results\nI use two approaches to report treatment effects. First, I aggregate data across the three scenarios on the three surveys, creating a single proxy treatment indicator for respondents assigned to the Chinese corporation, Russian private security company, or Iranian-aligned Iraqi militia treatments in each of the experiments. I use OLS to regress the outcomes on the proxy treatment. Dummy variables for the scenarios are included to account for different baseline responses in the military conditions, and I cluster standard errors by respondent, since each respondent completed more than one scenario on the same survey (Hainmueller et al. 2014). Analyzing the\nWilliamson\n\n|  Variable - Country | Survey 1 | Survey 2 | Survey 3  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Blame - China | 5.18 (1.46) | 5.18 (1.46) |   |\n|  Blame - Russia | 5.15 (1.52) | 5.16 (1.47) | 5.09 (1.44)  |\n|  Blame - Iran |  | 5.31 (1.44) | 5.27 (1.40)  |\n|  Ordered - China |  | 5.42 (1.43) |   |\n|  Ordered - Russia |  | 5.27 (1.48) | 5.25 (1.43)  |\n|  Ordered - Iran |  | 5.42 (1.44) | 5.43 (1.40)  |\n|  Sanction - China | 0.51 (0.50) | 0.47 (0.50) |   |\n|  Sanction - Russia | 0.55 (0.50) | 0.46 (0.50) |   |\n|  Sanction - Iran |  | 0.49 (0.50) |   |\n|  Retaliate - China |  | 4.04 (1.85) |   |\n|  Retaliate - Russia |  | 4.26 (1.75) |   |\n|  Retaliate - Iran |  | 4.54 (1.73) |   |\n|  Escalate - China |  |  |   |\n|  Escalate - Russia |  |  | 0.42 (0.63)  |\n|  Escalate - Iran |  |  | 0.54 (0.72)  |\nMean (SD) reported for each outcome measure.\nRange for blame, ordered, attack: 1-7.\nRange for sanction: 0-1; Range for escalate: 0-2.\naggregated data, which was pre-registered with the pre-analysis plan for the second survey, is useful for providing an overall assessment of how delegating to proxies affected responses to the different outcomes across multiple surveys and scenarios. Second, I then provide treatment effects for each of the scenarios on each survey to assess consistency. These effects are also analyzed with OLS regression, using models that control for age, gender, education, political interest, partisanship, foreign policy orientation, and region of residence. These controls were also pre-registered. They are relevant to foreign policy attitudes, are correlated with the outcomes, and were measured pre-treatment, so they can help to increase precision (Gerber and Green 2012). Results without control variables are consistent and are reported in the SI.\nTable 2 reports main effects for the proxy treatment in the aggregated data. The first two columns show results for the outcomes related to attributions of responsibility, with the first showing the effect of the treatment on perceptions that the foreign government should be blamed for the attack, and the second showing the effect on beliefs that senior officials in the foreign government ordered the attack. For both outcomes, assignment to the proxy treatment reduces attributions of responsibility by 0.14 on the seven point scale  $(p &lt; 0.001)$ . This effect is equivalent to a shift of approximately one-tenth of a standard deviation, indicating a modest impact on how respondents attribute responsibility for the hostilities. This small decrease occurred from relatively high levels of blame directed at the foreign government in the military treatments, where the\nJournal of Conflict Resolution 68(2-3)\nTable 2.

The effect of the proxy treatment on the sanctions outcome is substantively large. Respondents assigned to the proxy groups are 9 percentage points less likely to prefer sanctioning senior government officials over officials in the specific unit involved in the attack  $(p &lt; 0.001)$ . This effect reflects a shift of approximately two-fifths of a standard deviation and reduces support for the more escalatory sanctions below a majority of respondents. However, the proxy treatment did not have any influence on the other two response outcomes. Though coefficients were negative in both cases, they were near zero and statistically insignificant. In other words, respondents who read that proxies conducted the hostilities were not less likely to support retaliatory attacks by the United States against the relevant foreign country, and they were not less likely to support a response directly described as escalatory.\nNext, I report the effects for the proxy treatment in each scenario across the three surveys. These effects are displayed in Figures 1 and 2. The former addresses the attribution outcomes and the latter shows the response outcomes.\nFor the attribution outcomes, the treatment effects point in a consistent direction that reflects the negative effect in the aggregated results. Regarding blame, respondents in the first and second surveys who read that the hacking attack was carried out by a Chinese private corporation were 0.22 ( $p &lt; 0.05$ ) and 0.10 ( $p &lt; 0.10$ ) less likely to attribute responsibility to the Chinese government compared to respondents in the military treatment. On the other hand, the coefficients for the Chinese state corporation were negative but statistically insignificant in both surveys. Relative to the military treatment in the Russia scenario, the private security treatment reduced blame directed at the Russian government by 0.15 ( $p &lt; 0.10$ ) in the first survey, by 0.18 ( $p &lt; 0.001$ ) in the second survey, and by 0.13 ( $p &lt; 0.05$ ) in the third survey. Finally, for the Iran scenario, the militia treatment decreased blame relative to the military treatment by 0.20\nWilliamson\n\n$(p &lt; 0.001)$ in the second survey, and it was negative but insignificant in the third survey.\nFor the ordered outcome, respondents on the second survey were less likely to believe the attack was carried out on orders of senior officials in the foreign government by 0.16 $(p &lt; 0.01)$ when exposed to the Chinese private corporation treatment. Again, however, the effect of the state corporation was negative but not statistically significant. For the second survey, the private security treatment reduced the Russian government's perceived role by 0.12 $(p &lt; 0.05)$, while the Iraqi militia treatment reduced the Iranian government's perceived role in ordering the attacks by 0.21 $(p &lt; 0.001)$. On the third survey, the Russia treatment lost significance but the Iran treatment continued to reduce the perceived role by 0.10 $(p &lt; 0.10)$.\nWhile there is some variation across the scenarios and surveys, these effects are consistent with the aggregate data. They suggest that individuals may be less likely to attribute responsibility to foreign governments that have denied involvement in an attack when that attack is conducted by proxies, and this pattern appears with different countries and different types of hostilities. However, the modest effect sizes also imply that delegating to proxies is unlikely to substantially transform public perceptions of blame in these scenarios. In terms of\nJournal of Conflict Resolution 68(2-3)\nvariation across the treatments, the Chinese state-run corporation effect was consistently insignificant and weaker than the others. Though the difference is small, it reflects the expectation that plausible deniability should be stronger when the proxies have more credible separation from the sponsoring state.\nFor the response outcomes shown in Figure 2, the results are generally consistent as well. Proxies strongly reduce support for sanctioning senior government officials but produce limited to no effects on attitudes toward retaliatory attacks that could escalate the conflict.\nRegarding the sanctions outcome, respondents in the proxy treatment groups were consistently less likely to prefer sanctions against senior government officials over more targeted sanctions against lower-level officials in the organization that conducted the attack. In contrast to the responsibility outcomes, this finding applied to both Chinese corporation treatments. In the first and second surveys, the Chinese private corporation reduced the preference for senior-level sanctions by  $12(p &lt; 0.001)$  and  $16(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points, while the state-run corporation reduced this preference by  $12(p &lt; 0.001)$  and  $14(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points. Likewise, the Russian security company reduced support for sanctioning senior officials by  $8(p &lt; 0.01)$  and  $10(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points in the first and second surveys. The effect for the Iraqi militia treatment was smaller, reducing support for sanctions on senior Iranian officials by approximately 4 percentage points  $(p &lt; 0.05)$ .\nFor the retaliate and escalate outcomes, however, the proxy treatment produced effects that were inconsistent in their direction and for the most part statistically insignificant. For retaliate, the Chinese state corporation treatment slightly increased\nFigure 2. Treatment effects for response outcomes. Note: Plot displays coefficients for treatment effects from surveys 1, 2, and 3, with effects estimated by OLS regression with control variables for age, gender, education, political interest, partisanship, foreign policy orientation, and region of residence.\nsupport for the hacking attack on the electrical grid of a Chinese city, though the effect was insignificant. The Chinese private corporation and the Russian security company produced very small, negative effects that failed to attain statistical significance. The Iraqi militia treatment slightly reduced support for bombing military targets in Iran, by 0.10 (p < 0.10). Respondents in the military treatments were split on whether the US government should pursue these retaliatory actions against the Chinese, Russian, and Iranian governments, with average responses of approximately 4 on the 7-point scale, and the proxy treatments had no discernible impact on these attitudes.\nThe third survey was intended to explore further the discrepancy between the sanction and retaliation outcomes by incorporating a new outcome question that asked respondents explicitly whether they wished the US government to deescalate, respond proportionally, or escalate (taking values of 0, 1, and 2 respectively). However, the proxy treatments also did not produce consistent effects on attitudes toward this escalate outcome. The Russian private security company did have a small, negative effect of 0.05 (p < 0.05) on the 3-point scale, compared to the Russian military treatment. On the other hand, the Iraqi militia returned a positive but insignificant effect compared to the Iranian military unit. In both scenarios, most respondents in the control group were split between preferring a deescalatory or proportional response: few wanted to escalate the conflict by striking back harder against the foreign country, and the proxy treatments did not have a substantial or consistent impact on these views.\nAs reported in the SI, the source identifying the involved actor -- whether US officials or journalists -- did not have a significant effect on the outcomes. In addition, the SI shows that effects of the proxy treatment did not vary consistently based on pre-existing attitudes toward China, Russia, and Iran.\n## Discussion\nThe results show a modest impact of the proxy treatments on respondents' attributions of blame and inconsistent effects on their views of how the US government should respond. Regarding the latter, respondents in the proxy treatments became less likely to prefer sanctioning senior government officials rather than individuals from the unit directly engaged in the hostilities; however, they did not become less likely to prefer retaliatory attacks against the foreign country, and they did not become less likely to support a response explicitly described as escalatory.\nTwo possible explanations may account for this divergence between the different response outcomes. One possibility is that delegation to proxies affects whom people prefer their governments to retaliate against, without necessarily affecting levels of support for the government to retaliate in some fashion. When forced to choose between the options of punishing senior government leaders or lower-level officials in the military unit or proxy organization, respondents in the proxy treatment groups were more likely to favor the latter. In other words, they preferred to retaliate against the proxy rather than the government itself. On the other hand, when confronted with outcomes that asked whether they would support retaliatory responses against the\nforeign country directly or not, without the option of targeting the proxy instead, their attitudes did not shift. This divergence could indicate that delegation may redirect pressure for retaliation toward the proxy, without necessarily limiting demands for the targeted government to respond in some way. In this case, using proxies could help to limit escalation risks, since public opinion preferring to retaliate against the proxy rather than the government should be less likely to trigger a spiral of intensifying conflict between the two adversaries.\nAnother possibility is that delegating to proxies may influence attitudes toward retaliatory options that are viewed as less risky, without shifting public opinion toward potentially costly responses involving direct attacks on powerful foreign adversaries. Sanctions are unlikely to trigger a major, destructive conflict between two countries, even if they deepen tensions. As a result, citizens in a targeted country may shift their views on the kinds of sanctions that are appropriate for responding to a provocation without needing to worry that their country will get dragged into a war. In this case, whether a proxy conducted the attack may influence the public's preferred response. With retaliation that involves significant cyber attacks or killing foreign soldiers, however, it becomes more probable that serious conflict could result. Citizens may have more entrenched views about whether it is worth risking such a conflict, such that their attitudes toward these forms of retaliation are less likely to shift due to a modest strengthening of plausible deniability that results from delegating to a proxy.\nThe article's theoretical framework suggests that delegating to proxies should reduce demands for retaliation by citizens in the targeted state because they are less likely to hold the adversarial government responsible for the attack. As expected, the proxy treatment did have an effect on respondents' attributions of blame for the hostile actions. However, the theoretical link breaks for the retaliate and escalate outcomes, since the proxy treatment did not affect support for these responses. As was just discussed, this discrepancy could be explained by respondents holding relatively entrenched views about the circumstances under which the US government should respond with violence to an adversarial state, with these attitudes unlikely to be affected by modest changes in perceptions of the foreign government's responsibility.\nDid the theoretical link hold for the sanctions outcome, with respondents in the proxy treatment less willing to sanction senior government officials because they blamed them less when the proxies conducted the attacks? Consistent with theoretical expectations, mediation analysis indicates that respondents' attributions of responsibility mediated approximately 14% of the proxy treatment's effects on preferences toward whom to sanction (Imai et al. 2011). However, this result also suggests the proxy treatment influenced the sanctions outcome through other mechanisms. One possibility is that respondents view the decision to use the proxy as a signal of the foreign government's desire to keep the conflict limited, so they become less willing to impose more punitive sanctions on that government's leadership in response. This mechanism could be explored in future research.\nEven if there is only a modest connection between how the public in a targeted country attributes responsibility for hostile actions and how they want their own\ngovernment to respond, attacking states may still benefit in other ways from relying on proxies to reduce their exposure to blame. It is likely that when a state is viewed as more responsible for an attack by its target's citizens, its reputation among the public in that country will decline. This declining reputation could have negative consequences for the public's willingness to engage or trade with the opposing state, resulting in political or economic costs for the attacker. As a result, states may still delegate to proxies in an effort to limit their exposure to blame for hostile actions, even if the primary motivation differs from trying to control escalation risks.\nAt the same time, the small magnitude of the effects on respondents' attributions of blame suggests that the use of proxies is unlikely to cause dramatic shifts in how people in targeted states think about responsibility for hostile acts. If a non-state actor is known to have strong ties to a foreign government, many people appear likely to assume that its activities are linked to its sponsor's goals and directives. However, it is possible the effect sizes represent a lower bound for how public opinion would react in real-world situations. First, the vignettes were designed to provide hard tests of the hypothesized relationships by relying on countries with authoritarian governments disliked by majorities of Americans. It is possible that delegating to proxies would have stronger effects when used by democracies or between states where citizens have more neutral views of the opposing governments. Second, it is plausible that the hypothetical -- and low-stakes -- nature of the vignettes made respondents less responsive to the treatments and more willing to record negative answers about countries they dislike. The vignettes were designed to reflect actual situations in which states have sought to obscure aspects of their foreign policies by delegating to proxies, and research comparing survey experiments to actual political attitudes suggests they do a reasonable job of generalizing to real political developments (e.g. Hainmueller et al. 2015). However, compared to real-world attacks, respondents may have felt less uncertainty about assigning blame to the foreign government in the survey.\nRegarding generalizability, the three scenarios produced relatively consistent results. The proxy treatments reduced attributions of blame and perceptions of high-level orders for the attacks with similarly-sized treatment effects for the three non-state actors in the China, Russia, and Iran incidents. The treatments also had similar effects on preferences toward sanctions, though the magnitude was smaller for Iran. One possible explanation for this difference is that sanctioning Iran had already been part of a prominent political debate for years by the time the surveys were implemented, resulting in more fixed attitudes on this question. Finally, for the retaliate and escalate outcomes, responses varied somewhat in their direction; however, the magnitudes were consistently small in all cases. These patterns suggest that how the public responds to attacks carried out by proxies may be relatively similar across different types of attacks and when linked to different sponsors.\nHowever, other issues of external validity suggest avenues for future research. First, the language used in the vignettes could be varied to create more or less contestation over responsibility. On the one hand, US officials or journalists could use softer language in their attributions, perhaps“suspecting” certain actors to be responsible for\nthe attack rather than “concluding” that they were. In certain cases, US officials may not even comment at all, and journalists or researchers may not have enough evidence to publish, leaving the public with little more than speculation about which foreign actor should be blamed. In these cases, the use of proxies may produce stronger plausible deniability. On the other hand, government officials or journalists could bring actual evidence to bear in their assertions of responsibility, while also directly calling into question the opposing government's denials of involvement, which could leave them more exposed to blame. Both approaches reflect real-world engagement around covert actions. Sometimes, both government and private sources tread cautiously in how they attribute responsibility. At other times, they release detailed reports along with evidence such as satellite imagery that are capable of shifting public opinion effectively (Lin-Greenberg and Milonopoulos 2021). It seems plausible that public opinion would respond differently based on the kinds of language and arguments used by private and public actors to shape perceptions of responsibility for covert action, and future research could explore this variation. In addition, it may be the case that people in countries outside the United States would react differently to attacks by proxies, particularly if these countries have more or less trustworthy media environments and political leaders, or if they have different historical experiences with conflict. Future research could evaluate how the results generalize to other countries.\n## Conclusion\nGovernments frequently rely on proxies to pursue their foreign policy objectives while maintaining plausible deniability of their involvement. This secrecy has been theorized to reduce risks of conflict escalation, in part by limiting domestic pressures on adversaries to retaliate. Yet, proxies often have well-documented and publicized ties to their sponsors, raising questions about the extent to which delegation to proxies can reduce escalation risks by shaping public opinion about responsibility for -- and responses to -- hostile acts.\nThe experiments discussed in this paper suggest that delegating to proxies can influence how people attribute responsibility for an attack on their country's interests, though the reported effect sizes are modest and imply that proxies may only strengthen plausible deniability on the margins. The modest effects could indicate that other factors will often provide stronger motives for governments to delegate to proxies, whether related to lower costs, their knowledge of local conditions, or signaling a lack of interest in escalation (Carson 2018; Eck 2015). Respondents in the proxy treatment were also substantially more supportive of limited sanctions rather than those targeting senior leadership of the sponsor government, indicating some effect on citizens' views of how their own government should respond to hostilities. These findings contribute to a growing literature on secrecy in international relations by implying that delegation can contribute modestly to plausible deniability while shaping preferences about whom to retaliate against, even in cases where proxies are closely controlled by their sponsors and the credibility of their independence should be relatively low. On the other hand,\nthe proxy treatment did not affect respondents' views of whether the US government should respond with more coercive and escalatory forms of retaliation, such as a major cyber attack on a Chinese city, killing Russian soldiers, or bombing targets in Iran. These null effects could result from respondents' holding more fixed attitudes about the contexts in which the United States should use force against adversarial states, with modest shifts in plausible deniability unlikely to change these views.\n## Acknowledgements\nI thank Bridging the Gap's New Era Workshop for motivating the project.

Delegating these actions to proxies is one strategy states use to retain plausible deniability and limit escalation risks. Yet, proxies often have strong ties to sponsoring states, raising questions about their ability to influence blame and demands for retaliation. This paper tests these effects by analyzing American responses to hypothetical attacks by Chinese, Russian, and Iranian actors through experiments administered on three surveys. The results show that using proxies for these attacks modestly reduced how much Americans blamed the respective foreign governments, while also limiting demands that their senior leadership be sanctioned. However, the use of proxies did not affect Americans' attitudes toward more forceful responses by the US government. These findings contribute to understanding of how proxies shape plausible deniability and escalation risks in international conflicts.\n# Keywords\nconflict management, domestic politics, foreign policy, interstate conflict\n$^{1}$ Department of Social and Political Sciences, Bocconi University, Milano, Italy\n# Corresponding Author:\nScott Williamson, Department of Social and Political Sciences, Bocconi University, Via Sarfatti, 25, Milano 20136, Italy.\nEmail: scott.williamson@unibocconi.it\nIntroduction\nIn February 2018, Syrian and Russian forces attacked an American outpost in Syria. The assault dragged on for more than four hours, during which hundreds of the attacking soldiers were killed. Despite fears the incident could trigger conflict between Russian and American forces in Syria, escalation did not occur. The Russian government quickly distanced itself from the attack by claiming they had no control over the soldiers, who were not part of the Russian military. Instead, they were employees of a private military company called the Wagner Group (Gibbons-Neff 2018). This company has often served as a Russian proxy in conflicts where the government has not wished to involve itself openly, including in Libya, Ukraine, Venezuela, and Syria (Rabin 2019).\nCovert actions such as these are a common feature of international affairs, with states frequently attempting to disguise aspects of their foreign policies. Scholars have proposed that this emphasis on secrecy can contribute to stability within the international system by reducing the likelihood of conflict escalation (Carnegie and Carson 2018; Carson 2016; Joseph and Poznansky 2018; Yarhi-Milo 2013). This advantage is thought to occur in part because adversaries who engage each other secretly should be less likely to trigger domestic pressures that push them to increase the scope of the conflict (Carson 2016; Fearon 1994; Tomz et al. 2020).\nDelegating to their non-state proxies is one strategy states use when trying to preserve secrecy around their involvement in hostile actions (Groh 2019). In theory, the proxy's ability to claim independence from the chain of command can provide the state with more plausible deniability about their lack of responsibility. If this strategy is effective, it follows that public opinion in a targeted country should respond differently to denials of responsibility for hostile actions carried out by a state's proxies rather than its military or other security institutions. Specifically, this delegation should weaken attributions of blame against the attacking government while limiting demands for retaliation, thus mitigating pressures on the targeted government to respond. However, there are reasons to doubt whether proxies make deniability more plausible, since they frequently demonstrate strong ties to their patrons, which should undermine the credibility of claims that their decision-making is independent. Returning to the Russian Wagner Group, for example, the company's founder has a personal relationship with President Putin, and the company is known to receive funding, training, and equipment from the Russian military and intelligence apparatus (Rabin 2019). This relationship has become even more publicly apparent since the Russian invasion of Ukraine (Kirby 2023).\nTo date, there has been relatively little research on public opinion toward secrecy in international politics (Carnegie 2021; Myrick 2019), including whether and how delegating hostile actions to proxies shapes public opinion. I evaluate whether this delegation can influence attributions of blame and demands for retaliation by implementing seven vignette experiments across three surveys of American adults. The vignettes address hypothetical attacks against US targets by Russian, Chinese, and\nIranian actors, with these countries' governments denying involvement in the attacks. Respondents are randomly assigned to read that the attackers were part of a military unit or proxy group tied to the foreign government, after which they assess responsibility for the incident and evaluate possible US responses. These countries were chosen not only because their governments rely frequently on covert action, but also because their authoritarian political systems and their unpopularity with the American public should create a hard test of the hypothesized relationships.\nThe results show that respondents become less likely to attribute responsibility to the adversarial governments when attacks were carried out by proxies. The effects are small, however, suggesting that the use of proxies with known ties to the sponsor may marginally strengthen a government's plausible deniability of involvement in an attack without substantially altering the extent to which citizens in the targeted state blame that government. The results also provide mixed support for the ability of covert action to mitigate demands for escalation. Respondents in the proxy treatment groups are substantially less likely to support sanctioning the senior leadership of the adversarial governments instead of subordinate individuals involved directly in the attacks, and this effect is partially mediated by the treatment's effects on respondents' attributions of blame. However, respondents are not less likely to support forceful, retaliatory attacks by the US government that would reflect a clear escalation of the conflict. One interpretation of these findings is that delegation to proxies may help reduce escalation risks by increasing the likelihood that the targeted public prefers to retaliate against the proxy itself, but is less likely to influence citizens' views on their government responding to hostilities with coercive and forceful forms of retaliation.\nThese findings contribute to international relations research on secrecy by providing experimental evidence that both reinforces and expands on existing theories about the effects of covert action and plausible deniability on conflict, insofar as they provide some evidence that acting covertly through proxies can reduce a government's exposure to blame and shape how citizens in a targeted country think about the appropriate response (e.g. Carnegie and Carson 2018; Carson 2016; Hedgecock and Sukin 2023; Joseph and Poznansky 2018). They also extend a nascent body of work on public opinion toward the role of non-state proxies in international politics (e.g. Plana 2020). In addition, by showing that authoritarian regimes can reduce their exposure to blame in international conflicts by delegating to non-state proxies, the findings contribute to a large literature on blame avoidance that has to date focused primarily on domestic politics and democratic political systems (Baekkeskov and Rubin 2016).\nThis article proceeds as follows. It first reviews literature on covert action and secrecy in international politics before outlining expectations about the effects of proxies on attributions of responsibility and demands for retaliation. It then discusses the selected cases and research design for the experiments, before presenting the results. The article concludes with a discussion of external validity and implications for international relations research.\n##\nSecrecy, Delegation, and Conflict Escalation\nSecrecy is a common feature of international politics (Carnegie 2021), and a growing literature seeks to explain why states might attempt to conceal outcomes ranging from military alliances to the resolution of international legal disputes or crises (Hafner-Burton and Victor 2016; Kuo 2020; Kurizaki 2007). Covert action reflects one aspect of secrecy in the international system, whereby states attempt to obscure their involvement in hostile activities targeting another state or political entity. Well-known examples include the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba by US-backed Cuban exiles, or participation by Soviet pilots in the Korean War against the United States. As with these examples, covert operations or their outcomes tend to be visible publicly, and the objective is not to keep the acts themselves secret, but rather to conceal or create doubt about who was involved (DeVine 2022).\nThe identity of the responsible actor does not always stay secret to other states, whose governments often have the intelligence capacity to make reasonable determinations about who is behind an attack. Even so, the costs and risks associated with covert operations can prove useful by signaling resolve to the observing states (Carson and Yarhi-Milo 2017). Furthermore, covert action is more likely to succeed at concealing the identity of the responsible actor from the public. As a result, states may rely on it to obscure aspects of their foreign policy that would damage their reputations domestically or abroad (Joseph and Poznansky 2018). For example, democracies may use covert action against other democracies to avoid domestic backlash for violating the expectation that they remain on good terms with democratic governments (Crandall et al. 2018). Relatedly, governments may delegate violence against civilians to non-state actors to obscure their involvement from international audiences who would respond negatively to human rights violations (Carey et al. 2015).\nBy providing plausible deniability that conceals responsibility for hostile activities from the public, covert action has been theorized to help adversarial states reduce the risks of conflict escalation. Research indicates that political and military leaders are susceptible to pressure from public opinion when deciding whether and how to deploy military force (Chu and Recchia 2022; Lin-Greenberg 2021; Tomz et al. 2020). Keeping hostilities on the “backstage” and out of the public eye should help states to avoid pressures from hawkish domestic constituencies who wish to expand the scope of the conflict, while allowing states to signal to each other that they do not want to escalate (Carson 2016, 2018; Joseph and Poznansky 2018). In other words, by obscuring their involvement, states may be able to limit escalation risks in part by decreasing the likelihood that citizens in the targeted country demand a response from their own government that would escalate the conflict. As an example of this mechanism in action, Carson (2018, 21) notes how Nazi Germany monitored foreign reactions to its involvement in the Spanish Civil War and “...carefully calibrated covert German combat participation in light of hawkish domestic sentiment in London and Paris.”\nBecause the point of covert action is to obscure the identity of the responsible actor, states often pursue these operations through their proxies, whether corporations, informal militias, or “volunteer” fighters. Research on blame attributions and accountability implies that this strategy of delegating to proxies should be effective at creating plausible deniability that influences perceptions of responsibility in the targeted state. People are more likely to believe an actor is responsible for an outcome when they have direct control over the decision-making process that produces the outcome (Hood 2011). In cases where delegation occurs and multiple decision-makers are involved, clarity of responsibility is diminished and political actors are more capable of avoiding blame (Martin and Raffler 2021; Powell and Whitten 1993). Experimental research suggests these blame avoidance benefits can occur even when people know the delegator and delegatee share the same interests (Bartling and Fischbacher 2012). In terms of international relations, proxies such as militias or corporations are entities separate from the state apparatus, and, at least in theory, they can make decisions more independently than a military or intelligence unit. This potential independence should make it harder for citizens in the targeted state to determine whether an action occurred because of directives from the sponsor or because of the proxy's own initiative. As a result, delegating to proxies should increase plausible deniability and help the sponsor to limit how much it is held responsible by citizens of the targeted state.\nAs noted in the literature on covert action, governments may benefit from this redirection of perceived responsibility for several reasons, including protecting their political support domestically and their soft power internationally if their involvement in the hostile acts would be viewed negatively (Joseph and Poznansky 2018). Of primary interest to this article is that shifting blame through covert operations may also help governments to reduce the likelihood of citizens in the targeted country demanding retaliation that escalates the conflict (Carson 2018). The blame avoidance literature provides a framework for understanding why delegating to proxies could shape attitudes toward retaliation as well. Because blame helps people to identify who should be held accountable for a problematic outcome, those who limit their exposure to blame should face fewer demands that they be punished (Hood 2014). Thus, if delegating to a proxy can reduce how many people in the targeted country blame the sponsoring state for a hostile action, it follows that these people may also become less likely to want their government to hold that state accountable by retaliating against it. In other words, using proxies to conduct covert actions could weaken domestic pressure on the targeted government to expand the conflict, which would reduce escalation risks by limiting incentives for political and military leaders to respond forcefully (Carson 2016; Tomz et al. 2020).\nFrom this theoretical framework, I expect the following when hostile actions are known to be conducted by a state's proxies rather than its own military forces. First, when a proxy is involved, I expect that respondents will be more likely to believe a foreign government's denials of responsibility -- i.e. they will blame the government less. Second, because respondents attribute less blame to the foreign government, I\nexpect that they will be less likely to support retaliation against that government as well.\nHowever, there are also reasons to expect that delegating to proxies may have little effect on attributions of responsibility or attitudes toward retaliation. First, proxies often lack credible separation from their sponsors. If the proxy is a domestic entity with legal status within the sponsoring country, it may be constrained in its ability to pursue foreign policy objectives that contradict those of the government. This limitation is especially likely to apply in authoritarian regimes, where the government controls most domestic organizations closely to ensure that they do not work against the authorities. Foreign proxies of a government might have more credible claims to independence, since they exist outside that government's legal and coercive apparatus. Nonetheless, in these cases, journalists and foreign governments often go to great lengths to publicize ties between the proxy and its sponsor. If people do not believe that the proxy has genuine independence to operate, they are unlikely to absolve the sponsoring state of blame.\nSecond, if citizens in the targeted state dislike the sponsor government intensely and are primed to distrust it, they may discount claims of separation from the proxy. This reaction may be particularly likely in contexts where two states have a history of poor relations -- i.e. the contexts in which hostile covert actions are most likely to be conducted. Finally, citizens of a targeted state may blame the sponsor of an attacking proxy for failing to control their proxy, even if the sponsors did not intend for the attack to happen.\n## Research Design\nTo test how covert action by proxies influences attributions of blame and demands for retaliation, I implemented seven vignette experiments across three surveys administered online in the United States. Experiments have become increasingly common in the international relations literature, and they are particularly useful for studying IR theories that involve public opinion (Hyde 2015) -- including issues of secrecy and covert action (e.g. Myrick 2019). The following sections provide further details about the design.\n### Samples\nThe first survey was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 1299 American adults recruited by the firm Lucid in April 2019. Each respondent read and answered outcome questions for two vignettes: one involving China, and the other involving Russia. The survey was designed with the expectations about delegation, blame, and escalation in mind but was exploratory and not pre-registered.\nThe second survey was pre-registered. I specified hypotheses and analyses that would indicate replication of findings from the first survey, and I expanded the experiment by adding additional outcome questions in line with the theoretical\nexpectations. This second survey was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 3053 respondents recruited by Lucid in March 2021. Each respondent on the second survey saw the same China and Russia vignettes used on the first survey. In addition, they also read and responded to questions about a vignette involving Iran.\nThe third survey was intended to provide an additional replication check, while also facilitating exploratory analysis of patterns identified in the second survey. It was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 2007 American adults recruited by Lucid in May 2021. This survey used the Russia and Iran vignettes but dropped the China vignette due to time constraints. All three surveys were representative on age, gender, income, ethnicity, and US region. Summary statistics can be found in the SI.\n### Case Selection\nI chose to center my vignettes around hostile actions attributed to Chinese, Russian, and Iranian actors. These three cases are useful for several reasons. The first is that all three countries are relatively unpopular in the United States due to a history of adversarial relations. My survey data highlights these unfavorable perceptions among American adults. In the first survey in 2019, 15% of respondents reported a favorable view of Russia and 16% said the same about China. In the second survey in 2021, only 25% of respondents said they had a favorable view of China, 20% reported a favorable view of Russia, and 11% claimed to have a favorable view of Iran. These negative attitudes should make it less likely that respondents would give these governments the benefit of the doubt when they deny involvement in hostile actions carried out by their proxies. The second reason is that all three countries are governed by authoritarian regimes. China's government operates a massive surveillance state that exercises extensive control over the population. Russia and Iran also control their societies closely. These political systems make it less likely that proxy groups are operating independently of the authorities, which should reduce the credibility of delegation and make it less likely that people believe that the proxy's sponsor was not involved. These first two reasons suggest the countries provide a hard test of the hypothesized effects.\nFinally, the third reason is that all three countries regularly engage in covert action to advance their foreign policy objectives, and they frequently do so by delegating to non-state proxies that are believed to provide a degree of plausible deniability. As such, the survey vignettes should be highly relevant to real-world events. In the following paragraphs, I briefly discuss examples from each case.\nChina: As cyber activities have become increasingly important for global politics, China has invested heavily in its cyber capabilities to gather political and economic intelligence (Beecroft 2021). The Chinese government has used a variety of actors to conduct cyberattacks, including military personnel. In 2020, the US government charged four members of the People's Liberation Army for hacking the credit agency Equifax and acquiring data on tens of millions of Americans (US Department of Justice 2020). This case reflected a long history of Chinese state hackers conducting economic espionage against American corporations (Dorfman 2020). At the same time, the\ngovernment also works through proxies, including Chinese corporations and hacking groups. Chinese technology companies such as Huawei have been linked to espionage, with their equipment used to facilitate cyber intrusions (Robertson and Tarabay 2021), monitor the domestic population (Dou 2021), and process stolen data (Dorfman 2020). Chinese security officers have also established front companies to conduct cyberattacks. In a criminal case against four Chinese citizens accused of economic espionage, the US government alleged that the individuals were Chinese security officials in a provincial branch of the Ministry of State Security (MSS) who had “sought to obfuscate the Chinese government's role in such theft by establishing a front company, Hainan Xiandun Technology Department Co. Ltd” (US Department of Justice 2021).\nSeveral hacking groups have also been identified as proxies conducting cyberattacks on behalf of the Chinese government. An attack on Microsoft Exchange in 2021 was attributed to a group given the name Hafnium, which has been linked to the MSS by Western governments (Corera 2021). Another operation, known as Cloud Hopper, was attributed to the group APT10, which has also been connected to the MSS (Sabbagh 2021). While Western governments have attributed responsibility for the actions of these groups to the Chinese government, some ambiguity remains about the nature of the relationship. For instance, there is evidence that APT10 has also conducted cyberattacks to steal information for personal gain, raising questions about whether the group “enjoys protections that enable it to conduct its own for-profit activities” or “has simply evaded scrutiny from Chinese authorities” (Taylor 2019).\nRussia: The Russian government has made extensive use of proxies to achieve its foreign policy objectives. In Ukraine, prior to the invasion of 2022, it encouraged and then supported separatist groups in their attempts to establish independent states tied closely to Russia (International Crisis Group 2019), a tactic it has used to expand its influence in other countries including Georgia and Moldova (Cornell and Shaffer 2020). Russia has also increasingly turned to private military companies to advance its interests abroad (Hoffman and Orner 2021), the most well-known of which is the Wagner Group that has already been mentioned. These organizations have participated in conflicts in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe, receiving private gains while also extending Russia's influence. In Sudan, the Wagner Group was deployed in 2017 to help repress uprisings against Omar Al-Bashir. As payment, the company's owner was given exclusive rights to mine gold in the country, and the Russian government was later offered a naval base on the Red Sea before Al-Bashir was overthrown in 2019 (Fasanotti 2022). These companies exist in a legal gray area under Russian law and are technically separate from the state, even as they are owned and directed by individuals with close ties to President Putin and the security elite (Stronski 2020; Rondeaux 2019).\nWhile the connections are clear between Moscow and the proxies discussed above, debate has continued about how closely the Russian government controls them. Regarding private military companies like the Wagner Group, the extent to which they are “simply patriotic volunteers as the Kremlin claims...on official assignment for Russia's GRU intelligence service...mercenaries, corporate warriors, or frontline\nsoldiers” remains unclear (Rondeaux 2019). All of these identities may be true at different moments, fostering uncertainty about their role in specific conflicts or time periods. Analysts have argued that this ambiguity provides enough plausible deniability to help Russia avoid accountability for human rights violations and limit escalation risks in the conflicts in which these organizations are involved (Cornell and Shaffer 2020; Fasanotti 2022; Rondeaux 2019; Stronski 2020).\nIran: The use of proxy groups to extend its influence in the Middle East has been a central component of Iran's foreign policy for decades. The Iranian government maintains close ties with militant organizations and political movements in countries including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine, Pakistan, Syria, and Yemen (Jones 2019; Lane 2021). These organizations have received financial support, weapons, and training from Iran and often work closely with the Revolutionary Guard to advance the country's regional interests. They include Hezbollah in Lebanon, which operates a successful political party and a well-armed militia that has fought alongside the Syrian and Iranian governments in the Syrian civil war. They also include several militias in Iraq that have a formal relationship with the Iraqi armed forces (Azizi 2022), such as Kata'ib Hizballah, Asaib Ahl Al-Haq, and Harakat Hezbollah Al-Nujaba (Lane 2021). These groups participate openly in the political system, where they have worked to pull Iraq closer to Iran, and they have also taken part in armed attacks on US and Saudi targets (Malik 2020).\nDespite their close ties to Iran, most of these groups have their own domestic political interests and are not controlled fully from Tehran. In Yemen, Iranian support for the Houthis does not outweigh the group's own interests in fighting its domestic opponents and their international backers (Juneau 2016). While Iran does at times exercise direct influence over the decision-making of Hezbollah in Lebanon, its influence is usually indirect and decisions are made by Hezbollah's leaders (DeVore 2012). Likewise, the Iranian-aligned militias in Iraq are involved in Iraqi politics and frequently pursue their own political interests (Loveluck and Salim 2021). Though they coordinate militant activities closely with Iran's Revolutionary Guard, they are not entirely beholden to them and often act independently. For example, the failed assassination attempt against Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi in 2021 was suspected to have been carried out by one of the Iranian-aligned militias without approval from Iran (Khalid 2021). In addition, the militias have often attacked US forces even at moments when Iran is attempting to deescalate relations with the United States (Yuan 2021). The fact that these groups will act in their own interest can create ambiguity about the extent of Iranian involvement.\n### Vignettes\nFor each vignette in my surveys, respondents were provided with information about an attack linked to an adversarial foreign power against US interests. All details of the situation were held constant, except for the identity of the organization alleged to have carried out the attack. Respondents were told that the vignettes were hypothetical to\nensure no deception about events that could cause anger toward a foreign country. However, the content of the vignettes was selected to reflect real-world political developments discussed in the cases above. Respondents were told that the actor involved in the attack had been identified, and the attacker was randomized to be a military unit or proxy of the foreign government. The vignettes always noted that the relevant foreign government had denied foreknowledge of the attack and blamed it on a rogue operation. Because I am interested in how delegation to proxies affects public opinion by giving the government greater plausible deniability or not, it was important to be clear that the foreign government had denied involvement across the treatment groups. These scenarios reflect real-world use of covert action, where the attack is usually observed by everyone, there are attempts by government officials, journalists, and researchers to figure out who was directly involved, and the government on which the most suspicion is cast publicly denies responsibility.\nIn the first survey, the identity of the attacking organization was said to be determined by US officials. In the second and third surveys, I randomized whether the identity was determined by US officials or journalists. I included this additional randomization to account for the possibility that the source of information would shape responses to the proxy versus military treatments. It is possible that respondents would perceive US officials attributing blame to a proxy rather than the military as a signal that the US government did not wish to escalate the conflict, rather than as an objective statement about who was directly involved in the attack. In this case, respondents might attribute less blame to the foreign government and demand less escalation not because they believed the foreign government was less directly involved, but because they trusted the US government had good reasons to avoid escalation. However, I do not find any meaningful or consistent differences based on this randomization.\nThe China vignette discussed a cyberattack that stole valuable technology from a US company. The vignette randomized whether the attack was attributed to a Chinese military unit, private corporation, or state-run corporation. The state-run corporation should create less plausible deniability than the private corporation; however, its distance from the chain of command could strengthen that plausibility relative to the military unit. As discussed above, Chinese hackers linked to both state institutions and private companies have previously stolen sensitive technologies from American companies (Dofman 2020; Sullivan and Schuknect 2019).\nThe Russia vignette involved an attack on US soldiers in Syria by Russian forces. The attack was attributed either to soldiers in a Russian military unit or a Russian private military company. Throughout the Syrian civil war, American soldiers have been involved in clashes with Russian military forces but also members of the private Russian military companies that are used as proxy forces (Gibbons-Neff 2018; Schmitt 2020).\nFinally, the Iran vignette detailed an attack on US forces in Iraq by actors linked to Iran. Respondents were randomly assigned to read that the attack was connected to an Iranian military unit or an Iraqi militia with ties to Iran. These incidents have also occurred frequently since the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. As noted above, the attacks are often linked to Iranian-sponsored militias (Khaleel and Arraf 2021), but Iranian forces have been involved directly as well (Branigin 2011).\nThe full text of the vignettes are below:China Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that a Chinese (military unit/state-owned corporation/private corporation) was behind a major cyber attack on a US energy company, in which hackers stole valuable technological plans for a new renewable energy source. The Chinese government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on a rogue operation by hackers in the (military unit/state-owned corporation/private corporation).Russia Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that soldiers from a Russian (military unit/private security company) were behind an attack on US forces in Syria that killed two American soldiers. The Russian government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on officers in the (military unit/private security company) on the ground in Syria.Iran Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that soldiers from (an Iranian military unit/an Iraqi militia with ties to Iran) were behind a rocket attack on US forces in Iraq that killed two American soldiers. The Iranian government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on rogue officers in the (military unit/militia) in Iraq.\nAll randomizations within each scenario occurred with equal probability. Balance tests are reported in the SI.\nAn important motive for using multiple scenarios was to assess whether the effects of delegating to proxies would generalize to different situations in which covert action is commonly used. The scenarios reflect different types of attacks (cyber vs kinetic), different foreign governments (China, Russia, and Iran), and different proxies (corporations and militias). My expectation was that delegation would have similar effects across the scenarios, as the theoretical logic -- more credible independence of the proxy reducing attributions of blame and therefore demands for retaliation -- should apply even as the specific details vary. However, it is possible that these different scenarios would produce variation in responses. For example, cyber attacks may affect public opinion differently than kinetic attacks by limiting demands for forceful retaliation (e.g. Kreps and Schneider 2019). I explore generalizability further while discussing the results.\nOutcomes\nFollowing each vignette, respondents were asked outcome questions to assess their attributions of responsibility for the attacks and their views about how the US government should respond.\nRegarding responsibility, respondents on all three surveys were asked if the foreign governments should be blamed for the attacks. The question was worded “Do you agree or disagree that the [relevant] government should be blamed for this attack?” On the second and third surveys, respondents were also asked about who had ordered the attack, with the question “Do you think it is likely or unlikely senior officials in the [relevant] government ordered this attack?” This question provided a more direct assessment of whether respondents believed high-level officials were directly involved in -- and therefore responsible for -- the action. Answers for both questions ranged from strongly agree to strongly disagree on a 7 point Likert scale, with stronger attributions of responsibility coded as higher values. If respondents in the proxy treatment groups became less likely to blame the foreign governments and less likely to believe they ordered the attacks, it would provide support for the expectation that delegating to proxies can strengthen plausible deniability and help governments avoid blame in targeted states.\nRegarding the US response, respondents on the first and second surveys were asked if the US government should pursue targeted sanctions against the lower-level officials in the relevant proxies or military units, or if the US government should implement sanctions against senior officials in the respective governments. The question was worded as follows: “The US government is deciding how to respond to the attack. Which option do you see as a more appropriate response?” Respondents could then choose that “The US government responds by sanctioning the officers in charge of the [military unit/corporation/militia] or that “The US government responds by sanctioning senior officials in the [relevant] government. This latter option would be more likely to escalate conflict and deepen tensions between the two countries, since it reflects a direct attempt to punish the most important decision-makers in the foreign state. For example, the Chinese government responded angrily to US sanctions on senior Chinese officials over its Hong Kong policies (Wadhams 2020). In other words, respondents were forced to choose between a response that would hold accountable only those individuals involved directly in the event, or a stronger, more escalatory response that would hold accountable the top levels of the foreign government.\nOn the second survey, respondents were also asked if they would support US retaliation involving attacks on the respective countries, with answers ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree on a 7 point Likert scale. The first part of the question stated that “The US government is also deciding whether to retaliate by...” The remainder of the question specified actions including a “hacking attack that cuts off electricity to a major Chinese city” for the Chinese vignette, an attack “targeting several Russian soldiers in Syria” for the Russia vignette, and “bombing military targets in Iran” for the Iran vignette. In each case, the proposed US response was designed to\nappear escalatory. Cutting power to a major Chinese city would reflect an escalation over stealing technology; killing “several” Russian soldiers implies a higher cost on Russia than the two US soldiers killed; and bombing Iran would reflect an escalation from the tit-for-tat conflict between the two countries in Iraq.\nOne possible limitation of the second question is that respondents were not asked directly whether they would prefer to escalate, and some respondents may not have viewed the retaliatory options as escalatory. As a result, for the Iran and Russia vignettes included on the third survey, I used an outcome question designed to follow up on patterns identified in the first and second surveys by asking respondents directly about their attitudes toward escalation. The question stated that “The US government is deciding how to respond to the attack. Which option do you see as the most appropriate response?” Respondents could then choose between three options: that the US government “decides to deescalate by not targeting any [relevant government] soldiers,” that the US government “decides to respond proportionally by targeting and killing two [relevant government] soldiers, or that the US government “decides to escalate by targeting and killing twenty [relevant government] soldiers.” Because time was more limited on the third survey, I was unable to include the other two outcome questions about how the US government should respond to the attack.\nIf respondents in the proxy treatment group became more likely to prefer targeted sanctions, less likely to support a retaliatory attack, and less likely to approve explicitly of escalation, it would be consistent with delegation to proxies reducing pressure on the targeted government to escalate the conflict.\nTable 1 reports the mean and standard deviation for each outcome measure. It also illustrates which questions were asked for which country vignette on which surveys. In general, respondents are somewhat likely to blame the foreign government for the attacks and to believe that senior officials ordered them. Regarding the sanction outcome, respondents tend to be roughly split on whether sanctions should target higher-level authorities or the specific individuals involved in the attacks. Support for retaliating with force is lower, with respondents neutral on average about the retaliatory attack outcome, and with respondents mostly split between the US government either deescalating or responding proportionally -- but not escalating -- for the escalation outcome.\n## Results\nI use two approaches to report treatment effects. First, I aggregate data across the three scenarios on the three surveys, creating a single proxy treatment indicator for respondents assigned to the Chinese corporation, Russian private security company, or Iranian-aligned Iraqi militia treatments in each of the experiments. I use OLS to regress the outcomes on the proxy treatment. Dummy variables for the scenarios are included to account for different baseline responses in the military conditions, and I cluster standard errors by respondent, since each respondent completed more than one scenario on the same survey (Hainmueller et al. 2014). Analyzing the\nWilliamson\n335\nTable I.

Second, I then provide treatment effects for each of the scenarios on each survey to assess consistency. These effects are also analyzed with OLS regression, using models that control for age, gender, education, political interest, partisanship, foreign policy orientation, and region of residence. These controls were also pre-registered. They are relevant to foreign policy attitudes, are correlated with the outcomes, and were measured pre-treatment, so they can help to increase precision (Gerber and Green 2012). Results without control variables are consistent and are reported in the SI.\nTable 2 reports main effects for the proxy treatment in the aggregated data. The first two columns show results for the outcomes related to attributions of responsibility, with the first showing the effect of the treatment on perceptions that the foreign government should be blamed for the attack, and the second showing the effect on beliefs that senior officials in the foreign government ordered the attack. For both outcomes, assignment to the proxy treatment reduces attributions of responsibility by 0.14 on the seven point scale  $(p &lt; 0.001)$ . This effect is equivalent to a shift of approximately one-tenth of a standard deviation, indicating a modest impact on how respondents attribute responsibility for the hostilities. This small decrease occurred from relatively high levels of blame directed at the foreign government in the military treatments, where the\nJournal of Conflict Resolution 68(2-3)\nTable 2.

The effect of the proxy treatment on the sanctions outcome is substantively large. Respondents assigned to the proxy groups are 9 percentage points less likely to prefer sanctioning senior government officials over officials in the specific unit involved in the attack  $(p &lt; 0.001)$ . This effect reflects a shift of approximately two-fifths of a standard deviation and reduces support for the more escalatory sanctions below a majority of respondents. However, the proxy treatment did not have any influence on the other two response outcomes. Though coefficients were negative in both cases, they were near zero and statistically insignificant. In other words, respondents who read that proxies conducted the hostilities were not less likely to support retaliatory attacks by the United States against the relevant foreign country, and they were not less likely to support a response directly described as escalatory.\nNext, I report the effects for the proxy treatment in each scenario across the three surveys. These effects are displayed in Figures 1 and 2. The former addresses the attribution outcomes and the latter shows the response outcomes.\nFor the attribution outcomes, the treatment effects point in a consistent direction that reflects the negative effect in the aggregated results. Regarding blame, respondents in the first and second surveys who read that the hacking attack was carried out by a Chinese private corporation were 0.22 ( $p &lt; 0.05$ ) and 0.10 ( $p &lt; 0.10$ ) less likely to attribute responsibility to the Chinese government compared to respondents in the military treatment. On the other hand, the coefficients for the Chinese state corporation were negative but statistically insignificant in both surveys. Relative to the military treatment in the Russia scenario, the private security treatment reduced blame directed at the Russian government by 0.15 ( $p &lt; 0.10$ ) in the first survey, by 0.18 ( $p &lt; 0.001$ ) in the second survey, and by 0.13 ( $p &lt; 0.05$ ) in the third survey. Finally, for the Iran scenario, the militia treatment decreased blame relative to the military treatment by 0.20\nWilliamson\n337\nFigure 1. Treatment effects for responsibility outcomes. Note: Plot displays coefficients for treatment effects from surveys 1, 2, and 3, with effects estimated by OLS regression with control variables for age, gender, education, political interest, partisanship, foreign policy orientation, and region of residence.\n$(p &lt; 0.001)$ in the second survey, and it was negative but insignificant in the third survey.\nFor the ordered outcome, respondents on the second survey were less likely to believe the attack was carried out on orders of senior officials in the foreign government by 0.16 $(p &lt; 0.01)$ when exposed to the Chinese private corporation treatment. Again, however, the effect of the state corporation was negative but not statistically significant. For the second survey, the private security treatment reduced the Russian government's perceived role by 0.12 $(p &lt; 0.05)$, while the Iraqi militia treatment reduced the Iranian government's perceived role in ordering the attacks by 0.21 $(p &lt; 0.001)$. On the third survey, the Russia treatment lost significance but the Iran treatment continued to reduce the perceived role by 0.10 $(p &lt; 0.10)$.\nWhile there is some variation across the scenarios and surveys, these effects are consistent with the aggregate data. They suggest that individuals may be less likely to attribute responsibility to foreign governments that have denied involvement in an attack when that attack is conducted by proxies, and this pattern appears with different countries and different types of hostilities. However, the modest effect sizes also imply that delegating to proxies is unlikely to substantially transform public perceptions of blame in these scenarios. In terms of\nJournal of Conflict Resolution 68(2-3)\nvariation across the treatments, the Chinese state-run corporation effect was consistently insignificant and weaker than the others. Though the difference is small, it reflects the expectation that plausible deniability should be stronger when the proxies have more credible separation from the sponsoring state.\nFor the response outcomes shown in Figure 2, the results are generally consistent as well. Proxies strongly reduce support for sanctioning senior government officials but produce limited to no effects on attitudes toward retaliatory attacks that could escalate the conflict.\nRegarding the sanctions outcome, respondents in the proxy treatment groups were consistently less likely to prefer sanctions against senior government officials over more targeted sanctions against lower-level officials in the organization that conducted the attack. In contrast to the responsibility outcomes, this finding applied to both Chinese corporation treatments. In the first and second surveys, the Chinese private corporation reduced the preference for senior-level sanctions by  $12(p &lt; 0.001)$  and  $16(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points, while the state-run corporation reduced this preference by  $12(p &lt; 0.001)$  and  $14(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points. Likewise, the Russian security company reduced support for sanctioning senior officials by  $8(p &lt; 0.01)$  and  $10(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points in the first and second surveys. The effect for the Iraqi militia treatment was smaller, reducing support for sanctions on senior Iranian officials by approximately 4 percentage points  $(p &lt; 0.05)$ .\nFor the retaliate and escalate outcomes, however, the proxy treatment produced effects that were inconsistent in their direction and for the most part statistically insignificant. For retaliate, the Chinese state corporation treatment slightly increased\nFigure 2. Treatment effects for response outcomes. Note: Plot displays coefficients for treatment effects from surveys 1, 2, and 3, with effects estimated by OLS regression with control variables for age, gender, education, political interest, partisanship, foreign policy orientation, and region of residence.\nsupport for the hacking attack on the electrical grid of a Chinese city, though the effect was insignificant. The Chinese private corporation and the Russian security company produced very small, negative effects that failed to attain statistical significance. The Iraqi militia treatment slightly reduced support for bombing military targets in Iran, by 0.10 (p < 0.10). Respondents in the military treatments were split on whether the US government should pursue these retaliatory actions against the Chinese, Russian, and Iranian governments, with average responses of approximately 4 on the 7-point scale, and the proxy treatments had no discernible impact on these attitudes.\nThe third survey was intended to explore further the discrepancy between the sanction and retaliation outcomes by incorporating a new outcome question that asked respondents explicitly whether they wished the US government to deescalate, respond proportionally, or escalate (taking values of 0, 1, and 2 respectively). However, the proxy treatments also did not produce consistent effects on attitudes toward this escalate outcome. The Russian private security company did have a small, negative effect of 0.05 (p < 0.05) on the 3-point scale, compared to the Russian military treatment. On the other hand, the Iraqi militia returned a positive but insignificant effect compared to the Iranian military unit. In both scenarios, most respondents in the control group were split between preferring a deescalatory or proportional response: few wanted to escalate the conflict by striking back harder against the foreign country, and the proxy treatments did not have a substantial or consistent impact on these views.\nAs reported in the SI, the source identifying the involved actor -- whether US officials or journalists -- did not have a significant effect on the outcomes. In addition, the SI shows that effects of the proxy treatment did not vary consistently based on pre-existing attitudes toward China, Russia, and Iran.\n## Discussion\nThe results show a modest impact of the proxy treatments on respondents' attributions of blame and inconsistent effects on their views of how the US government should respond. Regarding the latter, respondents in the proxy treatments became less likely to prefer sanctioning senior government officials rather than individuals from the unit directly engaged in the hostilities; however, they did not become less likely to prefer retaliatory attacks against the foreign country, and they did not become less likely to support a response explicitly described as escalatory.\nTwo possible explanations may account for this divergence between the different response outcomes. One possibility is that delegation to proxies affects whom people prefer their governments to retaliate against, without necessarily affecting levels of support for the government to retaliate in some fashion. When forced to choose between the options of punishing senior government leaders or lower-level officials in the military unit or proxy organization, respondents in the proxy treatment groups were more likely to favor the latter. In other words, they preferred to retaliate against the proxy rather than the government itself. On the other hand, when confronted with outcomes that asked whether they would support retaliatory responses against the\nforeign country directly or not, without the option of targeting the proxy instead, their attitudes did not shift. This divergence could indicate that delegation may redirect pressure for retaliation toward the proxy, without necessarily limiting demands for the targeted government to respond in some way. In this case, using proxies could help to limit escalation risks, since public opinion preferring to retaliate against the proxy rather than the government should be less likely to trigger a spiral of intensifying conflict between the two adversaries.\nAnother possibility is that delegating to proxies may influence attitudes toward retaliatory options that are viewed as less risky, without shifting public opinion toward potentially costly responses involving direct attacks on powerful foreign adversaries. Sanctions are unlikely to trigger a major, destructive conflict between two countries, even if they deepen tensions. As a result, citizens in a targeted country may shift their views on the kinds of sanctions that are appropriate for responding to a provocation without needing to worry that their country will get dragged into a war. In this case, whether a proxy conducted the attack may influence the public's preferred response. With retaliation that involves significant cyber attacks or killing foreign soldiers, however, it becomes more probable that serious conflict could result. Citizens may have more entrenched views about whether it is worth risking such a conflict, such that their attitudes toward these forms of retaliation are less likely to shift due to a modest strengthening of plausible deniability that results from delegating to a proxy.\nThe article's theoretical framework suggests that delegating to proxies should reduce demands for retaliation by citizens in the targeted state because they are less likely to hold the adversarial government responsible for the attack. As expected, the proxy treatment did have an effect on respondents' attributions of blame for the hostile actions. However, the theoretical link breaks for the retaliate and escalate outcomes, since the proxy treatment did not affect support for these responses. As was just discussed, this discrepancy could be explained by respondents holding relatively entrenched views about the circumstances under which the US government should respond with violence to an adversarial state, with these attitudes unlikely to be affected by modest changes in perceptions of the foreign government's responsibility.\nDid the theoretical link hold for the sanctions outcome, with respondents in the proxy treatment less willing to sanction senior government officials because they blamed them less when the proxies conducted the attacks? Consistent with theoretical expectations, mediation analysis indicates that respondents' attributions of responsibility mediated approximately 14% of the proxy treatment's effects on preferences toward whom to sanction (Imai et al. 2011). However, this result also suggests the proxy treatment influenced the sanctions outcome through other mechanisms. One possibility is that respondents view the decision to use the proxy as a signal of the foreign government's desire to keep the conflict limited, so they become less willing to impose more punitive sanctions on that government's leadership in response. This mechanism could be explored in future research.\nEven if there is only a modest connection between how the public in a targeted country attributes responsibility for hostile actions and how they want their own\ngovernment to respond, attacking states may still benefit in other ways from relying on proxies to reduce their exposure to blame. It is likely that when a state is viewed as more responsible for an attack by its target's citizens, its reputation among the public in that country will decline. This declining reputation could have negative consequences for the public's willingness to engage or trade with the opposing state, resulting in political or economic costs for the attacker. As a result, states may still delegate to proxies in an effort to limit their exposure to blame for hostile actions, even if the primary motivation differs from trying to control escalation risks.\nAt the same time, the small magnitude of the effects on respondents' attributions of blame suggests that the use of proxies is unlikely to cause dramatic shifts in how people in targeted states think about responsibility for hostile acts. If a non-state actor is known to have strong ties to a foreign government, many people appear likely to assume that its activities are linked to its sponsor's goals and directives. However, it is possible the effect sizes represent a lower bound for how public opinion would react in real-world situations. First, the vignettes were designed to provide hard tests of the hypothesized relationships by relying on countries with authoritarian governments disliked by majorities of Americans. It is possible that delegating to proxies would have stronger effects when used by democracies or between states where citizens have more neutral views of the opposing governments. Second, it is plausible that the hypothetical -- and low-stakes -- nature of the vignettes made respondents less responsive to the treatments and more willing to record negative answers about countries they dislike. The vignettes were designed to reflect actual situations in which states have sought to obscure aspects of their foreign policies by delegating to proxies, and research comparing survey experiments to actual political attitudes suggests they do a reasonable job of generalizing to real political developments (e.g. Hainmueller et al. 2015). However, compared to real-world attacks, respondents may have felt less uncertainty about assigning blame to the foreign government in the survey.\nRegarding generalizability, the three scenarios produced relatively consistent results. The proxy treatments reduced attributions of blame and perceptions of high-level orders for the attacks with similarly-sized treatment effects for the three non-state actors in the China, Russia, and Iran incidents. The treatments also had similar effects on preferences toward sanctions, though the magnitude was smaller for Iran. One possible explanation for this difference is that sanctioning Iran had already been part of a prominent political debate for years by the time the surveys were implemented, resulting in more fixed attitudes on this question. Finally, for the retaliate and escalate outcomes, responses varied somewhat in their direction; however, the magnitudes were consistently small in all cases. These patterns suggest that how the public responds to attacks carried out by proxies may be relatively similar across different types of attacks and when linked to different sponsors.\nHowever, other issues of external validity suggest avenues for future research. First, the language used in the vignettes could be varied to create more or less contestation over responsibility. On the one hand, US officials or journalists could use softer language in their attributions, perhaps“suspecting” certain actors to be responsible for\nthe attack rather than “concluding” that they were. In certain cases, US officials may not even comment at all, and journalists or researchers may not have enough evidence to publish, leaving the public with little more than speculation about which foreign actor should be blamed. In these cases, the use of proxies may produce stronger plausible deniability. On the other hand, government officials or journalists could bring actual evidence to bear in their assertions of responsibility, while also directly calling into question the opposing government's denials of involvement, which could leave them more exposed to blame. Both approaches reflect real-world engagement around covert actions. Sometimes, both government and private sources tread cautiously in how they attribute responsibility. At other times, they release detailed reports along with evidence such as satellite imagery that are capable of shifting public opinion effectively (Lin-Greenberg and Milonopoulos 2021). It seems plausible that public opinion would respond differently based on the kinds of language and arguments used by private and public actors to shape perceptions of responsibility for covert action, and future research could explore this variation. In addition, it may be the case that people in countries outside the United States would react differently to attacks by proxies, particularly if these countries have more or less trustworthy media environments and political leaders, or if they have different historical experiences with conflict. Future research could evaluate how the results generalize to other countries.\n## Conclusion\nGovernments frequently rely on proxies to pursue their foreign policy objectives while maintaining plausible deniability of their involvement. This secrecy has been theorized to reduce risks of conflict escalation, in part by limiting domestic pressures on adversaries to retaliate. Yet, proxies often have well-documented and publicized ties to their sponsors, raising questions about the extent to which delegation to proxies can reduce escalation risks by shaping public opinion about responsibility for -- and responses to -- hostile acts.\nThe experiments discussed in this paper suggest that delegating to proxies can influence how people attribute responsibility for an attack on their country's interests, though the reported effect sizes are modest and imply that proxies may only strengthen plausible deniability on the margins. The modest effects could indicate that other factors will often provide stronger motives for governments to delegate to proxies, whether related to lower costs, their knowledge of local conditions, or signaling a lack of interest in escalation (Carson 2018; Eck 2015). Respondents in the proxy treatment were also substantially more supportive of limited sanctions rather than those targeting senior leadership of the sponsor government, indicating some effect on citizens' views of how their own government should respond to hostilities. These findings contribute to a growing literature on secrecy in international relations by implying that delegation can contribute modestly to plausible deniability while shaping preferences about whom to retaliate against, even in cases where proxies are closely controlled by their sponsors and the credibility of their independence should be relatively low. On the other hand,\nthe proxy treatment did not affect respondents' views of whether the US government should respond with more coercive and escalatory forms of retaliation, such as a major cyber attack on a Chinese city, killing Russian soldiers, or bombing targets in Iran. These null effects could result from respondents' holding more fixed attitudes about the contexts in which the United States should use force against adversarial states, with modest shifts in plausible deniability unlikely to change these views.\n## Acknowledgements\nI thank Bridging the Gap's New Era Workshop for motivating the project.

Delegating these actions to proxies is one strategy states use to retain plausible deniability and limit escalation risks. Yet, proxies often have strong ties to sponsoring states, raising questions about their ability to influence blame and demands for retaliation. This paper tests these effects by analyzing American responses to hypothetical attacks by Chinese, Russian, and Iranian actors through experiments administered on three surveys. The results show that using proxies for these attacks modestly reduced how much Americans blamed the respective foreign governments, while also limiting demands that their senior leadership be sanctioned. However, the use of proxies did not affect Americans' attitudes toward more forceful responses by the US government. These findings contribute to understanding of how proxies shape plausible deniability and escalation risks in international conflicts.\n# Keywords\nconflict management, domestic politics, foreign policy, interstate conflict\n$^{1}$ Department of Social and Political Sciences, Bocconi University, Milano, Italy\n# Corresponding Author:\nScott Williamson, Department of Social and Political Sciences, Bocconi University, Via Sarfatti, 25, Milano 20136, Italy.\nEmail: scott.williamson@unibocconi.it\nIntroduction\nIn February 2018, Syrian and Russian forces attacked an American outpost in Syria. The assault dragged on for more than four hours, during which hundreds of the attacking soldiers were killed. Despite fears the incident could trigger conflict between Russian and American forces in Syria, escalation did not occur. The Russian government quickly distanced itself from the attack by claiming they had no control over the soldiers, who were not part of the Russian military. Instead, they were employees of a private military company called the Wagner Group . This company has often served as a Russian proxy in conflicts where the government has not wished to involve itself openly, including in Libya, Ukraine, Venezuela, and Syria .\nCovert actions such as these are a common feature of international affairs, with states frequently attempting to disguise aspects of their foreign policies. Scholars have proposed that this emphasis on secrecy can contribute to stability within the international system by reducing the likelihood of conflict escalation . This advantage is thought to occur in part because adversaries who engage each other secretly should be less likely to trigger domestic pressures that push them to increase the scope of the conflict .\nDelegating to their non-state proxies is one strategy states use when trying to preserve secrecy around their involvement in hostile actions . In theory, the proxy's ability to claim independence from the chain of command can provide the state with more plausible deniability about their lack of responsibility. If this strategy is effective, it follows that public opinion in a targeted country should respond differently to denials of responsibility for hostile actions carried out by a state's proxies rather than its military or other security institutions. Specifically, this delegation should weaken attributions of blame against the attacking government while limiting demands for retaliation, thus mitigating pressures on the targeted government to respond. However, there are reasons to doubt whether proxies make deniability more plausible, since they frequently demonstrate strong ties to their patrons, which should undermine the credibility of claims that their decision-making is independent. Returning to the Russian Wagner Group, for example, the company's founder has a personal relationship with President Putin, and the company is known to receive funding, training, and equipment from the Russian military and intelligence apparatus . This relationship has become even more publicly apparent since the Russian invasion of Ukraine .\nTo date, there has been relatively little research on public opinion toward secrecy in international politics , including whether and how delegating hostile actions to proxies shapes public opinion. I evaluate whether this delegation can influence attributions of blame and demands for retaliation by implementing seven vignette experiments across three surveys of American adults. The vignettes address hypothetical attacks against US targets by Russian, Chinese, and\nIranian actors, with these countries' governments denying involvement in the attacks. Respondents are randomly assigned to read that the attackers were part of a military unit or proxy group tied to the foreign government, after which they assess responsibility for the incident and evaluate possible US responses. These countries were chosen not only because their governments rely frequently on covert action, but also because their authoritarian political systems and their unpopularity with the American public should create a hard test of the hypothesized relationships.\nThe results show that respondents become less likely to attribute responsibility to the adversarial governments when attacks were carried out by proxies. The effects are small, however, suggesting that the use of proxies with known ties to the sponsor may marginally strengthen a government's plausible deniability of involvement in an attack without substantially altering the extent to which citizens in the targeted state blame that government. The results also provide mixed support for the ability of covert action to mitigate demands for escalation. Respondents in the proxy treatment groups are substantially less likely to support sanctioning the senior leadership of the adversarial governments instead of subordinate individuals involved directly in the attacks, and this effect is partially mediated by the treatment's effects on respondents' attributions of blame. However, respondents are not less likely to support forceful, retaliatory attacks by the US government that would reflect a clear escalation of the conflict. One interpretation of these findings is that delegation to proxies may help reduce escalation risks by increasing the likelihood that the targeted public prefers to retaliate against the proxy itself, but is less likely to influence citizens' views on their government responding to hostilities with coercive and forceful forms of retaliation.\nThese findings contribute to international relations research on secrecy by providing experimental evidence that both reinforces and expands on existing theories about the effects of covert action and plausible deniability on conflict, insofar as they provide some evidence that acting covertly through proxies can reduce a government's exposure to blame and shape how citizens in a targeted country think about the appropriate response (e.g. Carnegie and Carson 2018; Carson 2016; Hedgecock and Sukin 2023; Joseph and Poznansky 2018). They also extend a nascent body of work on public opinion toward the role of non-state proxies in international politics (e.g. Plana 2020). In addition, by showing that authoritarian regimes can reduce their exposure to blame in international conflicts by delegating to non-state proxies, the findings contribute to a large literature on blame avoidance that has to date focused primarily on domestic politics and democratic political systems .\nThis article proceeds as follows. It first reviews literature on covert action and secrecy in international politics before outlining expectations about the effects of proxies on attributions of responsibility and demands for retaliation. It then discusses the selected cases and research design for the experiments, before presenting the results. The article concludes with a discussion of external validity and implications for international relations research.\n##\nSecrecy, Delegation, and Conflict Escalation\nSecrecy is a common feature of international politics , and a growing literature seeks to explain why states might attempt to conceal outcomes ranging from military alliances to the resolution of international legal disputes or crises . Covert action reflects one aspect of secrecy in the international system, whereby states attempt to obscure their involvement in hostile activities targeting another state or political entity. Well-known examples include the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba by US-backed Cuban exiles, or participation by Soviet pilots in the Korean War against the United States. As with these examples, covert operations or their outcomes tend to be visible publicly, and the objective is not to keep the acts themselves secret, but rather to conceal or create doubt about who was involved .\nThe identity of the responsible actor does not always stay secret to other states, whose governments often have the intelligence capacity to make reasonable determinations about who is behind an attack. Even so, the costs and risks associated with covert operations can prove useful by signaling resolve to the observing states . Furthermore, covert action is more likely to succeed at concealing the identity of the responsible actor from the public. As a result, states may rely on it to obscure aspects of their foreign policy that would damage their reputations domestically or abroad . For example, democracies may use covert action against other democracies to avoid domestic backlash for violating the expectation that they remain on good terms with democratic governments . Relatedly, governments may delegate violence against civilians to non-state actors to obscure their involvement from international audiences who would respond negatively to human rights violations .\nBy providing plausible deniability that conceals responsibility for hostile activities from the public, covert action has been theorized to help adversarial states reduce the risks of conflict escalation. Research indicates that political and military leaders are susceptible to pressure from public opinion when deciding whether and how to deploy military force . Keeping hostilities on the “backstage” and out of the public eye should help states to avoid pressures from hawkish domestic constituencies who wish to expand the scope of the conflict, while allowing states to signal to each other that they do not want to escalate . In other words, by obscuring their involvement, states may be able to limit escalation risks in part by decreasing the likelihood that citizens in the targeted country demand a response from their own government that would escalate the conflict. As an example of this mechanism in action, Carson (2018, 21) notes how Nazi Germany monitored foreign reactions to its involvement in the Spanish Civil War and “...carefully calibrated covert German combat participation in light of hawkish domestic sentiment in London and Paris.”\nBecause the point of covert action is to obscure the identity of the responsible actor, states often pursue these operations through their proxies, whether corporations, informal militias, or “volunteer” fighters. Research on blame attributions and accountability implies that this strategy of delegating to proxies should be effective at creating plausible deniability that influences perceptions of responsibility in the targeted state. People are more likely to believe an actor is responsible for an outcome when they have direct control over the decision-making process that produces the outcome . In cases where delegation occurs and multiple decision-makers are involved, clarity of responsibility is diminished and political actors are more capable of avoiding blame . Experimental research suggests these blame avoidance benefits can occur even when people know the delegator and delegatee share the same interests . In terms of international relations, proxies such as militias or corporations are entities separate from the state apparatus, and, at least in theory, they can make decisions more independently than a military or intelligence unit. This potential independence should make it harder for citizens in the targeted state to determine whether an action occurred because of directives from the sponsor or because of the proxy's own initiative. As a result, delegating to proxies should increase plausible deniability and help the sponsor to limit how much it is held responsible by citizens of the targeted state.\nAs noted in the literature on covert action, governments may benefit from this redirection of perceived responsibility for several reasons, including protecting their political support domestically and their soft power internationally if their involvement in the hostile acts would be viewed negatively . Of primary interest to this article is that shifting blame through covert operations may also help governments to reduce the likelihood of citizens in the targeted country demanding retaliation that escalates the conflict . The blame avoidance literature provides a framework for understanding why delegating to proxies could shape attitudes toward retaliation as well. Because blame helps people to identify who should be held accountable for a problematic outcome, those who limit their exposure to blame should face fewer demands that they be punished . Thus, if delegating to a proxy can reduce how many people in the targeted country blame the sponsoring state for a hostile action, it follows that these people may also become less likely to want their government to hold that state accountable by retaliating against it. In other words, using proxies to conduct covert actions could weaken domestic pressure on the targeted government to expand the conflict, which would reduce escalation risks by limiting incentives for political and military leaders to respond forcefully .\nFrom this theoretical framework, I expect the following when hostile actions are known to be conducted by a state's proxies rather than its own military forces. First, when a proxy is involved, I expect that respondents will be more likely to believe a foreign government's denials of responsibility -- i.e. they will blame the government less. Second, because respondents attribute less blame to the foreign government, I\nexpect that they will be less likely to support retaliation against that government as well.\nHowever, there are also reasons to expect that delegating to proxies may have little effect on attributions of responsibility or attitudes toward retaliation. First, proxies often lack credible separation from their sponsors. If the proxy is a domestic entity with legal status within the sponsoring country, it may be constrained in its ability to pursue foreign policy objectives that contradict those of the government. This limitation is especially likely to apply in authoritarian regimes, where the government controls most domestic organizations closely to ensure that they do not work against the authorities. Foreign proxies of a government might have more credible claims to independence, since they exist outside that government's legal and coercive apparatus. Nonetheless, in these cases, journalists and foreign governments often go to great lengths to publicize ties between the proxy and its sponsor. If people do not believe that the proxy has genuine independence to operate, they are unlikely to absolve the sponsoring state of blame.\nSecond, if citizens in the targeted state dislike the sponsor government intensely and are primed to distrust it, they may discount claims of separation from the proxy. This reaction may be particularly likely in contexts where two states have a history of poor relations -- i.e. the contexts in which hostile covert actions are most likely to be conducted. Finally, citizens of a targeted state may blame the sponsor of an attacking proxy for failing to control their proxy, even if the sponsors did not intend for the attack to happen.\n## Research Design\nTo test how covert action by proxies influences attributions of blame and demands for retaliation, I implemented seven vignette experiments across three surveys administered online in the United States. Experiments have become increasingly common in the international relations literature, and they are particularly useful for studying IR theories that involve public opinion  -- including issues of secrecy and covert action (e.g. Myrick 2019). The following sections provide further details about the design.\n### Samples\nThe first survey was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 1299 American adults recruited by the firm Lucid in April 2019. Each respondent read and answered outcome questions for two vignettes: one involving China, and the other involving Russia. The survey was designed with the expectations about delegation, blame, and escalation in mind but was exploratory and not pre-registered.\nThe second survey was pre-registered. I specified hypotheses and analyses that would indicate replication of findings from the first survey, and I expanded the experiment by adding additional outcome questions in line with the theoretical\nexpectations. This second survey was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 3053 respondents recruited by Lucid in March 2021. Each respondent on the second survey saw the same China and Russia vignettes used on the first survey. In addition, they also read and responded to questions about a vignette involving Iran.\nThe third survey was intended to provide an additional replication check, while also facilitating exploratory analysis of patterns identified in the second survey. It was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 2007 American adults recruited by Lucid in May 2021. This survey used the Russia and Iran vignettes but dropped the China vignette due to time constraints. All three surveys were representative on age, gender, income, ethnicity, and US region. Summary statistics can be found in the SI.\n### Case Selection\nI chose to center my vignettes around hostile actions attributed to Chinese, Russian, and Iranian actors. These three cases are useful for several reasons. The first is that all three countries are relatively unpopular in the United States due to a history of adversarial relations. My survey data highlights these unfavorable perceptions among American adults. In the first survey in 2019, 15% of respondents reported a favorable view of Russia and 16% said the same about China. In the second survey in 2021, only 25% of respondents said they had a favorable view of China, 20% reported a favorable view of Russia, and 11% claimed to have a favorable view of Iran. These negative attitudes should make it less likely that respondents would give these governments the benefit of the doubt when they deny involvement in hostile actions carried out by their proxies. The second reason is that all three countries are governed by authoritarian regimes. China's government operates a massive surveillance state that exercises extensive control over the population. Russia and Iran also control their societies closely. These political systems make it less likely that proxy groups are operating independently of the authorities, which should reduce the credibility of delegation and make it less likely that people believe that the proxy's sponsor was not involved. These first two reasons suggest the countries provide a hard test of the hypothesized effects.\nFinally, the third reason is that all three countries regularly engage in covert action to advance their foreign policy objectives, and they frequently do so by delegating to non-state proxies that are believed to provide a degree of plausible deniability. As such, the survey vignettes should be highly relevant to real-world events. In the following paragraphs, I briefly discuss examples from each case.\nChina: As cyber activities have become increasingly important for global politics, China has invested heavily in its cyber capabilities to gather political and economic intelligence . The Chinese government has used a variety of actors to conduct cyberattacks, including military personnel. In 2020, the US government charged four members of the People's Liberation Army for hacking the credit agency Equifax and acquiring data on tens of millions of Americans (US Department of Justice 2020). This case reflected a long history of Chinese state hackers conducting economic espionage against American corporations . At the same time, the\ngovernment also works through proxies, including Chinese corporations and hacking groups. Chinese technology companies such as Huawei have been linked to espionage, with their equipment used to facilitate cyber intrusions , monitor the domestic population , and process stolen data . Chinese security officers have also established front companies to conduct cyberattacks. In a criminal case against four Chinese citizens accused of economic espionage, the US government alleged that the individuals were Chinese security officials in a provincial branch of the Ministry of State Security (MSS) who had “sought to obfuscate the Chinese government's role in such theft by establishing a front company, Hainan Xiandun Technology Department Co. Ltd” (US Department of Justice 2021).\nSeveral hacking groups have also been identified as proxies conducting cyberattacks on behalf of the Chinese government. An attack on Microsoft Exchange in 2021 was attributed to a group given the name Hafnium, which has been linked to the MSS by Western governments . Another operation, known as Cloud Hopper, was attributed to the group APT10, which has also been connected to the MSS . While Western governments have attributed responsibility for the actions of these groups to the Chinese government, some ambiguity remains about the nature of the relationship. For instance, there is evidence that APT10 has also conducted cyberattacks to steal information for personal gain, raising questions about whether the group “enjoys protections that enable it to conduct its own for-profit activities” or “has simply evaded scrutiny from Chinese authorities” .\nRussia: The Russian government has made extensive use of proxies to achieve its foreign policy objectives. In Ukraine, prior to the invasion of 2022, it encouraged and then supported separatist groups in their attempts to establish independent states tied closely to Russia (International Crisis Group 2019), a tactic it has used to expand its influence in other countries including Georgia and Moldova . Russia has also increasingly turned to private military companies to advance its interests abroad , the most well-known of which is the Wagner Group that has already been mentioned. These organizations have participated in conflicts in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe, receiving private gains while also extending Russia's influence. In Sudan, the Wagner Group was deployed in 2017 to help repress uprisings against Omar Al-Bashir. As payment, the company's owner was given exclusive rights to mine gold in the country, and the Russian government was later offered a naval base on the Red Sea before Al-Bashir was overthrown in 2019 . These companies exist in a legal gray area under Russian law and are technically separate from the state, even as they are owned and directed by individuals with close ties to President Putin and the security elite .\nWhile the connections are clear between Moscow and the proxies discussed above, debate has continued about how closely the Russian government controls them. Regarding private military companies like the Wagner Group, the extent to which they are “simply patriotic volunteers as the Kremlin claims...on official assignment for Russia's GRU intelligence service...mercenaries, corporate warriors, or frontline\nsoldiers” remains unclear . All of these identities may be true at different moments, fostering uncertainty about their role in specific conflicts or time periods. Analysts have argued that this ambiguity provides enough plausible deniability to help Russia avoid accountability for human rights violations and limit escalation risks in the conflicts in which these organizations are involved .\nIran: The use of proxy groups to extend its influence in the Middle East has been a central component of Iran's foreign policy for decades. The Iranian government maintains close ties with militant organizations and political movements in countries including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine, Pakistan, Syria, and Yemen . These organizations have received financial support, weapons, and training from Iran and often work closely with the Revolutionary Guard to advance the country's regional interests. They include Hezbollah in Lebanon, which operates a successful political party and a well-armed militia that has fought alongside the Syrian and Iranian governments in the Syrian civil war. They also include several militias in Iraq that have a formal relationship with the Iraqi armed forces , such as Kata'ib Hizballah, Asaib Ahl Al-Haq, and Harakat Hezbollah Al-Nujaba . These groups participate openly in the political system, where they have worked to pull Iraq closer to Iran, and they have also taken part in armed attacks on US and Saudi targets .\nDespite their close ties to Iran, most of these groups have their own domestic political interests and are not controlled fully from Tehran. In Yemen, Iranian support for the Houthis does not outweigh the group's own interests in fighting its domestic opponents and their international backers . While Iran does at times exercise direct influence over the decision-making of Hezbollah in Lebanon, its influence is usually indirect and decisions are made by Hezbollah's leaders . Likewise, the Iranian-aligned militias in Iraq are involved in Iraqi politics and frequently pursue their own political interests . Though they coordinate militant activities closely with Iran's Revolutionary Guard, they are not entirely beholden to them and often act independently. For example, the failed assassination attempt against Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi in 2021 was suspected to have been carried out by one of the Iranian-aligned militias without approval from Iran . In addition, the militias have often attacked US forces even at moments when Iran is attempting to deescalate relations with the United States . The fact that these groups will act in their own interest can create ambiguity about the extent of Iranian involvement.\n### Vignettes\nFor each vignette in my surveys, respondents were provided with information about an attack linked to an adversarial foreign power against US interests. All details of the situation were held constant, except for the identity of the organization alleged to have carried out the attack. Respondents were told that the vignettes were hypothetical to\nensure no deception about events that could cause anger toward a foreign country. However, the content of the vignettes was selected to reflect real-world political developments discussed in the cases above. Respondents were told that the actor involved in the attack had been identified, and the attacker was randomized to be a military unit or proxy of the foreign government. The vignettes always noted that the relevant foreign government had denied foreknowledge of the attack and blamed it on a rogue operation. Because I am interested in how delegation to proxies affects public opinion by giving the government greater plausible deniability or not, it was important to be clear that the foreign government had denied involvement across the treatment groups. These scenarios reflect real-world use of covert action, where the attack is usually observed by everyone, there are attempts by government officials, journalists, and researchers to figure out who was directly involved, and the government on which the most suspicion is cast publicly denies responsibility.\nIn the first survey, the identity of the attacking organization was said to be determined by US officials. In the second and third surveys, I randomized whether the identity was determined by US officials or journalists. I included this additional randomization to account for the possibility that the source of information would shape responses to the proxy versus military treatments. It is possible that respondents would perceive US officials attributing blame to a proxy rather than the military as a signal that the US government did not wish to escalate the conflict, rather than as an objective statement about who was directly involved in the attack. In this case, respondents might attribute less blame to the foreign government and demand less escalation not because they believed the foreign government was less directly involved, but because they trusted the US government had good reasons to avoid escalation. However, I do not find any meaningful or consistent differences based on this randomization.\nThe China vignette discussed a cyberattack that stole valuable technology from a US company. The vignette randomized whether the attack was attributed to a Chinese military unit, private corporation, or state-run corporation. The state-run corporation should create less plausible deniability than the private corporation; however, its distance from the chain of command could strengthen that plausibility relative to the military unit. As discussed above, Chinese hackers linked to both state institutions and private companies have previously stolen sensitive technologies from American companies .\nThe Russia vignette involved an attack on US soldiers in Syria by Russian forces. The attack was attributed either to soldiers in a Russian military unit or a Russian private military company. Throughout the Syrian civil war, American soldiers have been involved in clashes with Russian military forces but also members of the private Russian military companies that are used as proxy forces .\nFinally, the Iran vignette detailed an attack on US forces in Iraq by actors linked to Iran. Respondents were randomly assigned to read that the attack was connected to an Iranian military unit or an Iraqi militia with ties to Iran. These incidents have also occurred frequently since the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. As noted above, the attacks are often linked to Iranian-sponsored militias , but Iranian forces have been involved directly as well .\nThe full text of the vignettes are below:China Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that a Chinese (military unit/state-owned corporation/private corporation) was behind a major cyber attack on a US energy company, in which hackers stole valuable technological plans for a new renewable energy source. The Chinese government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on a rogue operation by hackers in the (military unit/state-owned corporation/private corporation).Russia Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that soldiers from a Russian (military unit/private security company) were behind an attack on US forces in Syria that killed two American soldiers. The Russian government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on officers in the (military unit/private security company) on the ground in Syria.Iran Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that soldiers from (an Iranian military unit/an Iraqi militia with ties to Iran) were behind a rocket attack on US forces in Iraq that killed two American soldiers. The Iranian government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on rogue officers in the (military unit/militia) in Iraq.\nAll randomizations within each scenario occurred with equal probability. Balance tests are reported in the SI.\nAn important motive for using multiple scenarios was to assess whether the effects of delegating to proxies would generalize to different situations in which covert action is commonly used. The scenarios reflect different types of attacks (cyber vs kinetic), different foreign governments (China, Russia, and Iran), and different proxies (corporations and militias). My expectation was that delegation would have similar effects across the scenarios, as the theoretical logic -- more credible independence of the proxy reducing attributions of blame and therefore demands for retaliation -- should apply even as the specific details vary. However, it is possible that these different scenarios would produce variation in responses. For example, cyber attacks may affect public opinion differently than kinetic attacks by limiting demands for forceful retaliation (e.g. Kreps and Schneider 2019). I explore generalizability further while discussing the results.\nOutcomes\nFollowing each vignette, respondents were asked outcome questions to assess their attributions of responsibility for the attacks and their views about how the US government should respond.\nRegarding responsibility, respondents on all three surveys were asked if the foreign governments should be blamed for the attacks. The question was worded “Do you agree or disagree that the [relevant] government should be blamed for this attack?” On the second and third surveys, respondents were also asked about who had ordered the attack, with the question “Do you think it is likely or unlikely senior officials in the [relevant] government ordered this attack?” This question provided a more direct assessment of whether respondents believed high-level officials were directly involved in -- and therefore responsible for -- the action. Answers for both questions ranged from strongly agree to strongly disagree on a 7 point Likert scale, with stronger attributions of responsibility coded as higher values. If respondents in the proxy treatment groups became less likely to blame the foreign governments and less likely to believe they ordered the attacks, it would provide support for the expectation that delegating to proxies can strengthen plausible deniability and help governments avoid blame in targeted states.\nRegarding the US response, respondents on the first and second surveys were asked if the US government should pursue targeted sanctions against the lower-level officials in the relevant proxies or military units, or if the US government should implement sanctions against senior officials in the respective governments. The question was worded as follows: “The US government is deciding how to respond to the attack. Which option do you see as a more appropriate response?” Respondents could then choose that “The US government responds by sanctioning the officers in charge of the [military unit/corporation/militia] or that “The US government responds by sanctioning senior officials in the [relevant] government. This latter option would be more likely to escalate conflict and deepen tensions between the two countries, since it reflects a direct attempt to punish the most important decision-makers in the foreign state. For example, the Chinese government responded angrily to US sanctions on senior Chinese officials over its Hong Kong policies . In other words, respondents were forced to choose between a response that would hold accountable only those individuals involved directly in the event, or a stronger, more escalatory response that would hold accountable the top levels of the foreign government.\nOn the second survey, respondents were also asked if they would support US retaliation involving attacks on the respective countries, with answers ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree on a 7 point Likert scale. The first part of the question stated that “The US government is also deciding whether to retaliate by...” The remainder of the question specified actions including a “hacking attack that cuts off electricity to a major Chinese city” for the Chinese vignette, an attack “targeting several Russian soldiers in Syria” for the Russia vignette, and “bombing military targets in Iran” for the Iran vignette. In each case, the proposed US response was designed to\nappear escalatory. Cutting power to a major Chinese city would reflect an escalation over stealing technology; killing “several” Russian soldiers implies a higher cost on Russia than the two US soldiers killed; and bombing Iran would reflect an escalation from the tit-for-tat conflict between the two countries in Iraq.\nOne possible limitation of the second question is that respondents were not asked directly whether they would prefer to escalate, and some respondents may not have viewed the retaliatory options as escalatory. As a result, for the Iran and Russia vignettes included on the third survey, I used an outcome question designed to follow up on patterns identified in the first and second surveys by asking respondents directly about their attitudes toward escalation. The question stated that “The US government is deciding how to respond to the attack. Which option do you see as the most appropriate response?” Respondents could then choose between three options: that the US government “decides to deescalate by not targeting any [relevant government] soldiers,” that the US government “decides to respond proportionally by targeting and killing two [relevant government] soldiers, or that the US government “decides to escalate by targeting and killing twenty [relevant government] soldiers.” Because time was more limited on the third survey, I was unable to include the other two outcome questions about how the US government should respond to the attack.\nIf respondents in the proxy treatment group became more likely to prefer targeted sanctions, less likely to support a retaliatory attack, and less likely to approve explicitly of escalation, it would be consistent with delegation to proxies reducing pressure on the targeted government to escalate the conflict.\nTable 1 reports the mean and standard deviation for each outcome measure. It also illustrates which questions were asked for which country vignette on which surveys. In general, respondents are somewhat likely to blame the foreign government for the attacks and to believe that senior officials ordered them. Regarding the sanction outcome, respondents tend to be roughly split on whether sanctions should target higher-level authorities or the specific individuals involved in the attacks. Support for retaliating with force is lower, with respondents neutral on average about the retaliatory attack outcome, and with respondents mostly split between the US government either deescalating or responding proportionally -- but not escalating -- for the escalation outcome.\n## Results\nI use two approaches to report treatment effects. First, I aggregate data across the three scenarios on the three surveys, creating a single proxy treatment indicator for respondents assigned to the Chinese corporation, Russian private security company, or Iranian-aligned Iraqi militia treatments in each of the experiments. I use OLS to regress the outcomes on the proxy treatment. Dummy variables for the scenarios are included to account for different baseline responses in the military conditions, and I cluster standard errors by respondent, since each respondent completed more than one scenario on the same survey . Analyzing the\nWilliamson\n\n|  Variable - Country | Survey 1 | Survey 2 | Survey 3  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Blame - China | 5.18 (1.46) | 5.18 (1.46) |   |\n|  Blame - Russia | 5.15 (1.52) | 5.16 (1.47) | 5.09 (1.44)  |\n|  Blame - Iran |  | 5.31 (1.44) | 5.27 (1.40)  |\n|  Ordered - China |  | 5.42 (1.43) |   |\n|  Ordered - Russia |  | 5.27 (1.48) | 5.25 (1.43)  |\n|  Ordered - Iran |  | 5.42 (1.44) | 5.43 (1.40)  |\n|  Sanction - China | 0.51 (0.50) | 0.47 (0.50) |   |\n|  Sanction - Russia | 0.55 (0.50) | 0.46 (0.50) |   |\n|  Sanction - Iran |  | 0.49 (0.50) |   |\n|  Retaliate - China |  | 4.04 (1.85) |   |\n|  Retaliate - Russia |  | 4.26 (1.75) |   |\n|  Retaliate - Iran |  | 4.54 (1.73) |   |\n|  Escalate - China |  |  |   |\n|  Escalate - Russia |  |  | 0.42 (0.63)  |\n|  Escalate - Iran |  |  | 0.54 (0.72)  |\nMean (SD) reported for each outcome measure.\nRange for blame, ordered, attack: 1-7.\nRange for sanction: 0-1; Range for escalate: 0-2.\naggregated data, which was pre-registered with the pre-analysis plan for the second survey, is useful for providing an overall assessment of how delegating to proxies affected responses to the different outcomes across multiple surveys and scenarios. Second, I then provide treatment effects for each of the scenarios on each survey to assess consistency. These effects are also analyzed with OLS regression, using models that control for age, gender, education, political interest, partisanship, foreign policy orientation, and region of residence. These controls were also pre-registered. They are relevant to foreign policy attitudes, are correlated with the outcomes, and were measured pre-treatment, so they can help to increase precision . Results without control variables are consistent and are reported in the SI.\nTable 2 reports main effects for the proxy treatment in the aggregated data. The first two columns show results for the outcomes related to attributions of responsibility, with the first showing the effect of the treatment on perceptions that the foreign government should be blamed for the attack, and the second showing the effect on beliefs that senior officials in the foreign government ordered the attack. For both outcomes, assignment to the proxy treatment reduces attributions of responsibility by 0.14 on the seven point scale  $(p &lt; 0.001)$ . This effect is equivalent to a shift of approximately one-tenth of a standard deviation, indicating a modest impact on how respondents attribute responsibility for the hostilities. This small decrease occurred from relatively high levels of blame directed at the foreign government in the military treatments, where the\nJournal of Conflict Resolution 68(2-3)\nTable 2.

The effect of the proxy treatment on the sanctions outcome is substantively large. Respondents assigned to the proxy groups are 9 percentage points less likely to prefer sanctioning senior government officials over officials in the specific unit involved in the attack  $(p &lt; 0.001)$ . This effect reflects a shift of approximately two-fifths of a standard deviation and reduces support for the more escalatory sanctions below a majority of respondents. However, the proxy treatment did not have any influence on the other two response outcomes. Though coefficients were negative in both cases, they were near zero and statistically insignificant. In other words, respondents who read that proxies conducted the hostilities were not less likely to support retaliatory attacks by the United States against the relevant foreign country, and they were not less likely to support a response directly described as escalatory.\nNext, I report the effects for the proxy treatment in each scenario across the three surveys. These effects are displayed in Figures 1 and 2. The former addresses the attribution outcomes and the latter shows the response outcomes.\nFor the attribution outcomes, the treatment effects point in a consistent direction that reflects the negative effect in the aggregated results. Regarding blame, respondents in the first and second surveys who read that the hacking attack was carried out by a Chinese private corporation were 0.22 ( $p &lt; 0.05$ ) and 0.10 ( $p &lt; 0.10$ ) less likely to attribute responsibility to the Chinese government compared to respondents in the military treatment. On the other hand, the coefficients for the Chinese state corporation were negative but statistically insignificant in both surveys. Relative to the military treatment in the Russia scenario, the private security treatment reduced blame directed at the Russian government by 0.15 ( $p &lt; 0.10$ ) in the first survey, by 0.18 ( $p &lt; 0.001$ ) in the second survey, and by 0.13 ( $p &lt; 0.05$ ) in the third survey. Finally, for the Iran scenario, the militia treatment decreased blame relative to the military treatment by 0.20\nWilliamson\n\n$(p &lt; 0.001)$ in the second survey, and it was negative but insignificant in the third survey.\nFor the ordered outcome, respondents on the second survey were less likely to believe the attack was carried out on orders of senior officials in the foreign government by 0.16 $(p &lt; 0.01)$ when exposed to the Chinese private corporation treatment. Again, however, the effect of the state corporation was negative but not statistically significant. For the second survey, the private security treatment reduced the Russian government's perceived role by 0.12 $(p &lt; 0.05)$, while the Iraqi militia treatment reduced the Iranian government's perceived role in ordering the attacks by 0.21 $(p &lt; 0.001)$. On the third survey, the Russia treatment lost significance but the Iran treatment continued to reduce the perceived role by 0.10 $(p &lt; 0.10)$.\nWhile there is some variation across the scenarios and surveys, these effects are consistent with the aggregate data. They suggest that individuals may be less likely to attribute responsibility to foreign governments that have denied involvement in an attack when that attack is conducted by proxies, and this pattern appears with different countries and different types of hostilities. However, the modest effect sizes also imply that delegating to proxies is unlikely to substantially transform public perceptions of blame in these scenarios. In terms of\nJournal of Conflict Resolution 68(2-3)\nvariation across the treatments, the Chinese state-run corporation effect was consistently insignificant and weaker than the others. Though the difference is small, it reflects the expectation that plausible deniability should be stronger when the proxies have more credible separation from the sponsoring state.\nFor the response outcomes shown in Figure 2, the results are generally consistent as well. Proxies strongly reduce support for sanctioning senior government officials but produce limited to no effects on attitudes toward retaliatory attacks that could escalate the conflict.\nRegarding the sanctions outcome, respondents in the proxy treatment groups were consistently less likely to prefer sanctions against senior government officials over more targeted sanctions against lower-level officials in the organization that conducted the attack. In contrast to the responsibility outcomes, this finding applied to both Chinese corporation treatments. In the first and second surveys, the Chinese private corporation reduced the preference for senior-level sanctions by  $12(p &lt; 0.001)$  and  $16(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points, while the state-run corporation reduced this preference by  $12(p &lt; 0.001)$  and  $14(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points. Likewise, the Russian security company reduced support for sanctioning senior officials by  $8(p &lt; 0.01)$  and  $10(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points in the first and second surveys. The effect for the Iraqi militia treatment was smaller, reducing support for sanctions on senior Iranian officials by approximately 4 percentage points  $(p &lt; 0.05)$ .\nFor the retaliate and escalate outcomes, however, the proxy treatment produced effects that were inconsistent in their direction and for the most part statistically insignificant. For retaliate, the Chinese state corporation treatment slightly increased\nFigure 2. Treatment effects for response outcomes. Note: Plot displays coefficients for treatment effects from surveys 1, 2, and 3, with effects estimated by OLS regression with control variables for age, gender, education, political interest, partisanship, foreign policy orientation, and region of residence.\nsupport for the hacking attack on the electrical grid of a Chinese city, though the effect was insignificant. The Chinese private corporation and the Russian security company produced very small, negative effects that failed to attain statistical significance. The Iraqi militia treatment slightly reduced support for bombing military targets in Iran, by 0.10 (p < 0.10). Respondents in the military treatments were split on whether the US government should pursue these retaliatory actions against the Chinese, Russian, and Iranian governments, with average responses of approximately 4 on the 7-point scale, and the proxy treatments had no discernible impact on these attitudes.\nThe third survey was intended to explore further the discrepancy between the sanction and retaliation outcomes by incorporating a new outcome question that asked respondents explicitly whether they wished the US government to deescalate, respond proportionally, or escalate (taking values of 0, 1, and 2 respectively). However, the proxy treatments also did not produce consistent effects on attitudes toward this escalate outcome. The Russian private security company did have a small, negative effect of 0.05 (p < 0.05) on the 3-point scale, compared to the Russian military treatment. On the other hand, the Iraqi militia returned a positive but insignificant effect compared to the Iranian military unit. In both scenarios, most respondents in the control group were split between preferring a deescalatory or proportional response: few wanted to escalate the conflict by striking back harder against the foreign country, and the proxy treatments did not have a substantial or consistent impact on these views.\nAs reported in the SI, the source identifying the involved actor -- whether US officials or journalists -- did not have a significant effect on the outcomes. In addition, the SI shows that effects of the proxy treatment did not vary consistently based on pre-existing attitudes toward China, Russia, and Iran.\n## Discussion\nThe results show a modest impact of the proxy treatments on respondents' attributions of blame and inconsistent effects on their views of how the US government should respond. Regarding the latter, respondents in the proxy treatments became less likely to prefer sanctioning senior government officials rather than individuals from the unit directly engaged in the hostilities; however, they did not become less likely to prefer retaliatory attacks against the foreign country, and they did not become less likely to support a response explicitly described as escalatory.\nTwo possible explanations may account for this divergence between the different response outcomes. One possibility is that delegation to proxies affects whom people prefer their governments to retaliate against, without necessarily affecting levels of support for the government to retaliate in some fashion. When forced to choose between the options of punishing senior government leaders or lower-level officials in the military unit or proxy organization, respondents in the proxy treatment groups were more likely to favor the latter. In other words, they preferred to retaliate against the proxy rather than the government itself. On the other hand, when confronted with outcomes that asked whether they would support retaliatory responses against the\nforeign country directly or not, without the option of targeting the proxy instead, their attitudes did not shift. This divergence could indicate that delegation may redirect pressure for retaliation toward the proxy, without necessarily limiting demands for the targeted government to respond in some way. In this case, using proxies could help to limit escalation risks, since public opinion preferring to retaliate against the proxy rather than the government should be less likely to trigger a spiral of intensifying conflict between the two adversaries.\nAnother possibility is that delegating to proxies may influence attitudes toward retaliatory options that are viewed as less risky, without shifting public opinion toward potentially costly responses involving direct attacks on powerful foreign adversaries. Sanctions are unlikely to trigger a major, destructive conflict between two countries, even if they deepen tensions. As a result, citizens in a targeted country may shift their views on the kinds of sanctions that are appropriate for responding to a provocation without needing to worry that their country will get dragged into a war. In this case, whether a proxy conducted the attack may influence the public's preferred response. With retaliation that involves significant cyber attacks or killing foreign soldiers, however, it becomes more probable that serious conflict could result. Citizens may have more entrenched views about whether it is worth risking such a conflict, such that their attitudes toward these forms of retaliation are less likely to shift due to a modest strengthening of plausible deniability that results from delegating to a proxy.\nThe article's theoretical framework suggests that delegating to proxies should reduce demands for retaliation by citizens in the targeted state because they are less likely to hold the adversarial government responsible for the attack. As expected, the proxy treatment did have an effect on respondents' attributions of blame for the hostile actions. However, the theoretical link breaks for the retaliate and escalate outcomes, since the proxy treatment did not affect support for these responses. As was just discussed, this discrepancy could be explained by respondents holding relatively entrenched views about the circumstances under which the US government should respond with violence to an adversarial state, with these attitudes unlikely to be affected by modest changes in perceptions of the foreign government's responsibility.\nDid the theoretical link hold for the sanctions outcome, with respondents in the proxy treatment less willing to sanction senior government officials because they blamed them less when the proxies conducted the attacks? Consistent with theoretical expectations, mediation analysis indicates that respondents' attributions of responsibility mediated approximately 14% of the proxy treatment's effects on preferences toward whom to sanction . However, this result also suggests the proxy treatment influenced the sanctions outcome through other mechanisms. One possibility is that respondents view the decision to use the proxy as a signal of the foreign government's desire to keep the conflict limited, so they become less willing to impose more punitive sanctions on that government's leadership in response. This mechanism could be explored in future research.\nEven if there is only a modest connection between how the public in a targeted country attributes responsibility for hostile actions and how they want their own\ngovernment to respond, attacking states may still benefit in other ways from relying on proxies to reduce their exposure to blame. It is likely that when a state is viewed as more responsible for an attack by its target's citizens, its reputation among the public in that country will decline. This declining reputation could have negative consequences for the public's willingness to engage or trade with the opposing state, resulting in political or economic costs for the attacker. As a result, states may still delegate to proxies in an effort to limit their exposure to blame for hostile actions, even if the primary motivation differs from trying to control escalation risks.\nAt the same time, the small magnitude of the effects on respondents' attributions of blame suggests that the use of proxies is unlikely to cause dramatic shifts in how people in targeted states think about responsibility for hostile acts. If a non-state actor is known to have strong ties to a foreign government, many people appear likely to assume that its activities are linked to its sponsor's goals and directives. However, it is possible the effect sizes represent a lower bound for how public opinion would react in real-world situations. First, the vignettes were designed to provide hard tests of the hypothesized relationships by relying on countries with authoritarian governments disliked by majorities of Americans. It is possible that delegating to proxies would have stronger effects when used by democracies or between states where citizens have more neutral views of the opposing governments. Second, it is plausible that the hypothetical -- and low-stakes -- nature of the vignettes made respondents less responsive to the treatments and more willing to record negative answers about countries they dislike. The vignettes were designed to reflect actual situations in which states have sought to obscure aspects of their foreign policies by delegating to proxies, and research comparing survey experiments to actual political attitudes suggests they do a reasonable job of generalizing to real political developments (e.g. Hainmueller et al. 2015). However, compared to real-world attacks, respondents may have felt less uncertainty about assigning blame to the foreign government in the survey.\nRegarding generalizability, the three scenarios produced relatively consistent results. The proxy treatments reduced attributions of blame and perceptions of high-level orders for the attacks with similarly-sized treatment effects for the three non-state actors in the China, Russia, and Iran incidents. The treatments also had similar effects on preferences toward sanctions, though the magnitude was smaller for Iran. One possible explanation for this difference is that sanctioning Iran had already been part of a prominent political debate for years by the time the surveys were implemented, resulting in more fixed attitudes on this question. Finally, for the retaliate and escalate outcomes, responses varied somewhat in their direction; however, the magnitudes were consistently small in all cases. These patterns suggest that how the public responds to attacks carried out by proxies may be relatively similar across different types of attacks and when linked to different sponsors.\nHowever, other issues of external validity suggest avenues for future research. First, the language used in the vignettes could be varied to create more or less contestation over responsibility. On the one hand, US officials or journalists could use softer language in their attributions, perhaps“suspecting” certain actors to be responsible for\nthe attack rather than “concluding” that they were. In certain cases, US officials may not even comment at all, and journalists or researchers may not have enough evidence to publish, leaving the public with little more than speculation about which foreign actor should be blamed. In these cases, the use of proxies may produce stronger plausible deniability. On the other hand, government officials or journalists could bring actual evidence to bear in their assertions of responsibility, while also directly calling into question the opposing government's denials of involvement, which could leave them more exposed to blame. Both approaches reflect real-world engagement around covert actions. Sometimes, both government and private sources tread cautiously in how they attribute responsibility. At other times, they release detailed reports along with evidence such as satellite imagery that are capable of shifting public opinion effectively . It seems plausible that public opinion would respond differently based on the kinds of language and arguments used by private and public actors to shape perceptions of responsibility for covert action, and future research could explore this variation. In addition, it may be the case that people in countries outside the United States would react differently to attacks by proxies, particularly if these countries have more or less trustworthy media environments and political leaders, or if they have different historical experiences with conflict. Future research could evaluate how the results generalize to other countries.\n## Conclusion\nGovernments frequently rely on proxies to pursue their foreign policy objectives while maintaining plausible deniability of their involvement. This secrecy has been theorized to reduce risks of conflict escalation, in part by limiting domestic pressures on adversaries to retaliate. Yet, proxies often have well-documented and publicized ties to their sponsors, raising questions about the extent to which delegation to proxies can reduce escalation risks by shaping public opinion about responsibility for -- and responses to -- hostile acts.\nThe experiments discussed in this paper suggest that delegating to proxies can influence how people attribute responsibility for an attack on their country's interests, though the reported effect sizes are modest and imply that proxies may only strengthen plausible deniability on the margins. The modest effects could indicate that other factors will often provide stronger motives for governments to delegate to proxies, whether related to lower costs, their knowledge of local conditions, or signaling a lack of interest in escalation . Respondents in the proxy treatment were also substantially more supportive of limited sanctions rather than those targeting senior leadership of the sponsor government, indicating some effect on citizens' views of how their own government should respond to hostilities. These findings contribute to a growing literature on secrecy in international relations by implying that delegation can contribute modestly to plausible deniability while shaping preferences about whom to retaliate against, even in cases where proxies are closely controlled by their sponsors and the credibility of their independence should be relatively low. On the other hand,\nthe proxy treatment did not affect respondents' views of whether the US government should respond with more coercive and escalatory forms of retaliation, such as a major cyber attack on a Chinese city, killing Russian soldiers, or bombing targets in Iran. These null effects could result from respondents' holding more fixed attitudes about the contexts in which the United States should use force against adversarial states, with modest shifts in plausible deniability unlikely to change these views.\n## Acknowledgements\nI thank Bridging the Gap's New Era Workshop for motivating the project.

The assault dragged on for more than four hours, during which hundreds of the attacking soldiers were killed. Despite fears the incident could trigger conflict between Russian and American forces in Syria, escalation did not occur. The Russian government quickly distanced itself from the attack by claiming they had no control over the soldiers, who were not part of the Russian military. Instead, they were employees of a private military company called the Wagner Group . This company has often served as a Russian proxy in conflicts where the government has not wished to involve itself openly, including in Libya, Ukraine, Venezuela, and Syria .\nCovert actions such as these are a common feature of international affairs, with states frequently attempting to disguise aspects of their foreign policies. Scholars have proposed that this emphasis on secrecy can contribute to stability within the international system by reducing the likelihood of conflict escalation . This advantage is thought to occur in part because adversaries who engage each other secretly should be less likely to trigger domestic pressures that push them to increase the scope of the conflict .\nDelegating to their non-state proxies is one strategy states use when trying to preserve secrecy around their involvement in hostile actions . In theory, the proxy's ability to claim independence from the chain of command can provide the state with more plausible deniability about their lack of responsibility. If this strategy is effective, it follows that public opinion in a targeted country should respond differently to denials of responsibility for hostile actions carried out by a state's proxies rather than its military or other security institutions. Specifically, this delegation should weaken attributions of blame against the attacking government while limiting demands for retaliation, thus mitigating pressures on the targeted government to respond. However, there are reasons to doubt whether proxies make deniability more plausible, since they frequently demonstrate strong ties to their patrons, which should undermine the credibility of claims that their decision-making is independent. Returning to the Russian Wagner Group, for example, the company's founder has a personal relationship with President Putin, and the company is known to receive funding, training, and equipment from the Russian military and intelligence apparatus . This relationship has become even more publicly apparent since the Russian invasion of Ukraine .\nTo date, there has been relatively little research on public opinion toward secrecy in international politics , including whether and how delegating hostile actions to proxies shapes public opinion. I evaluate whether this delegation can influence attributions of blame and demands for retaliation by implementing seven vignette experiments across three surveys of American adults. The vignettes address hypothetical attacks against US targets by Russian, Chinese, and\nIranian actors, with these countries' governments denying involvement in the attacks. Respondents are randomly assigned to read that the attackers were part of a military unit or proxy group tied to the foreign government, after which they assess responsibility for the incident and evaluate possible US responses. These countries were chosen not only because their governments rely frequently on covert action, but also because their authoritarian political systems and their unpopularity with the American public should create a hard test of the hypothesized relationships.\nThe results show that respondents become less likely to attribute responsibility to the adversarial governments when attacks were carried out by proxies. The effects are small, however, suggesting that the use of proxies with known ties to the sponsor may marginally strengthen a government's plausible deniability of involvement in an attack without substantially altering the extent to which citizens in the targeted state blame that government. The results also provide mixed support for the ability of covert action to mitigate demands for escalation. Respondents in the proxy treatment groups are substantially less likely to support sanctioning the senior leadership of the adversarial governments instead of subordinate individuals involved directly in the attacks, and this effect is partially mediated by the treatment's effects on respondents' attributions of blame. However, respondents are not less likely to support forceful, retaliatory attacks by the US government that would reflect a clear escalation of the conflict. One interpretation of these findings is that delegation to proxies may help reduce escalation risks by increasing the likelihood that the targeted public prefers to retaliate against the proxy itself, but is less likely to influence citizens' views on their government responding to hostilities with coercive and forceful forms of retaliation.\nThese findings contribute to international relations research on secrecy by providing experimental evidence that both reinforces and expands on existing theories about the effects of covert action and plausible deniability on conflict, insofar as they provide some evidence that acting covertly through proxies can reduce a government's exposure to blame and shape how citizens in a targeted country think about the appropriate response (e.g. Carnegie and Carson 2018; Carson 2016; Hedgecock and Sukin 2023; Joseph and Poznansky 2018). They also extend a nascent body of work on public opinion toward the role of non-state proxies in international politics (e.g. Plana 2020). In addition, by showing that authoritarian regimes can reduce their exposure to blame in international conflicts by delegating to non-state proxies, the findings contribute to a large literature on blame avoidance that has to date focused primarily on domestic politics and democratic political systems .\nThis article proceeds as follows. It first reviews literature on covert action and secrecy in international politics before outlining expectations about the effects of proxies on attributions of responsibility and demands for retaliation. It then discusses the selected cases and research design for the experiments, before presenting the results. The article concludes with a discussion of external validity and implications for international relations research.\nSecrecy is a common feature of international politics , and a growing literature seeks to explain why states might attempt to conceal outcomes ranging from military alliances to the resolution of international legal disputes or crises . Covert action reflects one aspect of secrecy in the international system, whereby states attempt to obscure their involvement in hostile activities targeting another state or political entity. Well-known examples include the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba by US-backed Cuban exiles, or participation by Soviet pilots in the Korean War against the United States. As with these examples, covert operations or their outcomes tend to be visible publicly, and the objective is not to keep the acts themselves secret, but rather to conceal or create doubt about who was involved .\nThe identity of the responsible actor does not always stay secret to other states, whose governments often have the intelligence capacity to make reasonable determinations about who is behind an attack. Even so, the costs and risks associated with covert operations can prove useful by signaling resolve to the observing states . Furthermore, covert action is more likely to succeed at concealing the identity of the responsible actor from the public. As a result, states may rely on it to obscure aspects of their foreign policy that would damage their reputations domestically or abroad . For example, democracies may use covert action against other democracies to avoid domestic backlash for violating the expectation that they remain on good terms with democratic governments . Relatedly, governments may delegate violence against civilians to non-state actors to obscure their involvement from international audiences who would respond negatively to human rights violations .\nBy providing plausible deniability that conceals responsibility for hostile activities from the public, covert action has been theorized to help adversarial states reduce the risks of conflict escalation. Research indicates that political and military leaders are susceptible to pressure from public opinion when deciding whether and how to deploy military force . Keeping hostilities on the “backstage” and out of the public eye should help states to avoid pressures from hawkish domestic constituencies who wish to expand the scope of the conflict, while allowing states to signal to each other that they do not want to escalate . In other words, by obscuring their involvement, states may be able to limit escalation risks in part by decreasing the likelihood that citizens in the targeted country demand a response from their own government that would escalate the conflict. As an example of this mechanism in action, Carson (2018, 21) notes how Nazi Germany monitored foreign reactions to its involvement in the Spanish Civil War and “...carefully calibrated covert German combat participation in light of hawkish domestic sentiment in London and Paris.”\nBecause the point of covert action is to obscure the identity of the responsible actor, states often pursue these operations through their proxies, whether corporations, informal militias, or “volunteer” fighters. Research on blame attributions and accountability implies that this strategy of delegating to proxies should be effective at creating plausible deniability that influences perceptions of responsibility in the targeted state. People are more likely to believe an actor is responsible for an outcome when they have direct control over the decision-making process that produces the outcome . In cases where delegation occurs and multiple decision-makers are involved, clarity of responsibility is diminished and political actors are more capable of avoiding blame . Experimental research suggests these blame avoidance benefits can occur even when people know the delegator and delegatee share the same interests . In terms of international relations, proxies such as militias or corporations are entities separate from the state apparatus, and, at least in theory, they can make decisions more independently than a military or intelligence unit. This potential independence should make it harder for citizens in the targeted state to determine whether an action occurred because of directives from the sponsor or because of the proxy's own initiative. As a result, delegating to proxies should increase plausible deniability and help the sponsor to limit how much it is held responsible by citizens of the targeted state.\nAs noted in the literature on covert action, governments may benefit from this redirection of perceived responsibility for several reasons, including protecting their political support domestically and their soft power internationally if their involvement in the hostile acts would be viewed negatively . Of primary interest to this article is that shifting blame through covert operations may also help governments to reduce the likelihood of citizens in the targeted country demanding retaliation that escalates the conflict . The blame avoidance literature provides a framework for understanding why delegating to proxies could shape attitudes toward retaliation as well. Because blame helps people to identify who should be held accountable for a problematic outcome, those who limit their exposure to blame should face fewer demands that they be punished . Thus, if delegating to a proxy can reduce how many people in the targeted country blame the sponsoring state for a hostile action, it follows that these people may also become less likely to want their government to hold that state accountable by retaliating against it. In other words, using proxies to conduct covert actions could weaken domestic pressure on the targeted government to expand the conflict, which would reduce escalation risks by limiting incentives for political and military leaders to respond forcefully .\nFrom this theoretical framework, I expect the following when hostile actions are known to be conducted by a state's proxies rather than its own military forces. First, when a proxy is involved, I expect that respondents will be more likely to believe a foreign government's denials of responsibility -- i.e. they will blame the government less. Second, because respondents attribute less blame to the foreign government, I\nexpect that they will be less likely to support retaliation against that government as well.\nHowever, there are also reasons to expect that delegating to proxies may have little effect on attributions of responsibility or attitudes toward retaliation. First, proxies often lack credible separation from their sponsors. If the proxy is a domestic entity with legal status within the sponsoring country, it may be constrained in its ability to pursue foreign policy objectives that contradict those of the government. This limitation is especially likely to apply in authoritarian regimes, where the government controls most domestic organizations closely to ensure that they do not work against the authorities. Foreign proxies of a government might have more credible claims to independence, since they exist outside that government's legal and coercive apparatus. Nonetheless, in these cases, journalists and foreign governments often go to great lengths to publicize ties between the proxy and its sponsor. If people do not believe that the proxy has genuine independence to operate, they are unlikely to absolve the sponsoring state of blame.\nSecond, if citizens in the targeted state dislike the sponsor government intensely and are primed to distrust it, they may discount claims of separation from the proxy. This reaction may be particularly likely in contexts where two states have a history of poor relations -- i.e. the contexts in which hostile covert actions are most likely to be conducted. Finally, citizens of a targeted state may blame the sponsor of an attacking proxy for failing to control their proxy, even if the sponsors did not intend for the attack to happen.\n## Research Design\nTo test how covert action by proxies influences attributions of blame and demands for retaliation, I implemented seven vignette experiments across three surveys administered online in the United States. Experiments have become increasingly common in the international relations literature, and they are particularly useful for studying IR theories that involve public opinion  -- including issues of secrecy and covert action (e.g. Myrick 2019). The following sections provide further details about the design.\n### Samples\nThe first survey was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 1299 American adults recruited by the firm Lucid in April 2019. Each respondent read and answered outcome questions for two vignettes: one involving China, and the other involving Russia. The survey was designed with the expectations about delegation, blame, and escalation in mind but was exploratory and not pre-registered.\nThe second survey was pre-registered. I specified hypotheses and analyses that would indicate replication of findings from the first survey, and I expanded the experiment by adding additional outcome questions in line with the theoretical\nexpectations. This second survey was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 3053 respondents recruited by Lucid in March 2021. Each respondent on the second survey saw the same China and Russia vignettes used on the first survey. In addition, they also read and responded to questions about a vignette involving Iran.\nThe third survey was intended to provide an additional replication check, while also facilitating exploratory analysis of patterns identified in the second survey. It was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 2007 American adults recruited by Lucid in May 2021. This survey used the Russia and Iran vignettes but dropped the China vignette due to time constraints. All three surveys were representative on age, gender, income, ethnicity, and US region. Summary statistics can be found in the SI.\n### Case Selection\nI chose to center my vignettes around hostile actions attributed to Chinese, Russian, and Iranian actors. These three cases are useful for several reasons. The first is that all three countries are relatively unpopular in the United States due to a history of adversarial relations. My survey data highlights these unfavorable perceptions among American adults. In the first survey in 2019, 15% of respondents reported a favorable view of Russia and 16% said the same about China. In the second survey in 2021, only 25% of respondents said they had a favorable view of China, 20% reported a favorable view of Russia, and 11% claimed to have a favorable view of Iran. These negative attitudes should make it less likely that respondents would give these governments the benefit of the doubt when they deny involvement in hostile actions carried out by their proxies. The second reason is that all three countries are governed by authoritarian regimes. China's government operates a massive surveillance state that exercises extensive control over the population. Russia and Iran also control their societies closely. These political systems make it less likely that proxy groups are operating independently of the authorities, which should reduce the credibility of delegation and make it less likely that people believe that the proxy's sponsor was not involved. These first two reasons suggest the countries provide a hard test of the hypothesized effects.\nFinally, the third reason is that all three countries regularly engage in covert action to advance their foreign policy objectives, and they frequently do so by delegating to non-state proxies that are believed to provide a degree of plausible deniability. As such, the survey vignettes should be highly relevant to real-world events. In the following paragraphs, I briefly discuss examples from each case.\nChina: As cyber activities have become increasingly important for global politics, China has invested heavily in its cyber capabilities to gather political and economic intelligence . The Chinese government has used a variety of actors to conduct cyberattacks, including military personnel. In 2020, the US government charged four members of the People's Liberation Army for hacking the credit agency Equifax and acquiring data on tens of millions of Americans (US Department of Justice 2020). This case reflected a long history of Chinese state hackers conducting economic espionage against American corporations . At the same time, the\ngovernment also works through proxies, including Chinese corporations and hacking groups. Chinese technology companies such as Huawei have been linked to espionage, with their equipment used to facilitate cyber intrusions , monitor the domestic population , and process stolen data . Chinese security officers have also established front companies to conduct cyberattacks. In a criminal case against four Chinese citizens accused of economic espionage, the US government alleged that the individuals were Chinese security officials in a provincial branch of the Ministry of State Security (MSS) who had “sought to obfuscate the Chinese government's role in such theft by establishing a front company, Hainan Xiandun Technology Department Co. Ltd” (US Department of Justice 2021).\nSeveral hacking groups have also been identified as proxies conducting cyberattacks on behalf of the Chinese government. An attack on Microsoft Exchange in 2021 was attributed to a group given the name Hafnium, which has been linked to the MSS by Western governments . Another operation, known as Cloud Hopper, was attributed to the group APT10, which has also been connected to the MSS . While Western governments have attributed responsibility for the actions of these groups to the Chinese government, some ambiguity remains about the nature of the relationship. For instance, there is evidence that APT10 has also conducted cyberattacks to steal information for personal gain, raising questions about whether the group “enjoys protections that enable it to conduct its own for-profit activities” or “has simply evaded scrutiny from Chinese authorities” .\nRussia: The Russian government has made extensive use of proxies to achieve its foreign policy objectives. In Ukraine, prior to the invasion of 2022, it encouraged and then supported separatist groups in their attempts to establish independent states tied closely to Russia (International Crisis Group 2019), a tactic it has used to expand its influence in other countries including Georgia and Moldova . Russia has also increasingly turned to private military companies to advance its interests abroad , the most well-known of which is the Wagner Group that has already been mentioned. These organizations have participated in conflicts in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe, receiving private gains while also extending Russia's influence. In Sudan, the Wagner Group was deployed in 2017 to help repress uprisings against Omar Al-Bashir. As payment, the company's owner was given exclusive rights to mine gold in the country, and the Russian government was later offered a naval base on the Red Sea before Al-Bashir was overthrown in 2019 . These companies exist in a legal gray area under Russian law and are technically separate from the state, even as they are owned and directed by individuals with close ties to President Putin and the security elite .\nWhile the connections are clear between Moscow and the proxies discussed above, debate has continued about how closely the Russian government controls them. Regarding private military companies like the Wagner Group, the extent to which they are “simply patriotic volunteers as the Kremlin claims...on official assignment for Russia's GRU intelligence service...mercenaries, corporate warriors, or frontline\nsoldiers” remains unclear . All of these identities may be true at different moments, fostering uncertainty about their role in specific conflicts or time periods. Analysts have argued that this ambiguity provides enough plausible deniability to help Russia avoid accountability for human rights violations and limit escalation risks in the conflicts in which these organizations are involved .\nIran: The use of proxy groups to extend its influence in the Middle East has been a central component of Iran's foreign policy for decades. The Iranian government maintains close ties with militant organizations and political movements in countries including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine, Pakistan, Syria, and Yemen . These organizations have received financial support, weapons, and training from Iran and often work closely with the Revolutionary Guard to advance the country's regional interests. They include Hezbollah in Lebanon, which operates a successful political party and a well-armed militia that has fought alongside the Syrian and Iranian governments in the Syrian civil war. They also include several militias in Iraq that have a formal relationship with the Iraqi armed forces , such as Kata'ib Hizballah, Asaib Ahl Al-Haq, and Harakat Hezbollah Al-Nujaba . These groups participate openly in the political system, where they have worked to pull Iraq closer to Iran, and they have also taken part in armed attacks on US and Saudi targets .\nDespite their close ties to Iran, most of these groups have their own domestic political interests and are not controlled fully from Tehran. In Yemen, Iranian support for the Houthis does not outweigh the group's own interests in fighting its domestic opponents and their international backers . While Iran does at times exercise direct influence over the decision-making of Hezbollah in Lebanon, its influence is usually indirect and decisions are made by Hezbollah's leaders . Likewise, the Iranian-aligned militias in Iraq are involved in Iraqi politics and frequently pursue their own political interests . Though they coordinate militant activities closely with Iran's Revolutionary Guard, they are not entirely beholden to them and often act independently. For example, the failed assassination attempt against Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi in 2021 was suspected to have been carried out by one of the Iranian-aligned militias without approval from Iran . In addition, the militias have often attacked US forces even at moments when Iran is attempting to deescalate relations with the United States . The fact that these groups will act in their own interest can create ambiguity about the extent of Iranian involvement.\n### Vignettes\nFor each vignette in my surveys, respondents were provided with information about an attack linked to an adversarial foreign power against US interests. All details of the situation were held constant, except for the identity of the organization alleged to have carried out the attack. Respondents were told that the vignettes were hypothetical to\nensure no deception about events that could cause anger toward a foreign country. However, the content of the vignettes was selected to reflect real-world political developments discussed in the cases above. Respondents were told that the actor involved in the attack had been identified, and the attacker was randomized to be a military unit or proxy of the foreign government. The vignettes always noted that the relevant foreign government had denied foreknowledge of the attack and blamed it on a rogue operation. Because I am interested in how delegation to proxies affects public opinion by giving the government greater plausible deniability or not, it was important to be clear that the foreign government had denied involvement across the treatment groups. These scenarios reflect real-world use of covert action, where the attack is usually observed by everyone, there are attempts by government officials, journalists, and researchers to figure out who was directly involved, and the government on which the most suspicion is cast publicly denies responsibility.\nIn the first survey, the identity of the attacking organization was said to be determined by US officials. In the second and third surveys, I randomized whether the identity was determined by US officials or journalists. I included this additional randomization to account for the possibility that the source of information would shape responses to the proxy versus military treatments. It is possible that respondents would perceive US officials attributing blame to a proxy rather than the military as a signal that the US government did not wish to escalate the conflict, rather than as an objective statement about who was directly involved in the attack. In this case, respondents might attribute less blame to the foreign government and demand less escalation not because they believed the foreign government was less directly involved, but because they trusted the US government had good reasons to avoid escalation. However, I do not find any meaningful or consistent differences based on this randomization.\nThe China vignette discussed a cyberattack that stole valuable technology from a US company. The vignette randomized whether the attack was attributed to a Chinese military unit, private corporation, or state-run corporation. The state-run corporation should create less plausible deniability than the private corporation; however, its distance from the chain of command could strengthen that plausibility relative to the military unit. As discussed above, Chinese hackers linked to both state institutions and private companies have previously stolen sensitive technologies from American companies .\nThe Russia vignette involved an attack on US soldiers in Syria by Russian forces. The attack was attributed either to soldiers in a Russian military unit or a Russian private military company. Throughout the Syrian civil war, American soldiers have been involved in clashes with Russian military forces but also members of the private Russian military companies that are used as proxy forces .\nFinally, the Iran vignette detailed an attack on US forces in Iraq by actors linked to Iran. Respondents were randomly assigned to read that the attack was connected to an Iranian military unit or an Iraqi militia with ties to Iran. These incidents have also occurred frequently since the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. As noted above, the attacks are often linked to Iranian-sponsored militias , but Iranian forces have been involved directly as well .\nThe full text of the vignettes are below:China Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that a Chinese (military unit/state-owned corporation/private corporation) was behind a major cyber attack on a US energy company, in which hackers stole valuable technological plans for a new renewable energy source. The Chinese government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on a rogue operation by hackers in the (military unit/state-owned corporation/private corporation).Russia Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that soldiers from a Russian (military unit/private security company) were behind an attack on US forces in Syria that killed two American soldiers. The Russian government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on officers in the (military unit/private security company) on the ground in Syria.Iran Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that soldiers from (an Iranian military unit/an Iraqi militia with ties to Iran) were behind a rocket attack on US forces in Iraq that killed two American soldiers. The Iranian government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on rogue officers in the (military unit/militia) in Iraq.\nAll randomizations within each scenario occurred with equal probability. Balance tests are reported in the SI.\nAn important motive for using multiple scenarios was to assess whether the effects of delegating to proxies would generalize to different situations in which covert action is commonly used. The scenarios reflect different types of attacks (cyber vs kinetic), different foreign governments (China, Russia, and Iran), and different proxies (corporations and militias). My expectation was that delegation would have similar effects across the scenarios, as the theoretical logic -- more credible independence of the proxy reducing attributions of blame and therefore demands for retaliation -- should apply even as the specific details vary. However, it is possible that these different scenarios would produce variation in responses. For example, cyber attacks may affect public opinion differently than kinetic attacks by limiting demands for forceful retaliation (e.g. Kreps and Schneider 2019). I explore generalizability further while discussing the results.\nOutcomes\nFollowing each vignette, respondents were asked outcome questions to assess their attributions of responsibility for the attacks and their views about how the US government should respond.\nRegarding responsibility, respondents on all three surveys were asked if the foreign governments should be blamed for the attacks. The question was worded “Do you agree or disagree that the [relevant] government should be blamed for this attack?” On the second and third surveys, respondents were also asked about who had ordered the attack, with the question “Do you think it is likely or unlikely senior officials in the [relevant] government ordered this attack?” This question provided a more direct assessment of whether respondents believed high-level officials were directly involved in -- and therefore responsible for -- the action. Answers for both questions ranged from strongly agree to strongly disagree on a 7 point Likert scale, with stronger attributions of responsibility coded as higher values. If respondents in the proxy treatment groups became less likely to blame the foreign governments and less likely to believe they ordered the attacks, it would provide support for the expectation that delegating to proxies can strengthen plausible deniability and help governments avoid blame in targeted states.\nRegarding the US response, respondents on the first and second surveys were asked if the US government should pursue targeted sanctions against the lower-level officials in the relevant proxies or military units, or if the US government should implement sanctions against senior officials in the respective governments. The question was worded as follows: “The US government is deciding how to respond to the attack. Which option do you see as a more appropriate response?” Respondents could then choose that “The US government responds by sanctioning the officers in charge of the [military unit/corporation/militia] or that “The US government responds by sanctioning senior officials in the [relevant] government. This latter option would be more likely to escalate conflict and deepen tensions between the two countries, since it reflects a direct attempt to punish the most important decision-makers in the foreign state. For example, the Chinese government responded angrily to US sanctions on senior Chinese officials over its Hong Kong policies . In other words, respondents were forced to choose between a response that would hold accountable only those individuals involved directly in the event, or a stronger, more escalatory response that would hold accountable the top levels of the foreign government.\nOn the second survey, respondents were also asked if they would support US retaliation involving attacks on the respective countries, with answers ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree on a 7 point Likert scale. The first part of the question stated that “The US government is also deciding whether to retaliate by...” The remainder of the question specified actions including a “hacking attack that cuts off electricity to a major Chinese city” for the Chinese vignette, an attack “targeting several Russian soldiers in Syria” for the Russia vignette, and “bombing military targets in Iran” for the Iran vignette. In each case, the proposed US response was designed to\nappear escalatory. Cutting power to a major Chinese city would reflect an escalation over stealing technology; killing “several” Russian soldiers implies a higher cost on Russia than the two US soldiers killed; and bombing Iran would reflect an escalation from the tit-for-tat conflict between the two countries in Iraq.\nOne possible limitation of the second question is that respondents were not asked directly whether they would prefer to escalate, and some respondents may not have viewed the retaliatory options as escalatory. As a result, for the Iran and Russia vignettes included on the third survey, I used an outcome question designed to follow up on patterns identified in the first and second surveys by asking respondents directly about their attitudes toward escalation. The question stated that “The US government is deciding how to respond to the attack. Which option do you see as the most appropriate response?” Respondents could then choose between three options: that the US government “decides to deescalate by not targeting any [relevant government] soldiers,” that the US government “decides to respond proportionally by targeting and killing two [relevant government] soldiers, or that the US government “decides to escalate by targeting and killing twenty [relevant government] soldiers.” Because time was more limited on the third survey, I was unable to include the other two outcome questions about how the US government should respond to the attack.\nIf respondents in the proxy treatment group became more likely to prefer targeted sanctions, less likely to support a retaliatory attack, and less likely to approve explicitly of escalation, it would be consistent with delegation to proxies reducing pressure on the targeted government to escalate the conflict.\nTable 1 reports the mean and standard deviation for each outcome measure. It also illustrates which questions were asked for which country vignette on which surveys. In general, respondents are somewhat likely to blame the foreign government for the attacks and to believe that senior officials ordered them. Regarding the sanction outcome, respondents tend to be roughly split on whether sanctions should target higher-level authorities or the specific individuals involved in the attacks. Support for retaliating with force is lower, with respondents neutral on average about the retaliatory attack outcome, and with respondents mostly split between the US government either deescalating or responding proportionally -- but not escalating -- for the escalation outcome.\n## Results\nI use two approaches to report treatment effects. First, I aggregate data across the three scenarios on the three surveys, creating a single proxy treatment indicator for respondents assigned to the Chinese corporation, Russian private security company, or Iranian-aligned Iraqi militia treatments in each of the experiments. I use OLS to regress the outcomes on the proxy treatment. Dummy variables for the scenarios are included to account for different baseline responses in the military conditions, and I cluster standard errors by respondent, since each respondent completed more than one scenario on the same survey . Analyzing the\nWilliamson\n|  Variable - Country | Survey 1 | Survey 2 | Survey 3  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Blame - China | 5.18 (1.46) | 5.18 (1.46) |   |\n|  Blame - Russia | 5.15 (1.52) | 5.16 (1.47) | 5.09 (1.44)  |\n|  Blame - Iran |  | 5.31 (1.44) | 5.27 (1.40)  |\n|  Ordered - China |  | 5.42 (1.43) |   |\n|  Ordered - Russia |  | 5.27 (1.48) | 5.25 (1.43)  |\n|  Ordered - Iran |  | 5.42 (1.44) | 5.43 (1.40)  |\n|  Sanction - China | 0.51 (0.50) | 0.47 (0.50) |   |\n|  Sanction - Russia | 0.55 (0.50) | 0.46 (0.50) |   |\n|  Sanction - Iran |  | 0.49 (0.50) |   |\n|  Retaliate - China |  | 4.04 (1.85) |   |\n|  Retaliate - Russia |  | 4.26 (1.75) |   |\n|  Retaliate - Iran |  | 4.54 (1.73) |   |\n|  Escalate - China |  |  |   |\n|  Escalate - Russia |  |  | 0.42 (0.63)  |\n|  Escalate - Iran |  |  | 0.54 (0.72)  |\nMean (SD) reported for each outcome measure.\nRange for blame, ordered, attack: 1-7.\nRange for sanction: 0-1; Range for escalate: 0-2.\naggregated data, which was pre-registered with the pre-analysis plan for the second survey, is useful for providing an overall assessment of how delegating to proxies affected responses to the different outcomes across multiple surveys and scenarios. Second, I then provide treatment effects for each of the scenarios on each survey to assess consistency. These effects are also analyzed with OLS regression, using models that control for age, gender, education, political interest, partisanship, foreign policy orientation, and region of residence. These controls were also pre-registered. They are relevant to foreign policy attitudes, are correlated with the outcomes, and were measured pre-treatment, so they can help to increase precision . Results without control variables are consistent and are reported in the SI.\nTable 2 reports main effects for the proxy treatment in the aggregated data. The first two columns show results for the outcomes related to attributions of responsibility, with the first showing the effect of the treatment on perceptions that the foreign government should be blamed for the attack, and the second showing the effect on beliefs that senior officials in the foreign government ordered the attack. For both outcomes, assignment to the proxy treatment reduces attributions of responsibility by 0.14 on the seven point scale  $(p &lt; 0.001)$ . This effect is equivalent to a shift of approximately one-tenth of a standard deviation, indicating a modest impact on how respondents attribute responsibility for the hostilities. This small decrease occurred from relatively high levels of blame directed at the foreign government in the military treatments, where the\nJournal of Conflict Resolution 68(2-3)\nTable 2.

The effect of the proxy treatment on the sanctions outcome is substantively large. Respondents assigned to the proxy groups are 9 percentage points less likely to prefer sanctioning senior government officials over officials in the specific unit involved in the attack  $(p &lt; 0.001)$ . This effect reflects a shift of approximately two-fifths of a standard deviation and reduces support for the more escalatory sanctions below a majority of respondents. However, the proxy treatment did not have any influence on the other two response outcomes. Though coefficients were negative in both cases, they were near zero and statistically insignificant. In other words, respondents who read that proxies conducted the hostilities were not less likely to support retaliatory attacks by the United States against the relevant foreign country, and they were not less likely to support a response directly described as escalatory.\nNext, I report the effects for the proxy treatment in each scenario across the three surveys. These effects are displayed in Figures 1 and 2. The former addresses the attribution outcomes and the latter shows the response outcomes.\nFor the attribution outcomes, the treatment effects point in a consistent direction that reflects the negative effect in the aggregated results. Regarding blame, respondents in the first and second surveys who read that the hacking attack was carried out by a Chinese private corporation were 0.22 ( $p &lt; 0.05$ ) and 0.10 ( $p &lt; 0.10$ ) less likely to attribute responsibility to the Chinese government compared to respondents in the military treatment. On the other hand, the coefficients for the Chinese state corporation were negative but statistically insignificant in both surveys. Relative to the military treatment in the Russia scenario, the private security treatment reduced blame directed at the Russian government by 0.15 ( $p &lt; 0.10$ ) in the first survey, by 0.18 ( $p &lt; 0.001$ ) in the second survey, and by 0.13 ( $p &lt; 0.05$ ) in the third survey. Finally, for the Iran scenario, the militia treatment decreased blame relative to the military treatment by 0.20\nWilliamson\n$(p &lt; 0.001)$ in the second survey, and it was negative but insignificant in the third survey.\nFor the ordered outcome, respondents on the second survey were less likely to believe the attack was carried out on orders of senior officials in the foreign government by 0.16 $(p &lt; 0.01)$ when exposed to the Chinese private corporation treatment. Again, however, the effect of the state corporation was negative but not statistically significant. For the second survey, the private security treatment reduced the Russian government's perceived role by 0.12 $(p &lt; 0.05)$, while the Iraqi militia treatment reduced the Iranian government's perceived role in ordering the attacks by 0.21 $(p &lt; 0.001)$. On the third survey, the Russia treatment lost significance but the Iran treatment continued to reduce the perceived role by 0.10 $(p &lt; 0.10)$.\nWhile there is some variation across the scenarios and surveys, these effects are consistent with the aggregate data. They suggest that individuals may be less likely to attribute responsibility to foreign governments that have denied involvement in an attack when that attack is conducted by proxies, and this pattern appears with different countries and different types of hostilities. However, the modest effect sizes also imply that delegating to proxies is unlikely to substantially transform public perceptions of blame in these scenarios. In terms of\nJournal of Conflict Resolution 68(2-3)\nvariation across the treatments, the Chinese state-run corporation effect was consistently insignificant and weaker than the others. Though the difference is small, it reflects the expectation that plausible deniability should be stronger when the proxies have more credible separation from the sponsoring state.\nFor the response outcomes shown in Figure 2, the results are generally consistent as well. Proxies strongly reduce support for sanctioning senior government officials but produce limited to no effects on attitudes toward retaliatory attacks that could escalate the conflict.\nRegarding the sanctions outcome, respondents in the proxy treatment groups were consistently less likely to prefer sanctions against senior government officials over more targeted sanctions against lower-level officials in the organization that conducted the attack. In contrast to the responsibility outcomes, this finding applied to both Chinese corporation treatments. In the first and second surveys, the Chinese private corporation reduced the preference for senior-level sanctions by  $12(p &lt; 0.001)$  and  $16(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points, while the state-run corporation reduced this preference by  $12(p &lt; 0.001)$  and  $14(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points. Likewise, the Russian security company reduced support for sanctioning senior officials by  $8(p &lt; 0.01)$  and  $10(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points in the first and second surveys. The effect for the Iraqi militia treatment was smaller, reducing support for sanctions on senior Iranian officials by approximately 4 percentage points  $(p &lt; 0.05)$ .\nFor the retaliate and escalate outcomes, however, the proxy treatment produced effects that were inconsistent in their direction and for the most part statistically insignificant. For retaliate, the Chinese state corporation treatment slightly increased\nFigure 2. Treatment effects for response outcomes. Note: Plot displays coefficients for treatment effects from surveys 1, 2, and 3, with effects estimated by OLS regression with control variables for age, gender, education, political interest, partisanship, foreign policy orientation, and region of residence.\nsupport for the hacking attack on the electrical grid of a Chinese city, though the effect was insignificant. The Chinese private corporation and the Russian security company produced very small, negative effects that failed to attain statistical significance. The Iraqi militia treatment slightly reduced support for bombing military targets in Iran, by 0.10 (p < 0.10). Respondents in the military treatments were split on whether the US government should pursue these retaliatory actions against the Chinese, Russian, and Iranian governments, with average responses of approximately 4 on the 7-point scale, and the proxy treatments had no discernible impact on these attitudes.\nThe third survey was intended to explore further the discrepancy between the sanction and retaliation outcomes by incorporating a new outcome question that asked respondents explicitly whether they wished the US government to deescalate, respond proportionally, or escalate (taking values of 0, 1, and 2 respectively). However, the proxy treatments also did not produce consistent effects on attitudes toward this escalate outcome. The Russian private security company did have a small, negative effect of 0.05 (p < 0.05) on the 3-point scale, compared to the Russian military treatment. On the other hand, the Iraqi militia returned a positive but insignificant effect compared to the Iranian military unit. In both scenarios, most respondents in the control group were split between preferring a deescalatory or proportional response: few wanted to escalate the conflict by striking back harder against the foreign country, and the proxy treatments did not have a substantial or consistent impact on these views.\nAs reported in the SI, the source identifying the involved actor -- whether US officials or journalists -- did not have a significant effect on the outcomes. In addition, the SI shows that effects of the proxy treatment did not vary consistently based on pre-existing attitudes toward China, Russia, and Iran.\n## Discussion\nThe results show a modest impact of the proxy treatments on respondents' attributions of blame and inconsistent effects on their views of how the US government should respond. Regarding the latter, respondents in the proxy treatments became less likely to prefer sanctioning senior government officials rather than individuals from the unit directly engaged in the hostilities; however, they did not become less likely to prefer retaliatory attacks against the foreign country, and they did not become less likely to support a response explicitly described as escalatory.\nTwo possible explanations may account for this divergence between the different response outcomes. One possibility is that delegation to proxies affects whom people prefer their governments to retaliate against, without necessarily affecting levels of support for the government to retaliate in some fashion. When forced to choose between the options of punishing senior government leaders or lower-level officials in the military unit or proxy organization, respondents in the proxy treatment groups were more likely to favor the latter. In other words, they preferred to retaliate against the proxy rather than the government itself. On the other hand, when confronted with outcomes that asked whether they would support retaliatory responses against the\nforeign country directly or not, without the option of targeting the proxy instead, their attitudes did not shift. This divergence could indicate that delegation may redirect pressure for retaliation toward the proxy, without necessarily limiting demands for the targeted government to respond in some way. In this case, using proxies could help to limit escalation risks, since public opinion preferring to retaliate against the proxy rather than the government should be less likely to trigger a spiral of intensifying conflict between the two adversaries.\nAnother possibility is that delegating to proxies may influence attitudes toward retaliatory options that are viewed as less risky, without shifting public opinion toward potentially costly responses involving direct attacks on powerful foreign adversaries. Sanctions are unlikely to trigger a major, destructive conflict between two countries, even if they deepen tensions. As a result, citizens in a targeted country may shift their views on the kinds of sanctions that are appropriate for responding to a provocation without needing to worry that their country will get dragged into a war. In this case, whether a proxy conducted the attack may influence the public's preferred response. With retaliation that involves significant cyber attacks or killing foreign soldiers, however, it becomes more probable that serious conflict could result. Citizens may have more entrenched views about whether it is worth risking such a conflict, such that their attitudes toward these forms of retaliation are less likely to shift due to a modest strengthening of plausible deniability that results from delegating to a proxy.\nThe article's theoretical framework suggests that delegating to proxies should reduce demands for retaliation by citizens in the targeted state because they are less likely to hold the adversarial government responsible for the attack. As expected, the proxy treatment did have an effect on respondents' attributions of blame for the hostile actions. However, the theoretical link breaks for the retaliate and escalate outcomes, since the proxy treatment did not affect support for these responses. As was just discussed, this discrepancy could be explained by respondents holding relatively entrenched views about the circumstances under which the US government should respond with violence to an adversarial state, with these attitudes unlikely to be affected by modest changes in perceptions of the foreign government's responsibility.\nDid the theoretical link hold for the sanctions outcome, with respondents in the proxy treatment less willing to sanction senior government officials because they blamed them less when the proxies conducted the attacks? Consistent with theoretical expectations, mediation analysis indicates that respondents' attributions of responsibility mediated approximately 14% of the proxy treatment's effects on preferences toward whom to sanction . However, this result also suggests the proxy treatment influenced the sanctions outcome through other mechanisms. One possibility is that respondents view the decision to use the proxy as a signal of the foreign government's desire to keep the conflict limited, so they become less willing to impose more punitive sanctions on that government's leadership in response. This mechanism could be explored in future research.\nEven if there is only a modest connection between how the public in a targeted country attributes responsibility for hostile actions and how they want their own\ngovernment to respond, attacking states may still benefit in other ways from relying on proxies to reduce their exposure to blame. It is likely that when a state is viewed as more responsible for an attack by its target's citizens, its reputation among the public in that country will decline. This declining reputation could have negative consequences for the public's willingness to engage or trade with the opposing state, resulting in political or economic costs for the attacker. As a result, states may still delegate to proxies in an effort to limit their exposure to blame for hostile actions, even if the primary motivation differs from trying to control escalation risks.\nAt the same time, the small magnitude of the effects on respondents' attributions of blame suggests that the use of proxies is unlikely to cause dramatic shifts in how people in targeted states think about responsibility for hostile acts. If a non-state actor is known to have strong ties to a foreign government, many people appear likely to assume that its activities are linked to its sponsor's goals and directives. However, it is possible the effect sizes represent a lower bound for how public opinion would react in real-world situations. First, the vignettes were designed to provide hard tests of the hypothesized relationships by relying on countries with authoritarian governments disliked by majorities of Americans. It is possible that delegating to proxies would have stronger effects when used by democracies or between states where citizens have more neutral views of the opposing governments. Second, it is plausible that the hypothetical -- and low-stakes -- nature of the vignettes made respondents less responsive to the treatments and more willing to record negative answers about countries they dislike. The vignettes were designed to reflect actual situations in which states have sought to obscure aspects of their foreign policies by delegating to proxies, and research comparing survey experiments to actual political attitudes suggests they do a reasonable job of generalizing to real political developments (e.g. Hainmueller et al. 2015). However, compared to real-world attacks, respondents may have felt less uncertainty about assigning blame to the foreign government in the survey.\nRegarding generalizability, the three scenarios produced relatively consistent results. The proxy treatments reduced attributions of blame and perceptions of high-level orders for the attacks with similarly-sized treatment effects for the three non-state actors in the China, Russia, and Iran incidents. The treatments also had similar effects on preferences toward sanctions, though the magnitude was smaller for Iran. One possible explanation for this difference is that sanctioning Iran had already been part of a prominent political debate for years by the time the surveys were implemented, resulting in more fixed attitudes on this question. Finally, for the retaliate and escalate outcomes, responses varied somewhat in their direction; however, the magnitudes were consistently small in all cases. These patterns suggest that how the public responds to attacks carried out by proxies may be relatively similar across different types of attacks and when linked to different sponsors.\nHowever, other issues of external validity suggest avenues for future research. First, the language used in the vignettes could be varied to create more or less contestation over responsibility. On the one hand, US officials or journalists could use softer language in their attributions, perhaps“suspecting” certain actors to be responsible for\nthe attack rather than “concluding” that they were. In certain cases, US officials may not even comment at all, and journalists or researchers may not have enough evidence to publish, leaving the public with little more than speculation about which foreign actor should be blamed. In these cases, the use of proxies may produce stronger plausible deniability. On the other hand, government officials or journalists could bring actual evidence to bear in their assertions of responsibility, while also directly calling into question the opposing government's denials of involvement, which could leave them more exposed to blame. Both approaches reflect real-world engagement around covert actions. Sometimes, both government and private sources tread cautiously in how they attribute responsibility. At other times, they release detailed reports along with evidence such as satellite imagery that are capable of shifting public opinion effectively . It seems plausible that public opinion would respond differently based on the kinds of language and arguments used by private and public actors to shape perceptions of responsibility for covert action, and future research could explore this variation. In addition, it may be the case that people in countries outside the United States would react differently to attacks by proxies, particularly if these countries have more or less trustworthy media environments and political leaders, or if they have different historical experiences with conflict. Future research could evaluate how the results generalize to other countries.\n\n---\n\n## ## Conclusion\n\nGovernments frequently rely on proxies to pursue their foreign policy objectives while maintaining plausible deniability of their involvement. This secrecy has been theorized to reduce risks of conflict escalation, in part by limiting domestic pressures on adversaries to retaliate. Yet, proxies often have well-documented and publicized ties to their sponsors, raising questions about the extent to which delegation to proxies can reduce escalation risks by shaping public opinion about responsibility for -- and responses to -- hostile acts.\nThe experiments discussed in this paper suggest that delegating to proxies can influence how people attribute responsibility for an attack on their country's interests, though the reported effect sizes are modest and imply that proxies may only strengthen plausible deniability on the margins. The modest effects could indicate that other factors will often provide stronger motives for governments to delegate to proxies, whether related to lower costs, their knowledge of local conditions, or signaling a lack of interest in escalation . Respondents in the proxy treatment were also substantially more supportive of limited sanctions rather than those targeting senior leadership of the sponsor government, indicating some effect on citizens' views of how their own government should respond to hostilities. These findings contribute to a growing literature on secrecy in international relations by implying that delegation can contribute modestly to plausible deniability while shaping preferences about whom to retaliate against, even in cases where proxies are closely controlled by their sponsors and the credibility of their independence should be relatively low. On the other hand,\nthe proxy treatment did not affect respondents' views of whether the US government should respond with more coercive and escalatory forms of retaliation, such as a major cyber attack on a Chinese city, killing Russian soldiers, or bombing targets in Iran. These null effects could result from respondents' holding more fixed attitudes about the contexts in which the United States should use force against adversarial states, with modest shifts in plausible deniability unlikely to change these views.",

Delegating these actions to proxies is one strategy states use to retain plausible deniability and limit escalation risks. Yet, proxies often have strong ties to sponsoring states, raising questions about their ability to influence blame and demands for retaliation. This paper tests these effects by analyzing American responses to hypothetical attacks by Chinese, Russian, and Iranian actors through experiments administered on three surveys. The results show that using proxies for these attacks modestly reduced how much Americans blamed the respective foreign governments, while also limiting demands that their senior leadership be sanctioned. However, the use of proxies did not affect Americans' attitudes toward more forceful responses by the US government. These findings contribute to understanding of how proxies shape plausible deniability and escalation risks in international conflicts.\n\n# Keywords\n\nconflict management, domestic politics, foreign policy, interstate conflict\n\n$^{1}$ Department of Social and Political Sciences, Bocconi University, Milano, Italy\n\n# Corresponding Author:\n\nScott Williamson, Department of Social and Political Sciences, Bocconi University, Via Sarfatti, 25, Milano 20136, Italy.\n\nEmail: scott.williamson@unibocconi.it",
    "Introduction\n\nIn February 2018, Syrian and Russian forces attacked an American outpost in Syria. The assault dragged on for more than four hours, during which hundreds of the attacking soldiers were killed. Despite fears the incident could trigger conflict between Russian and American forces in Syria, escalation did not occur. The Russian government quickly distanced itself from the attack by claiming they had no control over the soldiers, who were not part of the Russian military. Instead, they were employees of a private military company called the Wagner Group (Gibbons-Neff 2018). This company has often served as a Russian proxy in conflicts where the government has not wished to involve itself openly, including in Libya, Ukraine, Venezuela, and Syria (Rabin 2019).\n\nCovert actions such as these are a common feature of international affairs, with states frequently attempting to disguise aspects of their foreign policies. Scholars have proposed that this emphasis on secrecy can contribute to stability within the international system by reducing the likelihood of conflict escalation (Carnegie and Carson 2018; Carson 2016; Joseph and Poznansky 2018; Yarhi-Milo 2013). This advantage is thought to occur in part because adversaries who engage each other secretly should be less likely to trigger domestic pressures that push them to increase the scope of the conflict (Carson 2016; Fearon 1994; Tomz et al. 2020).\n\nDelegating to their non-state proxies is one strategy states use when trying to preserve secrecy around their involvement in hostile actions (Groh 2019). In theory, the proxy's ability to claim independence from the chain of command can provide the state with more plausible deniability about their lack of responsibility. If this strategy is effective, it follows that public opinion in a targeted country should respond differently to denials of responsibility for hostile actions carried out by a state's proxies rather than its military or other security institutions. Specifically, this delegation should weaken attributions of blame against the attacking government while limiting demands for retaliation, thus mitigating pressures on the targeted government to respond. However, there are reasons to doubt whether proxies make deniability more plausible, since they frequently demonstrate strong ties to their patrons, which should undermine the credibility of claims that their decision-making is independent. Returning to the Russian Wagner Group, for example, the company's founder has a personal relationship with President Putin, and the company is known to receive funding, training, and equipment from the Russian military and intelligence apparatus (Rabin 2019). This relationship has become even more publicly apparent since the Russian invasion of Ukraine (Kirby 2023).\n\nTo date, there has been relatively little research on public opinion toward secrecy in international politics (Carnegie 2021; Myrick 2019), including whether and how delegating hostile actions to proxies shapes public opinion. I evaluate whether this delegation can influence attributions of blame and demands for retaliation by implementing seven vignette experiments across three surveys of American adults. The vignettes address hypothetical attacks against US targets by Russian, Chinese, and",
    "Iranian actors, with these countries' governments denying involvement in the attacks. Respondents are randomly assigned to read that the attackers were part of a military unit or proxy group tied to the foreign government, after which they assess responsibility for the incident and evaluate possible US responses. These countries were chosen not only because their governments rely frequently on covert action, but also because their authoritarian political systems and their unpopularity with the American public should create a hard test of the hypothesized relationships.\n\nThe results show that respondents become less likely to attribute responsibility to the adversarial governments when attacks were carried out by proxies. The effects are small, however, suggesting that the use of proxies with known ties to the sponsor may marginally strengthen a government's plausible deniability of involvement in an attack without substantially altering the extent to which citizens in the targeted state blame that government. The results also provide mixed support for the ability of covert action to mitigate demands for escalation. Respondents in the proxy treatment groups are substantially less likely to support sanctioning the senior leadership of the adversarial governments instead of subordinate individuals involved directly in the attacks, and this effect is partially mediated by the treatment's effects on respondents' attributions of blame. However, respondents are not less likely to support forceful, retaliatory attacks by the US government that would reflect a clear escalation of the conflict. One interpretation of these findings is that delegation to proxies may help reduce escalation risks by increasing the likelihood that the targeted public prefers to retaliate against the proxy itself, but is less likely to influence citizens' views on their government responding to hostilities with coercive and forceful forms of retaliation.\n\nThese findings contribute to international relations research on secrecy by providing experimental evidence that both reinforces and expands on existing theories about the effects of covert action and plausible deniability on conflict, insofar as they provide some evidence that acting covertly through proxies can reduce a government's exposure to blame and shape how citizens in a targeted country think about the appropriate response (e.g. Carnegie and Carson 2018; Carson 2016; Hedgecock and Sukin 2023; Joseph and Poznansky 2018). They also extend a nascent body of work on public opinion toward the role of non-state proxies in international politics (e.g. Plana 2020). In addition, by showing that authoritarian regimes can reduce their exposure to blame in international conflicts by delegating to non-state proxies, the findings contribute to a large literature on blame avoidance that has to date focused primarily on domestic politics and democratic political systems (Baekkeskov and Rubin 2016).\n\nThis article proceeds as follows. It first reviews literature on covert action and secrecy in international politics before outlining expectations about the effects of proxies on attributions of responsibility and demands for retaliation. It then discusses the selected cases and research design for the experiments, before presenting the results. The article concludes with a discussion of external validity and implications for international relations research.\n\n##",
    "Secrecy, Delegation, and Conflict Escalation\n\nSecrecy is a common feature of international politics (Carnegie 2021), and a growing literature seeks to explain why states might attempt to conceal outcomes ranging from military alliances to the resolution of international legal disputes or crises (Hafner-Burton and Victor 2016; Kuo 2020; Kurizaki 2007). Covert action reflects one aspect of secrecy in the international system, whereby states attempt to obscure their involvement in hostile activities targeting another state or political entity. Well-known examples include the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba by US-backed Cuban exiles, or participation by Soviet pilots in the Korean War against the United States. As with these examples, covert operations or their outcomes tend to be visible publicly, and the objective is not to keep the acts themselves secret, but rather to conceal or create doubt about who was involved (DeVine 2022).\n\nThe identity of the responsible actor does not always stay secret to other states, whose governments often have the intelligence capacity to make reasonable determinations about who is behind an attack. Even so, the costs and risks associated with covert operations can prove useful by signaling resolve to the observing states (Carson and Yarhi-Milo 2017). Furthermore, covert action is more likely to succeed at concealing the identity of the responsible actor from the public. As a result, states may rely on it to obscure aspects of their foreign policy that would damage their reputations domestically or abroad (Joseph and Poznansky 2018). For example, democracies may use covert action against other democracies to avoid domestic backlash for violating the expectation that they remain on good terms with democratic governments (Crandall et al. 2018). Relatedly, governments may delegate violence against civilians to non-state actors to obscure their involvement from international audiences who would respond negatively to human rights violations (Carey et al. 2015).\n\nBy providing plausible deniability that conceals responsibility for hostile activities from the public, covert action has been theorized to help adversarial states reduce the risks of conflict escalation. Research indicates that political and military leaders are susceptible to pressure from public opinion when deciding whether and how to deploy military force (Chu and Recchia 2022; Lin-Greenberg 2021; Tomz et al. 2020). Keeping hostilities on the “backstage” and out of the public eye should help states to avoid pressures from hawkish domestic constituencies who wish to expand the scope of the conflict, while allowing states to signal to each other that they do not want to escalate (Carson 2016, 2018; Joseph and Poznansky 2018). In other words, by obscuring their involvement, states may be able to limit escalation risks in part by decreasing the likelihood that citizens in the targeted country demand a response from their own government that would escalate the conflict. As an example of this mechanism in action, Carson (2018, 21) notes how Nazi Germany monitored foreign reactions to its involvement in the Spanish Civil War and “...carefully calibrated covert German combat participation in light of hawkish domestic sentiment in London and Paris.”",
    "Because the point of covert action is to obscure the identity of the responsible actor, states often pursue these operations through their proxies, whether corporations, informal militias, or “volunteer” fighters. Research on blame attributions and accountability implies that this strategy of delegating to proxies should be effective at creating plausible deniability that influences perceptions of responsibility in the targeted state. People are more likely to believe an actor is responsible for an outcome when they have direct control over the decision-making process that produces the outcome (Hood 2011). In cases where delegation occurs and multiple decision-makers are involved, clarity of responsibility is diminished and political actors are more capable of avoiding blame (Martin and Raffler 2021; Powell and Whitten 1993). Experimental research suggests these blame avoidance benefits can occur even when people know the delegator and delegatee share the same interests (Bartling and Fischbacher 2012). In terms of international relations, proxies such as militias or corporations are entities separate from the state apparatus, and, at least in theory, they can make decisions more independently than a military or intelligence unit. This potential independence should make it harder for citizens in the targeted state to determine whether an action occurred because of directives from the sponsor or because of the proxy's own initiative. As a result, delegating to proxies should increase plausible deniability and help the sponsor to limit how much it is held responsible by citizens of the targeted state.\n\nAs noted in the literature on covert action, governments may benefit from this redirection of perceived responsibility for several reasons, including protecting their political support domestically and their soft power internationally if their involvement in the hostile acts would be viewed negatively (Joseph and Poznansky 2018). Of primary interest to this article is that shifting blame through covert operations may also help governments to reduce the likelihood of citizens in the targeted country demanding retaliation that escalates the conflict (Carson 2018). The blame avoidance literature provides a framework for understanding why delegating to proxies could shape attitudes toward retaliation as well. Because blame helps people to identify who should be held accountable for a problematic outcome, those who limit their exposure to blame should face fewer demands that they be punished (Hood 2014). Thus, if delegating to a proxy can reduce how many people in the targeted country blame the sponsoring state for a hostile action, it follows that these people may also become less likely to want their government to hold that state accountable by retaliating against it. In other words, using proxies to conduct covert actions could weaken domestic pressure on the targeted government to expand the conflict, which would reduce escalation risks by limiting incentives for political and military leaders to respond forcefully (Carson 2016; Tomz et al. 2020).\n\nFrom this theoretical framework, I expect the following when hostile actions are known to be conducted by a state's proxies rather than its own military forces. First, when a proxy is involved, I expect that respondents will be more likely to believe a foreign government's denials of responsibility -- i.e. they will blame the government less. Second, because respondents attribute less blame to the foreign government, I",
    "expect that they will be less likely to support retaliation against that government as well.\n\nHowever, there are also reasons to expect that delegating to proxies may have little effect on attributions of responsibility or attitudes toward retaliation. First, proxies often lack credible separation from their sponsors. If the proxy is a domestic entity with legal status within the sponsoring country, it may be constrained in its ability to pursue foreign policy objectives that contradict those of the government. This limitation is especially likely to apply in authoritarian regimes, where the government controls most domestic organizations closely to ensure that they do not work against the authorities. Foreign proxies of a government might have more credible claims to independence, since they exist outside that government's legal and coercive apparatus. Nonetheless, in these cases, journalists and foreign governments often go to great lengths to publicize ties between the proxy and its sponsor. If people do not believe that the proxy has genuine independence to operate, they are unlikely to absolve the sponsoring state of blame.\n\nSecond, if citizens in the targeted state dislike the sponsor government intensely and are primed to distrust it, they may discount claims of separation from the proxy. This reaction may be particularly likely in contexts where two states have a history of poor relations -- i.e. the contexts in which hostile covert actions are most likely to be conducted. Finally, citizens of a targeted state may blame the sponsor of an attacking proxy for failing to control their proxy, even if the sponsors did not intend for the attack to happen.\n\n## Research Design\n\nTo test how covert action by proxies influences attributions of blame and demands for retaliation, I implemented seven vignette experiments across three surveys administered online in the United States. Experiments have become increasingly common in the international relations literature, and they are particularly useful for studying IR theories that involve public opinion (Hyde 2015) -- including issues of secrecy and covert action (e.g. Myrick 2019). The following sections provide further details about the design.\n\n### Samples\n\nThe first survey was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 1299 American adults recruited by the firm Lucid in April 2019. Each respondent read and answered outcome questions for two vignettes: one involving China, and the other involving Russia. The survey was designed with the expectations about delegation, blame, and escalation in mind but was exploratory and not pre-registered.\n\nThe second survey was pre-registered. I specified hypotheses and analyses that would indicate replication of findings from the first survey, and I expanded the experiment by adding additional outcome questions in line with the theoretical",
    "expectations. This second survey was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 3053 respondents recruited by Lucid in March 2021. Each respondent on the second survey saw the same China and Russia vignettes used on the first survey. In addition, they also read and responded to questions about a vignette involving Iran.\n\nThe third survey was intended to provide an additional replication check, while also facilitating exploratory analysis of patterns identified in the second survey. It was conducted on Qualtrics with a sample of 2007 American adults recruited by Lucid in May 2021. This survey used the Russia and Iran vignettes but dropped the China vignette due to time constraints. All three surveys were representative on age, gender, income, ethnicity, and US region. Summary statistics can be found in the SI.\n\n### Case Selection\n\nI chose to center my vignettes around hostile actions attributed to Chinese, Russian, and Iranian actors. These three cases are useful for several reasons. The first is that all three countries are relatively unpopular in the United States due to a history of adversarial relations. My survey data highlights these unfavorable perceptions among American adults. In the first survey in 2019, 15% of respondents reported a favorable view of Russia and 16% said the same about China. In the second survey in 2021, only 25% of respondents said they had a favorable view of China, 20% reported a favorable view of Russia, and 11% claimed to have a favorable view of Iran. These negative attitudes should make it less likely that respondents would give these governments the benefit of the doubt when they deny involvement in hostile actions carried out by their proxies. The second reason is that all three countries are governed by authoritarian regimes. China's government operates a massive surveillance state that exercises extensive control over the population. Russia and Iran also control their societies closely. These political systems make it less likely that proxy groups are operating independently of the authorities, which should reduce the credibility of delegation and make it less likely that people believe that the proxy's sponsor was not involved. These first two reasons suggest the countries provide a hard test of the hypothesized effects.\n\nFinally, the third reason is that all three countries regularly engage in covert action to advance their foreign policy objectives, and they frequently do so by delegating to non-state proxies that are believed to provide a degree of plausible deniability. As such, the survey vignettes should be highly relevant to real-world events. In the following paragraphs, I briefly discuss examples from each case.\n\nChina: As cyber activities have become increasingly important for global politics, China has invested heavily in its cyber capabilities to gather political and economic intelligence (Beecroft 2021). The Chinese government has used a variety of actors to conduct cyberattacks, including military personnel. In 2020, the US government charged four members of the People's Liberation Army for hacking the credit agency Equifax and acquiring data on tens of millions of Americans (US Department of Justice 2020). This case reflected a long history of Chinese state hackers conducting economic espionage against American corporations (Dorfman 2020). At the same time, the",
    "government also works through proxies, including Chinese corporations and hacking groups. Chinese technology companies such as Huawei have been linked to espionage, with their equipment used to facilitate cyber intrusions (Robertson and Tarabay 2021), monitor the domestic population (Dou 2021), and process stolen data (Dorfman 2020). Chinese security officers have also established front companies to conduct cyberattacks. In a criminal case against four Chinese citizens accused of economic espionage, the US government alleged that the individuals were Chinese security officials in a provincial branch of the Ministry of State Security (MSS) who had “sought to obfuscate the Chinese government's role in such theft by establishing a front company, Hainan Xiandun Technology Department Co. Ltd” (US Department of Justice 2021).\n\nSeveral hacking groups have also been identified as proxies conducting cyberattacks on behalf of the Chinese government. An attack on Microsoft Exchange in 2021 was attributed to a group given the name Hafnium, which has been linked to the MSS by Western governments (Corera 2021). Another operation, known as Cloud Hopper, was attributed to the group APT10, which has also been connected to the MSS (Sabbagh 2021). While Western governments have attributed responsibility for the actions of these groups to the Chinese government, some ambiguity remains about the nature of the relationship. For instance, there is evidence that APT10 has also conducted cyberattacks to steal information for personal gain, raising questions about whether the group “enjoys protections that enable it to conduct its own for-profit activities” or “has simply evaded scrutiny from Chinese authorities” (Taylor 2019).\n\nRussia: The Russian government has made extensive use of proxies to achieve its foreign policy objectives. In Ukraine, prior to the invasion of 2022, it encouraged and then supported separatist groups in their attempts to establish independent states tied closely to Russia (International Crisis Group 2019), a tactic it has used to expand its influence in other countries including Georgia and Moldova (Cornell and Shaffer 2020). Russia has also increasingly turned to private military companies to advance its interests abroad (Hoffman and Orner 2021), the most well-known of which is the Wagner Group that has already been mentioned. These organizations have participated in conflicts in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe, receiving private gains while also extending Russia's influence. In Sudan, the Wagner Group was deployed in 2017 to help repress uprisings against Omar Al-Bashir. As payment, the company's owner was given exclusive rights to mine gold in the country, and the Russian government was later offered a naval base on the Red Sea before Al-Bashir was overthrown in 2019 (Fasanotti 2022). These companies exist in a legal gray area under Russian law and are technically separate from the state, even as they are owned and directed by individuals with close ties to President Putin and the security elite (Stronski 2020; Rondeaux 2019).\n\nWhile the connections are clear between Moscow and the proxies discussed above, debate has continued about how closely the Russian government controls them. Regarding private military companies like the Wagner Group, the extent to which they are “simply patriotic volunteers as the Kremlin claims...on official assignment for Russia's GRU intelligence service...mercenaries, corporate warriors, or frontline",
    "soldiers” remains unclear (Rondeaux 2019). All of these identities may be true at different moments, fostering uncertainty about their role in specific conflicts or time periods. Analysts have argued that this ambiguity provides enough plausible deniability to help Russia avoid accountability for human rights violations and limit escalation risks in the conflicts in which these organizations are involved (Cornell and Shaffer 2020; Fasanotti 2022; Rondeaux 2019; Stronski 2020).\n\nIran: The use of proxy groups to extend its influence in the Middle East has been a central component of Iran's foreign policy for decades. The Iranian government maintains close ties with militant organizations and political movements in countries including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine, Pakistan, Syria, and Yemen (Jones 2019; Lane 2021). These organizations have received financial support, weapons, and training from Iran and often work closely with the Revolutionary Guard to advance the country's regional interests. They include Hezbollah in Lebanon, which operates a successful political party and a well-armed militia that has fought alongside the Syrian and Iranian governments in the Syrian civil war. They also include several militias in Iraq that have a formal relationship with the Iraqi armed forces (Azizi 2022), such as Kata'ib Hizballah, Asaib Ahl Al-Haq, and Harakat Hezbollah Al-Nujaba (Lane 2021). These groups participate openly in the political system, where they have worked to pull Iraq closer to Iran, and they have also taken part in armed attacks on US and Saudi targets (Malik 2020).\n\nDespite their close ties to Iran, most of these groups have their own domestic political interests and are not controlled fully from Tehran. In Yemen, Iranian support for the Houthis does not outweigh the group's own interests in fighting its domestic opponents and their international backers (Juneau 2016). While Iran does at times exercise direct influence over the decision-making of Hezbollah in Lebanon, its influence is usually indirect and decisions are made by Hezbollah's leaders (DeVore 2012). Likewise, the Iranian-aligned militias in Iraq are involved in Iraqi politics and frequently pursue their own political interests (Loveluck and Salim 2021). Though they coordinate militant activities closely with Iran's Revolutionary Guard, they are not entirely beholden to them and often act independently. For example, the failed assassination attempt against Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi in 2021 was suspected to have been carried out by one of the Iranian-aligned militias without approval from Iran (Khalid 2021). In addition, the militias have often attacked US forces even at moments when Iran is attempting to deescalate relations with the United States (Yuan 2021). The fact that these groups will act in their own interest can create ambiguity about the extent of Iranian involvement.\n\n### Vignettes\n\nFor each vignette in my surveys, respondents were provided with information about an attack linked to an adversarial foreign power against US interests. All details of the situation were held constant, except for the identity of the organization alleged to have carried out the attack. Respondents were told that the vignettes were hypothetical to",
    "ensure no deception about events that could cause anger toward a foreign country. However, the content of the vignettes was selected to reflect real-world political developments discussed in the cases above. Respondents were told that the actor involved in the attack had been identified, and the attacker was randomized to be a military unit or proxy of the foreign government. The vignettes always noted that the relevant foreign government had denied foreknowledge of the attack and blamed it on a rogue operation. Because I am interested in how delegation to proxies affects public opinion by giving the government greater plausible deniability or not, it was important to be clear that the foreign government had denied involvement across the treatment groups. These scenarios reflect real-world use of covert action, where the attack is usually observed by everyone, there are attempts by government officials, journalists, and researchers to figure out who was directly involved, and the government on which the most suspicion is cast publicly denies responsibility.\n\nIn the first survey, the identity of the attacking organization was said to be determined by US officials. In the second and third surveys, I randomized whether the identity was determined by US officials or journalists. I included this additional randomization to account for the possibility that the source of information would shape responses to the proxy versus military treatments. It is possible that respondents would perceive US officials attributing blame to a proxy rather than the military as a signal that the US government did not wish to escalate the conflict, rather than as an objective statement about who was directly involved in the attack. In this case, respondents might attribute less blame to the foreign government and demand less escalation not because they believed the foreign government was less directly involved, but because they trusted the US government had good reasons to avoid escalation. However, I do not find any meaningful or consistent differences based on this randomization.\n\nThe China vignette discussed a cyberattack that stole valuable technology from a US company. The vignette randomized whether the attack was attributed to a Chinese military unit, private corporation, or state-run corporation. The state-run corporation should create less plausible deniability than the private corporation; however, its distance from the chain of command could strengthen that plausibility relative to the military unit. As discussed above, Chinese hackers linked to both state institutions and private companies have previously stolen sensitive technologies from American companies (Dofman 2020; Sullivan and Schuknect 2019).\n\nThe Russia vignette involved an attack on US soldiers in Syria by Russian forces. The attack was attributed either to soldiers in a Russian military unit or a Russian private military company. Throughout the Syrian civil war, American soldiers have been involved in clashes with Russian military forces but also members of the private Russian military companies that are used as proxy forces (Gibbons-Neff 2018; Schmitt 2020).",
    "Finally, the Iran vignette detailed an attack on US forces in Iraq by actors linked to Iran. Respondents were randomly assigned to read that the attack was connected to an Iranian military unit or an Iraqi militia with ties to Iran. These incidents have also occurred frequently since the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. As noted above, the attacks are often linked to Iranian-sponsored militias (Khaleel and Arraf 2021), but Iranian forces have been involved directly as well (Branigin 2011).\n\nThe full text of the vignettes are below:China Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that a Chinese (military unit/state-owned corporation/private corporation) was behind a major cyber attack on a US energy company, in which hackers stole valuable technological plans for a new renewable energy source. The Chinese government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on a rogue operation by hackers in the (military unit/state-owned corporation/private corporation).Russia Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that soldiers from a Russian (military unit/private security company) were behind an attack on US forces in Syria that killed two American soldiers. The Russian government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on officers in the (military unit/private security company) on the ground in Syria.Iran Vignette: (US officials/Journalists) have concluded that soldiers from (an Iranian military unit/an Iraqi militia with ties to Iran) were behind a rocket attack on US forces in Iraq that killed two American soldiers. The Iranian government has denied knowledge of the attack, which it blamed on rogue officers in the (military unit/militia) in Iraq.\n\nAll randomizations within each scenario occurred with equal probability. Balance tests are reported in the SI.\n\nAn important motive for using multiple scenarios was to assess whether the effects of delegating to proxies would generalize to different situations in which covert action is commonly used. The scenarios reflect different types of attacks (cyber vs kinetic), different foreign governments (China, Russia, and Iran), and different proxies (corporations and militias). My expectation was that delegation would have similar effects across the scenarios, as the theoretical logic -- more credible independence of the proxy reducing attributions of blame and therefore demands for retaliation -- should apply even as the specific details vary. However, it is possible that these different scenarios would produce variation in responses. For example, cyber attacks may affect public opinion differently than kinetic attacks by limiting demands for forceful retaliation (e.g. Kreps and Schneider 2019). I explore generalizability further while discussing the results.",
    "Outcomes\n\nFollowing each vignette, respondents were asked outcome questions to assess their attributions of responsibility for the attacks and their views about how the US government should respond.\n\nRegarding responsibility, respondents on all three surveys were asked if the foreign governments should be blamed for the attacks. The question was worded “Do you agree or disagree that the [relevant] government should be blamed for this attack?” On the second and third surveys, respondents were also asked about who had ordered the attack, with the question “Do you think it is likely or unlikely senior officials in the [relevant] government ordered this attack?” This question provided a more direct assessment of whether respondents believed high-level officials were directly involved in -- and therefore responsible for -- the action. Answers for both questions ranged from strongly agree to strongly disagree on a 7 point Likert scale, with stronger attributions of responsibility coded as higher values. If respondents in the proxy treatment groups became less likely to blame the foreign governments and less likely to believe they ordered the attacks, it would provide support for the expectation that delegating to proxies can strengthen plausible deniability and help governments avoid blame in targeted states.\n\nRegarding the US response, respondents on the first and second surveys were asked if the US government should pursue targeted sanctions against the lower-level officials in the relevant proxies or military units, or if the US government should implement sanctions against senior officials in the respective governments. The question was worded as follows: “The US government is deciding how to respond to the attack. Which option do you see as a more appropriate response?” Respondents could then choose that “The US government responds by sanctioning the officers in charge of the [military unit/corporation/militia] or that “The US government responds by sanctioning senior officials in the [relevant] government. This latter option would be more likely to escalate conflict and deepen tensions between the two countries, since it reflects a direct attempt to punish the most important decision-makers in the foreign state. For example, the Chinese government responded angrily to US sanctions on senior Chinese officials over its Hong Kong policies (Wadhams 2020). In other words, respondents were forced to choose between a response that would hold accountable only those individuals involved directly in the event, or a stronger, more escalatory response that would hold accountable the top levels of the foreign government.\n\nOn the second survey, respondents were also asked if they would support US retaliation involving attacks on the respective countries, with answers ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree on a 7 point Likert scale. The first part of the question stated that “The US government is also deciding whether to retaliate by...” The remainder of the question specified actions including a “hacking attack that cuts off electricity to a major Chinese city” for the Chinese vignette, an attack “targeting several Russian soldiers in Syria” for the Russia vignette, and “bombing military targets in Iran” for the Iran vignette. In each case, the proposed US response was designed to",
    "appear escalatory. Cutting power to a major Chinese city would reflect an escalation over stealing technology; killing “several” Russian soldiers implies a higher cost on Russia than the two US soldiers killed; and bombing Iran would reflect an escalation from the tit-for-tat conflict between the two countries in Iraq.\n\nOne possible limitation of the second question is that respondents were not asked directly whether they would prefer to escalate, and some respondents may not have viewed the retaliatory options as escalatory. As a result, for the Iran and Russia vignettes included on the third survey, I used an outcome question designed to follow up on patterns identified in the first and second surveys by asking respondents directly about their attitudes toward escalation. The question stated that “The US government is deciding how to respond to the attack. Which option do you see as the most appropriate response?” Respondents could then choose between three options: that the US government “decides to deescalate by not targeting any [relevant government] soldiers,” that the US government “decides to respond proportionally by targeting and killing two [relevant government] soldiers, or that the US government “decides to escalate by targeting and killing twenty [relevant government] soldiers.” Because time was more limited on the third survey, I was unable to include the other two outcome questions about how the US government should respond to the attack.\n\nIf respondents in the proxy treatment group became more likely to prefer targeted sanctions, less likely to support a retaliatory attack, and less likely to approve explicitly of escalation, it would be consistent with delegation to proxies reducing pressure on the targeted government to escalate the conflict.\n\nTable 1 reports the mean and standard deviation for each outcome measure. It also illustrates which questions were asked for which country vignette on which surveys. In general, respondents are somewhat likely to blame the foreign government for the attacks and to believe that senior officials ordered them. Regarding the sanction outcome, respondents tend to be roughly split on whether sanctions should target higher-level authorities or the specific individuals involved in the attacks. Support for retaliating with force is lower, with respondents neutral on average about the retaliatory attack outcome, and with respondents mostly split between the US government either deescalating or responding proportionally -- but not escalating -- for the escalation outcome.\n\n## Results\n\nI use two approaches to report treatment effects. First, I aggregate data across the three scenarios on the three surveys, creating a single proxy treatment indicator for respondents assigned to the Chinese corporation, Russian private security company, or Iranian-aligned Iraqi militia treatments in each of the experiments. I use OLS to regress the outcomes on the proxy treatment. Dummy variables for the scenarios are included to account for different baseline responses in the military conditions, and I cluster standard errors by respondent, since each respondent completed more than one scenario on the same survey (Hainmueller et al. 2014).

Second, I then provide treatment effects for each of the scenarios on each survey to assess consistency. These effects are also analyzed with OLS regression, using models that control for age, gender, education, political interest, partisanship, foreign policy orientation, and region of residence. These controls were also pre-registered. They are relevant to foreign policy attitudes, are correlated with the outcomes, and were measured pre-treatment, so they can help to increase precision (Gerber and Green 2012). Results without control variables are consistent and are reported in the SI.\n\nTable 2 reports main effects for the proxy treatment in the aggregated data. The first two columns show results for the outcomes related to attributions of responsibility, with the first showing the effect of the treatment on perceptions that the foreign government should be blamed for the attack, and the second showing the effect on beliefs that senior officials in the foreign government ordered the attack. For both outcomes, assignment to the proxy treatment reduces attributions of responsibility by 0.14 on the seven point scale  $(p &lt; 0.001)$ . This effect is equivalent to a shift of approximately one-tenth of a standard deviation, indicating a modest impact on how respondents attribute responsibility for the hostilities. This small decrease occurred from relatively high levels of blame directed at the foreign government in the military treatments, where the",

The effect of the proxy treatment on the sanctions outcome is substantively large. Respondents assigned to the proxy groups are 9 percentage points less likely to prefer sanctioning senior government officials over officials in the specific unit involved in the attack  $(p &lt; 0.001)$ . This effect reflects a shift of approximately two-fifths of a standard deviation and reduces support for the more escalatory sanctions below a majority of respondents. However, the proxy treatment did not have any influence on the other two response outcomes. Though coefficients were negative in both cases, they were near zero and statistically insignificant. In other words, respondents who read that proxies conducted the hostilities were not less likely to support retaliatory attacks by the United States against the relevant foreign country, and they were not less likely to support a response directly described as escalatory.\n\nNext, I report the effects for the proxy treatment in each scenario across the three surveys. These effects are displayed in Figures 1 and 2. The former addresses the attribution outcomes and the latter shows the response outcomes.\n\nFor the attribution outcomes, the treatment effects point in a consistent direction that reflects the negative effect in the aggregated results. Regarding blame, respondents in the first and second surveys who read that the hacking attack was carried out by a Chinese private corporation were 0.22 ( $p &lt; 0.05$ ) and 0.10 ( $p &lt; 0.10$ ) less likely to attribute responsibility to the Chinese government compared to respondents in the military treatment. On the other hand, the coefficients for the Chinese state corporation were negative but statistically insignificant in both surveys. Relative to the military treatment in the Russia scenario, the private security treatment reduced blame directed at the Russian government by 0.15 ( $p &lt; 0.10$ ) in the first survey, by 0.18 ( $p &lt; 0.001$ ) in the second survey, and by 0.13 ( $p &lt; 0.05$ ) in the third survey. Finally, for the Iran scenario, the militia treatment decreased blame relative to the military treatment by 0.20",

Again, however, the effect of the state corporation was negative but not statistically significant. For the second survey, the private security treatment reduced the Russian government's perceived role by 0.12 $(p &lt; 0.05)$, while the Iraqi militia treatment reduced the Iranian government's perceived role in ordering the attacks by 0.21 $(p &lt; 0.001)$. On the third survey, the Russia treatment lost significance but the Iran treatment continued to reduce the perceived role by 0.10 $(p &lt; 0.10)$.\n\nWhile there is some variation across the scenarios and surveys, these effects are consistent with the aggregate data. They suggest that individuals may be less likely to attribute responsibility to foreign governments that have denied involvement in an attack when that attack is conducted by proxies, and this pattern appears with different countries and different types of hostilities. However, the modest effect sizes also imply that delegating to proxies is unlikely to substantially transform public perceptions of blame in these scenarios. In terms of",
    "Journal of Conflict Resolution 68(2-3)\n\nvariation across the treatments, the Chinese state-run corporation effect was consistently insignificant and weaker than the others. Though the difference is small, it reflects the expectation that plausible deniability should be stronger when the proxies have more credible separation from the sponsoring state.\n\nFor the response outcomes shown in Figure 2, the results are generally consistent as well. Proxies strongly reduce support for sanctioning senior government officials but produce limited to no effects on attitudes toward retaliatory attacks that could escalate the conflict.\n\nRegarding the sanctions outcome, respondents in the proxy treatment groups were consistently less likely to prefer sanctions against senior government officials over more targeted sanctions against lower-level officials in the organization that conducted the attack. In contrast to the responsibility outcomes, this finding applied to both Chinese corporation treatments. In the first and second surveys, the Chinese private corporation reduced the preference for senior-level sanctions by  $12(p &lt; 0.001)$  and  $16(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points, while the state-run corporation reduced this preference by  $12(p &lt; 0.001)$  and  $14(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points. Likewise, the Russian security company reduced support for sanctioning senior officials by  $8(p &lt; 0.01)$  and  $10(p &lt; 0.001)$  percentage points in the first and second surveys. The effect for the Iraqi militia treatment was smaller, reducing support for sanctions on senior Iranian officials by approximately 4 percentage points  $(p &lt; 0.05)$ .\n\nFor the retaliate and escalate outcomes, however, the proxy treatment produced effects that were inconsistent in their direction and for the most part statistically insignificant. For retaliate, the Chinese state corporation treatment slightly increased\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\nFigure 2. Treatment effects for response outcomes.

    "support for the hacking attack on the electrical grid of a Chinese city, though the effect was insignificant. The Chinese private corporation and the Russian security company produced very small, negative effects that failed to attain statistical significance. The Iraqi militia treatment slightly reduced support for bombing military targets in Iran, by 0.10 (p < 0.10). Respondents in the military treatments were split on whether the US government should pursue these retaliatory actions against the Chinese, Russian, and Iranian governments, with average responses of approximately 4 on the 7-point scale, and the proxy treatments had no discernible impact on these attitudes.\n\nThe third survey was intended to explore further the discrepancy between the sanction and retaliation outcomes by incorporating a new outcome question that asked respondents explicitly whether they wished the US government to deescalate, respond proportionally, or escalate (taking values of 0, 1, and 2 respectively). However, the proxy treatments also did not produce consistent effects on attitudes toward this escalate outcome. The Russian private security company did have a small, negative effect of 0.05 (p < 0.05) on the 3-point scale, compared to the Russian military treatment. On the other hand, the Iraqi militia returned a positive but insignificant effect compared to the Iranian military unit. In both scenarios, most respondents in the control group were split between preferring a deescalatory or proportional response: few wanted to escalate the conflict by striking back harder against the foreign country, and the proxy treatments did not have a substantial or consistent impact on these views.\n\nAs reported in the SI, the source identifying the involved actor -- whether US officials or journalists -- did not have a significant effect on the outcomes. In addition, the SI shows that effects of the proxy treatment did not vary consistently based on pre-existing attitudes toward China, Russia, and Iran.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe results show a modest impact of the proxy treatments on respondents' attributions of blame and inconsistent effects on their views of how the US government should respond. Regarding the latter, respondents in the proxy treatments became less likely to prefer sanctioning senior government officials rather than individuals from the unit directly engaged in the hostilities; however, they did not become less likely to prefer retaliatory attacks against the foreign country, and they did not become less likely to support a response explicitly described as escalatory.\n\nTwo possible explanations may account for this divergence between the different response outcomes. One possibility is that delegation to proxies affects whom people prefer their governments to retaliate against, without necessarily affecting levels of support for the government to retaliate in some fashion. When forced to choose between the options of punishing senior government leaders or lower-level officials in the military unit or proxy organization, respondents in the proxy treatment groups were more likely to favor the latter. In other words, they preferred to retaliate against the proxy rather than the government itself. On the other hand, when confronted with outcomes that asked whether they would support retaliatory responses against the",
    "foreign country directly or not, without the option of targeting the proxy instead, their attitudes did not shift. This divergence could indicate that delegation may redirect pressure for retaliation toward the proxy, without necessarily limiting demands for the targeted government to respond in some way. In this case, using proxies could help to limit escalation risks, since public opinion preferring to retaliate against the proxy rather than the government should be less likely to trigger a spiral of intensifying conflict between the two adversaries.\n\nAnother possibility is that delegating to proxies may influence attitudes toward retaliatory options that are viewed as less risky, without shifting public opinion toward potentially costly responses involving direct attacks on powerful foreign adversaries. Sanctions are unlikely to trigger a major, destructive conflict between two countries, even if they deepen tensions. As a result, citizens in a targeted country may shift their views on the kinds of sanctions that are appropriate for responding to a provocation without needing to worry that their country will get dragged into a war. In this case, whether a proxy conducted the attack may influence the public's preferred response. With retaliation that involves significant cyber attacks or killing foreign soldiers, however, it becomes more probable that serious conflict could result. Citizens may have more entrenched views about whether it is worth risking such a conflict, such that their attitudes toward these forms of retaliation are less likely to shift due to a modest strengthening of plausible deniability that results from delegating to a proxy.\n\nThe article's theoretical framework suggests that delegating to proxies should reduce demands for retaliation by citizens in the targeted state because they are less likely to hold the adversarial government responsible for the attack. As expected, the proxy treatment did have an effect on respondents' attributions of blame for the hostile actions. However, the theoretical link breaks for the retaliate and escalate outcomes, since the proxy treatment did not affect support for these responses. As was just discussed, this discrepancy could be explained by respondents holding relatively entrenched views about the circumstances under which the US government should respond with violence to an adversarial state, with these attitudes unlikely to be affected by modest changes in perceptions of the foreign government's responsibility.\n\nDid the theoretical link hold for the sanctions outcome, with respondents in the proxy treatment less willing to sanction senior government officials because they blamed them less when the proxies conducted the attacks? Consistent with theoretical expectations, mediation analysis indicates that respondents' attributions of responsibility mediated approximately 14% of the proxy treatment's effects on preferences toward whom to sanction (Imai et al. 2011). However, this result also suggests the proxy treatment influenced the sanctions outcome through other mechanisms. One possibility is that respondents view the decision to use the proxy as a signal of the foreign government's desire to keep the conflict limited, so they become less willing to impose more punitive sanctions on that government's leadership in response. This mechanism could be explored in future research.\n\nEven if there is only a modest connection between how the public in a targeted country attributes responsibility for hostile actions and how they want their own",
    "government to respond, attacking states may still benefit in other ways from relying on proxies to reduce their exposure to blame. It is likely that when a state is viewed as more responsible for an attack by its target's citizens, its reputation among the public in that country will decline. This declining reputation could have negative consequences for the public's willingness to engage or trade with the opposing state, resulting in political or economic costs for the attacker. As a result, states may still delegate to proxies in an effort to limit their exposure to blame for hostile actions, even if the primary motivation differs from trying to control escalation risks.\n\nAt the same time, the small magnitude of the effects on respondents' attributions of blame suggests that the use of proxies is unlikely to cause dramatic shifts in how people in targeted states think about responsibility for hostile acts. If a non-state actor is known to have strong ties to a foreign government, many people appear likely to assume that its activities are linked to its sponsor's goals and directives. However, it is possible the effect sizes represent a lower bound for how public opinion would react in real-world situations. First, the vignettes were designed to provide hard tests of the hypothesized relationships by relying on countries with authoritarian governments disliked by majorities of Americans. It is possible that delegating to proxies would have stronger effects when used by democracies or between states where citizens have more neutral views of the opposing governments. Second, it is plausible that the hypothetical -- and low-stakes -- nature of the vignettes made respondents less responsive to the treatments and more willing to record negative answers about countries they dislike. The vignettes were designed to reflect actual situations in which states have sought to obscure aspects of their foreign policies by delegating to proxies, and research comparing survey experiments to actual political attitudes suggests they do a reasonable job of generalizing to real political developments (e.g. Hainmueller et al. 2015). However, compared to real-world attacks, respondents may have felt less uncertainty about assigning blame to the foreign government in the survey.\n\nRegarding generalizability, the three scenarios produced relatively consistent results. The proxy treatments reduced attributions of blame and perceptions of high-level orders for the attacks with similarly-sized treatment effects for the three non-state actors in the China, Russia, and Iran incidents. The treatments also had similar effects on preferences toward sanctions, though the magnitude was smaller for Iran. One possible explanation for this difference is that sanctioning Iran had already been part of a prominent political debate for years by the time the surveys were implemented, resulting in more fixed attitudes on this question. Finally, for the retaliate and escalate outcomes, responses varied somewhat in their direction; however, the magnitudes were consistently small in all cases. These patterns suggest that how the public responds to attacks carried out by proxies may be relatively similar across different types of attacks and when linked to different sponsors.\n\nHowever, other issues of external validity suggest avenues for future research. First, the language used in the vignettes could be varied to create more or less contestation over responsibility. On the one hand, US officials or journalists could use softer language in their attributions, perhaps“suspecting” certain actors to be responsible for",
    "the attack rather than “concluding” that they were. In certain cases, US officials may not even comment at all, and journalists or researchers may not have enough evidence to publish, leaving the public with little more than speculation about which foreign actor should be blamed. In these cases, the use of proxies may produce stronger plausible deniability. On the other hand, government officials or journalists could bring actual evidence to bear in their assertions of responsibility, while also directly calling into question the opposing government's denials of involvement, which could leave them more exposed to blame. Both approaches reflect real-world engagement around covert actions. Sometimes, both government and private sources tread cautiously in how they attribute responsibility. At other times, they release detailed reports along with evidence such as satellite imagery that are capable of shifting public opinion effectively (Lin-Greenberg and Milonopoulos 2021). It seems plausible that public opinion would respond differently based on the kinds of language and arguments used by private and public actors to shape perceptions of responsibility for covert action, and future research could explore this variation. In addition, it may be the case that people in countries outside the United States would react differently to attacks by proxies, particularly if these countries have more or less trustworthy media environments and political leaders, or if they have different historical experiences with conflict. Future research could evaluate how the results generalize to other countries.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGovernments frequently rely on proxies to pursue their foreign policy objectives while maintaining plausible deniability of their involvement. This secrecy has been theorized to reduce risks of conflict escalation, in part by limiting domestic pressures on adversaries to retaliate. Yet, proxies often have well-documented and publicized ties to their sponsors, raising questions about the extent to which delegation to proxies can reduce escalation risks by shaping public opinion about responsibility for -- and responses to -- hostile acts.\n\nThe experiments discussed in this paper suggest that delegating to proxies can influence how people attribute responsibility for an attack on their country's interests, though the reported effect sizes are modest and imply that proxies may only strengthen plausible deniability on the margins. The modest effects could indicate that other factors will often provide stronger motives for governments to delegate to proxies, whether related to lower costs, their knowledge of local conditions, or signaling a lack of interest in escalation (Carson 2018; Eck 2015). Respondents in the proxy treatment were also substantially more supportive of limited sanctions rather than those targeting senior leadership of the sponsor government, indicating some effect on citizens' views of how their own government should respond to hostilities. These findings contribute to a growing literature on secrecy in international relations by implying that delegation can contribute modestly to plausible deniability while shaping preferences about whom to retaliate against, even in cases where proxies are closely controlled by their sponsors and the credibility of their independence should be relatively low. On the other hand,",
    "the proxy treatment did not affect respondents' views of whether the US government should respond with more coercive and escalatory forms of retaliation, such as a major cyber attack on a Chinese city, killing Russian soldiers, or bombing targets in Iran. These null effects could result from respondents' holding more fixed attitudes about the contexts in which the United States should use force against adversarial states, with modest shifts in plausible deniability unlikely to change these views.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nI thank Bridging the Gap's New Era Workshop for motivating the project.

    "abstract": "A purported advantage of secrecy in international politics is its ability to reduce pressures for conflict escalation by obscuring responsibility for hostile actions. Delegating these actions to proxies is one strategy states use to retain plausible deniability and limit escalation risks. Yet, proxies often have strong ties to sponsoring states, raising questions about their ability to influence blame and demands for retaliation. This paper tests these effects by analyzing American responses to hypothetical attacks by Chinese, Russian, and Iranian actors through experiments administered on three surveys. The results show that using proxies for these attacks modestly reduced how much Americans blamed the respective foreign governments, while also limiting demands that their senior leadership be sanctioned. However, the use of proxies did not affect Americans' attitudes toward more forceful responses by the US government. These findings contribute to understanding of how proxies shape plausible deniability and escalation risks in international conflicts.",
