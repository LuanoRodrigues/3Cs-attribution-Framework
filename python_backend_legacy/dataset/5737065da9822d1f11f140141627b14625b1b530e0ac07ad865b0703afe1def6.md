But the advantages of the digital revolution are now threatened by the use of cyberspace for war purposes. This article explores the states' security dilemma as they face cyber challenges and the ambivalence of the notion of security in cyberspace. It highlights how, in ten years, cyberspace has become a battlefield and a strategic priority for many states that have represented it as a geopolitical threat for their national security, hence justifying its progressive militarisation. Meanwhile, they have become cognizant to the systemic risk of proliferation of offensive cybertools and cyber-operations. This security dilemma – one that opposes a representation of cyber threats as a geopolitical risk to that of cyberspace as a systemic risk – is at the heart of the multilateral negotiations on the regulation of cyberspace. There, a multiplicity of non-state actors has forced their way to the table through a multitude of initiatives that emphasize the importance of the challenges at stake and how difficult it will be for the states to face them.\n## ARTICLE HISTORY\nReceived 28 February 2021\nRevised 23 March 2021\nAccepted 15 April 2021\n## KEYWORDS\nCyberspace; cyberwar; proliferation; security; stability\n## Introduction\nOn 12 November 2018, in the midst of the Paris Peace Forum that brought together nearly 70 heads of state and government to commemorate the centenary of the 1918 armistice, the French president Emmanuel Macron launched the 'Paris Call for trust and security in cyberspace' during a meeting with actors of internet governance at UNESCO headquarters.¹ His vibrant plea, now endorsed by more than 1,000 signatories – including 77 states – highlighted common principles to maintain peace, security and stability in cyberspace. In April 2018, UNESCO had previously hosted a symposium convened by the National Cybersecurity Agency of France (ANSSI) and the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs entitled 'Building international peace and security in the digital society'. These initiatives were in line with the numerous others that have been carried out globally by governments, civil society and major digital companies since the early 2010s. Interestingly, Russia was the first state to propose, as early as 1998, a resolution\nCONTACT Frédérick Douzet fdouzet@gmail.com\n© 2021 The Author(s).

As the strongest advocate for an international treaty on cyberspace, Russia has since sponsored a resolution almost every year, while other international dialogues and processes have progressively been established. How can we explain such activism? Very simply because cyberspace is used -- first and foremost -- to wage wars.\nBeyond a pleasant homage to its author, the analogy to Yves Lacoste's seminal work La géographie, ça sert, d'abord, à faire la guerre (1976), is justified by the apparent explosion of conflict in cyberspace, which has become a new vector for geopolitical rivalries and even a new military field in the strategies and doctrines of many nations. It has also increasingly been militarised -- a set of social, political and economic processes have made a military approach to solving cyber problems more acceptable (Rech et al. 2014) -- with the proliferation of weapons and threats that now structure its evolution and regulation. Obviously, cyberspace wasn't invented to wage wars and isn't only used for that (Douzet and Desforges 2018). We can even say that the attacks conducted until today have remained below the threshold of war according to international law. However, setting severity thresholds has been made more difficult by the boldness and provocations of the most enterprising protagonists (Forteau 2019). Cyberspace has altogether revolutionised our modes of life, disrupted our economies, and enabled important progress in our societies. But the benefits brought by the digital revolution are now threatened by a sharp increase in the number and sophistication of malicious acts in cyberspace.\nFirst, the use of cyberspace for offensive purposes, by states and a diverse array of other actors, entails the risk of conflict escalation and of a destabilisation of our societies that, in turn, threatens international peace and security. Evidently, the catastrophic scenarios of ‘digital Pearl Harbors' or massive deadly attacks on vital infrastructures, which were popular worries in the early 2010s, haven't materialised. But several attacks have been uncontrollably propagated throughout the world, highlighting the potentially devastating threat of conflict in cyberspace and the systemic risks it entails. The proliferation of cyberweapons -- i.e. malicious tools to conduct cyberattacks -- threatens the stability of cyberspace, on which our societies have grown increasingly dependent, because its underlying infrastructures are constantly targeted. Cyberspace is also increasingly used to conduct digital influence and subversion operations. However, in most cases, the weaponization of information does not involve cyberattacks that could contribute to the proliferation of cyberweapons.\nSecond, in an unstable geopolitical context marked by a persistent terrorist threat, weakened multilateral institutions and the evident return of a strategic competition between large powers, states hold onto their ability to act and aren't ready to abandon certain practices that otherwise threaten the security and stability of cyberspace. This context of distrust and power rivalries limits global cooperation and constitutes a rein on efforts to adopt the necessary regulation to ensure the security and stability of cyberspace in the face of a systemic risk -- and also questions the very notion of security in cyberspace.\nHow can we define a threat to national or international security in cyberspace? What does the ‘security of cyberspace' mean? These questions provoke debates and oppose a multiplicity of points of views among state and non-state protagonists. The notion of securitisation developed by Barry Buzan and Ole Wæver in the 1990s -- that is, the way in which a political actor seizes upon an object that he treats, in his speeches, as a security\nissue in order to justify the sometimes extraordinary means of defending it -- offers an interesting analytical framework in this context (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998). It brings a better understanding of the complexity of international discussions that involve multiple actors, starting with states, to define security in cyberspace, what is necessary to implement it, and the underlying political choices it implies.\nThis article explores the security dilemma faced by states when dealing with cyber issues and the ambivalence of the notion of security in cyberspace. It shows how, within a decade, cyberspace has become a battlefield and an absolute strategic priority for many states, leading them to view it as a geopolitical threat to their national security. Hence, they have endorsed its militarisation despite a progressive understanding of the systemic risk that results from the proliferation of offensive weapons and operations. This dilemma lies at the heart of the ongoing tensions in multilateral discussions on the regulation of cyberspace, in which non-state actors have invited themselves through a multitude of initiatives that demonstrate the importance of the stakes but also the difficulties in dealing with them.\n## The emergence of a new military domain\nThe representation of cyberspace as a new military domain emerged during the 2010s, the last step in the territorialisation of cyberspace by states in reaction to the multiplication of the strategic surprises they had faced there since the late 2000s. The territorialisation of cyberspace, which had been initiated by pioneers of the internet to represent the digital space and protect it from the geopolitical rivalries that prevailed in the physical world, became an imperative of securitisation quickly associated with its militarisation in the discourse of states (Desforges 2014; Dunn Cavelty 2008; Haddad 2018).\nThis association between cyberattacks and the militarisation of cyberspace was, however, not self-evident based on the growing challenges posed by the cybercrimes perpetrated by non-state actors against private and individual interests. And it could have become the focus of attention. Instead, states have built a representation of cyberspace first and foremost as a threat to their national security at the expense of other characterisation, such as a criminal danger, an economic risk or a threat to individual user security and privacy. (Dunn Cavelty 2012; Nissenbaum 2005). As a consequence, even though states have tackled the overall issues of cybersecurity and cybercrime, they have structured their strategies mostly under the umbrella of national security, primarily reinforced military means of action (both defensive and offensive) and subsequently designated enemies in cyberspace, an eminently political act (Rid and Buchanan 2015).\nThis militarisation of cyberspace can be partly explained by a deeper understanding of the internet and of digital technologies among defence protagonists, which allowed them to better foresee threats and publicise them. As they quickly allocated funds to this new field, they took part in defining state priorities on questions of national security. That said, it is the increasing number of state-sponsored attacks conducted for strategic reasons, together with the growing digitalisation of the battlefield, and the new opportunities arising from the association of digital operations with other traditional weapons, that led to the representation of cyberspace as a military battlefield. That representation has been predominant in Western democracies yet immediately contested by China\nand Russia, who have regularly denounced the risks of a militarisation of cyberspace, in which they have fully participated, however, according to the volume of cyberattacks officially attributed to them. Both countries had initially preferred the concept of informational space -- or information security -- to cyberspace, which reflects both their perception of the threat as being primarily informational and their priority of ensuring the stability of their political regimes (Goldsmith and Wu 2006; Limonier 2018). Their military doctrines have however considered this space as a strategic domain from the outset, even before Western countries. The most prominent cyber powers -- starting with the United States, France and the United Kingdom -- have since characterised cyberspace as the fifth military domain after land, sea, air and space. In turn, NATO recognised cyberspace as an operational military domain in 2016 (Ablon et al. 2019).\nThe pertinence of this representation has led to intense debates in the academic literature due to the specificities of cyberspace. Martin Libicki first denounced this label as inadequate to understand this hyper-dynamic environment in permanent and rapid reconfiguration, the plasticity of which requires constant adaptation and great agility (Libicki 2012). He noted that this development brought us back to classic concepts of warfare such as ‘control, manoeuvre, superiority' whereas control is illusory in cyberspace and armies don't manoeuvre in the same battlefield as their enemies. Indeed, the latter can reduce their vulnerabilities and limit the impact of an attack through measures of cyberdefence. Hence, the success of an attack in cyberspace partly depends on targets that evolve rapidly and dynamically.\nFurthermore, there is no academic consensus on the very notion of cyberwar, despite its large media and political echo. In his book Cyber War Will Not Take Place, Thomas Rid (2013, 37) stated that past operations couldn't be labelled warfare because an ‘act of war must be instrumental, political, and potentially lethal'. And even if a future cyberattack were to meet these criteria, the response would most likely not be confined to cyberspace but escalate into a kinetic conflict. Ultimately, these attacks were only more sophisticated versions -- involving malicious code -- of methods as old as war: espionage, sabotage and subversion. Even from the perspective of international law, the only operation that could have qualified as an act of war -- but wasn't declared one by the Iranian government -- was the Stuxnet attack against the nuclear centrifuges at Natanz in 2010. According to the New York Times, the attack was led by the United States with the help of Israeli intelligence services (Sanger 2012; Zetter 2014). To this day, no state has officially denounced an act of war in cyberspace.\nThe threshold of what is acceptable -- and accepted -- in terms of offensive operations also seems to be constantly pushed back, in view of the increasingly open hostilities conducted by states that push their advantage in cyberspace without necessarily triggering a forceful response. Current debates here suggest that it is a matter of time, more than a matter of threshold, before cyberwar reaches its cruising speed. But the reality is more complex. On the one hand, states show a certain restraint compared to their full capacity for action, which enables them to remain below the threshold for triggering an open conflict, despite testing this limit. On the other hand, the use of cyber operations is most often part of a combination of modes of action -- technical and non-technical, online and offline, direct and indirect, state and non-state -- which adds to the fog around (cyber)warfare, as it is not always clear where it starts and where it ends.\nHere, the only certainty is that cyber operations have now been integrated into the arsenal of the largest armies, supporting all the existing means used in the conduct of\nwar. But the clear risk of conflict escalation between nuclear powers have also led to constant and ambiguous confrontations between antagonist state actors into the grey zone, below the threshold of war -- a peacetime competition that opposes in particular Russia to Western democracies. As a result, cyberspace has become a new space of confrontation in the geopolitical power rivalries that oppose a multitude of actors, leading to the proliferation of operations -- the most sophisticated of which come from states -- and eventually to the materialisation of cyberwar.\n## The ‘materialisation of cyber war': a series of strategic surprises\nAccording to Robert Kaiser, the 2007 cyberattacks against Estonia were a catalyst for the ‘materialisation of cyber war' as a new policy object -- even though no attack has yet been said to reach the threshold of an armed attack and been qualified as an act of war -- that keeps influencing the way states perceive future threats of cyberwar (Kaiser 2015). These attacks occurred as protests proliferated among the Russian minority against the decision to move the statue of the Bronze Soldier in Tallinn. These DDOS attacks paralysed the websites of numerous organisations in the country, including banks, media outlets, ministries and the parliament. The following year, in July 2008, a wave of cyberattacks against Georgian websites preceded the arrival of Russian tanks in the country, the first known cyberattack combined with a land military operation. Despite their rudimentary nature, the public and spectacular dimension of these attacks forced states to come to term with them. Since then, cyberattacks have multiplied and, more importantly, they have become more targeted, sophisticated, creative and damaging, leading states to constantly adapt themselves to an evolving landscape of threats, marked by a succession of strategic surprises and a constant expansion of scope.\nIn 2010, Stuxnet became the first major attack against a critical infrastructure, in a joint attempt by the United States and Israel to halt the Iranian nuclear programme. In 2013, Edward Snowden's revelations disclosed that American espionage techniques could reach an unprecedented depth on an unsuspected scale thanks to the global interconnection of information and communication systems. Other countries -- including European states -- had to acknowledge their dependency on US digital platforms and technologies. The attacks that targeted the entertainment company Sony Pictures in 2014 took the American government completely by surprise: strategic attacks could also target large firms now. The 2015 attack against TV5 Monde in France reiterated that possibility.\nThen, in 2015, the Islamic State surprised everyone with its sophisticated use of social networks to distribute its propaganda, encourage online radicalisation, find new recruits, raise money, organise departures to Syria, and prepare terrorist attacks. It forced Western democracies, which had focused on technical attacks, to widen their approach to take informational operations into account as well. But it didn't prevent the American administration from being taken by surprise by the interferences attributed to Russia that occurred during the 2016 presidential campaign, for which they were evidently not prepared (François and Lin 2020). Operations of information manipulation interfering with, or destabilising, democratic countries are now under the spotlight.\nIn 2016, a long-feared scenario materialised when the servers of the company Dyn were attacked after its network of connected objects (cameras, printers ...) was manipulated, expanding the field of vulnerabilities and the vectors of attacks. Finally, the\nWannaCry and NotPetya attacks in 2017 inaugurated an era of massive propagating attacks, both swift and uncontrollable, and caused the greatest damage ever recorded by indiscriminately affecting dozens of companies and institutions in more than 150 countries that had not been initially targeted. It stressed the need to protect the systems but also to be able to react quickly to block a rapid contamination. This systemic risk is linked to the interconnection of digital networks.\nThese strategic surprises highlighted the vulnerability, and the unpreparedness, of states -- including the most advanced ones -- as they faced a ever-changing threat. They forcefully influenced the representation of cyberspace as a new military field that required the mobilisation of exceptional resources in the name of national security. This representation led to an institutional reorganisation: many countries created cybersecurity agencies and cybercommands within their armed forces to prepare their cyberdefence. It also encouraged the development of new offensive tools to be used for intelligence or surveillance, or during military operations. The inhibitions against such a dynamic arms race, during which countries strengthen their power, have paradoxically been loosened following Edward Snowden's revelations, as many states started claiming the development of offensive capabilities. For example, the cyber strategy of the Trump administration unambiguously endorsed the proliferation of offensive tools, as well as the penetration of digital systems to deter adversaries (Smeets 2020; Taillat 2020). In addition, the revelations spurred many countries in Europe and around the world into investing more in digital intelligence capabilities and boosting the commercial marketplace of digital surveillance technologies. The exportation of such technologies has, in some cases, permitted population surveillance by states that had not yet developed their own capabilities for the purpose of detecting and managing threats to the stability of their regime.\nHence, the ‘materialisation of cyber war' during the past decade has reinforced the securitization and militarisation of cyberspace that debuted during the 2000s. The notion of security remains ambiguous because, as noted by Dunn Cavelty (2012), the military conception of security can be associated with serious risks. The tools developed by the states to ensure their national security can increase the risks they are exposed to, especially in cyberspace as we will see later. They can also bring about insecurity in other domains of security -- economic, social or political (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998). Information and communication networks are shared by institutions, civil society and the economic and military spheres. Thus, cyberspace offers a multitude of complex interactions and interconnections between these areas where issues are overlapping. Hence, cyberspace is used by a multitude of actors for different ends, and their interests and representations of security may prove widely divergent. The debate over encryption illustrates the profound antagonisms generated by digital technologies between the different actors of security (Gasser et al. 2016), putting the proponents of encryption to protect states' and companies' secrets against the proponents of an access to data limited to the courts or the police, and even against the proponents of deeper protections for personal data and civil liberties (East West Institute 2018). Within a government, divergent conceptions of security can coexist and sometimes oppose each other, as different ministries and agencies implement different (sometimes contradictory) security objectives in cyberspace.\nLikewise, there is no uniform representation of cyberspace among states. On the contrary, it depends on the geopolitical context, the relationships between regional powers, on the level of development of the digital economy, on cyberdefence capabilities, and on\ntheir strategic culture. Besides, representations are shaped by imbalances in commanding technologies, infrastructures, data flows, or on the ability to act in the digital space. For instance, cyberspace is first and foremost an issue of connectivity and economic development in many African countries, but also a territory where cybercrime needs to be fought. Among authoritarian regimes, the informational dimension of cyberspace is seen as the main threat against political stability, as it opens a space for the expression of dissident opinions, the propagation of rumours and the risk of subversion.\nBut the military representation of cyberspace predominates in large Western countries that have advanced capabilities and a central role in international negotiations. They also influence political decision-makers at the expense of other approaches to risks that could better take into account the security of private actors and individual users. Finally, this militarisation of cyberspace also invites risks of which states are progressively growing aware, but they face a security dilemma.\n## Geopolitical risk v. systemic risk: states' security dilemma\nStates have become aware of the risks of proliferation as tools they have developed are used against them. In the digital sphere, offensive tools can be stolen, copied, retrieved, analysed, transformed, reused and repurposed, as the examples of the Shadow Brokers or Vault 7 have shown (Buchanan 2020). New offensive concepts and tactics can be imitated and re-employed. In other words, cyberattacks are liable to teach lessons and to improve the capabilities of their adversaries. A classified NSA document from 2013 divulged by Edward Snowden and published in The Intercept in 2015 confirmed what many had feared before: the Iranian regime learned from the cyberattacks it had suffered and it used this knowledge to improve its own capabilities (Zetter 2014). The report specified that Iran probably imitated the offensive techniques of an attack against its oil industry to launch the Shamoon attack against Saudi Aramco in 2012 which sabotaged 30,000 computers in one stroke. Hence, proliferation leads to improved skills among actors, including adversaries and criminals, and directly participates in the heightened sophistication of attacks and in the threats against the whole digital environment.\nFurthermore, because technologies and networks are shared by armies, private actors, institutions and civil society, these attacks are liable to propagate quickly, and sometimes uncontrollably. The risk of uncontrollable collateral damage is a serious hindrance to the work of armies in the digital space; for instance, the notion of a ‘surgical' attack appears to be a contradiction in terms, as the interactions and interconnections between the systems and their points of vulnerability are difficult to anticipate on this territory. The Stuxnet virus, specifically conceived for the Natanz nuclear infrastructure as it wasn't connected to the internet, did propagate through cyberspace, probably though a USB key. Although Stuxnet did not unleash its payload on third-party victims' computers, part of its code was later reused in other cyberattacks, hence demonstrating that highly targeted code is no guarantee against proliferation.\nThe WannaCry and NotPetya attacks were emblematic of the systemic risk posed by the proliferation of cyberweapons in our societies. These attacks were rapidly and uncontrollably propagated throughout the world, targeting hospitals and causing hundreds of millions of euros' worth of damage for companies that weren't initially targeted. In May 2017, the ransomware WannaCry infected more than 200,000 computers in 150 countries until\nthe discovery of a kill switch stopped it. Subsequent investigations brought the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia to dismiss the possibility of a criminal endeavour and they attributed the attack to North Korea. The NotPetya attack, which initially resembled a ransomware attack, was entirely conceived to sabotage systems. The White House estimated that this sole attack cost $10 billion, the most devastating ever, and it was attributed to Russia, first by the United Kingdom, and then by the other Five Eyes countries. These two attacks used EternalBlue, an offensive tool that took advantage of a Microsoft vulnerability and was developed by the NSA. This tool was stolen from the NSA, made publicly available online, and later used by other actors to launch attacks that propagated uncontrollably and hit the very country that created this offensive tool.\nThese attacks thus demonstrated the security dilemma faced by states regarding offensive operations in cyberspace (Segal ; Buchanan) and which pit two non-exclusive (but coexisting) representations of cyber risk against each other, leading to complex tensions and sometimes irreconcilable objectives between and within governments.\nOn the one hand, the states see a cyberthreat as systemic: an extremely complex, cross-border risk, not necessarily of state origin, which, like pandemics, can spread very rapidly, be very difficult to stop and cause massive damage. It is therefore in the interest of all actors to stop contagions that could have disastrous consequences. This approach to risks calls for enhanced cooperation between governments -- but also within governments and between private and public actors -- and arms control, in the common interest of system stability.\nOn the other hand, a cyberthreat is primarily a geopolitical threat for states because the offensive tools are used by their adversaries but also by their allies and economic rivals to increase their power through espionage, influence, or even military operations. Focusing on this risk takes states in the opposite direction: enhancing their offensive arsenal, limiting cooperation and protecting their sovereign capabilities. This approach clearly dominates the representations of states with the most advanced capabilities, as seen in the ongoing race for cyberweapons and in the offensive doctrines they have developed recently (Buchanan).\nThe dominant representation of the geopolitical risk is a source of distrust among states and it encourages them to reinforce their ‘territorial' control over cyberspace as well as their sovereign capabilities. It limits their ability to come to an agreement on the modalities for regulating states' behaviour in cyberspace and interpreting international law. It also explains why international discussions exclude a central issue linked to the offensive practices of states: espionage. That said, the search for an equilibrium between the two approaches is at the heart of the international intergovernmental discussions on the regulation of cyberspace as states start to acknowledge their own vulnerability in the face of systemic risk.\n## Diplomats launched an attack on the ‘digital far west'\nFor years, the most advanced states took advantage of the opacity of the digital space to discretely conduct offensive operations with impunity. But with the materialisation of cyber-war and the multiplication of large-scale attacks that targeted them, states have progressively acknowledged the risks they are exposed to -- and which are now becoming systemic.\nFirst, the technology is both more widely accessible and less expensive, making it available to a larger number of state and non-state actors, all increasingly enterprising and creative in how they use it. The 2010s were marked by a diversification of targets -- strategic attacks against private companies -- of actors involved, with sometimes blurry relations to state authorities, and of the operating modes as attackers are only limited by their imagination in hijacking digital technologies. Threats are more pressing, complex, protean and unpredictable.\nIn fact, the digital transformation of societies makes them increasingly dependent on cyberspace, the stability of which is now essential to their proper functioning. But the multiplication of badly-secured connected objects, the embedded computing in medical devices, vehicles and even in military armament, constantly expands the space that can be targeted. In other words, the more connected and dependent on data a society is, the more points of vulnerability there are. The rise of quantum computing -- which promises to revolutionise encryption by increasing computing power -- and of artificial intelligence suggests sophisticated and potentially destabilising attacks, even though these technologies could also be used to improve cybersecurity.\nStates are thus faced with the same type of dilemma as when they became aware of the dangers of nuclear power. Except that digital technology is within the reach of many actors (not only states), it is easier to steal and reuse than a nuclear missile, and it is by nature dual-use and ubiquitous, which makes controlling the possession of offensive tools and organising verification impossible. It therefore requires a totally different approach to counter-proliferation. But because it can turn against the states that develop it, at the risk of threatening international security and the very stability of cyberspace, it raises the question of systemic risk, which was at the heart of the balance of terror doctrine. This risk led states, at the end of the 1990s, to initiate discussions on the regulation of cyberspace which, after years of stalemate (Maurer 2011) and the change of posture of the United States in favour of multilateralism under the Obama administration (Douzet and Géry 2020), have led to significant progress.\nAfter the first resolution introduced by Russia in 1998, the General Assembly of the United Nations created a group of governmental experts (GGE) to begin discussions on information and communication technologies (ICTs). Only 15 states were initially represented, including the five permanent members of the Security Council -- due to the format chosen but also to the limited number of countries with competences in the field. Overall, 5 GGEs were successively convened and, when membership was progressively widened, it remained rather limited (25 states in 2016--2017). Only three GGEs agreed on a report -- in 2010 (A/65/201), 2013 (A/68/98) and 2015 (A/74/170) -- as the others couldn't reach a consensus.\nThe content of these three reports illustrates the progressive acknowledgment by states of their own vulnerabilities and of the existence of a systemic risk, on the one hand, and the domination of the geopolitical risk on the systemic risk on the other hand. All of this limits progress in regulating the digital space. It is necessary to note that these reports were only recommendations to the General Assembly and not binding instruments creating obligations for states. They shared a willingness to commit themselves politically without being legally constrained and, as such, acknowledged a need to identify limits to preserve the security and stability of cyberspace.\nIn the 2010 report, states recognised that ‘The global network of ICTs [communication and information technologies] has become an arena for disruptive activity' [para. 4] in which different actors intervene. They recommended reinforcing the cybersecurity capabilities of states, implementing confidence-building measures and a ‘[f]urther dialogue among States to discuss norms pertaining to State use of ICTs, to reduce collective risk and protect critical national and international infrastructure' (para. 18i).\nIn 2013, states recognised for the first time, in an international document, that international law applies to cyberspace: ‘International law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment' (GGE Report 2013, para. 19). This strengthened the territorialisation of digital space, further affirmed in the following paragraph: ‘State sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to State conduct of ICT-related activities, and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory' (ibid, para. 20). The recognition of the applicability of international law in cyberspace led to the delimitation of states' rights and obligations related to cyberoperations because states were now proscribed from conducting operations contrary to their international obligations. For example, they are not allowed to conduct cyberoperations that intervene in the internal affairs of another state; they would otherwise be in violation of the principle of non-intervention (Delerue 2020).\nThis decision also reflected the willingness of states to inscribe their behaviour in the international legal order. The digital space is therefore no longer a ‘digital Wild West' in which only the law of the strongest dominates, at least in theory. There are rules that derive from international law, but the question is how they should be applied or, in other words, what the rights and duties of states ought to be. But interpreting international law in such a new, complex and dynamic environment poses serious difficulties. For that reason, the member countries of the third GGE recommended the elaboration of ‘norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour by States' to reduce the risks threatening the security and stability of cyberspace. These norms, which are derived from international law according to the report, set out principles or good practices to guide the behaviour of states. The mission entrusted to the fourth GGE, created shortly after the publication of the 2013 report, and which met in 2014 and 2015, was to further develop these norms.\nHowever, this apparent UN consensus hides profound disagreements on the modalities of the regulation of cyberspace, based on the representation of the geopolitical risk, and they can be surmised from the 2015 report. Reading the table of contents, we see the first cracks in the consensus between the states. Indeed, the report includes six parts, the third and sixth respectively dealing with the norms of responsible behaviour of states and international law. Contrary to the 2013 report, a strict separation -- at least in appearance -- is established between the norms and rules of international law. As such, the report highlighted an opposition among states on the necessity to elaborate (or not) new rules of international law to ensure the security of the digital space. On one side, some countries, including the United States, believe that existing international law is enough to regulate behaviour and they demand political commitments instead, via non-binding norms, to translate the expectations of the international community and enable a better predictability of states' behaviour. These norms could be built on existing\nobligations but without creating new international obligations. On the other side, some states -- such as Russia -- display a more legalist approach to international law and believe that existing law isn't enough to regulate the behaviour of states in cyberspace because of its specificities. New rules, and binding new rights and obligations, are necessary to complete international law, via a treaty (Delerue and Géry 2017). But, by separating norms from questions of international law, the report gives the impression that norms are autonomous and that their implementation isn't dependent on existing obligations set in international law.\nUnderlying this position is the belief that international law is sufficient and does not need to be clarified. And mentioning the purpose and the value of the norms limits their scope: they are non-binding and serve as a standard of measurement to assess the behaviour of states, but are not intended to limit the rights of states (2015 GGE Report, para. 10). They are purely declaratory as they need to be specified to be implemented. Furthermore, the part dedicated to international law only reiterates, to a large extent, what was already written in the 2013 report. Conversely, separating the norms can be interpreted either as a need for new rules or states' willingness to limit their commitment (this is the way Russia interprets it). These two interpretations coexist and highlight the difficult elaboration of a consensus among states (Delerue, Douzet, and Géry 2020).\nThat said, the report did bring notable progress. Indeed, states came to an agreement on a series of non-binding norms to reduce the risks to global peace, security and stability. They forbade cyberoperations causing intentional damage to vital infrastructure and attacks on computer emergency response teams (CERTs). States shouldn't purposely authorise malicious cyberoperations organised from their territory, either. They committed themselves to notifying vulnerabilities in a responsible manner, but also to combating the proliferation of malicious computer technologies and tools, to exchanging information, to providing mutual assistance, and to implementing measures recommended by the General Assembly for the protection of critical infrastructures.\nThe adoption of these norms shows a common willingness to ensure the security and stability of the digital space. But it remains the product of a compromise between states and, more importantly, of the search for an equilibrium to limit systemic risk while continuing to use the digital space for offensive purposes, a realistic principle with regard to the current geopolitical context (Lewis 2018). The numerous caveats in the formulation of the recommendations, such as the use of the conditional (states should, should not) or the ambiguity in the formulation of proscribed cyberoperations all testify to this balancing act. Hence, the cyberoperations against vitally important infrastructures are not proscribed, but the ones contrary to international law and causing ‘intentional damages' against the infrastructures are.\nThe General Assembly of the United Nations hoped to pursue the discussions with a fifth GGE. But the negotiations failed in 2016--2017 in the face of profound disagreements on international law and its interpretation. The communiqués and statements of the United States, Cuba and Russia highlighted apparent doubts on the applicability of certain clauses of international law (self-defence, law of international responsibility, international humanitarian law) and, more importantly, profound dissensions on the interpretation of these branches of law. They could partly be explained by the particularly tense geopolitical context, marked by the affirmation of state power in cyberspace: accusations\nof Russian interferences in the American presidential elections, rising informational threats, trade tensions between China and the United States that focused on digital technologies, cyberattacks with systemic propagation, and the beginning of public attributions and retaliating threats. In this context, some states -- notably China -- questioned the scope and potential consequences of their legal commitments. From the outset, this geopolitical context foreshadowed the reluctance of states to agree on progress in the regulation of the digital space. This risk is all the greater because, apart from confidence-building measures and capacity-building, the discussions on international law and norms need to go into a level of detail that could further limit the behaviour of states. Hence, the geopolitical risk brought the negotiations on security and stability in the digital space to a stalemate. As a consequence, non-state actors confronted with systemic risk sought to become directly involved in these discussions through various new initiatives.\n## Much ado about nothing?\nOn 14 February 2017, Brad Smith, the President of Microsoft, called to convene a Digital Geneva Convention. Drawing from the 1949 Geneva Conventions, he invited states to protect infrastructures and citizens from computer attacks in times of peace. He also called for the creation of an international organisation modelled on the International Atomic Energy Agency to handle the attribution of cyberoperations. Meanwhile, during the Munich Security Conference, the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) debuted its work. This independent commission of 28 international experts from the private sector, academia, the technical community and NGOs was created by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the support of prominent companies and several states. It was tasked with offering new norms of responsible behaviour to maintain security and stability in the digital space, which is the objective of its final report presented at the Paris Peace Forum in November 2019. Between 2017 and 2019, these private (Microsoft) and multi-stakeholder (GCSC) settings played an important role in discussions on the security and stability of the digital space. They first maintained these questions on the global agenda through more or less formal contacts between states and international organisations when uncertainty prevailed over the future of international negotiations. They then launched initiatives and elaborated proposals to regulate the digital space. The GCSC listed eight norms of responsible behaviour, several of which were integrated in the Paris Call in November 2018 and in the Cybersecurity Act adopted in May 2019 by the European Union. Other initiatives emerged, such as private commitments (Charter of Trust by Siemens, Cybersecurity Tech Accord by Microsoft) and new NGOs (Cyber Peace Institute).\nAll these initiatives were symptomatic of a willingness among private actors and civil society to get involved in the discussions on a domain of sovereignty and to try to impose the multi-stakeholder model -- long limited to the governance of other aspects of the internet -- on matters of international security. These actors are historically legitimate, technically competent, and they have the necessary resources to ensure the stability and security of cyberspace. The internet was conceived by academic actors and then developed and commercialised by private actors who own most of the infrastructures. Global companies have superior technical capabilities, data and resources compared to\nthose of states and they are often the first to detect attacks and to offer a response. They have become essential partners to ensure the security of states.\nActors from the business and academic sectors, the technical community and civil society are heavily involved in the governance of the internet and their expertise can prove essential due to the technicity of the issues (Ríos Rodríguez 2010), as shown by the Wassenaar Arrangement. The implementation of this agreement regulating the exports of dual-use technologies was limited by its weak definition. Above all, these actors can help push states beyond some of the bottlenecks that limit the development and scope of norms because they have a common interest in the stability of cyberspace and in high user confidence.\nThe culmination of this logic lies in the creation, at the end of 2019, by Microsoft, MasterCard and the Hewlett Foundation, of the Cyber Peace Institute which, without having official attribution power, has an accountability function to evaluate states' respect of international law and of the norms of good behaviour. Similarly, the designation by Microsoft, in January 2020, of a representative for UN-related questions illustrated the company's willingness to directly weigh in into international discussions.\nHowever, these initiatives are limited by the reluctance of many states to leave non-state actors to get involved in the definition of states' rights, obligations and responsibilities. Although they recognise the importance of the multi-stakeholder model of internet governance and the need to closely involve the private sector and civil society in initiatives to promote the security and stability of cyberspace, they defend the exclusive dimension of some of their prerogatives. The role of non-state actors in the security and stability of cyberspace was recognised in 2013 and 2015 by the member states of the GGE, but they nevertheless reasserted their primary responsibility in this area. On the one hand, non-state actors, unless they have a specially granted title, are not allowed to participate in these discussions, because they are not subjects of international law. On the other hand, the representation of cyberspace as a field of confrontation and as an object of national security makes it the sole prerogative of states and limits the willingness of states to involve non-state actors in the discussions.\nIn any case, the input of non-state actors in international discussions has increasingly been recognised globally, even though disparities exist between states. Moreover, states are taking part in many multi-stakeholder forums dealing with issues of security and stability in cyberspace, which are being debated at the Internet Governance Forum, ICANN, but also in diplomatic dialogues and more specific initiatives (London Process, Raisina Dialogue, Sino-European Cyber Dialogue, US--China Cyber Dialogue, Canada--EU Cyber Dialogue and so on). They seek to advance ideas and build consensus outside multilateral processes in order to facilitate international discussions and/or create a balance of power by rallying states and organisations to their positions beforehand (Ruhl et al. 2020). This recognition of the role played by non-state actors is best illustrated by the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace initiated by France and largely promoted by Microsoft. The Paris Call -- not endorsed by the United States, China or Russia -- testifies to the signatories' public commitment to ensuring the security and stability of cyberspace globally.\nIt was not until a little over a year after the failure of the UN negotiations that new proposals emerged. And the way discussions resumed was emblematic of the tensions between two apprehensions of the risks in a deteriorated geopolitical context. Indeed,\ntwo processes (an open-ended working group and a group of governmental experts) actually debuted almost simultaneously in the autumn of 2019, one led by Russia, the other by the United States, with largely overlapping mandates. In October 2018, Russia introduced a new resolution on ICTs in the context of international security, listing several norms of behaviour and proposing to convene an open-ended working group (OEWG), i.e. a negotiation setting open to all UN member states. The First Commission at the UN was then the theatre of a sharp confrontation between the supporters of the Russian proposal and Western states which, in reaction, proposed their own draft resolution, offering another GGE restricted to 25 states. Despite important modifications on the Russian project, the United States -- followed by the European Union -- didn't withdraw its draft, leading to the adoption of two resolutions, amidst heightened tensions, by the General Assembly on 5 and 22 December 2018 (A/RES/73/27 and A/RES/73/266). A large majority of states voted in favour of the two resolutions which nevertheless reflected a deep divide between the major powers, both on their objectives and on the means of achieving them. Indeed, Russia hasn't renounced its original objective, stated in 1998, of a treaty to underpin the negotiations in the working group.\nInterestingly, the working group shepherded by Russia is the one consulting non-state actors (companies, NGOs ...), some of which (but not all) also demand a treaty. On the contrary, the GGE only consults regional state organisations. This fracture was accentuated in December 2019 when the General Assembly adopted a new Russian-led resolution (A/RES/74/247) that created a new negotiation process responsible for elaborating a treaty on cybercrime. Western countries are strongly opposed to it because they believe that the 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, open for signature to states not belonging to the Council of Europe, and already ratified by 64 states, should be universalised instead.\nThese two negotiation processes have been produced by major geopolitical tensions, in a context in which the United States is being offensive while denouncing, with several of their global partners, Russian and Chinese cyberoperations. For their part, countries such as Russia and China -- even though they have adopted different strategies (Broeders, Adamson, and Creemers 2019) -- fully take advantage of the offensive potentialities offered by networks while they call for limits on the militarisation of the digital space. Europe, for its part, seeks to offer a third path, but with limited opposition to the United States, which remains its main ally. That said, Europe is plagued by its own dissensions.\nTo many observers' surprise, the OEWG adopted its final report on 12 March 2021, demonstrating that despite the context of strategic competition exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic, states were still able to achieve consensus. The report consolidates the achievements of the previous GGEs, encourages more transparency in the implementation of the recommendations of the 2015 GGE report and promotes the pursuit of international negotiations. It also shows some progress, such as the recognition of health infrastructures as critical infrastructures that need to be protected, along with the integrity and the general availability of the internet. However, many contentious points persist as revealed by the Chair's summary, published with the report, that contains most of the state propositions that were not adopted by the OEWG, short of a consensus between states.\nIn addition, states rushed to launch the next round of international negotiations even before the two processes had finalised their respective reports. France proposed a\nprogramme of action within the OEWG to merge the two processes into a single one that could provide incremental progress as opposed to requiring a final consensus report. But Russia and its allies sponsored a UNGA resolution launching a new OEWG in October 2020. The same day, the United States and its allies sponsored another resolution, that acknowledges the ongoing negotiations, leaving the door open for further negotiations as the GGE is scheduled to achieve its report in May 2021. Both resolutions were adopted by the UNGA in December 2020. In addition to the OEWG being renewed, the GGE could potentially be continued and a new programme of action created depending on what states propose at the UNGA's 76th session, starting in October 2021.\nThe landscape of international negotiations is thus becoming particularly crowded and even confused, with a multiplication of actors, initiatives and proposals aimed at promoting peace and stability in cyberspace. It risks leading to inconsistencies or ambiguities that would leave room for states to pursue their hijinks with relative impunity, even if the two groups' chairs have worked together to reach a consensus and limit contradictions. However, this proliferation is creating a dynamic that is making it possible for states and all actors to become more aware of the risks and challenges associated with the proliferation of cyberweapons. But it is also part of a geopolitical context that is particularly conducive to an arms race.\n## Conclusion\nCyberspace has thus become a field of confrontations between states during the 2010s, to the point of becoming a military domain in its own right for many of them, which have engaged in a cyberweapons race. The proliferation of cyber operations and offensive tools has contributed to increasing the scope and sophistication of the threat they face in the digital space. The tools and attack concepts they have developed have escaped them and are increasingly turned against them, the vulnerabilities they exploit in adversary systems also affect the systems of their own companies and institutions, which can become strategic targets. Last but not least, the uncontrolled spread of certain attacks has had devastating consequences that raise important ethical, legal and economic liability issues but also awareness of the systemic risk that proliferation poses to the security and stability of cyberspace.\nFor these reasons, and despite a notably tense geopolitical context, states have chosen to resume international discussions on security and stability in cyberspace, and have taken part in multiple initiatives with private actors and civil society to try to contain the threat. And yet, we cannot but note that the representation of cyberthreat as a geopolitical risk continues to predominate over the representation of systemic risk, leading some states room for offensive operations, in order to ensure their own power in cyberspace, which they see as a condition for their security.\nAt the time of writing, negotiations are still ongoing at the UN, and it is difficult to predict their outcome. In the end, it will depend on what states perceive as their primary interest: to curb systemic threat or to continue waging wars. Whatever the outcome of the negotiations, systemic risk will necessarily remain high because of the divergent strategic interests among states and because the exploitation of a network vulnerability by one actor for a specific purpose is in fact exploited by all and for multiple purposes. It also shows that, whatever the initiatives and propositions made, cyberspace\nJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY\n#\nremains, first and foremost, used to wage war, and its regulation remains the product of the 'external legal policies' (Ladreit de Lacharrière 1983) of states, thus ultimately a byproduct of the defence of their respective interests.",

But the advantages of the digital revolution are now threatened by the use of cyberspace for war purposes. This article explores the states' security dilemma as they face cyber challenges and the ambivalence of the notion of security in cyberspace. It highlights how, in ten years, cyberspace has become a battlefield and a strategic priority for many states that have represented it as a geopolitical threat for their national security, hence justifying its progressive militarisation. Meanwhile, they have become cognizant to the systemic risk of proliferation of offensive cybertools and cyber-operations. This security dilemma – one that opposes a representation of cyber threats as a geopolitical risk to that of cyberspace as a systemic risk – is at the heart of the multilateral negotiations on the regulation of cyberspace. There, a multiplicity of non-state actors has forced their way to the table through a multitude of initiatives that emphasize the importance of the challenges at stake and how difficult it will be for the states to face them.\n## ARTICLE HISTORY Received 28 February 2021 Revised 23 March 2021 Accepted 15 April 2021 ## KEYWORDS Cyberspace; cyberwar; proliferation; security; stability ## Introduction On 12 November 2018, in the midst of the Paris Peace Forum that brought together nearly 70 heads of state and government to commemorate the centenary of the 1918 armistice, the French president Emmanuel Macron launched the 'Paris Call for trust and security in cyberspace' during a meeting with actors of internet governance at UNESCO headquarters.¹ His vibrant plea, now endorsed by more than 1,000 signatories – including 77 states – highlighted common principles to maintain peace, security and stability in cyberspace. In April 2018, UNESCO had previously hosted a symposium convened by the National Cybersecurity Agency of France (ANSSI) and the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs entitled 'Building international peace and security in the digital society'. These initiatives were in line with the numerous others that have been carried out globally by governments, civil society and major digital companies since the early 2010s. Interestingly, Russia was the first state to propose, as early as 1998, a resolution CONTACT Frédérick Douzet fdouzet@gmail.com © 2021 The Author(s).

As the strongest advocate for an international treaty on cyberspace, Russia has since sponsored a resolution almost every year, while other international dialogues and processes have progressively been established. How can we explain such activism? Very simply because cyberspace is used -- first and foremost -- to wage wars.\nBeyond a pleasant homage to its author, the analogy to Yves Lacoste's seminal work La géographie, ça sert, d'abord, à faire la guerre (1976), is justified by the apparent explosion of conflict in cyberspace, which has become a new vector for geopolitical rivalries and even a new military field in the strategies and doctrines of many nations. It has also increasingly been militarised -- a set of social, political and economic processes have made a military approach to solving cyber problems more acceptable -- with the proliferation of weapons and threats that now structure its evolution and regulation. Obviously, cyberspace wasn't invented to wage wars and isn't only used for that. We can even say that the attacks conducted until today have remained below the threshold of war according to international law. However, setting severity thresholds has been made more difficult by the boldness and provocations of the most enterprising protagonists. Cyberspace has altogether revolutionised our modes of life, disrupted our economies, and enabled important progress in our societies. But the benefits brought by the digital revolution are now threatened by a sharp increase in the number and sophistication of malicious acts in cyberspace.\nFirst, the use of cyberspace for offensive purposes, by states and a diverse array of other actors, entails the risk of conflict escalation and of a destabilisation of our societies that, in turn, threatens international peace and security. Evidently, the catastrophic scenarios of ‘digital Pearl Harbors' or massive deadly attacks on vital infrastructures, which were popular worries in the early 2010s, haven't materialised. But several attacks have been uncontrollably propagated throughout the world, highlighting the potentially devastating threat of conflict in cyberspace and the systemic risks it entails. The proliferation of cyberweapons -- i.e. malicious tools to conduct cyberattacks -- threatens the stability of cyberspace, on which our societies have grown increasingly dependent, because its underlying infrastructures are constantly targeted. Cyberspace is also increasingly used to conduct digital influence and subversion operations. However, in most cases, the weaponization of information does not involve cyberattacks that could contribute to the proliferation of cyberweapons.\nSecond, in an unstable geopolitical context marked by a persistent terrorist threat, weakened multilateral institutions and the evident return of a strategic competition between large powers, states hold onto their ability to act and aren't ready to abandon certain practices that otherwise threaten the security and stability of cyberspace. This context of distrust and power rivalries limits global cooperation and constitutes a rein on efforts to adopt the necessary regulation to ensure the security and stability of cyberspace in the face of a systemic risk -- and also questions the very notion of security in cyberspace.\nHow can we define a threat to national or international security in cyberspace? What does the ‘security of cyberspace' mean? These questions provoke debates and oppose a multiplicity of points of views among state and non-state protagonists. The notion of securitisation developed by Barry Buzan and Ole Wæver in the 1990s -- that is, the way in which a political actor seizes upon an object that he treats, in his speeches, as a security issue in order to justify the sometimes extraordinary means of defending it -- offers an interesting analytical framework in this context (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998). It brings a better understanding of the complexity of international discussions that involve multiple actors, starting with states, to define security in cyberspace, what is necessary to implement it, and the underlying political choices it implies.\nThis article explores the security dilemma faced by states when dealing with cyber issues and the ambivalence of the notion of security in cyberspace. It shows how, within a decade, cyberspace has become a battlefield and an absolute strategic priority for many states, leading them to view it as a geopolitical threat to their national security. Hence, they have endorsed its militarisation despite a progressive understanding of the systemic risk that results from the proliferation of offensive weapons and operations. This dilemma lies at the heart of the ongoing tensions in multilateral discussions on the regulation of cyberspace, in which non-state actors have invited themselves through a multitude of initiatives that demonstrate the importance of the stakes but also the difficulties in dealing with them.\n## The emergence of a new military domain The representation of cyberspace as a new military domain emerged during the 2010s, the last step in the territorialisation of cyberspace by states in reaction to the multiplication of the strategic surprises they had faced there since the late 2000s. The territorialisation of cyberspace, which had been initiated by pioneers of the internet to represent the digital space and protect it from the geopolitical rivalries that prevailed in the physical world, became an imperative of securitisation quickly associated with its militarisation in the discourse of states.\nThis association between cyberattacks and the militarisation of cyberspace was, however, not self-evident based on the growing challenges posed by the cybercrimes perpetrated by non-state actors against private and individual interests. And it could have become the focus of attention. Instead, states have built a representation of cyberspace first and foremost as a threat to their national security at the expense of other characterisation, such as a criminal danger, an economic risk or a threat to individual user security and privacy. (Dunn Cavelty 2012; Nissenbaum 2005). As a consequence, even though states have tackled the overall issues of cybersecurity and cybercrime, they have structured their strategies mostly under the umbrella of national security, primarily reinforced military means of action (both defensive and offensive) and subsequently designated enemies in cyberspace, an eminently political act.\nThis militarisation of cyberspace can be partly explained by a deeper understanding of the internet and of digital technologies among defence protagonists, which allowed them to better foresee threats and publicise them. As they quickly allocated funds to this new field, they took part in defining state priorities on questions of national security. That said, it is the increasing number of state-sponsored attacks conducted for strategic reasons, together with the growing digitalisation of the battlefield, and the new opportunities arising from the association of digital operations with other traditional weapons, that led to the representation of cyberspace as a military battlefield. That representation has been predominant in Western democracies yet immediately contested by China and Russia, who have regularly denounced the risks of a militarisation of cyberspace, in which they have fully participated, however, according to the volume of cyberattacks officially attributed to them. Both countries had initially preferred the concept of informational space -- or information security -- to cyberspace, which reflects both their perception of the threat as being primarily informational and their priority of ensuring the stability of their political regimes. Their military doctrines have however considered this space as a strategic domain from the outset, even before Western countries. The most prominent cyber powers -- starting with the United States, France and the United Kingdom -- have since characterised cyberspace as the fifth military domain after land, sea, air and space. In turn, NATO recognised cyberspace as an operational military domain in 2016.\nThe pertinence of this representation has led to intense debates in the academic literature due to the specificities of cyberspace. Martin Libicki first denounced this label as inadequate to understand this hyper-dynamic environment in permanent and rapid reconfiguration, the plasticity of which requires constant adaptation and great agility. He noted that this development brought us back to classic concepts of warfare such as ‘control, manoeuvre, superiority' whereas control is illusory in cyberspace and armies don't manoeuvre in the same battlefield as their enemies. Indeed, the latter can reduce their vulnerabilities and limit the impact of an attack through measures of cyberdefence. Hence, the success of an attack in cyberspace partly depends on targets that evolve rapidly and dynamically.\nFurthermore, there is no academic consensus on the very notion of cyberwar, despite its large media and political echo. In his book Cyber War Will Not Take Place, Thomas Rid (2013, 37) stated that past operations couldn't be labelled warfare because an ‘act of war must be instrumental, political, and potentially lethal'. And even if a future cyberattack were to meet these criteria, the response would most likely not be confined to cyberspace but escalate into a kinetic conflict. Ultimately, these attacks were only more sophisticated versions -- involving malicious code -- of methods as old as war: espionage, sabotage and subversion. Even from the perspective of international law, the only operation that could have qualified as an act of war -- but wasn't declared one by the Iranian government -- was the Stuxnet attack against the nuclear centrifuges at Natanz in 2010. According to the New York Times, the attack was led by the United States with the help of Israeli intelligence services. To this day, no state has officially denounced an act of war in cyberspace.\nThe threshold of what is acceptable -- and accepted -- in terms of offensive operations also seems to be constantly pushed back, in view of the increasingly open hostilities conducted by states that push their advantage in cyberspace without necessarily triggering a forceful response. Current debates here suggest that it is a matter of time, more than a matter of threshold, before cyberwar reaches its cruising speed. But the reality is more complex. On the one hand, states show a certain restraint compared to their full capacity for action, which enables them to remain below the threshold for triggering an open conflict, despite testing this limit. On the other hand, the use of cyber operations is most often part of a combination of modes of action -- technical and non-technical, online and offline, direct and indirect, state and non-state -- which adds to the fog around (cyber)warfare, as it is not always clear where it starts and where it ends.\nHere, the only certainty is that cyber operations have now been integrated into the arsenal of the largest armies, supporting all the existing means used in the conduct of war. But the clear risk of conflict escalation between nuclear powers have also led to constant and ambiguous confrontations between antagonist state actors into the grey zone, below the threshold of war -- a peacetime competition that opposes in particular Russia to Western democracies. As a result, cyberspace has become a new space of confrontation in the geopolitical power rivalries that oppose a multitude of actors, leading to the proliferation of operations -- the most sophisticated of which come from states -- and eventually to the materialisation of cyberwar.\n## The ‘materialisation of cyber war': a series of strategic surprises According to Robert Kaiser, the 2007 cyberattacks against Estonia were a catalyst for the ‘materialisation of cyber war' as a new policy object -- even though no attack has yet been said to reach the threshold of an armed attack and been qualified as an act of war -- that keeps influencing the way states perceive future threats of cyberwar. These attacks occurred as protests proliferated among the Russian minority against the decision to move the statue of the Bronze Soldier in Tallinn. These DDOS attacks paralysed the websites of numerous organisations in the country, including banks, media outlets, ministries and the parliament. The following year, in July 2008, a wave of cyberattacks against Georgian websites preceded the arrival of Russian tanks in the country, the first known cyberattack combined with a land military operation. Despite their rudimentary nature, the public and spectacular dimension of these attacks forced states to come to term with them. Since then, cyberattacks have multiplied and, more importantly, they have become more targeted, sophisticated, creative and damaging, leading states to constantly adapt themselves to an evolving landscape of threats, marked by a succession of strategic surprises and a constant expansion of scope.\nIn 2010, Stuxnet became the first major attack against a critical infrastructure, in a joint attempt by the United States and Israel to halt the Iranian nuclear programme. In 2013, Edward Snowden's revelations disclosed that American espionage techniques could reach an unprecedented depth on an unsuspected scale thanks to the global interconnection of information and communication systems. Other countries -- including European states -- had to acknowledge their dependency on US digital platforms and technologies. The attacks that targeted the entertainment company Sony Pictures in 2014 took the American government completely by surprise: strategic attacks could also target large firms now. The 2015 attack against TV5 Monde in France reiterated that possibility.\nThen, in 2015, the Islamic State surprised everyone with its sophisticated use of social networks to distribute its propaganda, encourage online radicalisation, find new recruits, raise money, organise departures to Syria, and prepare terrorist attacks. It forced Western democracies, which had focused on technical attacks, to widen their approach to take informational operations into account as well. But it didn't prevent the American administration from being taken by surprise by the interferences attributed to Russia that occurred during the 2016 presidential campaign, for which they were evidently not prepared (François and Lin 2020). Operations of information manipulation interfering with, or destabilising, democratic countries are now under the spotlight.\nIn 2016, a long-feared scenario materialised when the servers of the company Dyn were attacked after its network of connected objects (cameras, printers...) was manipulated, expanding the field of vulnerabilities and the vectors of attacks. Finally, the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks in 2017 inaugurated an era of massive propagating attacks, both swift and uncontrollable, and caused the greatest damage ever recorded by indiscriminately affecting dozens of companies and institutions in more than 150 countries that had not been initially targeted. It stressed the need to protect the systems but also to be able to react quickly to block a rapid contamination. This systemic risk is linked to the interconnection of digital networks.\nThese strategic surprises highlighted the vulnerability, and the unpreparedness, of states -- including the most advanced ones -- as they faced a ever-changing threat. They forcefully influenced the representation of cyberspace as a new military field that required the mobilisation of exceptional resources in the name of national security. This representation led to an institutional reorganisation: many countries created cybersecurity agencies and cybercommands within their armed forces to prepare their cyberdefence. It also encouraged the development of new offensive tools to be used for intelligence or surveillance, or during military operations. The inhibitions against such a dynamic arms race, during which countries strengthen their power, have paradoxically been loosened following Edward Snowden's revelations, as many states started claiming the development of offensive capabilities. For example, the cyber strategy of the Trump administration unambiguously endorsed the proliferation of offensive tools, as well as the penetration of digital systems to deter adversaries. In addition, the revelations spurred many countries in Europe and around the world into investing more in digital intelligence capabilities and boosting the commercial marketplace of digital surveillance technologies. The exportation of such technologies has, in some cases, permitted population surveillance by states that had not yet developed their own capabilities for the purpose of detecting and managing threats to the stability of their regime.\nHence, the ‘materialisation of cyber war' during the past decade has reinforced the securitization and militarisation of cyberspace that debuted during the 2000s. The notion of security remains ambiguous because, as noted by Dunn Cavelty (2012), the military conception of security can be associated with serious risks. The tools developed by the states to ensure their national security can increase the risks they are exposed to, especially in cyberspace as we will see later. They can also bring about insecurity in other domains of security -- economic, social or political (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998). Information and communication networks are shared by institutions, civil society and the economic and military spheres. Thus, cyberspace offers a multitude of complex interactions and interconnections between these areas where issues are overlapping. Hence, cyberspace is used by a multitude of actors for different ends, and their interests and representations of security may prove widely divergent. The debate over encryption illustrates the profound antagonisms generated by digital technologies between the different actors of security, putting the proponents of encryption to protect states' and companies' secrets against the proponents of an access to data limited to the courts or the police, and even against the proponents of deeper protections for personal data and civil liberties (East West Institute 2018). Within a government, divergent conceptions of security can coexist and sometimes oppose each other, as different ministries and agencies implement different (sometimes contradictory) security objectives in cyberspace.\nLikewise, there is no uniform representation of cyberspace among states. On the contrary, it depends on the geopolitical context, the relationships between regional powers, on the level of development of the digital economy, on cyberdefence capabilities, and on their strategic culture. Besides, representations are shaped by imbalances in commanding technologies, infrastructures, data flows, or on the ability to act in the digital space. For instance, cyberspace is first and foremost an issue of connectivity and economic development in many African countries, but also a territory where cybercrime needs to be fought. Among authoritarian regimes, the informational dimension of cyberspace is seen as the main threat against political stability, as it opens a space for the expression of dissident opinions, the propagation of rumours and the risk of subversion.\nBut the military representation of cyberspace predominates in large Western countries that have advanced capabilities and a central role in international negotiations. They also influence political decision-makers at the expense of other approaches to risks that could better take into account the security of private actors and individual users. Finally, this militarisation of cyberspace also invites risks of which states are progressively growing aware, but they face a security dilemma.\n## Geopolitical risk v. systemic risk: states' security dilemma States have become aware of the risks of proliferation as tools they have developed are used against them. In the digital sphere, offensive tools can be stolen, copied, retrieved, analysed, transformed, reused and repurposed, as the examples of the Shadow Brokers or Vault 7 have shown. New offensive concepts and tactics can be imitated and re-employed. In other words, cyberattacks are liable to teach lessons and to improve the capabilities of their adversaries. A classified NSA document from 2013 divulged by Edward Snowden and published in The Intercept in 2015 confirmed what many had feared before: the Iranian regime learned from the cyberattacks it had suffered and it used this knowledge to improve its own capabilities. The report specified that Iran probably imitated the offensive techniques of an attack against its oil industry to launch the Shamoon attack against Saudi Aramco in 2012 which sabotaged 30,000 computers in one stroke. Hence, proliferation leads to improved skills among actors, including adversaries and criminals, and directly participates in the heightened sophistication of attacks and in the threats against the whole digital environment.\nFurthermore, because technologies and networks are shared by armies, private actors, institutions and civil society, these attacks are liable to propagate quickly, and sometimes uncontrollably. The risk of uncontrollable collateral damage is a serious hindrance to the work of armies in the digital space; for instance, the notion of a ‘surgical' attack appears to be a contradiction in terms, as the interactions and interconnections between the systems and their points of vulnerability are difficult to anticipate on this territory. The Stuxnet virus, specifically conceived for the Natanz nuclear infrastructure as it wasn't connected to the internet, did propagate through cyberspace, probably though a USB key. Although Stuxnet did not unleash its payload on third-party victims' computers, part of its code was later reused in other cyberattacks, hence demonstrating that highly targeted code is no guarantee against proliferation.\nThe WannaCry and NotPetya attacks were emblematic of the systemic risk posed by the proliferation of cyberweapons in our societies. These attacks were rapidly and uncontrollably propagated throughout the world, targeting hospitals and causing hundreds of millions of euros' worth of damage for companies that weren't initially targeted. In May 2017, the ransomware WannaCry infected more than 200,000 computers in 150 countries until the discovery of a kill switch stopped it. Subsequent investigations brought the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia to dismiss the possibility of a criminal endeavour and they attributed the attack to North Korea. The NotPetya attack, which initially resembled a ransomware attack, was entirely conceived to sabotage systems. The White House estimated that this sole attack cost $10 billion, the most devastating ever, and it was attributed to Russia, first by the United Kingdom, and then by the other Five Eyes countries. These two attacks used EternalBlue, an offensive tool that took advantage of a Microsoft vulnerability and was developed by the NSA. This tool was stolen from the NSA, made publicly available online, and later used by other actors to launch attacks that propagated uncontrollably and hit the very country that created this offensive tool.\nThese attacks thus demonstrated the security dilemma faced by states regarding offensive operations in cyberspace (Segal; Buchanan) and which pit two non-exclusive (but coexisting) representations of cyber risk against each other, leading to complex tensions and sometimes irreconcilable objectives between and within governments.\nOn the one hand, the states see a cyberthreat as systemic: an extremely complex, cross-border risk, not necessarily of state origin, which, like pandemics, can spread very rapidly, be very difficult to stop and cause massive damage. It is therefore in the interest of all actors to stop contagions that could have disastrous consequences. This approach to risks calls for enhanced cooperation between governments -- but also within governments and between private and public actors -- and arms control, in the common interest of system stability.\nOn the other hand, a cyberthreat is primarily a geopolitical threat for states because the offensive tools are used by their adversaries but also by their allies and economic rivals to increase their power through espionage, influence, or even military operations. Focusing on this risk takes states in the opposite direction: enhancing their offensive arsenal, limiting cooperation and protecting their sovereign capabilities. This approach clearly dominates the representations of states with the most advanced capabilities, as seen in the ongoing race for cyberweapons and in the offensive doctrines they have developed recently (Buchanan).\nThe dominant representation of the geopolitical risk is a source of distrust among states and it encourages them to reinforce their ‘territorial' control over cyberspace as well as their sovereign capabilities. It limits their ability to come to an agreement on the modalities for regulating states' behaviour in cyberspace and interpreting international law. It also explains why international discussions exclude a central issue linked to the offensive practices of states: espionage. That said, the search for an equilibrium between the two approaches is at the heart of the international intergovernmental discussions on the regulation of cyberspace as states start to acknowledge their own vulnerability in the face of systemic risk.\n## Diplomats launched an attack on the ‘digital far west' For years, the most advanced states took advantage of the opacity of the digital space to discretely conduct offensive operations with impunity. But with the materialisation of cyber-war and the multiplication of large-scale attacks that targeted them, states have progressively acknowledged the risks they are exposed to -- and which are now becoming systemic.\nFirst, the technology is both more widely accessible and less expensive, making it available to a larger number of state and non-state actors, all increasingly enterprising and creative in how they use it. The 2010s were marked by a diversification of targets -- strategic attacks against private companies -- of actors involved, with sometimes blurry relations to state authorities, and of the operating modes as attackers are only limited by their imagination in hijacking digital technologies. Threats are more pressing, complex, protean and unpredictable.\nIn fact, the digital transformation of societies makes them increasingly dependent on cyberspace, the stability of which is now essential to their proper functioning. But the multiplication of badly-secured connected objects, the embedded computing in medical devices, vehicles and even in military armament, constantly expands the space that can be targeted. In other words, the more connected and dependent on data a society is, the more points of vulnerability there are. The rise of quantum computing -- which promises to revolutionise encryption by increasing computing power -- and of artificial intelligence suggests sophisticated and potentially destabilising attacks, even though these technologies could also be used to improve cybersecurity.\nStates are thus faced with the same type of dilemma as when they became aware of the dangers of nuclear power. Except that digital technology is within the reach of many actors (not only states), it is easier to steal and reuse than a nuclear missile, and it is by nature dual-use and ubiquitous, which makes controlling the possession of offensive tools and organising verification impossible. It therefore requires a totally different approach to counter-proliferation. But because it can turn against the states that develop it, at the risk of threatening international security and the very stability of cyberspace, it raises the question of systemic risk, which was at the heart of the balance of terror doctrine. This risk led states, at the end of the 1990s, to initiate discussions on the regulation of cyberspace which, after years of stalemate and the change of posture of the United States in favour of multilateralism under the Obama administration (Douzet and Géry 2020), have led to significant progress.\nAfter the first resolution introduced by Russia in 1998, the General Assembly of the United Nations created a group of governmental experts (GGE) to begin discussions on information and communication technologies (ICTs). Only 15 states were initially represented, including the five permanent members of the Security Council -- due to the format chosen but also to the limited number of countries with competences in the field. Overall, 5 GGEs were successively convened and, when membership was progressively widened, it remained rather limited (25 states in 2016--2017). Only three GGEs agreed on a report -- in 2010 (A/65/201), 2013 (A/68/98) and 2015 (A/74/170) -- as the others couldn't reach a consensus.\nThe content of these three reports illustrates the progressive acknowledgment by states of their own vulnerabilities and of the existence of a systemic risk, on the one hand, and the domination of the geopolitical risk on the systemic risk on the other hand. All of this limits progress in regulating the digital space. It is necessary to note that these reports were only recommendations to the General Assembly and not binding instruments creating obligations for states. They shared a willingness to commit themselves politically without being legally constrained and, as such, acknowledged a need to identify limits to preserve the security and stability of cyberspace.\nIn the 2010 report, states recognised that ‘The global network of ICTs [communication and information technologies] has become an arena for disruptive activity' [para. 4] in which different actors intervene. They recommended reinforcing the cybersecurity capabilities of states, implementing confidence-building measures and a ‘[f]urther dialogue among States to discuss norms pertaining to State use of ICTs, to reduce collective risk and protect critical national and international infrastructure' (para. 18i).\nIn 2013, states recognised for the first time, in an international document, that international law applies to cyberspace: ‘International law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment' (GGE Report 2013, para. 19). This strengthened the territorialisation of digital space, further affirmed in the following paragraph: ‘State sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to State conduct of ICT-related activities, and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory' (ibid, para. 20). The recognition of the applicability of international law in cyberspace led to the delimitation of states' rights and obligations related to cyberoperations because states were now proscribed from conducting operations contrary to their international obligations. For example, they are not allowed to conduct cyberoperations that intervene in the internal affairs of another state; they would otherwise be in violation of the principle of non-intervention.\nThis decision also reflected the willingness of states to inscribe their behaviour in the international legal order. The digital space is therefore no longer a ‘digital Wild West' in which only the law of the strongest dominates, at least in theory. There are rules that derive from international law, but the question is how they should be applied or, in other words, what the rights and duties of states ought to be. But interpreting international law in such a new, complex and dynamic environment poses serious difficulties. For that reason, the member countries of the third GGE recommended the elaboration of ‘norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour by States' to reduce the risks threatening the security and stability of cyberspace. These norms, which are derived from international law according to the report, set out principles or good practices to guide the behaviour of states. The mission entrusted to the fourth GGE, created shortly after the publication of the 2013 report, and which met in 2014 and 2015, was to further develop these norms.\nHowever, this apparent UN consensus hides profound disagreements on the modalities of the regulation of cyberspace, based on the representation of the geopolitical risk, and they can be surmised from the 2015 report. Reading the table of contents, we see the first cracks in the consensus between the states. Indeed, the report includes six parts, the third and sixth respectively dealing with the norms of responsible behaviour of states and international law. Contrary to the 2013 report, a strict separation -- at least in appearance -- is established between the norms and rules of international law. As such, the report highlighted an opposition among states on the necessity to elaborate (or not) new rules of international law to ensure the security of the digital space. On one side, some countries, including the United States, believe that existing international law is enough to regulate behaviour and they demand political commitments instead, via non-binding norms, to translate the expectations of the international community and enable a better predictability of states' behaviour. These norms could be built on existing obligations but without creating new international obligations. On the other side, some states -- such as Russia -- display a more legalist approach to international law and believe that existing law isn't enough to regulate the behaviour of states in cyberspace because of its specificities. New rules, and binding new rights and obligations, are necessary to complete international law, via a treaty (Delerue and Géry 2017). But, by separating norms from questions of international law, the report gives the impression that norms are autonomous and that their implementation isn't dependent on existing obligations set in international law.\nUnderlying this position is the belief that international law is sufficient and does not need to be clarified. And mentioning the purpose and the value of the norms limits their scope: they are non-binding and serve as a standard of measurement to assess the behaviour of states, but are not intended to limit the rights of states (2015 GGE Report, para. 10). They are purely declaratory as they need to be specified to be implemented. Furthermore, the part dedicated to international law only reiterates, to a large extent, what was already written in the 2013 report. Conversely, separating the norms can be interpreted either as a need for new rules or states' willingness to limit their commitment (this is the way Russia interprets it). These two interpretations coexist and highlight the difficult elaboration of a consensus among states (Delerue, Douzet, and Géry 2020).\nThat said, the report did bring notable progress. Indeed, states came to an agreement on a series of non-binding norms to reduce the risks to global peace, security and stability. They forbade cyberoperations causing intentional damage to vital infrastructure and attacks on computer emergency response teams (CERTs). States shouldn't purposely authorise malicious cyberoperations organised from their territory, either. They committed themselves to notifying vulnerabilities in a responsible manner, but also to combating the proliferation of malicious computer technologies and tools, to exchanging information, to providing mutual assistance, and to implementing measures recommended by the General Assembly for the protection of critical infrastructures.\nThe adoption of these norms shows a common willingness to ensure the security and stability of the digital space. But it remains the product of a compromise between states and, more importantly, of the search for an equilibrium to limit systemic risk while continuing to use the digital space for offensive purposes, a realistic principle with regard to the current geopolitical context. The numerous caveats in the formulation of the recommendations, such as the use of the conditional (states should, should not) or the ambiguity in the formulation of proscribed cyberoperations all testify to this balancing act. Hence, the cyberoperations against vitally important infrastructures are not proscribed, but the ones contrary to international law and causing ‘intentional damages' against the infrastructures are.\nThe General Assembly of the United Nations hoped to pursue the discussions with a fifth GGE. But the negotiations failed in 2016--2017 in the face of profound disagreements on international law and its interpretation. The communiqués and statements of the United States, Cuba and Russia highlighted apparent doubts on the applicability of certain clauses of international law (self-defence, law of international responsibility, international humanitarian law) and, more importantly, profound dissensions on the interpretation of these branches of law. They could partly be explained by the particularly tense geopolitical context, marked by the affirmation of state power in cyberspace: accusations of Russian interferences in the American presidential elections, rising informational threats, trade tensions between China and the United States that focused on digital technologies, cyberattacks with systemic propagation, and the beginning of public attributions and retaliating threats. In this context, some states -- notably China -- questioned the scope and potential consequences of their legal commitments. From the outset, this geopolitical context foreshadowed the reluctance of states to agree on progress in the regulation of the digital space. This risk is all the greater because, apart from confidence-building measures and capacity-building, the discussions on international law and norms need to go into a level of detail that could further limit the behaviour of states. Hence, the geopolitical risk brought the negotiations on security and stability in the digital space to a stalemate. As a consequence, non-state actors confronted with systemic risk sought to become directly involved in these discussions through various new initiatives.\n## Much ado about nothing?\nOn 14 February 2017, Brad Smith, the President of Microsoft, called to convene a Digital Geneva Convention. Drawing from the 1949 Geneva Conventions, he invited states to protect infrastructures and citizens from computer attacks in times of peace. He also called for the creation of an international organisation modelled on the International Atomic Energy Agency to handle the attribution of cyberoperations. Meanwhile, during the Munich Security Conference, the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) debuted its work. This independent commission of 28 international experts from the private sector, academia, the technical community and NGOs was created by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the support of prominent companies and several states. It was tasked with offering new norms of responsible behaviour to maintain security and stability in the digital space, which is the objective of its final report presented at the Paris Peace Forum in November 2019. Between 2017 and 2019, these private (Microsoft) and multi-stakeholder (GCSC) settings played an important role in discussions on the security and stability of the digital space. They first maintained these questions on the global agenda through more or less formal contacts between states and international organisations when uncertainty prevailed over the future of international negotiations. They then launched initiatives and elaborated proposals to regulate the digital space. The GCSC listed eight norms of responsible behaviour, several of which were integrated in the Paris Call in November 2018 and in the Cybersecurity Act adopted in May 2019 by the European Union. Other initiatives emerged, such as private commitments (Charter of Trust by Siemens, Cybersecurity Tech Accord by Microsoft) and new NGOs (Cyber Peace Institute).\nAll these initiatives were symptomatic of a willingness among private actors and civil society to get involved in the discussions on a domain of sovereignty and to try to impose the multi-stakeholder model -- long limited to the governance of other aspects of the internet -- on matters of international security. These actors are historically legitimate, technically competent, and they have the necessary resources to ensure the stability and security of cyberspace. The internet was conceived by academic actors and then developed and commercialised by private actors who own most of the infrastructures. Global companies have superior technical capabilities, data and resources compared to those of states and they are often the first to detect attacks and to offer a response. They have become essential partners to ensure the security of states.\nActors from the business and academic sectors, the technical community and civil society are heavily involved in the governance of the internet and their expertise can prove essential due to the technicity of the issues (Ríos Rodríguez 2010), as shown by the Wassenaar Arrangement. The implementation of this agreement regulating the exports of dual-use technologies was limited by its weak definition. Above all, these actors can help push states beyond some of the bottlenecks that limit the development and scope of norms because they have a common interest in the stability of cyberspace and in high user confidence.\nThe culmination of this logic lies in the creation, at the end of 2019, by Microsoft, MasterCard and the Hewlett Foundation, of the Cyber Peace Institute which, without having official attribution power, has an accountability function to evaluate states' respect of international law and of the norms of good behaviour. Similarly, the designation by Microsoft, in January 2020, of a representative for UN-related questions illustrated the company's willingness to directly weigh in into international discussions.\nHowever, these initiatives are limited by the reluctance of many states to leave non-state actors to get involved in the definition of states' rights, obligations and responsibilities. Although they recognise the importance of the multi-stakeholder model of internet governance and the need to closely involve the private sector and civil society in initiatives to promote the security and stability of cyberspace, they defend the exclusive dimension of some of their prerogatives. The role of non-state actors in the security and stability of cyberspace was recognised in 2013 and 2015 by the member states of the GGE, but they nevertheless reasserted their primary responsibility in this area. On the one hand, non-state actors, unless they have a specially granted title, are not allowed to participate in these discussions, because they are not subjects of international law. On the other hand, the representation of cyberspace as a field of confrontation and as an object of national security makes it the sole prerogative of states and limits the willingness of states to involve non-state actors in the discussions.\nIn any case, the input of non-state actors in international discussions has increasingly been recognised globally, even though disparities exist between states. Moreover, states are taking part in many multi-stakeholder forums dealing with issues of security and stability in cyberspace, which are being debated at the Internet Governance Forum, ICANN, but also in diplomatic dialogues and more specific initiatives (London Process, Raisina Dialogue, Sino-European Cyber Dialogue, US--China Cyber Dialogue, Canada--EU Cyber Dialogue and so on). They seek to advance ideas and build consensus outside multilateral processes in order to facilitate international discussions and/or create a balance of power by rallying states and organisations to their positions beforehand. This recognition of the role played by non-state actors is best illustrated by the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace initiated by France and largely promoted by Microsoft. The Paris Call -- not endorsed by the United States, China or Russia -- testifies to the signatories' public commitment to ensuring the security and stability of cyberspace globally.\nIt was not until a little over a year after the failure of the UN negotiations that new proposals emerged. And the way discussions resumed was emblematic of the tensions between two apprehensions of the risks in a deteriorated geopolitical context. Indeed, two processes (an open-ended working group and a group of governmental experts) actually debuted almost simultaneously in the autumn of 2019, one led by Russia, the other by the United States, with largely overlapping mandates. In October 2018, Russia introduced a new resolution on ICTs in the context of international security, listing several norms of behaviour and proposing to convene an open-ended working group (OEWG), i.e. a negotiation setting open to all UN member states. The First Commission at the UN was then the theatre of a sharp confrontation between the supporters of the Russian proposal and Western states which, in reaction, proposed their own draft resolution, offering another GGE restricted to 25 states. Despite important modifications on the Russian project, the United States -- followed by the European Union -- didn't withdraw its draft, leading to the adoption of two resolutions, amidst heightened tensions, by the General Assembly on 5 and 22 December 2018 (A/RES/73/27 and A/RES/73/266). A large majority of states voted in favour of the two resolutions which nevertheless reflected a deep divide between the major powers, both on their objectives and on the means of achieving them. Indeed, Russia hasn't renounced its original objective, stated in 1998, of a treaty to underpin the negotiations in the working group.\nInterestingly, the working group shepherded by Russia is the one consulting non-state actors (companies, NGOs...), some of which (but not all) also demand a treaty. On the contrary, the GGE only consults regional state organisations. This fracture was accentuated in December 2019 when the General Assembly adopted a new Russian-led resolution (A/RES/74/247) that created a new negotiation process responsible for elaborating a treaty on cybercrime. Western countries are strongly opposed to it because they believe that the 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, open for signature to states not belonging to the Council of Europe, and already ratified by 64 states, should be universalised instead.\nThese two negotiation processes have been produced by major geopolitical tensions, in a context in which the United States is being offensive while denouncing, with several of their global partners, Russian and Chinese cyberoperations. For their part, countries such as Russia and China -- even though they have adopted different strategies (Broeders, Adamson, and Creemers 2019) -- fully take advantage of the offensive potentialities offered by networks while they call for limits on the militarisation of the digital space. Europe, for its part, seeks to offer a third path, but with limited opposition to the United States, which remains its main ally. That said, Europe is plagued by its own dissensions.\nTo many observers' surprise, the OEWG adopted its final report on 12 March 2021, demonstrating that despite the context of strategic competition exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic, states were still able to achieve consensus. The report consolidates the achievements of the previous GGEs, encourages more transparency in the implementation of the recommendations of the 2015 GGE report and promotes the pursuit of international negotiations. It also shows some progress, such as the recognition of health infrastructures as critical infrastructures that need to be protected, along with the integrity and the general availability of the internet. However, many contentious points persist as revealed by the Chair's summary, published with the report, that contains most of the state propositions that were not adopted by the OEWG, short of a consensus between states.\nIn addition, states rushed to launch the next round of international negotiations even before the two processes had finalised their respective reports. France proposed a programme of action within the OEWG to merge the two processes into a single one that could provide incremental progress as opposed to requiring a final consensus report. But Russia and its allies sponsored a UNGA resolution launching a new OEWG in October 2020. The same day, the United States and its allies sponsored another resolution, that acknowledges the ongoing negotiations, leaving the door open for further negotiations as the GGE is scheduled to achieve its report in May 2021. Both resolutions were adopted by the UNGA in December 2020. In addition to the OEWG being renewed, the GGE could potentially be continued and a new programme of action created depending on what states propose at the UNGA's 76th session, starting in October 2021.\nThe landscape of international negotiations is thus becoming particularly crowded and even confused, with a multiplication of actors, initiatives and proposals aimed at promoting peace and stability in cyberspace. It risks leading to inconsistencies or ambiguities that would leave room for states to pursue their hijinks with relative impunity, even if the two groups' chairs have worked together to reach a consensus and limit contradictions. However, this proliferation is creating a dynamic that is making it possible for states and all actors to become more aware of the risks and challenges associated with the proliferation of cyberweapons. But it is also part of a geopolitical context that is particularly conducive to an arms race.\n## Conclusion Cyberspace has thus become a field of confrontations between states during the 2010s, to the point of becoming a military domain in its own right for many of them, which have engaged in a cyberweapons race. The proliferation of cyber operations and offensive tools has contributed to increasing the scope and sophistication of the threat they face in the digital space. The tools and attack concepts they have developed have escaped them and are increasingly turned against them, the vulnerabilities they exploit in adversary systems also affect the systems of their own companies and institutions, which can become strategic targets. Last but not least, the uncontrolled spread of certain attacks has had devastating consequences that raise important ethical, legal and economic liability issues but also awareness of the systemic risk that proliferation poses to the security and stability of cyberspace.\nFor these reasons, and despite a notably tense geopolitical context, states have chosen to resume international discussions on security and stability in cyberspace, and have taken part in multiple initiatives with private actors and civil society to try to contain the threat. And yet, we cannot but note that the representation of cyberthreat as a geopolitical risk continues to predominate over the representation of systemic risk, leading some states room for offensive operations, in order to ensure their own power in cyberspace, which they see as a condition for their security.\nAt the time of writing, negotiations are still ongoing at the UN, and it is difficult to predict their outcome. In the end, it will depend on what states perceive as their primary interest: to curb systemic threat or to continue waging wars. Whatever the outcome of the negotiations, systemic risk will necessarily remain high because of the divergent strategic interests among states and because the exploitation of a network vulnerability by one actor for a specific purpose is in fact exploited by all and for multiple purposes. It also shows that, whatever the initiatives and propositions made, cyberspace JOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY # remains, first and foremost, used to wage war, and its regulation remains the product of the 'external legal policies' (Ladreit de Lacharrière 1983) of states, thus ultimately a byproduct of the defence of their respective interests.",

In April 2018, UNESCO had previously hosted a symposium convened by the National Cybersecurity Agency of France (ANSSI) and the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs entitled 'Building international peace and security in the digital society'. These initiatives were in line with the numerous others that have been carried out globally by governments, civil society and major digital companies since the early 2010s.

      "## The emergence of a new military domain The representation of cyberspace as a new military domain emerged during the 2010s, the last step in the territorialisation of cyberspace by states in reaction to the multiplication of the strategic surprises they had faced there since the late 2000s. The territorialisation of cyberspace, which had been initiated by pioneers of the internet to represent the digital space and protect it from the geopolitical rivalries that prevailed in the physical world, became an imperative of securitisation quickly associated with its militarisation in the discourse of states."

      "## The ‘materialisation of cyber war': a series of strategic surprises According to Robert Kaiser, the 2007 cyberattacks against Estonia were a catalyst for the ‘materialisation of cyber war' as a new policy object -- even though no attack has yet been said to reach the threshold of an armed attack and been qualified as an act of war -- that keeps influencing the way states perceive future threats of cyberwar. These attacks occurred as protests proliferated among the Russian minority against the decision to move the statue of the Bronze Soldier in Tallinn. These DDOS attacks paralysed the websites of numerous organisations in the country, including banks, media outlets, ministries and the parliament. The following year, in July 2008, a wave of cyberattacks against Georgian websites preceded the arrival of Russian tanks in the country, the first known cyberattack combined with a land military operation. Despite their rudimentary nature, the public and spectacular dimension of these attacks forced states to come to term with them. Since then, cyberattacks have multiplied and, more importantly, they have become more targeted, sophisticated, creative and damaging, leading states to constantly adapt themselves to an evolving landscape of threats, marked by a succession of strategic surprises and a constant expansion of scope."

      "## Geopolitical risk v. systemic risk: states' security dilemma States have become aware of the risks of proliferation as tools they have developed are used against them. In the digital sphere, offensive tools can be stolen, copied, retrieved, analysed, transformed, reused and repurposed, as the examples of the Shadow Brokers or Vault 7 have shown. New offensive concepts and tactics can be imitated and re-employed. In other words, cyberattacks are liable to teach lessons and to improve the capabilities of their adversaries. A classified NSA document from 2013 divulged by Edward Snowden and published in The Intercept in 2015 confirmed what many had feared before: the Iranian regime learned from the cyberattacks it had suffered and it used this knowledge to improve its own capabilities. The report specified that Iran probably imitated the offensive techniques of an attack against its oil industry to launch the Shamoon attack against Saudi Aramco in 2012 which sabotaged 30,000 computers in one stroke. Hence, proliferation leads to improved skills among actors, including adversaries and criminals, and directly participates in the heightened sophistication of attacks and in the threats against the whole digital environment."

      "## Conclusion Cyberspace has thus become a field of confrontations between states during the 2010s, to the point of becoming a military domain in its own right for many of them, which have engaged in a cyberweapons race. The proliferation of cyber operations and offensive tools has contributed to increasing the scope and sophistication of the threat they face in the digital space. The tools and attack concepts they have developed have escaped them and are increasingly turned against them, the vulnerabilities they exploit in adversary systems also affect the systems of their own companies and institutions, which can become strategic targets. Last but not least, the uncontrolled spread of certain attacks has had devastating consequences that raise important ethical, legal and economic liability issues but also awareness of the systemic risk that proliferation poses to the security and stability of cyberspace."

But the advantages of the digital revolution are now threatened by the use of cyberspace for war purposes. This article explores the states' security dilemma as they face cyber challenges and the ambivalence of the notion of security in cyberspace. It highlights how, in ten years, cyberspace has become a battlefield and a strategic priority for many states that have represented it as a geopolitical threat for their national security, hence justifying its progressive militarisation. Meanwhile, they have become cognizant to the systemic risk of proliferation of offensive cybertools and cyber-operations. This security dilemma – one that opposes a representation of cyber threats as a geopolitical risk to that of cyberspace as a systemic risk – is at the heart of the multilateral negotiations on the regulation of cyberspace. There, a multiplicity of non-state actors has forced their way to the table through a multitude of initiatives that emphasize the importance of the challenges at stake and how difficult it will be for the states to face them.",
    "## ARTICLE HISTORY Received 28 February 2021 Revised 23 March 2021 Accepted 15 April 2021 ## KEYWORDS Cyberspace; cyberwar; proliferation; security; stability ## Introduction On 12 November 2018, in the midst of the Paris Peace Forum that brought together nearly 70 heads of state and government to commemorate the centenary of the 1918 armistice, the French president Emmanuel Macron launched the 'Paris Call for trust and security in cyberspace' during a meeting with actors of internet governance at UNESCO headquarters.¹ His vibrant plea, now endorsed by more than 1,000 signatories – including 77 states – highlighted common principles to maintain peace, security and stability in cyberspace. In April 2018, UNESCO had previously hosted a symposium convened by the National Cybersecurity Agency of France (ANSSI) and the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs entitled 'Building international peace and security in the digital society'. These initiatives were in line with the numerous others that have been carried out globally by governments, civil society and major digital companies since the early 2010s. Interestingly, Russia was the first state to propose, as early as 1998, a resolution CONTACT Frédérick Douzet fdouzet@gmail.com © 2021 The Author(s).

As the strongest advocate for an international treaty on cyberspace, Russia has since sponsored a resolution almost every year, while other international dialogues and processes have progressively been established. How can we explain such activism? Very simply because cyberspace is used -- first and foremost -- to wage wars.\nBeyond a pleasant homage to its author, the analogy to Yves Lacoste's seminal work La géographie, ça sert, d'abord, à faire la guerre (1976), is justified by the apparent explosion of conflict in cyberspace, which has become a new vector for geopolitical rivalries and even a new military field in the strategies and doctrines of many nations. It has also increasingly been militarised -- a set of social, political and economic processes have made a military approach to solving cyber problems more acceptable -- with the proliferation of weapons and threats that now structure its evolution and regulation. Obviously, cyberspace wasn't invented to wage wars and isn't only used for that. We can even say that the attacks conducted until today have remained below the threshold of war according to international law. However, setting severity thresholds has been made more difficult by the boldness and provocations of the most enterprising protagonists. Cyberspace has altogether revolutionised our modes of life, disrupted our economies, and enabled important progress in our societies. But the benefits brought by the digital revolution are now threatened by a sharp increase in the number and sophistication of malicious acts in cyberspace.\nFirst, the use of cyberspace for offensive purposes, by states and a diverse array of other actors, entails the risk of conflict escalation and of a destabilisation of our societies that, in turn, threatens international peace and security. Evidently, the catastrophic scenarios of ‘digital Pearl Harbors' or massive deadly attacks on vital infrastructures, which were popular worries in the early 2010s, haven't materialised. But several attacks have been uncontrollably propagated throughout the world, highlighting the potentially devastating threat of conflict in cyberspace and the systemic risks it entails. The proliferation of cyberweapons -- i.e. malicious tools to conduct cyberattacks -- threatens the stability of cyberspace, on which our societies have grown increasingly dependent, because its underlying infrastructures are constantly targeted. Cyberspace is also increasingly used to conduct digital influence and subversion operations. However, in most cases, the weaponization of information does not involve cyberattacks that could contribute to the proliferation of cyberweapons.\nSecond, in an unstable geopolitical context marked by a persistent terrorist threat, weakened multilateral institutions and the evident return of a strategic competition between large powers, states hold onto their ability to act and aren't ready to abandon certain practices that otherwise threaten the security and stability of cyberspace. This context of distrust and power rivalries limits global cooperation and constitutes a rein on efforts to adopt the necessary regulation to ensure the security and stability of cyberspace in the face of a systemic risk -- and also questions the very notion of security in cyberspace.\nHow can we define a threat to national or international security in cyberspace? What does the ‘security of cyberspace' mean? These questions provoke debates and oppose a multiplicity of points of views among state and non-state protagonists. The notion of securitisation developed by Barry Buzan and Ole Wæver in the 1990s -- that is, the way in which a political actor seizes upon an object that he treats, in his speeches, as a security issue in order to justify the sometimes extraordinary means of defending it -- offers an interesting analytical framework in this context (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998). It brings a better understanding of the complexity of international discussions that involve multiple actors, starting with states, to define security in cyberspace, what is necessary to implement it, and the underlying political choices it implies.\nThis article explores the security dilemma faced by states when dealing with cyber issues and the ambivalence of the notion of security in cyberspace. It shows how, within a decade, cyberspace has become a battlefield and an absolute strategic priority for many states, leading them to view it as a geopolitical threat to their national security. Hence, they have endorsed its militarisation despite a progressive understanding of the systemic risk that results from the proliferation of offensive weapons and operations. This dilemma lies at the heart of the ongoing tensions in multilateral discussions on the regulation of cyberspace, in which non-state actors have invited themselves through a multitude of initiatives that demonstrate the importance of the stakes but also the difficulties in dealing with them.",
    "## The emergence of a new military domain The representation of cyberspace as a new military domain emerged during the 2010s, the last step in the territorialisation of cyberspace by states in reaction to the multiplication of the strategic surprises they had faced there since the late 2000s. The territorialisation of cyberspace, which had been initiated by pioneers of the internet to represent the digital space and protect it from the geopolitical rivalries that prevailed in the physical world, became an imperative of securitisation quickly associated with its militarisation in the discourse of states.": "This association between cyberattacks and the militarisation of cyberspace was, however, not self-evident based on the growing challenges posed by the cybercrimes perpetrated by non-state actors against private and individual interests. And it could have become the focus of attention. Instead, states have built a representation of cyberspace first and foremost as a threat to their national security at the expense of other characterisation, such as a criminal danger, an economic risk or a threat to individual user security and privacy. (Dunn Cavelty 2012; Nissenbaum 2005). As a consequence, even though states have tackled the overall issues of cybersecurity and cybercrime, they have structured their strategies mostly under the umbrella of national security, primarily reinforced military means of action (both defensive and offensive) and subsequently designated enemies in cyberspace, an eminently political act.\nThis militarisation of cyberspace can be partly explained by a deeper understanding of the internet and of digital technologies among defence protagonists, which allowed them to better foresee threats and publicise them. As they quickly allocated funds to this new field, they took part in defining state priorities on questions of national security. That said, it is the increasing number of state-sponsored attacks conducted for strategic reasons, together with the growing digitalisation of the battlefield, and the new opportunities arising from the association of digital operations with other traditional weapons, that led to the representation of cyberspace as a military battlefield. That representation has been predominant in Western democracies yet immediately contested by China and Russia, who have regularly denounced the risks of a militarisation of cyberspace, in which they have fully participated, however, according to the volume of cyberattacks officially attributed to them. Both countries had initially preferred the concept of informational space -- or information security -- to cyberspace, which reflects both their perception of the threat as being primarily informational and their priority of ensuring the stability of their political regimes. Their military doctrines have however considered this space as a strategic domain from the outset, even before Western countries. The most prominent cyber powers -- starting with the United States, France and the United Kingdom -- have since characterised cyberspace as the fifth military domain after land, sea, air and space. In turn, NATO recognised cyberspace as an operational military domain in 2016.\nThe pertinence of this representation has led to intense debates in the academic literature due to the specificities of cyberspace. Martin Libicki first denounced this label as inadequate to understand this hyper-dynamic environment in permanent and rapid reconfiguration, the plasticity of which requires constant adaptation and great agility. He noted that this development brought us back to classic concepts of warfare such as ‘control, manoeuvre, superiority' whereas control is illusory in cyberspace and armies don't manoeuvre in the same battlefield as their enemies. Indeed, the latter can reduce their vulnerabilities and limit the impact of an attack through measures of cyberdefence. Hence, the success of an attack in cyberspace partly depends on targets that evolve rapidly and dynamically.\nFurthermore, there is no academic consensus on the very notion of cyberwar, despite its large media and political echo. In his book Cyber War Will Not Take Place, Thomas Rid (2013, 37) stated that past operations couldn't be labelled warfare because an ‘act of war must be instrumental, political, and potentially lethal'. And even if a future cyberattack were to meet these criteria, the response would most likely not be confined to cyberspace but escalate into a kinetic conflict. Ultimately, these attacks were only more sophisticated versions -- involving malicious code -- of methods as old as war: espionage, sabotage and subversion. Even from the perspective of international law, the only operation that could have qualified as an act of war -- but wasn't declared one by the Iranian government -- was the Stuxnet attack against the nuclear centrifuges at Natanz in 2010. According to the New York Times, the attack was led by the United States with the help of Israeli intelligence services. To this day, no state has officially denounced an act of war in cyberspace.\nThe threshold of what is acceptable -- and accepted -- in terms of offensive operations also seems to be constantly pushed back, in view of the increasingly open hostilities conducted by states that push their advantage in cyberspace without necessarily triggering a forceful response. Current debates here suggest that it is a matter of time, more than a matter of threshold, before cyberwar reaches its cruising speed. But the reality is more complex. On the one hand, states show a certain restraint compared to their full capacity for action, which enables them to remain below the threshold for triggering an open conflict, despite testing this limit. On the other hand, the use of cyber operations is most often part of a combination of modes of action -- technical and non-technical, online and offline, direct and indirect, state and non-state -- which adds to the fog around (cyber)warfare, as it is not always clear where it starts and where it ends.\nHere, the only certainty is that cyber operations have now been integrated into the arsenal of the largest armies, supporting all the existing means used in the conduct of war. But the clear risk of conflict escalation between nuclear powers have also led to constant and ambiguous confrontations between antagonist state actors into the grey zone, below the threshold of war -- a peacetime competition that opposes in particular Russia to Western democracies. As a result, cyberspace has become a new space of confrontation in the geopolitical power rivalries that oppose a multitude of actors, leading to the proliferation of operations -- the most sophisticated of which come from states -- and eventually to the materialisation of cyberwar.",
    "## The ‘materialisation of cyber war': a series of strategic surprises According to Robert Kaiser, the 2007 cyberattacks against Estonia were a catalyst for the ‘materialisation of cyber war' as a new policy object -- even though no attack has yet been said to reach the threshold of an armed attack and been qualified as an act of war -- that keeps influencing the way states perceive future threats of cyberwar. These attacks occurred as protests proliferated among the Russian minority against the decision to move the statue of the Bronze Soldier in Tallinn. These DDOS attacks paralysed the websites of numerous organisations in the country, including banks, media outlets, ministries and the parliament. The following year, in July 2008, a wave of cyberattacks against Georgian websites preceded the arrival of Russian tanks in the country, the first known cyberattack combined with a land military operation. Despite their rudimentary nature, the public and spectacular dimension of these attacks forced states to come to term with them. Since then, cyberattacks have multiplied and, more importantly, they have become more targeted, sophisticated, creative and damaging, leading states to constantly adapt themselves to an evolving landscape of threats, marked by a succession of strategic surprises and a constant expansion of scope.": "In 2010, Stuxnet became the first major attack against a critical infrastructure, in a joint attempt by the United States and Israel to halt the Iranian nuclear programme. In 2013, Edward Snowden's revelations disclosed that American espionage techniques could reach an unprecedented depth on an unsuspected scale thanks to the global interconnection of information and communication systems. Other countries -- including European states -- had to acknowledge their dependency on US digital platforms and technologies. The attacks that targeted the entertainment company Sony Pictures in 2014 took the American government completely by surprise: strategic attacks could also target large firms now. The 2015 attack against TV5 Monde in France reiterated that possibility.\nThen, in 2015, the Islamic State surprised everyone with its sophisticated use of social networks to distribute its propaganda, encourage online radicalisation, find new recruits, raise money, organise departures to Syria, and prepare terrorist attacks. It forced Western democracies, which had focused on technical attacks, to widen their approach to take informational operations into account as well. But it didn't prevent the American administration from being taken by surprise by the interferences attributed to Russia that occurred during the 2016 presidential campaign, for which they were evidently not prepared (François and Lin 2020). Operations of information manipulation interfering with, or destabilising, democratic countries are now under the spotlight.\nIn 2016, a long-feared scenario materialised when the servers of the company Dyn were attacked after its network of connected objects (cameras, printers...) was manipulated, expanding the field of vulnerabilities and the vectors of attacks. Finally, the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks in 2017 inaugurated an era of massive propagating attacks, both swift and uncontrollable, and caused the greatest damage ever recorded by indiscriminately affecting dozens of companies and institutions in more than 150 countries that had not been initially targeted. It stressed the need to protect the systems but also to be able to react quickly to block a rapid contamination. This systemic risk is linked to the interconnection of digital networks.\nThese strategic surprises highlighted the vulnerability, and the unpreparedness, of states -- including the most advanced ones -- as they faced a ever-changing threat. They forcefully influenced the representation of cyberspace as a new military field that required the mobilisation of exceptional resources in the name of national security. This representation led to an institutional reorganisation: many countries created cybersecurity agencies and cybercommands within their armed forces to prepare their cyberdefence. It also encouraged the development of new offensive tools to be used for intelligence or surveillance, or during military operations. The inhibitions against such a dynamic arms race, during which countries strengthen their power, have paradoxically been loosened following Edward Snowden's revelations, as many states started claiming the development of offensive capabilities. For example, the cyber strategy of the Trump administration unambiguously endorsed the proliferation of offensive tools, as well as the penetration of digital systems to deter adversaries. In addition, the revelations spurred many countries in Europe and around the world into investing more in digital intelligence capabilities and boosting the commercial marketplace of digital surveillance technologies. The exportation of such technologies has, in some cases, permitted population surveillance by states that had not yet developed their own capabilities for the purpose of detecting and managing threats to the stability of their regime.\nHence, the ‘materialisation of cyber war' during the past decade has reinforced the securitization and militarisation of cyberspace that debuted during the 2000s. The notion of security remains ambiguous because, as noted by Dunn Cavelty (2012), the military conception of security can be associated with serious risks. The tools developed by the states to ensure their national security can increase the risks they are exposed to, especially in cyberspace as we will see later. They can also bring about insecurity in other domains of security -- economic, social or political (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998). Information and communication networks are shared by institutions, civil society and the economic and military spheres. Thus, cyberspace offers a multitude of complex interactions and interconnections between these areas where issues are overlapping. Hence, cyberspace is used by a multitude of actors for different ends, and their interests and representations of security may prove widely divergent. The debate over encryption illustrates the profound antagonisms generated by digital technologies between the different actors of security, putting the proponents of encryption to protect states' and companies' secrets against the proponents of an access to data limited to the courts or the police, and even against the proponents of deeper protections for personal data and civil liberties (East West Institute 2018). Within a government, divergent conceptions of security can coexist and sometimes oppose each other, as different ministries and agencies implement different (sometimes contradictory) security objectives in cyberspace.\nLikewise, there is no uniform representation of cyberspace among states. On the contrary, it depends on the geopolitical context, the relationships between regional powers, on the level of development of the digital economy, on cyberdefence capabilities, and on their strategic culture. Besides, representations are shaped by imbalances in commanding technologies, infrastructures, data flows, or on the ability to act in the digital space. For instance, cyberspace is first and foremost an issue of connectivity and economic development in many African countries, but also a territory where cybercrime needs to be fought. Among authoritarian regimes, the informational dimension of cyberspace is seen as the main threat against political stability, as it opens a space for the expression of dissident opinions, the propagation of rumours and the risk of subversion.\nBut the military representation of cyberspace predominates in large Western countries that have advanced capabilities and a central role in international negotiations. They also influence political decision-makers at the expense of other approaches to risks that could better take into account the security of private actors and individual users. Finally, this militarisation of cyberspace also invites risks of which states are progressively growing aware, but they face a security dilemma.",
    "## Geopolitical risk v. systemic risk: states' security dilemma States have become aware of the risks of proliferation as tools they have developed are used against them. In the digital sphere, offensive tools can be stolen, copied, retrieved, analysed, transformed, reused and repurposed, as the examples of the Shadow Brokers or Vault 7 have shown. New offensive concepts and tactics can be imitated and re-employed. In other words, cyberattacks are liable to teach lessons and to improve the capabilities of their adversaries. A classified NSA document from 2013 divulged by Edward Snowden and published in The Intercept in 2015 confirmed what many had feared before: the Iranian regime learned from the cyberattacks it had suffered and it used this knowledge to improve its own capabilities. The report specified that Iran probably imitated the offensive techniques of an attack against its oil industry to launch the Shamoon attack against Saudi Aramco in 2012 which sabotaged 30,000 computers in one stroke. Hence, proliferation leads to improved skills among actors, including adversaries and criminals, and directly participates in the heightened sophistication of attacks and in the threats against the whole digital environment.": "Furthermore, because technologies and networks are shared by armies, private actors, institutions and civil society, these attacks are liable to propagate quickly, and sometimes uncontrollably. The risk of uncontrollable collateral damage is a serious hindrance to the work of armies in the digital space; for instance, the notion of a ‘surgical' attack appears to be a contradiction in terms, as the interactions and interconnections between the systems and their points of vulnerability are difficult to anticipate on this territory. The Stuxnet virus, specifically conceived for the Natanz nuclear infrastructure as it wasn't connected to the internet, did propagate through cyberspace, probably though a USB key. Although Stuxnet did not unleash its payload on third-party victims' computers, part of its code was later reused in other cyberattacks, hence demonstrating that highly targeted code is no guarantee against proliferation.\nThe WannaCry and NotPetya attacks were emblematic of the systemic risk posed by the proliferation of cyberweapons in our societies. These attacks were rapidly and uncontrollably propagated throughout the world, targeting hospitals and causing hundreds of millions of euros' worth of damage for companies that weren't initially targeted. In May 2017, the ransomware WannaCry infected more than 200,000 computers in 150 countries until the discovery of a kill switch stopped it. Subsequent investigations brought the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia to dismiss the possibility of a criminal endeavour and they attributed the attack to North Korea. The NotPetya attack, which initially resembled a ransomware attack, was entirely conceived to sabotage systems. The White House estimated that this sole attack cost $10 billion, the most devastating ever, and it was attributed to Russia, first by the United Kingdom, and then by the other Five Eyes countries. These two attacks used EternalBlue, an offensive tool that took advantage of a Microsoft vulnerability and was developed by the NSA. This tool was stolen from the NSA, made publicly available online, and later used by other actors to launch attacks that propagated uncontrollably and hit the very country that created this offensive tool.\nThese attacks thus demonstrated the security dilemma faced by states regarding offensive operations in cyberspace (Segal; Buchanan) and which pit two non-exclusive (but coexisting) representations of cyber risk against each other, leading to complex tensions and sometimes irreconcilable objectives between and within governments.\nOn the one hand, the states see a cyberthreat as systemic: an extremely complex, cross-border risk, not necessarily of state origin, which, like pandemics, can spread very rapidly, be very difficult to stop and cause massive damage. It is therefore in the interest of all actors to stop contagions that could have disastrous consequences. This approach to risks calls for enhanced cooperation between governments -- but also within governments and between private and public actors -- and arms control, in the common interest of system stability.\nOn the other hand, a cyberthreat is primarily a geopolitical threat for states because the offensive tools are used by their adversaries but also by their allies and economic rivals to increase their power through espionage, influence, or even military operations. Focusing on this risk takes states in the opposite direction: enhancing their offensive arsenal, limiting cooperation and protecting their sovereign capabilities. This approach clearly dominates the representations of states with the most advanced capabilities, as seen in the ongoing race for cyberweapons and in the offensive doctrines they have developed recently (Buchanan).\nThe dominant representation of the geopolitical risk is a source of distrust among states and it encourages them to reinforce their ‘territorial' control over cyberspace as well as their sovereign capabilities. It limits their ability to come to an agreement on the modalities for regulating states' behaviour in cyberspace and interpreting international law. It also explains why international discussions exclude a central issue linked to the offensive practices of states: espionage. That said, the search for an equilibrium between the two approaches is at the heart of the international intergovernmental discussions on the regulation of cyberspace as states start to acknowledge their own vulnerability in the face of systemic risk.",
    "## Diplomats launched an attack on the ‘digital far west' For years, the most advanced states took advantage of the opacity of the digital space to discretely conduct offensive operations with impunity. But with the materialisation of cyber-war and the multiplication of large-scale attacks that targeted them, states have progressively acknowledged the risks they are exposed to -- and which are now becoming systemic.": "First, the technology is both more widely accessible and less expensive, making it available to a larger number of state and non-state actors, all increasingly enterprising and creative in how they use it. The 2010s were marked by a diversification of targets -- strategic attacks against private companies -- of actors involved, with sometimes blurry relations to state authorities, and of the operating modes as attackers are only limited by their imagination in hijacking digital technologies. Threats are more pressing, complex, protean and unpredictable.\nIn fact, the digital transformation of societies makes them increasingly dependent on cyberspace, the stability of which is now essential to their proper functioning. But the multiplication of badly-secured connected objects, the embedded computing in medical devices, vehicles and even in military armament, constantly expands the space that can be targeted. In other words, the more connected and dependent on data a society is, the more points of vulnerability there are. The rise of quantum computing -- which promises to revolutionise encryption by increasing computing power -- and of artificial intelligence suggests sophisticated and potentially destabilising attacks, even though these technologies could also be used to improve cybersecurity.\nStates are thus faced with the same type of dilemma as when they became aware of the dangers of nuclear power. Except that digital technology is within the reach of many actors (not only states), it is easier to steal and reuse than a nuclear missile, and it is by nature dual-use and ubiquitous, which makes controlling the possession of offensive tools and organising verification impossible. It therefore requires a totally different approach to counter-proliferation. But because it can turn against the states that develop it, at the risk of threatening international security and the very stability of cyberspace, it raises the question of systemic risk, which was at the heart of the balance of terror doctrine. This risk led states, at the end of the 1990s, to initiate discussions on the regulation of cyberspace which, after years of stalemate and the change of posture of the United States in favour of multilateralism under the Obama administration (Douzet and Géry 2020), have led to significant progress.\nAfter the first resolution introduced by Russia in 1998, the General Assembly of the United Nations created a group of governmental experts (GGE) to begin discussions on information and communication technologies (ICTs). Only 15 states were initially represented, including the five permanent members of the Security Council -- due to the format chosen but also to the limited number of countries with competences in the field. Overall, 5 GGEs were successively convened and, when membership was progressively widened, it remained rather limited (25 states in 2016--2017). Only three GGEs agreed on a report -- in 2010 (A/65/201), 2013 (A/68/98) and 2015 (A/74/170) -- as the others couldn't reach a consensus.\nThe content of these three reports illustrates the progressive acknowledgment by states of their own vulnerabilities and of the existence of a systemic risk, on the one hand, and the domination of the geopolitical risk on the systemic risk on the other hand. All of this limits progress in regulating the digital space. It is necessary to note that these reports were only recommendations to the General Assembly and not binding instruments creating obligations for states. They shared a willingness to commit themselves politically without being legally constrained and, as such, acknowledged a need to identify limits to preserve the security and stability of cyberspace.\nIn the 2010 report, states recognised that ‘The global network of ICTs [communication and information technologies] has become an arena for disruptive activity' [para. 4] in which different actors intervene. They recommended reinforcing the cybersecurity capabilities of states, implementing confidence-building measures and a ‘[f]urther dialogue among States to discuss norms pertaining to State use of ICTs, to reduce collective risk and protect critical national and international infrastructure' (para. 18i).\nIn 2013, states recognised for the first time, in an international document, that international law applies to cyberspace: ‘International law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment' (GGE Report 2013, para. 19). This strengthened the territorialisation of digital space, further affirmed in the following paragraph: ‘State sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to State conduct of ICT-related activities, and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory' (ibid, para. 20). The recognition of the applicability of international law in cyberspace led to the delimitation of states' rights and obligations related to cyberoperations because states were now proscribed from conducting operations contrary to their international obligations. For example, they are not allowed to conduct cyberoperations that intervene in the internal affairs of another state; they would otherwise be in violation of the principle of non-intervention.\nThis decision also reflected the willingness of states to inscribe their behaviour in the international legal order. The digital space is therefore no longer a ‘digital Wild West' in which only the law of the strongest dominates, at least in theory. There are rules that derive from international law, but the question is how they should be applied or, in other words, what the rights and duties of states ought to be. But interpreting international law in such a new, complex and dynamic environment poses serious difficulties. For that reason, the member countries of the third GGE recommended the elaboration of ‘norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour by States' to reduce the risks threatening the security and stability of cyberspace. These norms, which are derived from international law according to the report, set out principles or good practices to guide the behaviour of states. The mission entrusted to the fourth GGE, created shortly after the publication of the 2013 report, and which met in 2014 and 2015, was to further develop these norms.\nHowever, this apparent UN consensus hides profound disagreements on the modalities of the regulation of cyberspace, based on the representation of the geopolitical risk, and they can be surmised from the 2015 report. Reading the table of contents, we see the first cracks in the consensus between the states. Indeed, the report includes six parts, the third and sixth respectively dealing with the norms of responsible behaviour of states and international law. Contrary to the 2013 report, a strict separation -- at least in appearance -- is established between the norms and rules of international law. As such, the report highlighted an opposition among states on the necessity to elaborate (or not) new rules of international law to ensure the security of the digital space. On one side, some countries, including the United States, believe that existing international law is enough to regulate behaviour and they demand political commitments instead, via non-binding norms, to translate the expectations of the international community and enable a better predictability of states' behaviour. These norms could be built on existing obligations but without creating new international obligations. On the other side, some states -- such as Russia -- display a more legalist approach to international law and believe that existing law isn't enough to regulate the behaviour of states in cyberspace because of its specificities. New rules, and binding new rights and obligations, are necessary to complete international law, via a treaty (Delerue and Géry 2017). But, by separating norms from questions of international law, the report gives the impression that norms are autonomous and that their implementation isn't dependent on existing obligations set in international law.\nUnderlying this position is the belief that international law is sufficient and does not need to be clarified. And mentioning the purpose and the value of the norms limits their scope: they are non-binding and serve as a standard of measurement to assess the behaviour of states, but are not intended to limit the rights of states (2015 GGE Report, para. 10). They are purely declaratory as they need to be specified to be implemented. Furthermore, the part dedicated to international law only reiterates, to a large extent, what was already written in the 2013 report. Conversely, separating the norms can be interpreted either as a need for new rules or states' willingness to limit their commitment (this is the way Russia interprets it). These two interpretations coexist and highlight the difficult elaboration of a consensus among states (Delerue, Douzet, and Géry 2020).\nThat said, the report did bring notable progress. Indeed, states came to an agreement on a series of non-binding norms to reduce the risks to global peace, security and stability. They forbade cyberoperations causing intentional damage to vital infrastructure and attacks on computer emergency response teams (CERTs). States shouldn't purposely authorise malicious cyberoperations organised from their territory, either. They committed themselves to notifying vulnerabilities in a responsible manner, but also to combating the proliferation of malicious computer technologies and tools, to exchanging information, to providing mutual assistance, and to implementing measures recommended by the General Assembly for the protection of critical infrastructures.\nThe adoption of these norms shows a common willingness to ensure the security and stability of the digital space. But it remains the product of a compromise between states and, more importantly, of the search for an equilibrium to limit systemic risk while continuing to use the digital space for offensive purposes, a realistic principle with regard to the current geopolitical context. The numerous caveats in the formulation of the recommendations, such as the use of the conditional (states should, should not) or the ambiguity in the formulation of proscribed cyberoperations all testify to this balancing act. Hence, the cyberoperations against vitally important infrastructures are not proscribed, but the ones contrary to international law and causing ‘intentional damages' against the infrastructures are.\nThe General Assembly of the United Nations hoped to pursue the discussions with a fifth GGE. But the negotiations failed in 2016--2017 in the face of profound disagreements on international law and its interpretation. The communiqués and statements of the United States, Cuba and Russia highlighted apparent doubts on the applicability of certain clauses of international law (self-defence, law of international responsibility, international humanitarian law) and, more importantly, profound dissensions on the interpretation of these branches of law. They could partly be explained by the particularly tense geopolitical context, marked by the affirmation of state power in cyberspace: accusations of Russian interferences in the American presidential elections, rising informational threats, trade tensions between China and the United States that focused on digital technologies, cyberattacks with systemic propagation, and the beginning of public attributions and retaliating threats. In this context, some states -- notably China -- questioned the scope and potential consequences of their legal commitments. From the outset, this geopolitical context foreshadowed the reluctance of states to agree on progress in the regulation of the digital space. This risk is all the greater because, apart from confidence-building measures and capacity-building, the discussions on international law and norms need to go into a level of detail that could further limit the behaviour of states. Hence, the geopolitical risk brought the negotiations on security and stability in the digital space to a stalemate. As a consequence, non-state actors confronted with systemic risk sought to become directly involved in these discussions through various new initiatives.",
    "## Much ado about nothing?": "On 14 February 2017, Brad Smith, the President of Microsoft, called to convene a Digital Geneva Convention. Drawing from the 1949 Geneva Conventions, he invited states to protect infrastructures and citizens from computer attacks in times of peace. He also called for the creation of an international organisation modelled on the International Atomic Energy Agency to handle the attribution of cyberoperations. Meanwhile, during the Munich Security Conference, the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) debuted its work. This independent commission of 28 international experts from the private sector, academia, the technical community and NGOs was created by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the support of prominent companies and several states. It was tasked with offering new norms of responsible behaviour to maintain security and stability in the digital space, which is the objective of its final report presented at the Paris Peace Forum in November 2019. Between 2017 and 2019, these private (Microsoft) and multi-stakeholder (GCSC) settings played an important role in discussions on the security and stability of the digital space. They first maintained these questions on the global agenda through more or less formal contacts between states and international organisations when uncertainty prevailed over the future of international negotiations. They then launched initiatives and elaborated proposals to regulate the digital space. The GCSC listed eight norms of responsible behaviour, several of which were integrated in the Paris Call in November 2018 and in the Cybersecurity Act adopted in May 2019 by the European Union. Other initiatives emerged, such as private commitments (Charter of Trust by Siemens, Cybersecurity Tech Accord by Microsoft) and new NGOs (Cyber Peace Institute).\nAll these initiatives were symptomatic of a willingness among private actors and civil society to get involved in the discussions on a domain of sovereignty and to try to impose the multi-stakeholder model -- long limited to the governance of other aspects of the internet -- on matters of international security. These actors are historically legitimate, technically competent, and they have the necessary resources to ensure the stability and security of cyberspace. The internet was conceived by academic actors and then developed and commercialised by private actors who own most of the infrastructures. Global companies have superior technical capabilities, data and resources compared to those of states and they are often the first to detect attacks and to offer a response. They have become essential partners to ensure the security of states.\nActors from the business and academic sectors, the technical community and civil society are heavily involved in the governance of the internet and their expertise can prove essential due to the technicity of the issues (Ríos Rodríguez 2010), as shown by the Wassenaar Arrangement. The implementation of this agreement regulating the exports of dual-use technologies was limited by its weak definition. Above all, these actors can help push states beyond some of the bottlenecks that limit the development and scope of norms because they have a common interest in the stability of cyberspace and in high user confidence.\nThe culmination of this logic lies in the creation, at the end of 2019, by Microsoft, MasterCard and the Hewlett Foundation, of the Cyber Peace Institute which, without having official attribution power, has an accountability function to evaluate states' respect of international law and of the norms of good behaviour. Similarly, the designation by Microsoft, in January 2020, of a representative for UN-related questions illustrated the company's willingness to directly weigh in into international discussions.\nHowever, these initiatives are limited by the reluctance of many states to leave non-state actors to get involved in the definition of states' rights, obligations and responsibilities. Although they recognise the importance of the multi-stakeholder model of internet governance and the need to closely involve the private sector and civil society in initiatives to promote the security and stability of cyberspace, they defend the exclusive dimension of some of their prerogatives. The role of non-state actors in the security and stability of cyberspace was recognised in 2013 and 2015 by the member states of the GGE, but they nevertheless reasserted their primary responsibility in this area. On the one hand, non-state actors, unless they have a specially granted title, are not allowed to participate in these discussions, because they are not subjects of international law. On the other hand, the representation of cyberspace as a field of confrontation and as an object of national security makes it the sole prerogative of states and limits the willingness of states to involve non-state actors in the discussions.\nIn any case, the input of non-state actors in international discussions has increasingly been recognised globally, even though disparities exist between states. Moreover, states are taking part in many multi-stakeholder forums dealing with issues of security and stability in cyberspace, which are being debated at the Internet Governance Forum, ICANN, but also in diplomatic dialogues and more specific initiatives (London Process, Raisina Dialogue, Sino-European Cyber Dialogue, US--China Cyber Dialogue, Canada--EU Cyber Dialogue and so on). They seek to advance ideas and build consensus outside multilateral processes in order to facilitate international discussions and/or create a balance of power by rallying states and organisations to their positions beforehand. This recognition of the role played by non-state actors is best illustrated by the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace initiated by France and largely promoted by Microsoft. The Paris Call -- not endorsed by the United States, China or Russia -- testifies to the signatories' public commitment to ensuring the security and stability of cyberspace globally.\nIt was not until a little over a year after the failure of the UN negotiations that new proposals emerged. And the way discussions resumed was emblematic of the tensions between two apprehensions of the risks in a deteriorated geopolitical context. Indeed, two processes (an open-ended working group and a group of governmental experts) actually debuted almost simultaneously in the autumn of 2019, one led by Russia, the other by the United States, with largely overlapping mandates. In October 2018, Russia introduced a new resolution on ICTs in the context of international security, listing several norms of behaviour and proposing to convene an open-ended working group (OEWG), i.e. a negotiation setting open to all UN member states. The First Commission at the UN was then the theatre of a sharp confrontation between the supporters of the Russian proposal and Western states which, in reaction, proposed their own draft resolution, offering another GGE restricted to 25 states. Despite important modifications on the Russian project, the United States -- followed by the European Union -- didn't withdraw its draft, leading to the adoption of two resolutions, amidst heightened tensions, by the General Assembly on 5 and 22 December 2018 (A/RES/73/27 and A/RES/73/266). A large majority of states voted in favour of the two resolutions which nevertheless reflected a deep divide between the major powers, both on their objectives and on the means of achieving them. Indeed, Russia hasn't renounced its original objective, stated in 1998, of a treaty to underpin the negotiations in the working group.\nInterestingly, the working group shepherded by Russia is the one consulting non-state actors (companies, NGOs...), some of which (but not all) also demand a treaty. On the contrary, the GGE only consults regional state organisations. This fracture was accentuated in December 2019 when the General Assembly adopted a new Russian-led resolution (A/RES/74/247) that created a new negotiation process responsible for elaborating a treaty on cybercrime. Western countries are strongly opposed to it because they believe that the 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, open for signature to states not belonging to the Council of Europe, and already ratified by 64 states, should be universalised instead.\nThese two negotiation processes have been produced by major geopolitical tensions, in a context in which the United States is being offensive while denouncing, with several of their global partners, Russian and Chinese cyberoperations. For their part, countries such as Russia and China -- even though they have adopted different strategies (Broeders, Adamson, and Creemers 2019) -- fully take advantage of the offensive potentialities offered by networks while they call for limits on the militarisation of the digital space. Europe, for its part, seeks to offer a third path, but with limited opposition to the United States, which remains its main ally. That said, Europe is plagued by its own dissensions.\nTo many observers' surprise, the OEWG adopted its final report on 12 March 2021, demonstrating that despite the context of strategic competition exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic, states were still able to achieve consensus. The report consolidates the achievements of the previous GGEs, encourages more transparency in the implementation of the recommendations of the 2015 GGE report and promotes the pursuit of international negotiations. It also shows some progress, such as the recognition of health infrastructures as critical infrastructures that need to be protected, along with the integrity and the general availability of the internet. However, many contentious points persist as revealed by the Chair's summary, published with the report, that contains most of the state propositions that were not adopted by the OEWG, short of a consensus between states.\nIn addition, states rushed to launch the next round of international negotiations even before the two processes had finalised their respective reports. France proposed a programme of action within the OEWG to merge the two processes into a single one that could provide incremental progress as opposed to requiring a final consensus report. But Russia and its allies sponsored a UNGA resolution launching a new OEWG in October 2020. The same day, the United States and its allies sponsored another resolution, that acknowledges the ongoing negotiations, leaving the door open for further negotiations as the GGE is scheduled to achieve its report in May 2021. Both resolutions were adopted by the UNGA in December 2020. In addition to the OEWG being renewed, the GGE could potentially be continued and a new programme of action created depending on what states propose at the UNGA's 76th session, starting in October 2021.\nThe landscape of international negotiations is thus becoming particularly crowded and even confused, with a multiplication of actors, initiatives and proposals aimed at promoting peace and stability in cyberspace. It risks leading to inconsistencies or ambiguities that would leave room for states to pursue their hijinks with relative impunity, even if the two groups' chairs have worked together to reach a consensus and limit contradictions. However, this proliferation is creating a dynamic that is making it possible for states and all actors to become more aware of the risks and challenges associated with the proliferation of cyberweapons. But it is also part of a geopolitical context that is particularly conducive to an arms race.",
    "## Conclusion Cyberspace has thus become a field of confrontations between states during the 2010s, to the point of becoming a military domain in its own right for many of them, which have engaged in a cyberweapons race. The proliferation of cyber operations and offensive tools has contributed to increasing the scope and sophistication of the threat they face in the digital space. The tools and attack concepts they have developed have escaped them and are increasingly turned against them, the vulnerabilities they exploit in adversary systems also affect the systems of their own companies and institutions, which can become strategic targets. Last but not least, the uncontrolled spread of certain attacks has had devastating consequences that raise important ethical, legal and economic liability issues but also awareness of the systemic risk that proliferation poses to the security and stability of cyberspace.": "For these reasons, and despite a notably tense geopolitical context, states have chosen to resume international discussions on security and stability in cyberspace, and have taken part in multiple initiatives with private actors and civil society to try to contain the threat. And yet, we cannot but note that the representation of cyberthreat as a geopolitical risk continues to predominate over the representation of systemic risk, leading some states room for offensive operations, in order to ensure their own power in cyberspace, which they see as a condition for their security.\nAt the time of writing, negotiations are still ongoing at the UN, and it is difficult to predict their outcome. In the end, it will depend on what states perceive as their primary interest: to curb systemic threat or to continue waging wars. Whatever the outcome of the negotiations, systemic risk will necessarily remain high because of the divergent strategic interests among states and because the exploitation of a network vulnerability by one actor for a specific purpose is in fact exploited by all and for multiple purposes. It also shows that, whatever the initiatives and propositions made, cyberspace JOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY # remains, first and foremost, used to wage war, and its regulation remains the product of the 'external legal policies' (Ladreit de Lacharrière 1983) of states, thus ultimately a byproduct of the defence of their respective interests."

But the advantages of the digital revolution are now threatened by the use of cyberspace for war purposes. This article explores the states' security dilemma as they face cyber challenges and the ambivalence of the notion of security in cyberspace. It highlights how, in ten years, cyberspace has become a battlefield and a strategic priority for many states that have represented it as a geopolitical threat for their national security, hence justifying its progressive militarisation. Meanwhile, they have become cognizant to the systemic risk of proliferation of offensive cybertools and cyber-operations. This security dilemma – one that opposes a representation of cyber threats as a geopolitical risk to that of cyberspace as a systemic risk – is at the heart of the multilateral negotiations on the regulation of cyberspace. There, a multiplicity of non-state actors has forced their way to the table through a multitude of initiatives that emphasize the importance of the challenges at stake and how difficult it will be for the states to face them.\n## ARTICLE HISTORY Received 28 February 2021 Revised 23 March 2021 Accepted 15 April 2021 ## KEYWORDS Cyberspace; cyberwar; proliferation; security; stability ## Introduction On 12 November 2018, in the midst of the Paris Peace Forum that brought together nearly 70 heads of state and government to commemorate the centenary of the 1918 armistice, the French president Emmanuel Macron launched the 'Paris Call for trust and security in cyberspace' during a meeting with actors of internet governance at UNESCO headquarters.¹ His vibrant plea, now endorsed by more than 1,000 signatories – including 77 states – highlighted common principles to maintain peace, security and stability in cyberspace. In April 2018, UNESCO had previously hosted a symposium convened by the National Cybersecurity Agency of France (ANSSI) and the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs entitled 'Building international peace and security in the digital society'. These initiatives were in line with the numerous others that have been carried out globally by governments, civil society and major digital companies since the early 2010s. Interestingly, Russia was the first state to propose, as early as 1998, a resolution CONTACT Frédérick Douzet fdouzet@gmail.com © 2021 The Author(s).

As the strongest advocate for an international treaty on cyberspace, Russia has since sponsored a resolution almost every year, while other international dialogues and processes have progressively been established. How can we explain such activism? Very simply because cyberspace is used -- first and foremost -- to wage wars.\nBeyond a pleasant homage to its author, the analogy to Yves Lacoste's seminal work La géographie, ça sert, d'abord, à faire la guerre (1976), is justified by the apparent explosion of conflict in cyberspace, which has become a new vector for geopolitical rivalries and even a new military field in the strategies and doctrines of many nations. It has also increasingly been militarised -- a set of social, political and economic processes have made a military approach to solving cyber problems more acceptable -- with the proliferation of weapons and threats that now structure its evolution and regulation. Obviously, cyberspace wasn't invented to wage wars and isn't only used for that. We can even say that the attacks conducted until today have remained below the threshold of war according to international law. However, setting severity thresholds has been made more difficult by the boldness and provocations of the most enterprising protagonists. Cyberspace has altogether revolutionised our modes of life, disrupted our economies, and enabled important progress in our societies. But the benefits brought by the digital revolution are now threatened by a sharp increase in the number and sophistication of malicious acts in cyberspace.\nFirst, the use of cyberspace for offensive purposes, by states and a diverse array of other actors, entails the risk of conflict escalation and of a destabilisation of our societies that, in turn, threatens international peace and security. Evidently, the catastrophic scenarios of ‘digital Pearl Harbors' or massive deadly attacks on vital infrastructures, which were popular worries in the early 2010s, haven't materialised. But several attacks have been uncontrollably propagated throughout the world, highlighting the potentially devastating threat of conflict in cyberspace and the systemic risks it entails. The proliferation of cyberweapons -- i.e. malicious tools to conduct cyberattacks -- threatens the stability of cyberspace, on which our societies have grown increasingly dependent, because its underlying infrastructures are constantly targeted. Cyberspace is also increasingly used to conduct digital influence and subversion operations. However, in most cases, the weaponization of information does not involve cyberattacks that could contribute to the proliferation of cyberweapons.\nSecond, in an unstable geopolitical context marked by a persistent terrorist threat, weakened multilateral institutions and the evident return of a strategic competition between large powers, states hold onto their ability to act and aren't ready to abandon certain practices that otherwise threaten the security and stability of cyberspace. This context of distrust and power rivalries limits global cooperation and constitutes a rein on efforts to adopt the necessary regulation to ensure the security and stability of cyberspace in the face of a systemic risk -- and also questions the very notion of security in cyberspace.\nHow can we define a threat to national or international security in cyberspace? What does the ‘security of cyberspace' mean? These questions provoke debates and oppose a multiplicity of points of views among state and non-state protagonists. The notion of securitisation developed by Barry Buzan and Ole Wæver in the 1990s -- that is, the way in which a political actor seizes upon an object that he treats, in his speeches, as a security issue in order to justify the sometimes extraordinary means of defending it -- offers an interesting analytical framework in this context (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998). It brings a better understanding of the complexity of international discussions that involve multiple actors, starting with states, to define security in cyberspace, what is necessary to implement it, and the underlying political choices it implies.\nThis article explores the security dilemma faced by states when dealing with cyber issues and the ambivalence of the notion of security in cyberspace. It shows how, within a decade, cyberspace has become a battlefield and an absolute strategic priority for many states, leading them to view it as a geopolitical threat to their national security. Hence, they have endorsed its militarisation despite a progressive understanding of the systemic risk that results from the proliferation of offensive weapons and operations. This dilemma lies at the heart of the ongoing tensions in multilateral discussions on the regulation of cyberspace, in which non-state actors have invited themselves through a multitude of initiatives that demonstrate the importance of the stakes but also the difficulties in dealing with them.\n## The emergence of a new military domain The representation of cyberspace as a new military domain emerged during the 2010s, the last step in the territorialisation of cyberspace by states in reaction to the multiplication of the strategic surprises they had faced there since the late 2000s. The territorialisation of cyberspace, which had been initiated by pioneers of the internet to represent the digital space and protect it from the geopolitical rivalries that prevailed in the physical world, became an imperative of securitisation quickly associated with its militarisation in the discourse of states.\nThis association between cyberattacks and the militarisation of cyberspace was, however, not self-evident based on the growing challenges posed by the cybercrimes perpetrated by non-state actors against private and individual interests. And it could have become the focus of attention. Instead, states have built a representation of cyberspace first and foremost as a threat to their national security at the expense of other characterisation, such as a criminal danger, an economic risk or a threat to individual user security and privacy. (Dunn Cavelty 2012; Nissenbaum 2005). As a consequence, even though states have tackled the overall issues of cybersecurity and cybercrime, they have structured their strategies mostly under the umbrella of national security, primarily reinforced military means of action (both defensive and offensive) and subsequently designated enemies in cyberspace, an eminently political act.\nThis militarisation of cyberspace can be partly explained by a deeper understanding of the internet and of digital technologies among defence protagonists, which allowed them to better foresee threats and publicise them. As they quickly allocated funds to this new field, they took part in defining state priorities on questions of national security. That said, it is the increasing number of state-sponsored attacks conducted for strategic reasons, together with the growing digitalisation of the battlefield, and the new opportunities arising from the association of digital operations with other traditional weapons, that led to the representation of cyberspace as a military battlefield. That representation has been predominant in Western democracies yet immediately contested by China and Russia, who have regularly denounced the risks of a militarisation of cyberspace, in which they have fully participated, however, according to the volume of cyberattacks officially attributed to them. Both countries had initially preferred the concept of informational space -- or information security -- to cyberspace, which reflects both their perception of the threat as being primarily informational and their priority of ensuring the stability of their political regimes. Their military doctrines have however considered this space as a strategic domain from the outset, even before Western countries. The most prominent cyber powers -- starting with the United States, France and the United Kingdom -- have since characterised cyberspace as the fifth military domain after land, sea, air and space. In turn, NATO recognised cyberspace as an operational military domain in 2016.\nThe pertinence of this representation has led to intense debates in the academic literature due to the specificities of cyberspace. Martin Libicki first denounced this label as inadequate to understand this hyper-dynamic environment in permanent and rapid reconfiguration, the plasticity of which requires constant adaptation and great agility. He noted that this development brought us back to classic concepts of warfare such as ‘control, manoeuvre, superiority' whereas control is illusory in cyberspace and armies don't manoeuvre in the same battlefield as their enemies. Indeed, the latter can reduce their vulnerabilities and limit the impact of an attack through measures of cyberdefence. Hence, the success of an attack in cyberspace partly depends on targets that evolve rapidly and dynamically.\nFurthermore, there is no academic consensus on the very notion of cyberwar, despite its large media and political echo. In his book Cyber War Will Not Take Place, Thomas Rid (2013, 37) stated that past operations couldn't be labelled warfare because an ‘act of war must be instrumental, political, and potentially lethal'. And even if a future cyberattack were to meet these criteria, the response would most likely not be confined to cyberspace but escalate into a kinetic conflict. Ultimately, these attacks were only more sophisticated versions -- involving malicious code -- of methods as old as war: espionage, sabotage and subversion. Even from the perspective of international law, the only operation that could have qualified as an act of war -- but wasn't declared one by the Iranian government -- was the Stuxnet attack against the nuclear centrifuges at Natanz in 2010. According to the New York Times, the attack was led by the United States with the help of Israeli intelligence services. To this day, no state has officially denounced an act of war in cyberspace.\nThe threshold of what is acceptable -- and accepted -- in terms of offensive operations also seems to be constantly pushed back, in view of the increasingly open hostilities conducted by states that push their advantage in cyberspace without necessarily triggering a forceful response. Current debates here suggest that it is a matter of time, more than a matter of threshold, before cyberwar reaches its cruising speed. But the reality is more complex. On the one hand, states show a certain restraint compared to their full capacity for action, which enables them to remain below the threshold for triggering an open conflict, despite testing this limit. On the other hand, the use of cyber operations is most often part of a combination of modes of action -- technical and non-technical, online and offline, direct and indirect, state and non-state -- which adds to the fog around (cyber)warfare, as it is not always clear where it starts and where it ends.\nHere, the only certainty is that cyber operations have now been integrated into the arsenal of the largest armies, supporting all the existing means used in the conduct of war. But the clear risk of conflict escalation between nuclear powers have also led to constant and ambiguous confrontations between antagonist state actors into the grey zone, below the threshold of war -- a peacetime competition that opposes in particular Russia to Western democracies. As a result, cyberspace has become a new space of confrontation in the geopolitical power rivalries that oppose a multitude of actors, leading to the proliferation of operations -- the most sophisticated of which come from states -- and eventually to the materialisation of cyberwar.\n## The ‘materialisation of cyber war': a series of strategic surprises According to Robert Kaiser, the 2007 cyberattacks against Estonia were a catalyst for the ‘materialisation of cyber war' as a new policy object -- even though no attack has yet been said to reach the threshold of an armed attack and been qualified as an act of war -- that keeps influencing the way states perceive future threats of cyberwar. These attacks occurred as protests proliferated among the Russian minority against the decision to move the statue of the Bronze Soldier in Tallinn. These DDOS attacks paralysed the websites of numerous organisations in the country, including banks, media outlets, ministries and the parliament. The following year, in July 2008, a wave of cyberattacks against Georgian websites preceded the arrival of Russian tanks in the country, the first known cyberattack combined with a land military operation. Despite their rudimentary nature, the public and spectacular dimension of these attacks forced states to come to term with them. Since then, cyberattacks have multiplied and, more importantly, they have become more targeted, sophisticated, creative and damaging, leading states to constantly adapt themselves to an evolving landscape of threats, marked by a succession of strategic surprises and a constant expansion of scope.\nIn 2010, Stuxnet became the first major attack against a critical infrastructure, in a joint attempt by the United States and Israel to halt the Iranian nuclear programme. In 2013, Edward Snowden's revelations disclosed that American espionage techniques could reach an unprecedented depth on an unsuspected scale thanks to the global interconnection of information and communication systems. Other countries -- including European states -- had to acknowledge their dependency on US digital platforms and technologies. The attacks that targeted the entertainment company Sony Pictures in 2014 took the American government completely by surprise: strategic attacks could also target large firms now. The 2015 attack against TV5 Monde in France reiterated that possibility.\nThen, in 2015, the Islamic State surprised everyone with its sophisticated use of social networks to distribute its propaganda, encourage online radicalisation, find new recruits, raise money, organise departures to Syria, and prepare terrorist attacks. It forced Western democracies, which had focused on technical attacks, to widen their approach to take informational operations into account as well. But it didn't prevent the American administration from being taken by surprise by the interferences attributed to Russia that occurred during the 2016 presidential campaign, for which they were evidently not prepared (François and Lin 2020). Operations of information manipulation interfering with, or destabilising, democratic countries are now under the spotlight.\nIn 2016, a long-feared scenario materialised when the servers of the company Dyn were attacked after its network of connected objects (cameras, printers...) was manipulated, expanding the field of vulnerabilities and the vectors of attacks. Finally, the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks in 2017 inaugurated an era of massive propagating attacks, both swift and uncontrollable, and caused the greatest damage ever recorded by indiscriminately affecting dozens of companies and institutions in more than 150 countries that had not been initially targeted. It stressed the need to protect the systems but also to be able to react quickly to block a rapid contamination. This systemic risk is linked to the interconnection of digital networks.\nThese strategic surprises highlighted the vulnerability, and the unpreparedness, of states -- including the most advanced ones -- as they faced a ever-changing threat. They forcefully influenced the representation of cyberspace as a new military field that required the mobilisation of exceptional resources in the name of national security. This representation led to an institutional reorganisation: many countries created cybersecurity agencies and cybercommands within their armed forces to prepare their cyberdefence. It also encouraged the development of new offensive tools to be used for intelligence or surveillance, or during military operations. The inhibitions against such a dynamic arms race, during which countries strengthen their power, have paradoxically been loosened following Edward Snowden's revelations, as many states started claiming the development of offensive capabilities. For example, the cyber strategy of the Trump administration unambiguously endorsed the proliferation of offensive tools, as well as the penetration of digital systems to deter adversaries. In addition, the revelations spurred many countries in Europe and around the world into investing more in digital intelligence capabilities and boosting the commercial marketplace of digital surveillance technologies. The exportation of such technologies has, in some cases, permitted population surveillance by states that had not yet developed their own capabilities for the purpose of detecting and managing threats to the stability of their regime.\nHence, the ‘materialisation of cyber war' during the past decade has reinforced the securitization and militarisation of cyberspace that debuted during the 2000s. The notion of security remains ambiguous because, as noted by Dunn Cavelty (2012), the military conception of security can be associated with serious risks. The tools developed by the states to ensure their national security can increase the risks they are exposed to, especially in cyberspace as we will see later. They can also bring about insecurity in other domains of security -- economic, social or political (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998). Information and communication networks are shared by institutions, civil society and the economic and military spheres. Thus, cyberspace offers a multitude of complex interactions and interconnections between these areas where issues are overlapping. Hence, cyberspace is used by a multitude of actors for different ends, and their interests and representations of security may prove widely divergent. The debate over encryption illustrates the profound antagonisms generated by digital technologies between the different actors of security, putting the proponents of encryption to protect states' and companies' secrets against the proponents of an access to data limited to the courts or the police, and even against the proponents of deeper protections for personal data and civil liberties (East West Institute 2018). Within a government, divergent conceptions of security can coexist and sometimes oppose each other, as different ministries and agencies implement different (sometimes contradictory) security objectives in cyberspace.\nLikewise, there is no uniform representation of cyberspace among states. On the contrary, it depends on the geopolitical context, the relationships between regional powers, on the level of development of the digital economy, on cyberdefence capabilities, and on their strategic culture. Besides, representations are shaped by imbalances in commanding technologies, infrastructures, data flows, or on the ability to act in the digital space. For instance, cyberspace is first and foremost an issue of connectivity and economic development in many African countries, but also a territory where cybercrime needs to be fought. Among authoritarian regimes, the informational dimension of cyberspace is seen as the main threat against political stability, as it opens a space for the expression of dissident opinions, the propagation of rumours and the risk of subversion.\nBut the military representation of cyberspace predominates in large Western countries that have advanced capabilities and a central role in international negotiations. They also influence political decision-makers at the expense of other approaches to risks that could better take into account the security of private actors and individual users. Finally, this militarisation of cyberspace also invites risks of which states are progressively growing aware, but they face a security dilemma.\n## Geopolitical risk v. systemic risk: states' security dilemma States have become aware of the risks of proliferation as tools they have developed are used against them. In the digital sphere, offensive tools can be stolen, copied, retrieved, analysed, transformed, reused and repurposed, as the examples of the Shadow Brokers or Vault 7 have shown. New offensive concepts and tactics can be imitated and re-employed. In other words, cyberattacks are liable to teach lessons and to improve the capabilities of their adversaries. A classified NSA document from 2013 divulged by Edward Snowden and published in The Intercept in 2015 confirmed what many had feared before: the Iranian regime learned from the cyberattacks it had suffered and it used this knowledge to improve its own capabilities. The report specified that Iran probably imitated the offensive techniques of an attack against its oil industry to launch the Shamoon attack against Saudi Aramco in 2012 which sabotaged 30,000 computers in one stroke. Hence, proliferation leads to improved skills among actors, including adversaries and criminals, and directly participates in the heightened sophistication of attacks and in the threats against the whole digital environment.\nFurthermore, because technologies and networks are shared by armies, private actors, institutions and civil society, these attacks are liable to propagate quickly, and sometimes uncontrollably. The risk of uncontrollable collateral damage is a serious hindrance to the work of armies in the digital space; for instance, the notion of a ‘surgical' attack appears to be a contradiction in terms, as the interactions and interconnections between the systems and their points of vulnerability are difficult to anticipate on this territory. The Stuxnet virus, specifically conceived for the Natanz nuclear infrastructure as it wasn't connected to the internet, did propagate through cyberspace, probably though a USB key. Although Stuxnet did not unleash its payload on third-party victims' computers, part of its code was later reused in other cyberattacks, hence demonstrating that highly targeted code is no guarantee against proliferation.\nThe WannaCry and NotPetya attacks were emblematic of the systemic risk posed by the proliferation of cyberweapons in our societies. These attacks were rapidly and uncontrollably propagated throughout the world, targeting hospitals and causing hundreds of millions of euros' worth of damage for companies that weren't initially targeted. In May 2017, the ransomware WannaCry infected more than 200,000 computers in 150 countries until the discovery of a kill switch stopped it. Subsequent investigations brought the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia to dismiss the possibility of a criminal endeavour and they attributed the attack to North Korea. The NotPetya attack, which initially resembled a ransomware attack, was entirely conceived to sabotage systems. The White House estimated that this sole attack cost $10 billion, the most devastating ever, and it was attributed to Russia, first by the United Kingdom, and then by the other Five Eyes countries. These two attacks used EternalBlue, an offensive tool that took advantage of a Microsoft vulnerability and was developed by the NSA. This tool was stolen from the NSA, made publicly available online, and later used by other actors to launch attacks that propagated uncontrollably and hit the very country that created this offensive tool.\nThese attacks thus demonstrated the security dilemma faced by states regarding offensive operations in cyberspace (Segal; Buchanan) and which pit two non-exclusive (but coexisting) representations of cyber risk against each other, leading to complex tensions and sometimes irreconcilable objectives between and within governments.\nOn the one hand, the states see a cyberthreat as systemic: an extremely complex, cross-border risk, not necessarily of state origin, which, like pandemics, can spread very rapidly, be very difficult to stop and cause massive damage. It is therefore in the interest of all actors to stop contagions that could have disastrous consequences. This approach to risks calls for enhanced cooperation between governments -- but also within governments and between private and public actors -- and arms control, in the common interest of system stability.\nOn the other hand, a cyberthreat is primarily a geopolitical threat for states because the offensive tools are used by their adversaries but also by their allies and economic rivals to increase their power through espionage, influence, or even military operations. Focusing on this risk takes states in the opposite direction: enhancing their offensive arsenal, limiting cooperation and protecting their sovereign capabilities. This approach clearly dominates the representations of states with the most advanced capabilities, as seen in the ongoing race for cyberweapons and in the offensive doctrines they have developed recently (Buchanan).\nThe dominant representation of the geopolitical risk is a source of distrust among states and it encourages them to reinforce their ‘territorial' control over cyberspace as well as their sovereign capabilities. It limits their ability to come to an agreement on the modalities for regulating states' behaviour in cyberspace and interpreting international law. It also explains why international discussions exclude a central issue linked to the offensive practices of states: espionage. That said, the search for an equilibrium between the two approaches is at the heart of the international intergovernmental discussions on the regulation of cyberspace as states start to acknowledge their own vulnerability in the face of systemic risk.\n## Diplomats launched an attack on the ‘digital far west' For years, the most advanced states took advantage of the opacity of the digital space to discretely conduct offensive operations with impunity. But with the materialisation of cyber-war and the multiplication of large-scale attacks that targeted them, states have progressively acknowledged the risks they are exposed to -- and which are now becoming systemic.\nFirst, the technology is both more widely accessible and less expensive, making it available to a larger number of state and non-state actors, all increasingly enterprising and creative in how they use it. The 2010s were marked by a diversification of targets -- strategic attacks against private companies -- of actors involved, with sometimes blurry relations to state authorities, and of the operating modes as attackers are only limited by their imagination in hijacking digital technologies. Threats are more pressing, complex, protean and unpredictable.\nIn fact, the digital transformation of societies makes them increasingly dependent on cyberspace, the stability of which is now essential to their proper functioning. But the multiplication of badly-secured connected objects, the embedded computing in medical devices, vehicles and even in military armament, constantly expands the space that can be targeted. In other words, the more connected and dependent on data a society is, the more points of vulnerability there are. The rise of quantum computing -- which promises to revolutionise encryption by increasing computing power -- and of artificial intelligence suggests sophisticated and potentially destabilising attacks, even though these technologies could also be used to improve cybersecurity.\nStates are thus faced with the same type of dilemma as when they became aware of the dangers of nuclear power. Except that digital technology is within the reach of many actors (not only states), it is easier to steal and reuse than a nuclear missile, and it is by nature dual-use and ubiquitous, which makes controlling the possession of offensive tools and organising verification impossible. It therefore requires a totally different approach to counter-proliferation. But because it can turn against the states that develop it, at the risk of threatening international security and the very stability of cyberspace, it raises the question of systemic risk, which was at the heart of the balance of terror doctrine. This risk led states, at the end of the 1990s, to initiate discussions on the regulation of cyberspace which, after years of stalemate and the change of posture of the United States in favour of multilateralism under the Obama administration (Douzet and Géry 2020), have led to significant progress.\nAfter the first resolution introduced by Russia in 1998, the General Assembly of the United Nations created a group of governmental experts (GGE) to begin discussions on information and communication technologies (ICTs). Only 15 states were initially represented, including the five permanent members of the Security Council -- due to the format chosen but also to the limited number of countries with competences in the field. Overall, 5 GGEs were successively convened and, when membership was progressively widened, it remained rather limited (25 states in 2016--2017). Only three GGEs agreed on a report -- in 2010 (A/65/201), 2013 (A/68/98) and 2015 (A/74/170) -- as the others couldn't reach a consensus.\nThe content of these three reports illustrates the progressive acknowledgment by states of their own vulnerabilities and of the existence of a systemic risk, on the one hand, and the domination of the geopolitical risk on the systemic risk on the other hand. All of this limits progress in regulating the digital space. It is necessary to note that these reports were only recommendations to the General Assembly and not binding instruments creating obligations for states. They shared a willingness to commit themselves politically without being legally constrained and, as such, acknowledged a need to identify limits to preserve the security and stability of cyberspace.\nIn the 2010 report, states recognised that ‘The global network of ICTs [communication and information technologies] has become an arena for disruptive activity' [para. 4] in which different actors intervene. They recommended reinforcing the cybersecurity capabilities of states, implementing confidence-building measures and a ‘[f]urther dialogue among States to discuss norms pertaining to State use of ICTs, to reduce collective risk and protect critical national and international infrastructure' (para. 18i).\nIn 2013, states recognised for the first time, in an international document, that international law applies to cyberspace: ‘International law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment' (GGE Report 2013, para. 19). This strengthened the territorialisation of digital space, further affirmed in the following paragraph: ‘State sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to State conduct of ICT-related activities, and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory' (ibid, para. 20). The recognition of the applicability of international law in cyberspace led to the delimitation of states' rights and obligations related to cyberoperations because states were now proscribed from conducting operations contrary to their international obligations. For example, they are not allowed to conduct cyberoperations that intervene in the internal affairs of another state; they would otherwise be in violation of the principle of non-intervention.\nThis decision also reflected the willingness of states to inscribe their behaviour in the international legal order. The digital space is therefore no longer a ‘digital Wild West' in which only the law of the strongest dominates, at least in theory. There are rules that derive from international law, but the question is how they should be applied or, in other words, what the rights and duties of states ought to be. But interpreting international law in such a new, complex and dynamic environment poses serious difficulties. For that reason, the member countries of the third GGE recommended the elaboration of ‘norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour by States' to reduce the risks threatening the security and stability of cyberspace. These norms, which are derived from international law according to the report, set out principles or good practices to guide the behaviour of states. The mission entrusted to the fourth GGE, created shortly after the publication of the 2013 report, and which met in 2014 and 2015, was to further develop these norms.\nHowever, this apparent UN consensus hides profound disagreements on the modalities of the regulation of cyberspace, based on the representation of the geopolitical risk, and they can be surmised from the 2015 report. Reading the table of contents, we see the first cracks in the consensus between the states. Indeed, the report includes six parts, the third and sixth respectively dealing with the norms of responsible behaviour of states and international law. Contrary to the 2013 report, a strict separation -- at least in appearance -- is established between the norms and rules of international law. As such, the report highlighted an opposition among states on the necessity to elaborate (or not) new rules of international law to ensure the security of the digital space. On one side, some countries, including the United States, believe that existing international law is enough to regulate behaviour and they demand political commitments instead, via non-binding norms, to translate the expectations of the international community and enable a better predictability of states' behaviour. These norms could be built on existing obligations but without creating new international obligations. On the other side, some states -- such as Russia -- display a more legalist approach to international law and believe that existing law isn't enough to regulate the behaviour of states in cyberspace because of its specificities. New rules, and binding new rights and obligations, are necessary to complete international law, via a treaty (Delerue and Géry 2017). But, by separating norms from questions of international law, the report gives the impression that norms are autonomous and that their implementation isn't dependent on existing obligations set in international law.\nUnderlying this position is the belief that international law is sufficient and does not need to be clarified. And mentioning the purpose and the value of the norms limits their scope: they are non-binding and serve as a standard of measurement to assess the behaviour of states, but are not intended to limit the rights of states (2015 GGE Report, para. 10). They are purely declaratory as they need to be specified to be implemented. Furthermore, the part dedicated to international law only reiterates, to a large extent, what was already written in the 2013 report. Conversely, separating the norms can be interpreted either as a need for new rules or states' willingness to limit their commitment (this is the way Russia interprets it). These two interpretations coexist and highlight the difficult elaboration of a consensus among states (Delerue, Douzet, and Géry 2020).\nThat said, the report did bring notable progress. Indeed, states came to an agreement on a series of non-binding norms to reduce the risks to global peace, security and stability. They forbade cyberoperations causing intentional damage to vital infrastructure and attacks on computer emergency response teams (CERTs). States shouldn't purposely authorise malicious cyberoperations organised from their territory, either. They committed themselves to notifying vulnerabilities in a responsible manner, but also to combating the proliferation of malicious computer technologies and tools, to exchanging information, to providing mutual assistance, and to implementing measures recommended by the General Assembly for the protection of critical infrastructures.\nThe adoption of these norms shows a common willingness to ensure the security and stability of the digital space. But it remains the product of a compromise between states and, more importantly, of the search for an equilibrium to limit systemic risk while continuing to use the digital space for offensive purposes, a realistic principle with regard to the current geopolitical context. The numerous caveats in the formulation of the recommendations, such as the use of the conditional (states should, should not) or the ambiguity in the formulation of proscribed cyberoperations all testify to this balancing act. Hence, the cyberoperations against vitally important infrastructures are not proscribed, but the ones contrary to international law and causing ‘intentional damages' against the infrastructures are.\nThe General Assembly of the United Nations hoped to pursue the discussions with a fifth GGE. But the negotiations failed in 2016--2017 in the face of profound disagreements on international law and its interpretation. The communiqués and statements of the United States, Cuba and Russia highlighted apparent doubts on the applicability of certain clauses of international law (self-defence, law of international responsibility, international humanitarian law) and, more importantly, profound dissensions on the interpretation of these branches of law. They could partly be explained by the particularly tense geopolitical context, marked by the affirmation of state power in cyberspace: accusations of Russian interferences in the American presidential elections, rising informational threats, trade tensions between China and the United States that focused on digital technologies, cyberattacks with systemic propagation, and the beginning of public attributions and retaliating threats. In this context, some states -- notably China -- questioned the scope and potential consequences of their legal commitments. From the outset, this geopolitical context foreshadowed the reluctance of states to agree on progress in the regulation of the digital space. This risk is all the greater because, apart from confidence-building measures and capacity-building, the discussions on international law and norms need to go into a level of detail that could further limit the behaviour of states. Hence, the geopolitical risk brought the negotiations on security and stability in the digital space to a stalemate. As a consequence, non-state actors confronted with systemic risk sought to become directly involved in these discussions through various new initiatives.\n## Much ado about nothing?\nOn 14 February 2017, Brad Smith, the President of Microsoft, called to convene a Digital Geneva Convention. Drawing from the 1949 Geneva Conventions, he invited states to protect infrastructures and citizens from computer attacks in times of peace. He also called for the creation of an international organisation modelled on the International Atomic Energy Agency to handle the attribution of cyberoperations. Meanwhile, during the Munich Security Conference, the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) debuted its work. This independent commission of 28 international experts from the private sector, academia, the technical community and NGOs was created by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the support of prominent companies and several states. It was tasked with offering new norms of responsible behaviour to maintain security and stability in the digital space, which is the objective of its final report presented at the Paris Peace Forum in November 2019. Between 2017 and 2019, these private (Microsoft) and multi-stakeholder (GCSC) settings played an important role in discussions on the security and stability of the digital space. They first maintained these questions on the global agenda through more or less formal contacts between states and international organisations when uncertainty prevailed over the future of international negotiations. They then launched initiatives and elaborated proposals to regulate the digital space. The GCSC listed eight norms of responsible behaviour, several of which were integrated in the Paris Call in November 2018 and in the Cybersecurity Act adopted in May 2019 by the European Union. Other initiatives emerged, such as private commitments (Charter of Trust by Siemens, Cybersecurity Tech Accord by Microsoft) and new NGOs (Cyber Peace Institute).\nAll these initiatives were symptomatic of a willingness among private actors and civil society to get involved in the discussions on a domain of sovereignty and to try to impose the multi-stakeholder model -- long limited to the governance of other aspects of the internet -- on matters of international security. These actors are historically legitimate, technically competent, and they have the necessary resources to ensure the stability and security of cyberspace. The internet was conceived by academic actors and then developed and commercialised by private actors who own most of the infrastructures. Global companies have superior technical capabilities, data and resources compared to those of states and they are often the first to detect attacks and to offer a response. They have become essential partners to ensure the security of states.\nActors from the business and academic sectors, the technical community and civil society are heavily involved in the governance of the internet and their expertise can prove essential due to the technicity of the issues (Ríos Rodríguez 2010), as shown by the Wassenaar Arrangement. The implementation of this agreement regulating the exports of dual-use technologies was limited by its weak definition. Above all, these actors can help push states beyond some of the bottlenecks that limit the development and scope of norms because they have a common interest in the stability of cyberspace and in high user confidence.\nThe culmination of this logic lies in the creation, at the end of 2019, by Microsoft, MasterCard and the Hewlett Foundation, of the Cyber Peace Institute which, without having official attribution power, has an accountability function to evaluate states' respect of international law and of the norms of good behaviour. Similarly, the designation by Microsoft, in January 2020, of a representative for UN-related questions illustrated the company's willingness to directly weigh in into international discussions.\nHowever, these initiatives are limited by the reluctance of many states to leave non-state actors to get involved in the definition of states' rights, obligations and responsibilities. Although they recognise the importance of the multi-stakeholder model of internet governance and the need to closely involve the private sector and civil society in initiatives to promote the security and stability of cyberspace, they defend the exclusive dimension of some of their prerogatives. The role of non-state actors in the security and stability of cyberspace was recognised in 2013 and 2015 by the member states of the GGE, but they nevertheless reasserted their primary responsibility in this area. On the one hand, non-state actors, unless they have a specially granted title, are not allowed to participate in these discussions, because they are not subjects of international law. On the other hand, the representation of cyberspace as a field of confrontation and as an object of national security makes it the sole prerogative of states and limits the willingness of states to involve non-state actors in the discussions.\nIn any case, the input of non-state actors in international discussions has increasingly been recognised globally, even though disparities exist between states. Moreover, states are taking part in many multi-stakeholder forums dealing with issues of security and stability in cyberspace, which are being debated at the Internet Governance Forum, ICANN, but also in diplomatic dialogues and more specific initiatives (London Process, Raisina Dialogue, Sino-European Cyber Dialogue, US--China Cyber Dialogue, Canada--EU Cyber Dialogue and so on). They seek to advance ideas and build consensus outside multilateral processes in order to facilitate international discussions and/or create a balance of power by rallying states and organisations to their positions beforehand. This recognition of the role played by non-state actors is best illustrated by the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace initiated by France and largely promoted by Microsoft. The Paris Call -- not endorsed by the United States, China or Russia -- testifies to the signatories' public commitment to ensuring the security and stability of cyberspace globally.\nIt was not until a little over a year after the failure of the UN negotiations that new proposals emerged. And the way discussions resumed was emblematic of the tensions between two apprehensions of the risks in a deteriorated geopolitical context. Indeed, two processes (an open-ended working group and a group of governmental experts) actually debuted almost simultaneously in the autumn of 2019, one led by Russia, the other by the United States, with largely overlapping mandates. In October 2018, Russia introduced a new resolution on ICTs in the context of international security, listing several norms of behaviour and proposing to convene an open-ended working group (OEWG), i.e. a negotiation setting open to all UN member states. The First Commission at the UN was then the theatre of a sharp confrontation between the supporters of the Russian proposal and Western states which, in reaction, proposed their own draft resolution, offering another GGE restricted to 25 states. Despite important modifications on the Russian project, the United States -- followed by the European Union -- didn't withdraw its draft, leading to the adoption of two resolutions, amidst heightened tensions, by the General Assembly on 5 and 22 December 2018 (A/RES/73/27 and A/RES/73/266). A large majority of states voted in favour of the two resolutions which nevertheless reflected a deep divide between the major powers, both on their objectives and on the means of achieving them. Indeed, Russia hasn't renounced its original objective, stated in 1998, of a treaty to underpin the negotiations in the working group.\nInterestingly, the working group shepherded by Russia is the one consulting non-state actors (companies, NGOs...), some of which (but not all) also demand a treaty. On the contrary, the GGE only consults regional state organisations. This fracture was accentuated in December 2019 when the General Assembly adopted a new Russian-led resolution (A/RES/74/247) that created a new negotiation process responsible for elaborating a treaty on cybercrime. Western countries are strongly opposed to it because they believe that the 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, open for signature to states not belonging to the Council of Europe, and already ratified by 64 states, should be universalised instead.\nThese two negotiation processes have been produced by major geopolitical tensions, in a context in which the United States is being offensive while denouncing, with several of their global partners, Russian and Chinese cyberoperations. For their part, countries such as Russia and China -- even though they have adopted different strategies (Broeders, Adamson, and Creemers 2019) -- fully take advantage of the offensive potentialities offered by networks while they call for limits on the militarisation of the digital space. Europe, for its part, seeks to offer a third path, but with limited opposition to the United States, which remains its main ally. That said, Europe is plagued by its own dissensions.\nTo many observers' surprise, the OEWG adopted its final report on 12 March 2021, demonstrating that despite the context of strategic competition exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic, states were still able to achieve consensus. The report consolidates the achievements of the previous GGEs, encourages more transparency in the implementation of the recommendations of the 2015 GGE report and promotes the pursuit of international negotiations. It also shows some progress, such as the recognition of health infrastructures as critical infrastructures that need to be protected, along with the integrity and the general availability of the internet. However, many contentious points persist as revealed by the Chair's summary, published with the report, that contains most of the state propositions that were not adopted by the OEWG, short of a consensus between states.\nIn addition, states rushed to launch the next round of international negotiations even before the two processes had finalised their respective reports. France proposed a programme of action within the OEWG to merge the two processes into a single one that could provide incremental progress as opposed to requiring a final consensus report. But Russia and its allies sponsored a UNGA resolution launching a new OEWG in October 2020. The same day, the United States and its allies sponsored another resolution, that acknowledges the ongoing negotiations, leaving the door open for further negotiations as the GGE is scheduled to achieve its report in May 2021. Both resolutions were adopted by the UNGA in December 2020. In addition to the OEWG being renewed, the GGE could potentially be continued and a new programme of action created depending on what states propose at the UNGA's 76th session, starting in October 2021.\nThe landscape of international negotiations is thus becoming particularly crowded and even confused, with a multiplication of actors, initiatives and proposals aimed at promoting peace and stability in cyberspace. It risks leading to inconsistencies or ambiguities that would leave room for states to pursue their hijinks with relative impunity, even if the two groups' chairs have worked together to reach a consensus and limit contradictions. However, this proliferation is creating a dynamic that is making it possible for states and all actors to become more aware of the risks and challenges associated with the proliferation of cyberweapons. But it is also part of a geopolitical context that is particularly conducive to an arms race.\n## Conclusion Cyberspace has thus become a field of confrontations between states during the 2010s, to the point of becoming a military domain in its own right for many of them, which have engaged in a cyberweapons race. The proliferation of cyber operations and offensive tools has contributed to increasing the scope and sophistication of the threat they face in the digital space. The tools and attack concepts they have developed have escaped them and are increasingly turned against them, the vulnerabilities they exploit in adversary systems also affect the systems of their own companies and institutions, which can become strategic targets. Last but not least, the uncontrolled spread of certain attacks has had devastating consequences that raise important ethical, legal and economic liability issues but also awareness of the systemic risk that proliferation poses to the security and stability of cyberspace.\nFor these reasons, and despite a notably tense geopolitical context, states have chosen to resume international discussions on security and stability in cyberspace, and have taken part in multiple initiatives with private actors and civil society to try to contain the threat. And yet, we cannot but note that the representation of cyberthreat as a geopolitical risk continues to predominate over the representation of systemic risk, leading some states room for offensive operations, in order to ensure their own power in cyberspace, which they see as a condition for their security.\nAt the time of writing, negotiations are still ongoing at the UN, and it is difficult to predict their outcome. In the end, it will depend on what states perceive as their primary interest: to curb systemic threat or to continue waging wars. Whatever the outcome of the negotiations, systemic risk will necessarily remain high because of the divergent strategic interests among states and because the exploitation of a network vulnerability by one actor for a specific purpose is in fact exploited by all and for multiple purposes. It also shows that, whatever the initiatives and propositions made, cyberspace JOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY # remains, first and foremost, used to wage war, and its regulation remains the product of the 'external legal policies' (Ladreit de Lacharrière 1983) of states, thus ultimately a byproduct of the defence of their respective interests.",

But the advantages of the digital revolution are now threatened by the use of cyberspace for war purposes. This article explores the states' security dilemma as they face cyber challenges and the ambivalence of the notion of security in cyberspace. It highlights how, in ten years, cyberspace has become a battlefield and a strategic priority for many states that have represented it as a geopolitical threat for their national security, hence justifying its progressive militarisation. Meanwhile, they have become cognizant to the systemic risk of proliferation of offensive cybertools and cyber-operations. This security dilemma – one that opposes a representation of cyber threats as a geopolitical risk to that of cyberspace as a systemic risk – is at the heart of the multilateral negotiations on the regulation of cyberspace. There, a multiplicity of non-state actors has forced their way to the table through a multitude of initiatives that emphasize the importance of the challenges at stake and how difficult it will be for the states to face them.\n## ARTICLE HISTORY\nReceived 28 February 2021\nRevised 23 March 2021\nAccepted 15 April 2021\n## KEYWORDS\nCyberspace; cyberwar; proliferation; security; stability\n## Introduction\nOn 12 November 2018, in the midst of the Paris Peace Forum that brought together nearly 70 heads of state and government to commemorate the centenary of the 1918 armistice, the French president Emmanuel Macron launched the 'Paris Call for trust and security in cyberspace' during a meeting with actors of internet governance at UNESCO headquarters.¹ His vibrant plea, now endorsed by more than 1,000 signatories – including 77 states – highlighted common principles to maintain peace, security and stability in cyberspace. In April 2018, UNESCO had previously hosted a symposium convened by the National Cybersecurity Agency of France (ANSSI) and the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs entitled 'Building international peace and security in the digital society'. These initiatives were in line with the numerous others that have been carried out globally by governments, civil society and major digital companies since the early 2010s. Interestingly, Russia was the first state to propose, as early as 1998, a resolution\nCONTACT Frédérick Douzet fdouzet@gmail.com\n© 2021 The Author(s).

As the strongest advocate for an international treaty on cyberspace, Russia has since sponsored a resolution almost every year, while other international dialogues and processes have progressively been established. How can we explain such activism? Very simply because cyberspace is used -- first and foremost -- to wage wars.\nBeyond a pleasant homage to its author, the analogy to Yves Lacoste's seminal work La géographie, ça sert, d'abord, à faire la guerre (1976), is justified by the apparent explosion of conflict in cyberspace, which has become a new vector for geopolitical rivalries and even a new military field in the strategies and doctrines of many nations. It has also increasingly been militarised -- a set of social, political and economic processes have made a military approach to solving cyber problems more acceptable (Rech et al. 2014) -- with the proliferation of weapons and threats that now structure its evolution and regulation. Obviously, cyberspace wasn't invented to wage wars and isn't only used for that (Douzet and Desforges 2018). We can even say that the attacks conducted until today have remained below the threshold of war according to international law. However, setting severity thresholds has been made more difficult by the boldness and provocations of the most enterprising protagonists (Forteau 2019). Cyberspace has altogether revolutionised our modes of life, disrupted our economies, and enabled important progress in our societies. But the benefits brought by the digital revolution are now threatened by a sharp increase in the number and sophistication of malicious acts in cyberspace.\nFirst, the use of cyberspace for offensive purposes, by states and a diverse array of other actors, entails the risk of conflict escalation and of a destabilisation of our societies that, in turn, threatens international peace and security. Evidently, the catastrophic scenarios of ‘digital Pearl Harbors' or massive deadly attacks on vital infrastructures, which were popular worries in the early 2010s, haven't materialised. But several attacks have been uncontrollably propagated throughout the world, highlighting the potentially devastating threat of conflict in cyberspace and the systemic risks it entails. The proliferation of cyberweapons -- i.e. malicious tools to conduct cyberattacks -- threatens the stability of cyberspace, on which our societies have grown increasingly dependent, because its underlying infrastructures are constantly targeted. Cyberspace is also increasingly used to conduct digital influence and subversion operations. However, in most cases, the weaponization of information does not involve cyberattacks that could contribute to the proliferation of cyberweapons.\nSecond, in an unstable geopolitical context marked by a persistent terrorist threat, weakened multilateral institutions and the evident return of a strategic competition between large powers, states hold onto their ability to act and aren't ready to abandon certain practices that otherwise threaten the security and stability of cyberspace. This context of distrust and power rivalries limits global cooperation and constitutes a rein on efforts to adopt the necessary regulation to ensure the security and stability of cyberspace in the face of a systemic risk -- and also questions the very notion of security in cyberspace.\nHow can we define a threat to national or international security in cyberspace? What does the ‘security of cyberspace' mean? These questions provoke debates and oppose a multiplicity of points of views among state and non-state protagonists. The notion of securitisation developed by Barry Buzan and Ole Wæver in the 1990s -- that is, the way in which a political actor seizes upon an object that he treats, in his speeches, as a security\nissue in order to justify the sometimes extraordinary means of defending it -- offers an interesting analytical framework in this context (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998). It brings a better understanding of the complexity of international discussions that involve multiple actors, starting with states, to define security in cyberspace, what is necessary to implement it, and the underlying political choices it implies.\nThis article explores the security dilemma faced by states when dealing with cyber issues and the ambivalence of the notion of security in cyberspace. It shows how, within a decade, cyberspace has become a battlefield and an absolute strategic priority for many states, leading them to view it as a geopolitical threat to their national security. Hence, they have endorsed its militarisation despite a progressive understanding of the systemic risk that results from the proliferation of offensive weapons and operations. This dilemma lies at the heart of the ongoing tensions in multilateral discussions on the regulation of cyberspace, in which non-state actors have invited themselves through a multitude of initiatives that demonstrate the importance of the stakes but also the difficulties in dealing with them.\n## The emergence of a new military domain\nThe representation of cyberspace as a new military domain emerged during the 2010s, the last step in the territorialisation of cyberspace by states in reaction to the multiplication of the strategic surprises they had faced there since the late 2000s. The territorialisation of cyberspace, which had been initiated by pioneers of the internet to represent the digital space and protect it from the geopolitical rivalries that prevailed in the physical world, became an imperative of securitisation quickly associated with its militarisation in the discourse of states (Desforges 2014; Dunn Cavelty 2008; Haddad 2018).\nThis association between cyberattacks and the militarisation of cyberspace was, however, not self-evident based on the growing challenges posed by the cybercrimes perpetrated by non-state actors against private and individual interests. And it could have become the focus of attention. Instead, states have built a representation of cyberspace first and foremost as a threat to their national security at the expense of other characterisation, such as a criminal danger, an economic risk or a threat to individual user security and privacy. (Dunn Cavelty 2012; Nissenbaum 2005). As a consequence, even though states have tackled the overall issues of cybersecurity and cybercrime, they have structured their strategies mostly under the umbrella of national security, primarily reinforced military means of action (both defensive and offensive) and subsequently designated enemies in cyberspace, an eminently political act (Rid and Buchanan 2015).\nThis militarisation of cyberspace can be partly explained by a deeper understanding of the internet and of digital technologies among defence protagonists, which allowed them to better foresee threats and publicise them. As they quickly allocated funds to this new field, they took part in defining state priorities on questions of national security. That said, it is the increasing number of state-sponsored attacks conducted for strategic reasons, together with the growing digitalisation of the battlefield, and the new opportunities arising from the association of digital operations with other traditional weapons, that led to the representation of cyberspace as a military battlefield. That representation has been predominant in Western democracies yet immediately contested by China\nand Russia, who have regularly denounced the risks of a militarisation of cyberspace, in which they have fully participated, however, according to the volume of cyberattacks officially attributed to them. Both countries had initially preferred the concept of informational space -- or information security -- to cyberspace, which reflects both their perception of the threat as being primarily informational and their priority of ensuring the stability of their political regimes (Goldsmith and Wu 2006; Limonier 2018). Their military doctrines have however considered this space as a strategic domain from the outset, even before Western countries. The most prominent cyber powers -- starting with the United States, France and the United Kingdom -- have since characterised cyberspace as the fifth military domain after land, sea, air and space. In turn, NATO recognised cyberspace as an operational military domain in 2016 (Ablon et al. 2019).\nThe pertinence of this representation has led to intense debates in the academic literature due to the specificities of cyberspace. Martin Libicki first denounced this label as inadequate to understand this hyper-dynamic environment in permanent and rapid reconfiguration, the plasticity of which requires constant adaptation and great agility (Libicki 2012). He noted that this development brought us back to classic concepts of warfare such as ‘control, manoeuvre, superiority' whereas control is illusory in cyberspace and armies don't manoeuvre in the same battlefield as their enemies. Indeed, the latter can reduce their vulnerabilities and limit the impact of an attack through measures of cyberdefence. Hence, the success of an attack in cyberspace partly depends on targets that evolve rapidly and dynamically.\nFurthermore, there is no academic consensus on the very notion of cyberwar, despite its large media and political echo. In his book Cyber War Will Not Take Place, Thomas Rid (2013, 37) stated that past operations couldn't be labelled warfare because an ‘act of war must be instrumental, political, and potentially lethal'. And even if a future cyberattack were to meet these criteria, the response would most likely not be confined to cyberspace but escalate into a kinetic conflict. Ultimately, these attacks were only more sophisticated versions -- involving malicious code -- of methods as old as war: espionage, sabotage and subversion. Even from the perspective of international law, the only operation that could have qualified as an act of war -- but wasn't declared one by the Iranian government -- was the Stuxnet attack against the nuclear centrifuges at Natanz in 2010. According to the New York Times, the attack was led by the United States with the help of Israeli intelligence services (Sanger 2012; Zetter 2014). To this day, no state has officially denounced an act of war in cyberspace.\nThe threshold of what is acceptable -- and accepted -- in terms of offensive operations also seems to be constantly pushed back, in view of the increasingly open hostilities conducted by states that push their advantage in cyberspace without necessarily triggering a forceful response. Current debates here suggest that it is a matter of time, more than a matter of threshold, before cyberwar reaches its cruising speed. But the reality is more complex. On the one hand, states show a certain restraint compared to their full capacity for action, which enables them to remain below the threshold for triggering an open conflict, despite testing this limit. On the other hand, the use of cyber operations is most often part of a combination of modes of action -- technical and non-technical, online and offline, direct and indirect, state and non-state -- which adds to the fog around (cyber)warfare, as it is not always clear where it starts and where it ends.\nHere, the only certainty is that cyber operations have now been integrated into the arsenal of the largest armies, supporting all the existing means used in the conduct of\nwar. But the clear risk of conflict escalation between nuclear powers have also led to constant and ambiguous confrontations between antagonist state actors into the grey zone, below the threshold of war -- a peacetime competition that opposes in particular Russia to Western democracies. As a result, cyberspace has become a new space of confrontation in the geopolitical power rivalries that oppose a multitude of actors, leading to the proliferation of operations -- the most sophisticated of which come from states -- and eventually to the materialisation of cyberwar.\n## The ‘materialisation of cyber war': a series of strategic surprises\nAccording to Robert Kaiser, the 2007 cyberattacks against Estonia were a catalyst for the ‘materialisation of cyber war' as a new policy object -- even though no attack has yet been said to reach the threshold of an armed attack and been qualified as an act of war -- that keeps influencing the way states perceive future threats of cyberwar (Kaiser 2015). These attacks occurred as protests proliferated among the Russian minority against the decision to move the statue of the Bronze Soldier in Tallinn. These DDOS attacks paralysed the websites of numerous organisations in the country, including banks, media outlets, ministries and the parliament. The following year, in July 2008, a wave of cyberattacks against Georgian websites preceded the arrival of Russian tanks in the country, the first known cyberattack combined with a land military operation. Despite their rudimentary nature, the public and spectacular dimension of these attacks forced states to come to term with them. Since then, cyberattacks have multiplied and, more importantly, they have become more targeted, sophisticated, creative and damaging, leading states to constantly adapt themselves to an evolving landscape of threats, marked by a succession of strategic surprises and a constant expansion of scope.\nIn 2010, Stuxnet became the first major attack against a critical infrastructure, in a joint attempt by the United States and Israel to halt the Iranian nuclear programme. In 2013, Edward Snowden's revelations disclosed that American espionage techniques could reach an unprecedented depth on an unsuspected scale thanks to the global interconnection of information and communication systems. Other countries -- including European states -- had to acknowledge their dependency on US digital platforms and technologies. The attacks that targeted the entertainment company Sony Pictures in 2014 took the American government completely by surprise: strategic attacks could also target large firms now. The 2015 attack against TV5 Monde in France reiterated that possibility.\nThen, in 2015, the Islamic State surprised everyone with its sophisticated use of social networks to distribute its propaganda, encourage online radicalisation, find new recruits, raise money, organise departures to Syria, and prepare terrorist attacks. It forced Western democracies, which had focused on technical attacks, to widen their approach to take informational operations into account as well. But it didn't prevent the American administration from being taken by surprise by the interferences attributed to Russia that occurred during the 2016 presidential campaign, for which they were evidently not prepared (François and Lin 2020). Operations of information manipulation interfering with, or destabilising, democratic countries are now under the spotlight.\nIn 2016, a long-feared scenario materialised when the servers of the company Dyn were attacked after its network of connected objects (cameras, printers ...) was manipulated, expanding the field of vulnerabilities and the vectors of attacks. Finally, the\nWannaCry and NotPetya attacks in 2017 inaugurated an era of massive propagating attacks, both swift and uncontrollable, and caused the greatest damage ever recorded by indiscriminately affecting dozens of companies and institutions in more than 150 countries that had not been initially targeted. It stressed the need to protect the systems but also to be able to react quickly to block a rapid contamination. This systemic risk is linked to the interconnection of digital networks.\nThese strategic surprises highlighted the vulnerability, and the unpreparedness, of states -- including the most advanced ones -- as they faced a ever-changing threat. They forcefully influenced the representation of cyberspace as a new military field that required the mobilisation of exceptional resources in the name of national security. This representation led to an institutional reorganisation: many countries created cybersecurity agencies and cybercommands within their armed forces to prepare their cyberdefence. It also encouraged the development of new offensive tools to be used for intelligence or surveillance, or during military operations. The inhibitions against such a dynamic arms race, during which countries strengthen their power, have paradoxically been loosened following Edward Snowden's revelations, as many states started claiming the development of offensive capabilities. For example, the cyber strategy of the Trump administration unambiguously endorsed the proliferation of offensive tools, as well as the penetration of digital systems to deter adversaries (Smeets 2020; Taillat 2020). In addition, the revelations spurred many countries in Europe and around the world into investing more in digital intelligence capabilities and boosting the commercial marketplace of digital surveillance technologies. The exportation of such technologies has, in some cases, permitted population surveillance by states that had not yet developed their own capabilities for the purpose of detecting and managing threats to the stability of their regime.\nHence, the ‘materialisation of cyber war' during the past decade has reinforced the securitization and militarisation of cyberspace that debuted during the 2000s. The notion of security remains ambiguous because, as noted by Dunn Cavelty (2012), the military conception of security can be associated with serious risks. The tools developed by the states to ensure their national security can increase the risks they are exposed to, especially in cyberspace as we will see later. They can also bring about insecurity in other domains of security -- economic, social or political (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998). Information and communication networks are shared by institutions, civil society and the economic and military spheres. Thus, cyberspace offers a multitude of complex interactions and interconnections between these areas where issues are overlapping. Hence, cyberspace is used by a multitude of actors for different ends, and their interests and representations of security may prove widely divergent. The debate over encryption illustrates the profound antagonisms generated by digital technologies between the different actors of security (Gasser et al. 2016), putting the proponents of encryption to protect states' and companies' secrets against the proponents of an access to data limited to the courts or the police, and even against the proponents of deeper protections for personal data and civil liberties (East West Institute 2018). Within a government, divergent conceptions of security can coexist and sometimes oppose each other, as different ministries and agencies implement different (sometimes contradictory) security objectives in cyberspace.\nLikewise, there is no uniform representation of cyberspace among states. On the contrary, it depends on the geopolitical context, the relationships between regional powers, on the level of development of the digital economy, on cyberdefence capabilities, and on\ntheir strategic culture. Besides, representations are shaped by imbalances in commanding technologies, infrastructures, data flows, or on the ability to act in the digital space. For instance, cyberspace is first and foremost an issue of connectivity and economic development in many African countries, but also a territory where cybercrime needs to be fought. Among authoritarian regimes, the informational dimension of cyberspace is seen as the main threat against political stability, as it opens a space for the expression of dissident opinions, the propagation of rumours and the risk of subversion.\nBut the military representation of cyberspace predominates in large Western countries that have advanced capabilities and a central role in international negotiations. They also influence political decision-makers at the expense of other approaches to risks that could better take into account the security of private actors and individual users. Finally, this militarisation of cyberspace also invites risks of which states are progressively growing aware, but they face a security dilemma.\n## Geopolitical risk v. systemic risk: states' security dilemma\nStates have become aware of the risks of proliferation as tools they have developed are used against them. In the digital sphere, offensive tools can be stolen, copied, retrieved, analysed, transformed, reused and repurposed, as the examples of the Shadow Brokers or Vault 7 have shown (Buchanan 2020). New offensive concepts and tactics can be imitated and re-employed. In other words, cyberattacks are liable to teach lessons and to improve the capabilities of their adversaries. A classified NSA document from 2013 divulged by Edward Snowden and published in The Intercept in 2015 confirmed what many had feared before: the Iranian regime learned from the cyberattacks it had suffered and it used this knowledge to improve its own capabilities (Zetter 2014). The report specified that Iran probably imitated the offensive techniques of an attack against its oil industry to launch the Shamoon attack against Saudi Aramco in 2012 which sabotaged 30,000 computers in one stroke. Hence, proliferation leads to improved skills among actors, including adversaries and criminals, and directly participates in the heightened sophistication of attacks and in the threats against the whole digital environment.\nFurthermore, because technologies and networks are shared by armies, private actors, institutions and civil society, these attacks are liable to propagate quickly, and sometimes uncontrollably. The risk of uncontrollable collateral damage is a serious hindrance to the work of armies in the digital space; for instance, the notion of a ‘surgical' attack appears to be a contradiction in terms, as the interactions and interconnections between the systems and their points of vulnerability are difficult to anticipate on this territory. The Stuxnet virus, specifically conceived for the Natanz nuclear infrastructure as it wasn't connected to the internet, did propagate through cyberspace, probably though a USB key. Although Stuxnet did not unleash its payload on third-party victims' computers, part of its code was later reused in other cyberattacks, hence demonstrating that highly targeted code is no guarantee against proliferation.\nThe WannaCry and NotPetya attacks were emblematic of the systemic risk posed by the proliferation of cyberweapons in our societies. These attacks were rapidly and uncontrollably propagated throughout the world, targeting hospitals and causing hundreds of millions of euros' worth of damage for companies that weren't initially targeted. In May 2017, the ransomware WannaCry infected more than 200,000 computers in 150 countries until\nthe discovery of a kill switch stopped it. Subsequent investigations brought the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia to dismiss the possibility of a criminal endeavour and they attributed the attack to North Korea. The NotPetya attack, which initially resembled a ransomware attack, was entirely conceived to sabotage systems. The White House estimated that this sole attack cost $10 billion, the most devastating ever, and it was attributed to Russia, first by the United Kingdom, and then by the other Five Eyes countries. These two attacks used EternalBlue, an offensive tool that took advantage of a Microsoft vulnerability and was developed by the NSA. This tool was stolen from the NSA, made publicly available online, and later used by other actors to launch attacks that propagated uncontrollably and hit the very country that created this offensive tool.\nThese attacks thus demonstrated the security dilemma faced by states regarding offensive operations in cyberspace (Segal ; Buchanan) and which pit two non-exclusive (but coexisting) representations of cyber risk against each other, leading to complex tensions and sometimes irreconcilable objectives between and within governments.\nOn the one hand, the states see a cyberthreat as systemic: an extremely complex, cross-border risk, not necessarily of state origin, which, like pandemics, can spread very rapidly, be very difficult to stop and cause massive damage. It is therefore in the interest of all actors to stop contagions that could have disastrous consequences. This approach to risks calls for enhanced cooperation between governments -- but also within governments and between private and public actors -- and arms control, in the common interest of system stability.\nOn the other hand, a cyberthreat is primarily a geopolitical threat for states because the offensive tools are used by their adversaries but also by their allies and economic rivals to increase their power through espionage, influence, or even military operations. Focusing on this risk takes states in the opposite direction: enhancing their offensive arsenal, limiting cooperation and protecting their sovereign capabilities. This approach clearly dominates the representations of states with the most advanced capabilities, as seen in the ongoing race for cyberweapons and in the offensive doctrines they have developed recently (Buchanan).\nThe dominant representation of the geopolitical risk is a source of distrust among states and it encourages them to reinforce their ‘territorial' control over cyberspace as well as their sovereign capabilities. It limits their ability to come to an agreement on the modalities for regulating states' behaviour in cyberspace and interpreting international law. It also explains why international discussions exclude a central issue linked to the offensive practices of states: espionage. That said, the search for an equilibrium between the two approaches is at the heart of the international intergovernmental discussions on the regulation of cyberspace as states start to acknowledge their own vulnerability in the face of systemic risk.\n## Diplomats launched an attack on the ‘digital far west'\nFor years, the most advanced states took advantage of the opacity of the digital space to discretely conduct offensive operations with impunity. But with the materialisation of cyber-war and the multiplication of large-scale attacks that targeted them, states have progressively acknowledged the risks they are exposed to -- and which are now becoming systemic.\nFirst, the technology is both more widely accessible and less expensive, making it available to a larger number of state and non-state actors, all increasingly enterprising and creative in how they use it. The 2010s were marked by a diversification of targets -- strategic attacks against private companies -- of actors involved, with sometimes blurry relations to state authorities, and of the operating modes as attackers are only limited by their imagination in hijacking digital technologies. Threats are more pressing, complex, protean and unpredictable.\nIn fact, the digital transformation of societies makes them increasingly dependent on cyberspace, the stability of which is now essential to their proper functioning. But the multiplication of badly-secured connected objects, the embedded computing in medical devices, vehicles and even in military armament, constantly expands the space that can be targeted. In other words, the more connected and dependent on data a society is, the more points of vulnerability there are. The rise of quantum computing -- which promises to revolutionise encryption by increasing computing power -- and of artificial intelligence suggests sophisticated and potentially destabilising attacks, even though these technologies could also be used to improve cybersecurity.\nStates are thus faced with the same type of dilemma as when they became aware of the dangers of nuclear power. Except that digital technology is within the reach of many actors (not only states), it is easier to steal and reuse than a nuclear missile, and it is by nature dual-use and ubiquitous, which makes controlling the possession of offensive tools and organising verification impossible. It therefore requires a totally different approach to counter-proliferation. But because it can turn against the states that develop it, at the risk of threatening international security and the very stability of cyberspace, it raises the question of systemic risk, which was at the heart of the balance of terror doctrine. This risk led states, at the end of the 1990s, to initiate discussions on the regulation of cyberspace which, after years of stalemate (Maurer 2011) and the change of posture of the United States in favour of multilateralism under the Obama administration (Douzet and Géry 2020), have led to significant progress.\nAfter the first resolution introduced by Russia in 1998, the General Assembly of the United Nations created a group of governmental experts (GGE) to begin discussions on information and communication technologies (ICTs). Only 15 states were initially represented, including the five permanent members of the Security Council -- due to the format chosen but also to the limited number of countries with competences in the field. Overall, 5 GGEs were successively convened and, when membership was progressively widened, it remained rather limited (25 states in 2016--2017). Only three GGEs agreed on a report -- in 2010 (A/65/201), 2013 (A/68/98) and 2015 (A/74/170) -- as the others couldn't reach a consensus.\nThe content of these three reports illustrates the progressive acknowledgment by states of their own vulnerabilities and of the existence of a systemic risk, on the one hand, and the domination of the geopolitical risk on the systemic risk on the other hand. All of this limits progress in regulating the digital space. It is necessary to note that these reports were only recommendations to the General Assembly and not binding instruments creating obligations for states. They shared a willingness to commit themselves politically without being legally constrained and, as such, acknowledged a need to identify limits to preserve the security and stability of cyberspace.\nIn the 2010 report, states recognised that ‘The global network of ICTs [communication and information technologies] has become an arena for disruptive activity' [para. 4] in which different actors intervene. They recommended reinforcing the cybersecurity capabilities of states, implementing confidence-building measures and a ‘[f]urther dialogue among States to discuss norms pertaining to State use of ICTs, to reduce collective risk and protect critical national and international infrastructure' (para. 18i).\nIn 2013, states recognised for the first time, in an international document, that international law applies to cyberspace: ‘International law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment' (GGE Report 2013, para. 19). This strengthened the territorialisation of digital space, further affirmed in the following paragraph: ‘State sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to State conduct of ICT-related activities, and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory' (ibid, para. 20). The recognition of the applicability of international law in cyberspace led to the delimitation of states' rights and obligations related to cyberoperations because states were now proscribed from conducting operations contrary to their international obligations. For example, they are not allowed to conduct cyberoperations that intervene in the internal affairs of another state; they would otherwise be in violation of the principle of non-intervention (Delerue 2020).\nThis decision also reflected the willingness of states to inscribe their behaviour in the international legal order. The digital space is therefore no longer a ‘digital Wild West' in which only the law of the strongest dominates, at least in theory. There are rules that derive from international law, but the question is how they should be applied or, in other words, what the rights and duties of states ought to be. But interpreting international law in such a new, complex and dynamic environment poses serious difficulties. For that reason, the member countries of the third GGE recommended the elaboration of ‘norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour by States' to reduce the risks threatening the security and stability of cyberspace. These norms, which are derived from international law according to the report, set out principles or good practices to guide the behaviour of states. The mission entrusted to the fourth GGE, created shortly after the publication of the 2013 report, and which met in 2014 and 2015, was to further develop these norms.\nHowever, this apparent UN consensus hides profound disagreements on the modalities of the regulation of cyberspace, based on the representation of the geopolitical risk, and they can be surmised from the 2015 report. Reading the table of contents, we see the first cracks in the consensus between the states. Indeed, the report includes six parts, the third and sixth respectively dealing with the norms of responsible behaviour of states and international law. Contrary to the 2013 report, a strict separation -- at least in appearance -- is established between the norms and rules of international law. As such, the report highlighted an opposition among states on the necessity to elaborate (or not) new rules of international law to ensure the security of the digital space. On one side, some countries, including the United States, believe that existing international law is enough to regulate behaviour and they demand political commitments instead, via non-binding norms, to translate the expectations of the international community and enable a better predictability of states' behaviour. These norms could be built on existing\nobligations but without creating new international obligations. On the other side, some states -- such as Russia -- display a more legalist approach to international law and believe that existing law isn't enough to regulate the behaviour of states in cyberspace because of its specificities. New rules, and binding new rights and obligations, are necessary to complete international law, via a treaty (Delerue and Géry 2017). But, by separating norms from questions of international law, the report gives the impression that norms are autonomous and that their implementation isn't dependent on existing obligations set in international law.\nUnderlying this position is the belief that international law is sufficient and does not need to be clarified. And mentioning the purpose and the value of the norms limits their scope: they are non-binding and serve as a standard of measurement to assess the behaviour of states, but are not intended to limit the rights of states (2015 GGE Report, para. 10). They are purely declaratory as they need to be specified to be implemented. Furthermore, the part dedicated to international law only reiterates, to a large extent, what was already written in the 2013 report. Conversely, separating the norms can be interpreted either as a need for new rules or states' willingness to limit their commitment (this is the way Russia interprets it). These two interpretations coexist and highlight the difficult elaboration of a consensus among states (Delerue, Douzet, and Géry 2020).\nThat said, the report did bring notable progress. Indeed, states came to an agreement on a series of non-binding norms to reduce the risks to global peace, security and stability. They forbade cyberoperations causing intentional damage to vital infrastructure and attacks on computer emergency response teams (CERTs). States shouldn't purposely authorise malicious cyberoperations organised from their territory, either. They committed themselves to notifying vulnerabilities in a responsible manner, but also to combating the proliferation of malicious computer technologies and tools, to exchanging information, to providing mutual assistance, and to implementing measures recommended by the General Assembly for the protection of critical infrastructures.\nThe adoption of these norms shows a common willingness to ensure the security and stability of the digital space. But it remains the product of a compromise between states and, more importantly, of the search for an equilibrium to limit systemic risk while continuing to use the digital space for offensive purposes, a realistic principle with regard to the current geopolitical context (Lewis 2018). The numerous caveats in the formulation of the recommendations, such as the use of the conditional (states should, should not) or the ambiguity in the formulation of proscribed cyberoperations all testify to this balancing act. Hence, the cyberoperations against vitally important infrastructures are not proscribed, but the ones contrary to international law and causing ‘intentional damages' against the infrastructures are.\nThe General Assembly of the United Nations hoped to pursue the discussions with a fifth GGE. But the negotiations failed in 2016--2017 in the face of profound disagreements on international law and its interpretation. The communiqués and statements of the United States, Cuba and Russia highlighted apparent doubts on the applicability of certain clauses of international law (self-defence, law of international responsibility, international humanitarian law) and, more importantly, profound dissensions on the interpretation of these branches of law. They could partly be explained by the particularly tense geopolitical context, marked by the affirmation of state power in cyberspace: accusations\nof Russian interferences in the American presidential elections, rising informational threats, trade tensions between China and the United States that focused on digital technologies, cyberattacks with systemic propagation, and the beginning of public attributions and retaliating threats. In this context, some states -- notably China -- questioned the scope and potential consequences of their legal commitments. From the outset, this geopolitical context foreshadowed the reluctance of states to agree on progress in the regulation of the digital space. This risk is all the greater because, apart from confidence-building measures and capacity-building, the discussions on international law and norms need to go into a level of detail that could further limit the behaviour of states. Hence, the geopolitical risk brought the negotiations on security and stability in the digital space to a stalemate. As a consequence, non-state actors confronted with systemic risk sought to become directly involved in these discussions through various new initiatives.\n## Much ado about nothing?\nOn 14 February 2017, Brad Smith, the President of Microsoft, called to convene a Digital Geneva Convention. Drawing from the 1949 Geneva Conventions, he invited states to protect infrastructures and citizens from computer attacks in times of peace. He also called for the creation of an international organisation modelled on the International Atomic Energy Agency to handle the attribution of cyberoperations. Meanwhile, during the Munich Security Conference, the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) debuted its work. This independent commission of 28 international experts from the private sector, academia, the technical community and NGOs was created by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the support of prominent companies and several states. It was tasked with offering new norms of responsible behaviour to maintain security and stability in the digital space, which is the objective of its final report presented at the Paris Peace Forum in November 2019. Between 2017 and 2019, these private (Microsoft) and multi-stakeholder (GCSC) settings played an important role in discussions on the security and stability of the digital space. They first maintained these questions on the global agenda through more or less formal contacts between states and international organisations when uncertainty prevailed over the future of international negotiations. They then launched initiatives and elaborated proposals to regulate the digital space. The GCSC listed eight norms of responsible behaviour, several of which were integrated in the Paris Call in November 2018 and in the Cybersecurity Act adopted in May 2019 by the European Union. Other initiatives emerged, such as private commitments (Charter of Trust by Siemens, Cybersecurity Tech Accord by Microsoft) and new NGOs (Cyber Peace Institute).\nAll these initiatives were symptomatic of a willingness among private actors and civil society to get involved in the discussions on a domain of sovereignty and to try to impose the multi-stakeholder model -- long limited to the governance of other aspects of the internet -- on matters of international security. These actors are historically legitimate, technically competent, and they have the necessary resources to ensure the stability and security of cyberspace. The internet was conceived by academic actors and then developed and commercialised by private actors who own most of the infrastructures. Global companies have superior technical capabilities, data and resources compared to\nthose of states and they are often the first to detect attacks and to offer a response. They have become essential partners to ensure the security of states.\nActors from the business and academic sectors, the technical community and civil society are heavily involved in the governance of the internet and their expertise can prove essential due to the technicity of the issues (Ríos Rodríguez 2010), as shown by the Wassenaar Arrangement. The implementation of this agreement regulating the exports of dual-use technologies was limited by its weak definition. Above all, these actors can help push states beyond some of the bottlenecks that limit the development and scope of norms because they have a common interest in the stability of cyberspace and in high user confidence.\nThe culmination of this logic lies in the creation, at the end of 2019, by Microsoft, MasterCard and the Hewlett Foundation, of the Cyber Peace Institute which, without having official attribution power, has an accountability function to evaluate states' respect of international law and of the norms of good behaviour. Similarly, the designation by Microsoft, in January 2020, of a representative for UN-related questions illustrated the company's willingness to directly weigh in into international discussions.\nHowever, these initiatives are limited by the reluctance of many states to leave non-state actors to get involved in the definition of states' rights, obligations and responsibilities. Although they recognise the importance of the multi-stakeholder model of internet governance and the need to closely involve the private sector and civil society in initiatives to promote the security and stability of cyberspace, they defend the exclusive dimension of some of their prerogatives. The role of non-state actors in the security and stability of cyberspace was recognised in 2013 and 2015 by the member states of the GGE, but they nevertheless reasserted their primary responsibility in this area. On the one hand, non-state actors, unless they have a specially granted title, are not allowed to participate in these discussions, because they are not subjects of international law. On the other hand, the representation of cyberspace as a field of confrontation and as an object of national security makes it the sole prerogative of states and limits the willingness of states to involve non-state actors in the discussions.\nIn any case, the input of non-state actors in international discussions has increasingly been recognised globally, even though disparities exist between states. Moreover, states are taking part in many multi-stakeholder forums dealing with issues of security and stability in cyberspace, which are being debated at the Internet Governance Forum, ICANN, but also in diplomatic dialogues and more specific initiatives (London Process, Raisina Dialogue, Sino-European Cyber Dialogue, US--China Cyber Dialogue, Canada--EU Cyber Dialogue and so on). They seek to advance ideas and build consensus outside multilateral processes in order to facilitate international discussions and/or create a balance of power by rallying states and organisations to their positions beforehand (Ruhl et al. 2020). This recognition of the role played by non-state actors is best illustrated by the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace initiated by France and largely promoted by Microsoft. The Paris Call -- not endorsed by the United States, China or Russia -- testifies to the signatories' public commitment to ensuring the security and stability of cyberspace globally.\nIt was not until a little over a year after the failure of the UN negotiations that new proposals emerged. And the way discussions resumed was emblematic of the tensions between two apprehensions of the risks in a deteriorated geopolitical context. Indeed,\ntwo processes (an open-ended working group and a group of governmental experts) actually debuted almost simultaneously in the autumn of 2019, one led by Russia, the other by the United States, with largely overlapping mandates. In October 2018, Russia introduced a new resolution on ICTs in the context of international security, listing several norms of behaviour and proposing to convene an open-ended working group (OEWG), i.e. a negotiation setting open to all UN member states. The First Commission at the UN was then the theatre of a sharp confrontation between the supporters of the Russian proposal and Western states which, in reaction, proposed their own draft resolution, offering another GGE restricted to 25 states. Despite important modifications on the Russian project, the United States -- followed by the European Union -- didn't withdraw its draft, leading to the adoption of two resolutions, amidst heightened tensions, by the General Assembly on 5 and 22 December 2018 (A/RES/73/27 and A/RES/73/266). A large majority of states voted in favour of the two resolutions which nevertheless reflected a deep divide between the major powers, both on their objectives and on the means of achieving them. Indeed, Russia hasn't renounced its original objective, stated in 1998, of a treaty to underpin the negotiations in the working group.\nInterestingly, the working group shepherded by Russia is the one consulting non-state actors (companies, NGOs ...), some of which (but not all) also demand a treaty. On the contrary, the GGE only consults regional state organisations. This fracture was accentuated in December 2019 when the General Assembly adopted a new Russian-led resolution (A/RES/74/247) that created a new negotiation process responsible for elaborating a treaty on cybercrime. Western countries are strongly opposed to it because they believe that the 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, open for signature to states not belonging to the Council of Europe, and already ratified by 64 states, should be universalised instead.\nThese two negotiation processes have been produced by major geopolitical tensions, in a context in which the United States is being offensive while denouncing, with several of their global partners, Russian and Chinese cyberoperations. For their part, countries such as Russia and China -- even though they have adopted different strategies (Broeders, Adamson, and Creemers 2019) -- fully take advantage of the offensive potentialities offered by networks while they call for limits on the militarisation of the digital space. Europe, for its part, seeks to offer a third path, but with limited opposition to the United States, which remains its main ally. That said, Europe is plagued by its own dissensions.\nTo many observers' surprise, the OEWG adopted its final report on 12 March 2021, demonstrating that despite the context of strategic competition exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic, states were still able to achieve consensus. The report consolidates the achievements of the previous GGEs, encourages more transparency in the implementation of the recommendations of the 2015 GGE report and promotes the pursuit of international negotiations. It also shows some progress, such as the recognition of health infrastructures as critical infrastructures that need to be protected, along with the integrity and the general availability of the internet. However, many contentious points persist as revealed by the Chair's summary, published with the report, that contains most of the state propositions that were not adopted by the OEWG, short of a consensus between states.\nIn addition, states rushed to launch the next round of international negotiations even before the two processes had finalised their respective reports. France proposed a\nprogramme of action within the OEWG to merge the two processes into a single one that could provide incremental progress as opposed to requiring a final consensus report. But Russia and its allies sponsored a UNGA resolution launching a new OEWG in October 2020. The same day, the United States and its allies sponsored another resolution, that acknowledges the ongoing negotiations, leaving the door open for further negotiations as the GGE is scheduled to achieve its report in May 2021. Both resolutions were adopted by the UNGA in December 2020. In addition to the OEWG being renewed, the GGE could potentially be continued and a new programme of action created depending on what states propose at the UNGA's 76th session, starting in October 2021.\nThe landscape of international negotiations is thus becoming particularly crowded and even confused, with a multiplication of actors, initiatives and proposals aimed at promoting peace and stability in cyberspace. It risks leading to inconsistencies or ambiguities that would leave room for states to pursue their hijinks with relative impunity, even if the two groups' chairs have worked together to reach a consensus and limit contradictions. However, this proliferation is creating a dynamic that is making it possible for states and all actors to become more aware of the risks and challenges associated with the proliferation of cyberweapons. But it is also part of a geopolitical context that is particularly conducive to an arms race.\n## Conclusion\nCyberspace has thus become a field of confrontations between states during the 2010s, to the point of becoming a military domain in its own right for many of them, which have engaged in a cyberweapons race. The proliferation of cyber operations and offensive tools has contributed to increasing the scope and sophistication of the threat they face in the digital space. The tools and attack concepts they have developed have escaped them and are increasingly turned against them, the vulnerabilities they exploit in adversary systems also affect the systems of their own companies and institutions, which can become strategic targets. Last but not least, the uncontrolled spread of certain attacks has had devastating consequences that raise important ethical, legal and economic liability issues but also awareness of the systemic risk that proliferation poses to the security and stability of cyberspace.\nFor these reasons, and despite a notably tense geopolitical context, states have chosen to resume international discussions on security and stability in cyberspace, and have taken part in multiple initiatives with private actors and civil society to try to contain the threat. And yet, we cannot but note that the representation of cyberthreat as a geopolitical risk continues to predominate over the representation of systemic risk, leading some states room for offensive operations, in order to ensure their own power in cyberspace, which they see as a condition for their security.\nAt the time of writing, negotiations are still ongoing at the UN, and it is difficult to predict their outcome. In the end, it will depend on what states perceive as their primary interest: to curb systemic threat or to continue waging wars. Whatever the outcome of the negotiations, systemic risk will necessarily remain high because of the divergent strategic interests among states and because the exploitation of a network vulnerability by one actor for a specific purpose is in fact exploited by all and for multiple purposes. It also shows that, whatever the initiatives and propositions made, cyberspace\nJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY\n#\nremains, first and foremost, used to wage war, and its regulation remains the product of the 'external legal policies' (Ladreit de Lacharrière 1983) of states, thus ultimately a byproduct of the defence of their respective interests."

But the advantages of the digital revolution are now threatened by the use of cyberspace for war purposes. This article explores the states' security dilemma as they face cyber challenges and the ambivalence of the notion of security in cyberspace. It highlights how, in ten years, cyberspace has become a battlefield and a strategic priority for many states that have represented it as a geopolitical threat for their national security, hence justifying its progressive militarisation. Meanwhile, they have become cognizant to the systemic risk of proliferation of offensive cybertools and cyber-operations. This security dilemma – one that opposes a representation of cyber threats as a geopolitical risk to that of cyberspace as a systemic risk – is at the heart of the multilateral negotiations on the regulation of cyberspace. There, a multiplicity of non-state actors has forced their way to the table through a multitude of initiatives that emphasize the importance of the challenges at stake and how difficult it will be for the states to face them.\n## ARTICLE HISTORY\nReceived 28 February 2021\nRevised 23 March 2021\nAccepted 15 April 2021\n## KEYWORDS\nCyberspace; cyberwar; proliferation; security; stability\n## Introduction\nOn 12 November 2018, in the midst of the Paris Peace Forum that brought together nearly 70 heads of state and government to commemorate the centenary of the 1918 armistice, the French president Emmanuel Macron launched the 'Paris Call for trust and security in cyberspace' during a meeting with actors of internet governance at UNESCO headquarters.¹ His vibrant plea, now endorsed by more than 1,000 signatories – including 77 states – highlighted common principles to maintain peace, security and stability in cyberspace. In April 2018, UNESCO had previously hosted a symposium convened by the National Cybersecurity Agency of France (ANSSI) and the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs entitled 'Building international peace and security in the digital society'. These initiatives were in line with the numerous others that have been carried out globally by governments, civil society and major digital companies since the early 2010s. Interestingly, Russia was the first state to propose, as early as 1998, a resolution\nCONTACT Frédérick Douzet fdouzet@gmail.com\n© 2021 The Author(s).

As the strongest advocate for an international treaty on cyberspace, Russia has since sponsored a resolution almost every year, while other international dialogues and processes have progressively been established. How can we explain such activism? Very simply because cyberspace is used -- first and foremost -- to wage wars.\nBeyond a pleasant homage to its author, the analogy to Yves Lacoste's seminal work La géographie, ça sert, d'abord, à faire la guerre (1976), is justified by the apparent explosion of conflict in cyberspace, which has become a new vector for geopolitical rivalries and even a new military field in the strategies and doctrines of many nations. It has also increasingly been militarised -- a set of social, political and economic processes have made a military approach to solving cyber problems more acceptable (Rech et al. 2014) -- with the proliferation of weapons and threats that now structure its evolution and regulation. Obviously, cyberspace wasn't invented to wage wars and isn't only used for that (Douzet and Desforges 2018). We can even say that the attacks conducted until today have remained below the threshold of war according to international law. However, setting severity thresholds has been made more difficult by the boldness and provocations of the most enterprising protagonists (Forteau 2019). Cyberspace has altogether revolutionised our modes of life, disrupted our economies, and enabled important progress in our societies. But the benefits brought by the digital revolution are now threatened by a sharp increase in the number and sophistication of malicious acts in cyberspace.\nFirst, the use of cyberspace for offensive purposes, by states and a diverse array of other actors, entails the risk of conflict escalation and of a destabilisation of our societies that, in turn, threatens international peace and security. Evidently, the catastrophic scenarios of ‘digital Pearl Harbors' or massive deadly attacks on vital infrastructures, which were popular worries in the early 2010s, haven't materialised. But several attacks have been uncontrollably propagated throughout the world, highlighting the potentially devastating threat of conflict in cyberspace and the systemic risks it entails. The proliferation of cyberweapons -- i.e. malicious tools to conduct cyberattacks -- threatens the stability of cyberspace, on which our societies have grown increasingly dependent, because its underlying infrastructures are constantly targeted. Cyberspace is also increasingly used to conduct digital influence and subversion operations. However, in most cases, the weaponization of information does not involve cyberattacks that could contribute to the proliferation of cyberweapons.\nSecond, in an unstable geopolitical context marked by a persistent terrorist threat, weakened multilateral institutions and the evident return of a strategic competition between large powers, states hold onto their ability to act and aren't ready to abandon certain practices that otherwise threaten the security and stability of cyberspace. This context of distrust and power rivalries limits global cooperation and constitutes a rein on efforts to adopt the necessary regulation to ensure the security and stability of cyberspace in the face of a systemic risk -- and also questions the very notion of security in cyberspace.\nHow can we define a threat to national or international security in cyberspace? What does the ‘security of cyberspace' mean? These questions provoke debates and oppose a multiplicity of points of views among state and non-state protagonists. The notion of securitisation developed by Barry Buzan and Ole Wæver in the 1990s -- that is, the way in which a political actor seizes upon an object that he treats, in his speeches, as a security\nissue in order to justify the sometimes extraordinary means of defending it -- offers an interesting analytical framework in this context (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998). It brings a better understanding of the complexity of international discussions that involve multiple actors, starting with states, to define security in cyberspace, what is necessary to implement it, and the underlying political choices it implies.\nThis article explores the security dilemma faced by states when dealing with cyber issues and the ambivalence of the notion of security in cyberspace. It shows how, within a decade, cyberspace has become a battlefield and an absolute strategic priority for many states, leading them to view it as a geopolitical threat to their national security. Hence, they have endorsed its militarisation despite a progressive understanding of the systemic risk that results from the proliferation of offensive weapons and operations. This dilemma lies at the heart of the ongoing tensions in multilateral discussions on the regulation of cyberspace, in which non-state actors have invited themselves through a multitude of initiatives that demonstrate the importance of the stakes but also the difficulties in dealing with them.\n## The emergence of a new military domain\nThe representation of cyberspace as a new military domain emerged during the 2010s, the last step in the territorialisation of cyberspace by states in reaction to the multiplication of the strategic surprises they had faced there since the late 2000s. The territorialisation of cyberspace, which had been initiated by pioneers of the internet to represent the digital space and protect it from the geopolitical rivalries that prevailed in the physical world, became an imperative of securitisation quickly associated with its militarisation in the discourse of states (Desforges 2014; Dunn Cavelty 2008; Haddad 2018).\nThis association between cyberattacks and the militarisation of cyberspace was, however, not self-evident based on the growing challenges posed by the cybercrimes perpetrated by non-state actors against private and individual interests. And it could have become the focus of attention. Instead, states have built a representation of cyberspace first and foremost as a threat to their national security at the expense of other characterisation, such as a criminal danger, an economic risk or a threat to individual user security and privacy. (Dunn Cavelty 2012; Nissenbaum 2005). As a consequence, even though states have tackled the overall issues of cybersecurity and cybercrime, they have structured their strategies mostly under the umbrella of national security, primarily reinforced military means of action (both defensive and offensive) and subsequently designated enemies in cyberspace, an eminently political act (Rid and Buchanan 2015).\nThis militarisation of cyberspace can be partly explained by a deeper understanding of the internet and of digital technologies among defence protagonists, which allowed them to better foresee threats and publicise them. As they quickly allocated funds to this new field, they took part in defining state priorities on questions of national security. That said, it is the increasing number of state-sponsored attacks conducted for strategic reasons, together with the growing digitalisation of the battlefield, and the new opportunities arising from the association of digital operations with other traditional weapons, that led to the representation of cyberspace as a military battlefield. That representation has been predominant in Western democracies yet immediately contested by China\nand Russia, who have regularly denounced the risks of a militarisation of cyberspace, in which they have fully participated, however, according to the volume of cyberattacks officially attributed to them. Both countries had initially preferred the concept of informational space -- or information security -- to cyberspace, which reflects both their perception of the threat as being primarily informational and their priority of ensuring the stability of their political regimes (Goldsmith and Wu 2006; Limonier 2018). Their military doctrines have however considered this space as a strategic domain from the outset, even before Western countries. The most prominent cyber powers -- starting with the United States, France and the United Kingdom -- have since characterised cyberspace as the fifth military domain after land, sea, air and space. In turn, NATO recognised cyberspace as an operational military domain in 2016 (Ablon et al. 2019).\nThe pertinence of this representation has led to intense debates in the academic literature due to the specificities of cyberspace. Martin Libicki first denounced this label as inadequate to understand this hyper-dynamic environment in permanent and rapid reconfiguration, the plasticity of which requires constant adaptation and great agility (Libicki 2012). He noted that this development brought us back to classic concepts of warfare such as ‘control, manoeuvre, superiority' whereas control is illusory in cyberspace and armies don't manoeuvre in the same battlefield as their enemies. Indeed, the latter can reduce their vulnerabilities and limit the impact of an attack through measures of cyberdefence. Hence, the success of an attack in cyberspace partly depends on targets that evolve rapidly and dynamically.\nFurthermore, there is no academic consensus on the very notion of cyberwar, despite its large media and political echo. In his book Cyber War Will Not Take Place, Thomas Rid (2013, 37) stated that past operations couldn't be labelled warfare because an ‘act of war must be instrumental, political, and potentially lethal'. And even if a future cyberattack were to meet these criteria, the response would most likely not be confined to cyberspace but escalate into a kinetic conflict. Ultimately, these attacks were only more sophisticated versions -- involving malicious code -- of methods as old as war: espionage, sabotage and subversion. Even from the perspective of international law, the only operation that could have qualified as an act of war -- but wasn't declared one by the Iranian government -- was the Stuxnet attack against the nuclear centrifuges at Natanz in 2010. According to the New York Times, the attack was led by the United States with the help of Israeli intelligence services (Sanger 2012; Zetter 2014). To this day, no state has officially denounced an act of war in cyberspace.\nThe threshold of what is acceptable -- and accepted -- in terms of offensive operations also seems to be constantly pushed back, in view of the increasingly open hostilities conducted by states that push their advantage in cyberspace without necessarily triggering a forceful response. Current debates here suggest that it is a matter of time, more than a matter of threshold, before cyberwar reaches its cruising speed. But the reality is more complex. On the one hand, states show a certain restraint compared to their full capacity for action, which enables them to remain below the threshold for triggering an open conflict, despite testing this limit. On the other hand, the use of cyber operations is most often part of a combination of modes of action -- technical and non-technical, online and offline, direct and indirect, state and non-state -- which adds to the fog around (cyber)warfare, as it is not always clear where it starts and where it ends.\nHere, the only certainty is that cyber operations have now been integrated into the arsenal of the largest armies, supporting all the existing means used in the conduct of\nwar. But the clear risk of conflict escalation between nuclear powers have also led to constant and ambiguous confrontations between antagonist state actors into the grey zone, below the threshold of war -- a peacetime competition that opposes in particular Russia to Western democracies. As a result, cyberspace has become a new space of confrontation in the geopolitical power rivalries that oppose a multitude of actors, leading to the proliferation of operations -- the most sophisticated of which come from states -- and eventually to the materialisation of cyberwar.\n## The ‘materialisation of cyber war': a series of strategic surprises\nAccording to Robert Kaiser, the 2007 cyberattacks against Estonia were a catalyst for the ‘materialisation of cyber war' as a new policy object -- even though no attack has yet been said to reach the threshold of an armed attack and been qualified as an act of war -- that keeps influencing the way states perceive future threats of cyberwar (Kaiser 2015). These attacks occurred as protests proliferated among the Russian minority against the decision to move the statue of the Bronze Soldier in Tallinn. These DDOS attacks paralysed the websites of numerous organisations in the country, including banks, media outlets, ministries and the parliament. The following year, in July 2008, a wave of cyberattacks against Georgian websites preceded the arrival of Russian tanks in the country, the first known cyberattack combined with a land military operation. Despite their rudimentary nature, the public and spectacular dimension of these attacks forced states to come to term with them. Since then, cyberattacks have multiplied and, more importantly, they have become more targeted, sophisticated, creative and damaging, leading states to constantly adapt themselves to an evolving landscape of threats, marked by a succession of strategic surprises and a constant expansion of scope.\nIn 2010, Stuxnet became the first major attack against a critical infrastructure, in a joint attempt by the United States and Israel to halt the Iranian nuclear programme. In 2013, Edward Snowden's revelations disclosed that American espionage techniques could reach an unprecedented depth on an unsuspected scale thanks to the global interconnection of information and communication systems. Other countries -- including European states -- had to acknowledge their dependency on US digital platforms and technologies. The attacks that targeted the entertainment company Sony Pictures in 2014 took the American government completely by surprise: strategic attacks could also target large firms now. The 2015 attack against TV5 Monde in France reiterated that possibility.\nThen, in 2015, the Islamic State surprised everyone with its sophisticated use of social networks to distribute its propaganda, encourage online radicalisation, find new recruits, raise money, organise departures to Syria, and prepare terrorist attacks. It forced Western democracies, which had focused on technical attacks, to widen their approach to take informational operations into account as well. But it didn't prevent the American administration from being taken by surprise by the interferences attributed to Russia that occurred during the 2016 presidential campaign, for which they were evidently not prepared (François and Lin 2020). Operations of information manipulation interfering with, or destabilising, democratic countries are now under the spotlight.\nIn 2016, a long-feared scenario materialised when the servers of the company Dyn were attacked after its network of connected objects (cameras, printers ...) was manipulated, expanding the field of vulnerabilities and the vectors of attacks. Finally, the\nWannaCry and NotPetya attacks in 2017 inaugurated an era of massive propagating attacks, both swift and uncontrollable, and caused the greatest damage ever recorded by indiscriminately affecting dozens of companies and institutions in more than 150 countries that had not been initially targeted. It stressed the need to protect the systems but also to be able to react quickly to block a rapid contamination. This systemic risk is linked to the interconnection of digital networks.\nThese strategic surprises highlighted the vulnerability, and the unpreparedness, of states -- including the most advanced ones -- as they faced a ever-changing threat. They forcefully influenced the representation of cyberspace as a new military field that required the mobilisation of exceptional resources in the name of national security. This representation led to an institutional reorganisation: many countries created cybersecurity agencies and cybercommands within their armed forces to prepare their cyberdefence. It also encouraged the development of new offensive tools to be used for intelligence or surveillance, or during military operations. The inhibitions against such a dynamic arms race, during which countries strengthen their power, have paradoxically been loosened following Edward Snowden's revelations, as many states started claiming the development of offensive capabilities. For example, the cyber strategy of the Trump administration unambiguously endorsed the proliferation of offensive tools, as well as the penetration of digital systems to deter adversaries (Smeets 2020; Taillat 2020). In addition, the revelations spurred many countries in Europe and around the world into investing more in digital intelligence capabilities and boosting the commercial marketplace of digital surveillance technologies. The exportation of such technologies has, in some cases, permitted population surveillance by states that had not yet developed their own capabilities for the purpose of detecting and managing threats to the stability of their regime.\nHence, the ‘materialisation of cyber war' during the past decade has reinforced the securitization and militarisation of cyberspace that debuted during the 2000s. The notion of security remains ambiguous because, as noted by Dunn Cavelty (2012), the military conception of security can be associated with serious risks. The tools developed by the states to ensure their national security can increase the risks they are exposed to, especially in cyberspace as we will see later. They can also bring about insecurity in other domains of security -- economic, social or political (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998). Information and communication networks are shared by institutions, civil society and the economic and military spheres. Thus, cyberspace offers a multitude of complex interactions and interconnections between these areas where issues are overlapping. Hence, cyberspace is used by a multitude of actors for different ends, and their interests and representations of security may prove widely divergent. The debate over encryption illustrates the profound antagonisms generated by digital technologies between the different actors of security (Gasser et al. 2016), putting the proponents of encryption to protect states' and companies' secrets against the proponents of an access to data limited to the courts or the police, and even against the proponents of deeper protections for personal data and civil liberties (East West Institute 2018). Within a government, divergent conceptions of security can coexist and sometimes oppose each other, as different ministries and agencies implement different (sometimes contradictory) security objectives in cyberspace.\nLikewise, there is no uniform representation of cyberspace among states. On the contrary, it depends on the geopolitical context, the relationships between regional powers, on the level of development of the digital economy, on cyberdefence capabilities, and on\ntheir strategic culture. Besides, representations are shaped by imbalances in commanding technologies, infrastructures, data flows, or on the ability to act in the digital space. For instance, cyberspace is first and foremost an issue of connectivity and economic development in many African countries, but also a territory where cybercrime needs to be fought. Among authoritarian regimes, the informational dimension of cyberspace is seen as the main threat against political stability, as it opens a space for the expression of dissident opinions, the propagation of rumours and the risk of subversion.\nBut the military representation of cyberspace predominates in large Western countries that have advanced capabilities and a central role in international negotiations. They also influence political decision-makers at the expense of other approaches to risks that could better take into account the security of private actors and individual users. Finally, this militarisation of cyberspace also invites risks of which states are progressively growing aware, but they face a security dilemma.\n## Geopolitical risk v. systemic risk: states' security dilemma\nStates have become aware of the risks of proliferation as tools they have developed are used against them. In the digital sphere, offensive tools can be stolen, copied, retrieved, analysed, transformed, reused and repurposed, as the examples of the Shadow Brokers or Vault 7 have shown (Buchanan 2020). New offensive concepts and tactics can be imitated and re-employed. In other words, cyberattacks are liable to teach lessons and to improve the capabilities of their adversaries. A classified NSA document from 2013 divulged by Edward Snowden and published in The Intercept in 2015 confirmed what many had feared before: the Iranian regime learned from the cyberattacks it had suffered and it used this knowledge to improve its own capabilities (Zetter 2014). The report specified that Iran probably imitated the offensive techniques of an attack against its oil industry to launch the Shamoon attack against Saudi Aramco in 2012 which sabotaged 30,000 computers in one stroke. Hence, proliferation leads to improved skills among actors, including adversaries and criminals, and directly participates in the heightened sophistication of attacks and in the threats against the whole digital environment.\nFurthermore, because technologies and networks are shared by armies, private actors, institutions and civil society, these attacks are liable to propagate quickly, and sometimes uncontrollably. The risk of uncontrollable collateral damage is a serious hindrance to the work of armies in the digital space; for instance, the notion of a ‘surgical' attack appears to be a contradiction in terms, as the interactions and interconnections between the systems and their points of vulnerability are difficult to anticipate on this territory. The Stuxnet virus, specifically conceived for the Natanz nuclear infrastructure as it wasn't connected to the internet, did propagate through cyberspace, probably though a USB key. Although Stuxnet did not unleash its payload on third-party victims' computers, part of its code was later reused in other cyberattacks, hence demonstrating that highly targeted code is no guarantee against proliferation.\nThe WannaCry and NotPetya attacks were emblematic of the systemic risk posed by the proliferation of cyberweapons in our societies. These attacks were rapidly and uncontrollably propagated throughout the world, targeting hospitals and causing hundreds of millions of euros' worth of damage for companies that weren't initially targeted. In May 2017, the ransomware WannaCry infected more than 200,000 computers in 150 countries until\nthe discovery of a kill switch stopped it. Subsequent investigations brought the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia to dismiss the possibility of a criminal endeavour and they attributed the attack to North Korea. The NotPetya attack, which initially resembled a ransomware attack, was entirely conceived to sabotage systems. The White House estimated that this sole attack cost $10 billion, the most devastating ever, and it was attributed to Russia, first by the United Kingdom, and then by the other Five Eyes countries. These two attacks used EternalBlue, an offensive tool that took advantage of a Microsoft vulnerability and was developed by the NSA. This tool was stolen from the NSA, made publicly available online, and later used by other actors to launch attacks that propagated uncontrollably and hit the very country that created this offensive tool.\nThese attacks thus demonstrated the security dilemma faced by states regarding offensive operations in cyberspace (Segal ; Buchanan) and which pit two non-exclusive (but coexisting) representations of cyber risk against each other, leading to complex tensions and sometimes irreconcilable objectives between and within governments.\nOn the one hand, the states see a cyberthreat as systemic: an extremely complex, cross-border risk, not necessarily of state origin, which, like pandemics, can spread very rapidly, be very difficult to stop and cause massive damage. It is therefore in the interest of all actors to stop contagions that could have disastrous consequences. This approach to risks calls for enhanced cooperation between governments -- but also within governments and between private and public actors -- and arms control, in the common interest of system stability.\nOn the other hand, a cyberthreat is primarily a geopolitical threat for states because the offensive tools are used by their adversaries but also by their allies and economic rivals to increase their power through espionage, influence, or even military operations. Focusing on this risk takes states in the opposite direction: enhancing their offensive arsenal, limiting cooperation and protecting their sovereign capabilities. This approach clearly dominates the representations of states with the most advanced capabilities, as seen in the ongoing race for cyberweapons and in the offensive doctrines they have developed recently (Buchanan).\nThe dominant representation of the geopolitical risk is a source of distrust among states and it encourages them to reinforce their ‘territorial' control over cyberspace as well as their sovereign capabilities. It limits their ability to come to an agreement on the modalities for regulating states' behaviour in cyberspace and interpreting international law. It also explains why international discussions exclude a central issue linked to the offensive practices of states: espionage. That said, the search for an equilibrium between the two approaches is at the heart of the international intergovernmental discussions on the regulation of cyberspace as states start to acknowledge their own vulnerability in the face of systemic risk.\n## Diplomats launched an attack on the ‘digital far west'\nFor years, the most advanced states took advantage of the opacity of the digital space to discretely conduct offensive operations with impunity. But with the materialisation of cyber-war and the multiplication of large-scale attacks that targeted them, states have progressively acknowledged the risks they are exposed to -- and which are now becoming systemic.\nFirst, the technology is both more widely accessible and less expensive, making it available to a larger number of state and non-state actors, all increasingly enterprising and creative in how they use it. The 2010s were marked by a diversification of targets -- strategic attacks against private companies -- of actors involved, with sometimes blurry relations to state authorities, and of the operating modes as attackers are only limited by their imagination in hijacking digital technologies. Threats are more pressing, complex, protean and unpredictable.\nIn fact, the digital transformation of societies makes them increasingly dependent on cyberspace, the stability of which is now essential to their proper functioning. But the multiplication of badly-secured connected objects, the embedded computing in medical devices, vehicles and even in military armament, constantly expands the space that can be targeted. In other words, the more connected and dependent on data a society is, the more points of vulnerability there are. The rise of quantum computing -- which promises to revolutionise encryption by increasing computing power -- and of artificial intelligence suggests sophisticated and potentially destabilising attacks, even though these technologies could also be used to improve cybersecurity.\nStates are thus faced with the same type of dilemma as when they became aware of the dangers of nuclear power. Except that digital technology is within the reach of many actors (not only states), it is easier to steal and reuse than a nuclear missile, and it is by nature dual-use and ubiquitous, which makes controlling the possession of offensive tools and organising verification impossible. It therefore requires a totally different approach to counter-proliferation. But because it can turn against the states that develop it, at the risk of threatening international security and the very stability of cyberspace, it raises the question of systemic risk, which was at the heart of the balance of terror doctrine. This risk led states, at the end of the 1990s, to initiate discussions on the regulation of cyberspace which, after years of stalemate (Maurer 2011) and the change of posture of the United States in favour of multilateralism under the Obama administration (Douzet and Géry 2020), have led to significant progress.\nAfter the first resolution introduced by Russia in 1998, the General Assembly of the United Nations created a group of governmental experts (GGE) to begin discussions on information and communication technologies (ICTs). Only 15 states were initially represented, including the five permanent members of the Security Council -- due to the format chosen but also to the limited number of countries with competences in the field. Overall, 5 GGEs were successively convened and, when membership was progressively widened, it remained rather limited (25 states in 2016--2017). Only three GGEs agreed on a report -- in 2010 (A/65/201), 2013 (A/68/98) and 2015 (A/74/170) -- as the others couldn't reach a consensus.\nThe content of these three reports illustrates the progressive acknowledgment by states of their own vulnerabilities and of the existence of a systemic risk, on the one hand, and the domination of the geopolitical risk on the systemic risk on the other hand. All of this limits progress in regulating the digital space. It is necessary to note that these reports were only recommendations to the General Assembly and not binding instruments creating obligations for states. They shared a willingness to commit themselves politically without being legally constrained and, as such, acknowledged a need to identify limits to preserve the security and stability of cyberspace.\nIn the 2010 report, states recognised that ‘The global network of ICTs [communication and information technologies] has become an arena for disruptive activity' [para. 4] in which different actors intervene. They recommended reinforcing the cybersecurity capabilities of states, implementing confidence-building measures and a ‘[f]urther dialogue among States to discuss norms pertaining to State use of ICTs, to reduce collective risk and protect critical national and international infrastructure' (para. 18i).\nIn 2013, states recognised for the first time, in an international document, that international law applies to cyberspace: ‘International law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment' (GGE Report 2013, para. 19). This strengthened the territorialisation of digital space, further affirmed in the following paragraph: ‘State sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to State conduct of ICT-related activities, and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory' (ibid, para. 20). The recognition of the applicability of international law in cyberspace led to the delimitation of states' rights and obligations related to cyberoperations because states were now proscribed from conducting operations contrary to their international obligations. For example, they are not allowed to conduct cyberoperations that intervene in the internal affairs of another state; they would otherwise be in violation of the principle of non-intervention (Delerue 2020).\nThis decision also reflected the willingness of states to inscribe their behaviour in the international legal order. The digital space is therefore no longer a ‘digital Wild West' in which only the law of the strongest dominates, at least in theory. There are rules that derive from international law, but the question is how they should be applied or, in other words, what the rights and duties of states ought to be. But interpreting international law in such a new, complex and dynamic environment poses serious difficulties. For that reason, the member countries of the third GGE recommended the elaboration of ‘norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour by States' to reduce the risks threatening the security and stability of cyberspace. These norms, which are derived from international law according to the report, set out principles or good practices to guide the behaviour of states. The mission entrusted to the fourth GGE, created shortly after the publication of the 2013 report, and which met in 2014 and 2015, was to further develop these norms.\nHowever, this apparent UN consensus hides profound disagreements on the modalities of the regulation of cyberspace, based on the representation of the geopolitical risk, and they can be surmised from the 2015 report. Reading the table of contents, we see the first cracks in the consensus between the states. Indeed, the report includes six parts, the third and sixth respectively dealing with the norms of responsible behaviour of states and international law. Contrary to the 2013 report, a strict separation -- at least in appearance -- is established between the norms and rules of international law. As such, the report highlighted an opposition among states on the necessity to elaborate (or not) new rules of international law to ensure the security of the digital space. On one side, some countries, including the United States, believe that existing international law is enough to regulate behaviour and they demand political commitments instead, via non-binding norms, to translate the expectations of the international community and enable a better predictability of states' behaviour. These norms could be built on existing\nobligations but without creating new international obligations. On the other side, some states -- such as Russia -- display a more legalist approach to international law and believe that existing law isn't enough to regulate the behaviour of states in cyberspace because of its specificities. New rules, and binding new rights and obligations, are necessary to complete international law, via a treaty (Delerue and Géry 2017). But, by separating norms from questions of international law, the report gives the impression that norms are autonomous and that their implementation isn't dependent on existing obligations set in international law.\nUnderlying this position is the belief that international law is sufficient and does not need to be clarified. And mentioning the purpose and the value of the norms limits their scope: they are non-binding and serve as a standard of measurement to assess the behaviour of states, but are not intended to limit the rights of states (2015 GGE Report, para. 10). They are purely declaratory as they need to be specified to be implemented. Furthermore, the part dedicated to international law only reiterates, to a large extent, what was already written in the 2013 report. Conversely, separating the norms can be interpreted either as a need for new rules or states' willingness to limit their commitment (this is the way Russia interprets it). These two interpretations coexist and highlight the difficult elaboration of a consensus among states (Delerue, Douzet, and Géry 2020).\nThat said, the report did bring notable progress. Indeed, states came to an agreement on a series of non-binding norms to reduce the risks to global peace, security and stability. They forbade cyberoperations causing intentional damage to vital infrastructure and attacks on computer emergency response teams (CERTs). States shouldn't purposely authorise malicious cyberoperations organised from their territory, either. They committed themselves to notifying vulnerabilities in a responsible manner, but also to combating the proliferation of malicious computer technologies and tools, to exchanging information, to providing mutual assistance, and to implementing measures recommended by the General Assembly for the protection of critical infrastructures.\nThe adoption of these norms shows a common willingness to ensure the security and stability of the digital space. But it remains the product of a compromise between states and, more importantly, of the search for an equilibrium to limit systemic risk while continuing to use the digital space for offensive purposes, a realistic principle with regard to the current geopolitical context (Lewis 2018). The numerous caveats in the formulation of the recommendations, such as the use of the conditional (states should, should not) or the ambiguity in the formulation of proscribed cyberoperations all testify to this balancing act. Hence, the cyberoperations against vitally important infrastructures are not proscribed, but the ones contrary to international law and causing ‘intentional damages' against the infrastructures are.\nThe General Assembly of the United Nations hoped to pursue the discussions with a fifth GGE. But the negotiations failed in 2016--2017 in the face of profound disagreements on international law and its interpretation. The communiqués and statements of the United States, Cuba and Russia highlighted apparent doubts on the applicability of certain clauses of international law (self-defence, law of international responsibility, international humanitarian law) and, more importantly, profound dissensions on the interpretation of these branches of law. They could partly be explained by the particularly tense geopolitical context, marked by the affirmation of state power in cyberspace: accusations\nof Russian interferences in the American presidential elections, rising informational threats, trade tensions between China and the United States that focused on digital technologies, cyberattacks with systemic propagation, and the beginning of public attributions and retaliating threats. In this context, some states -- notably China -- questioned the scope and potential consequences of their legal commitments. From the outset, this geopolitical context foreshadowed the reluctance of states to agree on progress in the regulation of the digital space. This risk is all the greater because, apart from confidence-building measures and capacity-building, the discussions on international law and norms need to go into a level of detail that could further limit the behaviour of states. Hence, the geopolitical risk brought the negotiations on security and stability in the digital space to a stalemate. As a consequence, non-state actors confronted with systemic risk sought to become directly involved in these discussions through various new initiatives.\n## Much ado about nothing?\nOn 14 February 2017, Brad Smith, the President of Microsoft, called to convene a Digital Geneva Convention. Drawing from the 1949 Geneva Conventions, he invited states to protect infrastructures and citizens from computer attacks in times of peace. He also called for the creation of an international organisation modelled on the International Atomic Energy Agency to handle the attribution of cyberoperations. Meanwhile, during the Munich Security Conference, the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) debuted its work. This independent commission of 28 international experts from the private sector, academia, the technical community and NGOs was created by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the support of prominent companies and several states. It was tasked with offering new norms of responsible behaviour to maintain security and stability in the digital space, which is the objective of its final report presented at the Paris Peace Forum in November 2019. Between 2017 and 2019, these private (Microsoft) and multi-stakeholder (GCSC) settings played an important role in discussions on the security and stability of the digital space. They first maintained these questions on the global agenda through more or less formal contacts between states and international organisations when uncertainty prevailed over the future of international negotiations. They then launched initiatives and elaborated proposals to regulate the digital space. The GCSC listed eight norms of responsible behaviour, several of which were integrated in the Paris Call in November 2018 and in the Cybersecurity Act adopted in May 2019 by the European Union. Other initiatives emerged, such as private commitments (Charter of Trust by Siemens, Cybersecurity Tech Accord by Microsoft) and new NGOs (Cyber Peace Institute).\nAll these initiatives were symptomatic of a willingness among private actors and civil society to get involved in the discussions on a domain of sovereignty and to try to impose the multi-stakeholder model -- long limited to the governance of other aspects of the internet -- on matters of international security. These actors are historically legitimate, technically competent, and they have the necessary resources to ensure the stability and security of cyberspace. The internet was conceived by academic actors and then developed and commercialised by private actors who own most of the infrastructures. Global companies have superior technical capabilities, data and resources compared to\nthose of states and they are often the first to detect attacks and to offer a response. They have become essential partners to ensure the security of states.\nActors from the business and academic sectors, the technical community and civil society are heavily involved in the governance of the internet and their expertise can prove essential due to the technicity of the issues (Ríos Rodríguez 2010), as shown by the Wassenaar Arrangement. The implementation of this agreement regulating the exports of dual-use technologies was limited by its weak definition. Above all, these actors can help push states beyond some of the bottlenecks that limit the development and scope of norms because they have a common interest in the stability of cyberspace and in high user confidence.\nThe culmination of this logic lies in the creation, at the end of 2019, by Microsoft, MasterCard and the Hewlett Foundation, of the Cyber Peace Institute which, without having official attribution power, has an accountability function to evaluate states' respect of international law and of the norms of good behaviour. Similarly, the designation by Microsoft, in January 2020, of a representative for UN-related questions illustrated the company's willingness to directly weigh in into international discussions.\nHowever, these initiatives are limited by the reluctance of many states to leave non-state actors to get involved in the definition of states' rights, obligations and responsibilities. Although they recognise the importance of the multi-stakeholder model of internet governance and the need to closely involve the private sector and civil society in initiatives to promote the security and stability of cyberspace, they defend the exclusive dimension of some of their prerogatives. The role of non-state actors in the security and stability of cyberspace was recognised in 2013 and 2015 by the member states of the GGE, but they nevertheless reasserted their primary responsibility in this area. On the one hand, non-state actors, unless they have a specially granted title, are not allowed to participate in these discussions, because they are not subjects of international law. On the other hand, the representation of cyberspace as a field of confrontation and as an object of national security makes it the sole prerogative of states and limits the willingness of states to involve non-state actors in the discussions.\nIn any case, the input of non-state actors in international discussions has increasingly been recognised globally, even though disparities exist between states. Moreover, states are taking part in many multi-stakeholder forums dealing with issues of security and stability in cyberspace, which are being debated at the Internet Governance Forum, ICANN, but also in diplomatic dialogues and more specific initiatives (London Process, Raisina Dialogue, Sino-European Cyber Dialogue, US--China Cyber Dialogue, Canada--EU Cyber Dialogue and so on). They seek to advance ideas and build consensus outside multilateral processes in order to facilitate international discussions and/or create a balance of power by rallying states and organisations to their positions beforehand (Ruhl et al. 2020). This recognition of the role played by non-state actors is best illustrated by the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace initiated by France and largely promoted by Microsoft. The Paris Call -- not endorsed by the United States, China or Russia -- testifies to the signatories' public commitment to ensuring the security and stability of cyberspace globally.\nIt was not until a little over a year after the failure of the UN negotiations that new proposals emerged. And the way discussions resumed was emblematic of the tensions between two apprehensions of the risks in a deteriorated geopolitical context. Indeed,\ntwo processes (an open-ended working group and a group of governmental experts) actually debuted almost simultaneously in the autumn of 2019, one led by Russia, the other by the United States, with largely overlapping mandates. In October 2018, Russia introduced a new resolution on ICTs in the context of international security, listing several norms of behaviour and proposing to convene an open-ended working group (OEWG), i.e. a negotiation setting open to all UN member states. The First Commission at the UN was then the theatre of a sharp confrontation between the supporters of the Russian proposal and Western states which, in reaction, proposed their own draft resolution, offering another GGE restricted to 25 states. Despite important modifications on the Russian project, the United States -- followed by the European Union -- didn't withdraw its draft, leading to the adoption of two resolutions, amidst heightened tensions, by the General Assembly on 5 and 22 December 2018 (A/RES/73/27 and A/RES/73/266). A large majority of states voted in favour of the two resolutions which nevertheless reflected a deep divide between the major powers, both on their objectives and on the means of achieving them. Indeed, Russia hasn't renounced its original objective, stated in 1998, of a treaty to underpin the negotiations in the working group.\nInterestingly, the working group shepherded by Russia is the one consulting non-state actors (companies, NGOs ...), some of which (but not all) also demand a treaty. On the contrary, the GGE only consults regional state organisations. This fracture was accentuated in December 2019 when the General Assembly adopted a new Russian-led resolution (A/RES/74/247) that created a new negotiation process responsible for elaborating a treaty on cybercrime. Western countries are strongly opposed to it because they believe that the 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, open for signature to states not belonging to the Council of Europe, and already ratified by 64 states, should be universalised instead.\nThese two negotiation processes have been produced by major geopolitical tensions, in a context in which the United States is being offensive while denouncing, with several of their global partners, Russian and Chinese cyberoperations. For their part, countries such as Russia and China -- even though they have adopted different strategies (Broeders, Adamson, and Creemers 2019) -- fully take advantage of the offensive potentialities offered by networks while they call for limits on the militarisation of the digital space. Europe, for its part, seeks to offer a third path, but with limited opposition to the United States, which remains its main ally. That said, Europe is plagued by its own dissensions.\nTo many observers' surprise, the OEWG adopted its final report on 12 March 2021, demonstrating that despite the context of strategic competition exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic, states were still able to achieve consensus. The report consolidates the achievements of the previous GGEs, encourages more transparency in the implementation of the recommendations of the 2015 GGE report and promotes the pursuit of international negotiations. It also shows some progress, such as the recognition of health infrastructures as critical infrastructures that need to be protected, along with the integrity and the general availability of the internet. However, many contentious points persist as revealed by the Chair's summary, published with the report, that contains most of the state propositions that were not adopted by the OEWG, short of a consensus between states.\nIn addition, states rushed to launch the next round of international negotiations even before the two processes had finalised their respective reports. France proposed a\nprogramme of action within the OEWG to merge the two processes into a single one that could provide incremental progress as opposed to requiring a final consensus report. But Russia and its allies sponsored a UNGA resolution launching a new OEWG in October 2020. The same day, the United States and its allies sponsored another resolution, that acknowledges the ongoing negotiations, leaving the door open for further negotiations as the GGE is scheduled to achieve its report in May 2021. Both resolutions were adopted by the UNGA in December 2020. In addition to the OEWG being renewed, the GGE could potentially be continued and a new programme of action created depending on what states propose at the UNGA's 76th session, starting in October 2021.\nThe landscape of international negotiations is thus becoming particularly crowded and even confused, with a multiplication of actors, initiatives and proposals aimed at promoting peace and stability in cyberspace. It risks leading to inconsistencies or ambiguities that would leave room for states to pursue their hijinks with relative impunity, even if the two groups' chairs have worked together to reach a consensus and limit contradictions. However, this proliferation is creating a dynamic that is making it possible for states and all actors to become more aware of the risks and challenges associated with the proliferation of cyberweapons. But it is also part of a geopolitical context that is particularly conducive to an arms race.\n## Conclusion\nCyberspace has thus become a field of confrontations between states during the 2010s, to the point of becoming a military domain in its own right for many of them, which have engaged in a cyberweapons race. The proliferation of cyber operations and offensive tools has contributed to increasing the scope and sophistication of the threat they face in the digital space. The tools and attack concepts they have developed have escaped them and are increasingly turned against them, the vulnerabilities they exploit in adversary systems also affect the systems of their own companies and institutions, which can become strategic targets. Last but not least, the uncontrolled spread of certain attacks has had devastating consequences that raise important ethical, legal and economic liability issues but also awareness of the systemic risk that proliferation poses to the security and stability of cyberspace.\nFor these reasons, and despite a notably tense geopolitical context, states have chosen to resume international discussions on security and stability in cyberspace, and have taken part in multiple initiatives with private actors and civil society to try to contain the threat. And yet, we cannot but note that the representation of cyberthreat as a geopolitical risk continues to predominate over the representation of systemic risk, leading some states room for offensive operations, in order to ensure their own power in cyberspace, which they see as a condition for their security.\nAt the time of writing, negotiations are still ongoing at the UN, and it is difficult to predict their outcome. In the end, it will depend on what states perceive as their primary interest: to curb systemic threat or to continue waging wars. Whatever the outcome of the negotiations, systemic risk will necessarily remain high because of the divergent strategic interests among states and because the exploitation of a network vulnerability by one actor for a specific purpose is in fact exploited by all and for multiple purposes. It also shows that, whatever the initiatives and propositions made, cyberspace\nJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY\n#\nremains, first and foremost, used to wage war, and its regulation remains the product of the 'external legal policies' (Ladreit de Lacharrière 1983) of states, thus ultimately a byproduct of the defence of their respective interests."

But the advantages of the digital revolution are now threatened by the use of cyberspace for war purposes. This article explores the states' security dilemma as they face cyber challenges and the ambivalence of the notion of security in cyberspace. It highlights how, in ten years, cyberspace has become a battlefield and a strategic priority for many states that have represented it as a geopolitical threat for their national security, hence justifying its progressive militarisation. Meanwhile, they have become cognizant to the systemic risk of proliferation of offensive cybertools and cyber-operations. This security dilemma – one that opposes a representation of cyber threats as a geopolitical risk to that of cyberspace as a systemic risk – is at the heart of the multilateral negotiations on the regulation of cyberspace. There, a multiplicity of non-state actors has forced their way to the table through a multitude of initiatives that emphasize the importance of the challenges at stake and how difficult it will be for the states to face them.\n## ARTICLE HISTORY Received 28 February 2021 Revised 23 March 2021 Accepted 15 April 2021 ## KEYWORDS Cyberspace; cyberwar; proliferation; security; stability ## Introduction On 12 November 2018, in the midst of the Paris Peace Forum that brought together nearly 70 heads of state and government to commemorate the centenary of the 1918 armistice, the French president Emmanuel Macron launched the 'Paris Call for trust and security in cyberspace' during a meeting with actors of internet governance at UNESCO headquarters.¹ His vibrant plea, now endorsed by more than 1,000 signatories – including 77 states – highlighted common principles to maintain peace, security and stability in cyberspace. In April 2018, UNESCO had previously hosted a symposium convened by the National Cybersecurity Agency of France (ANSSI) and the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs entitled 'Building international peace and security in the digital society'. These initiatives were in line with the numerous others that have been carried out globally by governments, civil society and major digital companies since the early 2010s. Interestingly, Russia was the first state to propose, as early as 1998, a resolution CONTACT Frédérick Douzet fdouzet@gmail.com © 2021 The Author(s).

As the strongest advocate for an international treaty on cyberspace, Russia has since sponsored a resolution almost every year, while other international dialogues and processes have progressively been established. How can we explain such activism? Very simply because cyberspace is used -- first and foremost -- to wage wars.\nBeyond a pleasant homage to its author, the analogy to Yves Lacoste's seminal work La géographie, ça sert, d'abord, à faire la guerre (1976), is justified by the apparent explosion of conflict in cyberspace, which has become a new vector for geopolitical rivalries and even a new military field in the strategies and doctrines of many nations. It has also increasingly been militarised -- a set of social, political and economic processes have made a military approach to solving cyber problems more acceptable -- with the proliferation of weapons and threats that now structure its evolution and regulation. Obviously, cyberspace wasn't invented to wage wars and isn't only used for that. We can even say that the attacks conducted until today have remained below the threshold of war according to international law. However, setting severity thresholds has been made more difficult by the boldness and provocations of the most enterprising protagonists. Cyberspace has altogether revolutionised our modes of life, disrupted our economies, and enabled important progress in our societies. But the benefits brought by the digital revolution are now threatened by a sharp increase in the number and sophistication of malicious acts in cyberspace.\nFirst, the use of cyberspace for offensive purposes, by states and a diverse array of other actors, entails the risk of conflict escalation and of a destabilisation of our societies that, in turn, threatens international peace and security. Evidently, the catastrophic scenarios of ‘digital Pearl Harbors' or massive deadly attacks on vital infrastructures, which were popular worries in the early 2010s, haven't materialised. But several attacks have been uncontrollably propagated throughout the world, highlighting the potentially devastating threat of conflict in cyberspace and the systemic risks it entails. The proliferation of cyberweapons -- i.e. malicious tools to conduct cyberattacks -- threatens the stability of cyberspace, on which our societies have grown increasingly dependent, because its underlying infrastructures are constantly targeted. Cyberspace is also increasingly used to conduct digital influence and subversion operations. However, in most cases, the weaponization of information does not involve cyberattacks that could contribute to the proliferation of cyberweapons.\nSecond, in an unstable geopolitical context marked by a persistent terrorist threat, weakened multilateral institutions and the evident return of a strategic competition between large powers, states hold onto their ability to act and aren't ready to abandon certain practices that otherwise threaten the security and stability of cyberspace. This context of distrust and power rivalries limits global cooperation and constitutes a rein on efforts to adopt the necessary regulation to ensure the security and stability of cyberspace in the face of a systemic risk -- and also questions the very notion of security in cyberspace.\nHow can we define a threat to national or international security in cyberspace? What does the ‘security of cyberspace' mean? These questions provoke debates and oppose a multiplicity of points of views among state and non-state protagonists. The notion of securitisation developed by Barry Buzan and Ole Wæver in the 1990s -- that is, the way in which a political actor seizes upon an object that he treats, in his speeches, as a security issue in order to justify the sometimes extraordinary means of defending it -- offers an interesting analytical framework in this context (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998). It brings a better understanding of the complexity of international discussions that involve multiple actors, starting with states, to define security in cyberspace, what is necessary to implement it, and the underlying political choices it implies.\nThis article explores the security dilemma faced by states when dealing with cyber issues and the ambivalence of the notion of security in cyberspace. It shows how, within a decade, cyberspace has become a battlefield and an absolute strategic priority for many states, leading them to view it as a geopolitical threat to their national security. Hence, they have endorsed its militarisation despite a progressive understanding of the systemic risk that results from the proliferation of offensive weapons and operations. This dilemma lies at the heart of the ongoing tensions in multilateral discussions on the regulation of cyberspace, in which non-state actors have invited themselves through a multitude of initiatives that demonstrate the importance of the stakes but also the difficulties in dealing with them.\n## The emergence of a new military domain The representation of cyberspace as a new military domain emerged during the 2010s, the last step in the territorialisation of cyberspace by states in reaction to the multiplication of the strategic surprises they had faced there since the late 2000s. The territorialisation of cyberspace, which had been initiated by pioneers of the internet to represent the digital space and protect it from the geopolitical rivalries that prevailed in the physical world, became an imperative of securitisation quickly associated with its militarisation in the discourse of states.\nThis association between cyberattacks and the militarisation of cyberspace was, however, not self-evident based on the growing challenges posed by the cybercrimes perpetrated by non-state actors against private and individual interests. And it could have become the focus of attention. Instead, states have built a representation of cyberspace first and foremost as a threat to their national security at the expense of other characterisation, such as a criminal danger, an economic risk or a threat to individual user security and privacy. (Dunn Cavelty 2012; Nissenbaum 2005). As a consequence, even though states have tackled the overall issues of cybersecurity and cybercrime, they have structured their strategies mostly under the umbrella of national security, primarily reinforced military means of action (both defensive and offensive) and subsequently designated enemies in cyberspace, an eminently political act.\nThis militarisation of cyberspace can be partly explained by a deeper understanding of the internet and of digital technologies among defence protagonists, which allowed them to better foresee threats and publicise them. As they quickly allocated funds to this new field, they took part in defining state priorities on questions of national security. That said, it is the increasing number of state-sponsored attacks conducted for strategic reasons, together with the growing digitalisation of the battlefield, and the new opportunities arising from the association of digital operations with other traditional weapons, that led to the representation of cyberspace as a military battlefield. That representation has been predominant in Western democracies yet immediately contested by China and Russia, who have regularly denounced the risks of a militarisation of cyberspace, in which they have fully participated, however, according to the volume of cyberattacks officially attributed to them. Both countries had initially preferred the concept of informational space -- or information security -- to cyberspace, which reflects both their perception of the threat as being primarily informational and their priority of ensuring the stability of their political regimes. Their military doctrines have however considered this space as a strategic domain from the outset, even before Western countries. The most prominent cyber powers -- starting with the United States, France and the United Kingdom -- have since characterised cyberspace as the fifth military domain after land, sea, air and space. In turn, NATO recognised cyberspace as an operational military domain in 2016.\nThe pertinence of this representation has led to intense debates in the academic literature due to the specificities of cyberspace. Martin Libicki first denounced this label as inadequate to understand this hyper-dynamic environment in permanent and rapid reconfiguration, the plasticity of which requires constant adaptation and great agility. He noted that this development brought us back to classic concepts of warfare such as ‘control, manoeuvre, superiority' whereas control is illusory in cyberspace and armies don't manoeuvre in the same battlefield as their enemies. Indeed, the latter can reduce their vulnerabilities and limit the impact of an attack through measures of cyberdefence. Hence, the success of an attack in cyberspace partly depends on targets that evolve rapidly and dynamically.\nFurthermore, there is no academic consensus on the very notion of cyberwar, despite its large media and political echo. In his book Cyber War Will Not Take Place, Thomas Rid (2013, 37) stated that past operations couldn't be labelled warfare because an ‘act of war must be instrumental, political, and potentially lethal'. And even if a future cyberattack were to meet these criteria, the response would most likely not be confined to cyberspace but escalate into a kinetic conflict. Ultimately, these attacks were only more sophisticated versions -- involving malicious code -- of methods as old as war: espionage, sabotage and subversion. Even from the perspective of international law, the only operation that could have qualified as an act of war -- but wasn't declared one by the Iranian government -- was the Stuxnet attack against the nuclear centrifuges at Natanz in 2010. According to the New York Times, the attack was led by the United States with the help of Israeli intelligence services. To this day, no state has officially denounced an act of war in cyberspace.\nThe threshold of what is acceptable -- and accepted -- in terms of offensive operations also seems to be constantly pushed back, in view of the increasingly open hostilities conducted by states that push their advantage in cyberspace without necessarily triggering a forceful response. Current debates here suggest that it is a matter of time, more than a matter of threshold, before cyberwar reaches its cruising speed. But the reality is more complex. On the one hand, states show a certain restraint compared to their full capacity for action, which enables them to remain below the threshold for triggering an open conflict, despite testing this limit. On the other hand, the use of cyber operations is most often part of a combination of modes of action -- technical and non-technical, online and offline, direct and indirect, state and non-state -- which adds to the fog around (cyber)warfare, as it is not always clear where it starts and where it ends.\nHere, the only certainty is that cyber operations have now been integrated into the arsenal of the largest armies, supporting all the existing means used in the conduct of war. But the clear risk of conflict escalation between nuclear powers have also led to constant and ambiguous confrontations between antagonist state actors into the grey zone, below the threshold of war -- a peacetime competition that opposes in particular Russia to Western democracies. As a result, cyberspace has become a new space of confrontation in the geopolitical power rivalries that oppose a multitude of actors, leading to the proliferation of operations -- the most sophisticated of which come from states -- and eventually to the materialisation of cyberwar.\n## The ‘materialisation of cyber war': a series of strategic surprises According to Robert Kaiser, the 2007 cyberattacks against Estonia were a catalyst for the ‘materialisation of cyber war' as a new policy object -- even though no attack has yet been said to reach the threshold of an armed attack and been qualified as an act of war -- that keeps influencing the way states perceive future threats of cyberwar. These attacks occurred as protests proliferated among the Russian minority against the decision to move the statue of the Bronze Soldier in Tallinn. These DDOS attacks paralysed the websites of numerous organisations in the country, including banks, media outlets, ministries and the parliament. The following year, in July 2008, a wave of cyberattacks against Georgian websites preceded the arrival of Russian tanks in the country, the first known cyberattack combined with a land military operation. Despite their rudimentary nature, the public and spectacular dimension of these attacks forced states to come to term with them. Since then, cyberattacks have multiplied and, more importantly, they have become more targeted, sophisticated, creative and damaging, leading states to constantly adapt themselves to an evolving landscape of threats, marked by a succession of strategic surprises and a constant expansion of scope.\nIn 2010, Stuxnet became the first major attack against a critical infrastructure, in a joint attempt by the United States and Israel to halt the Iranian nuclear programme. In 2013, Edward Snowden's revelations disclosed that American espionage techniques could reach an unprecedented depth on an unsuspected scale thanks to the global interconnection of information and communication systems. Other countries -- including European states -- had to acknowledge their dependency on US digital platforms and technologies. The attacks that targeted the entertainment company Sony Pictures in 2014 took the American government completely by surprise: strategic attacks could also target large firms now. The 2015 attack against TV5 Monde in France reiterated that possibility.\nThen, in 2015, the Islamic State surprised everyone with its sophisticated use of social networks to distribute its propaganda, encourage online radicalisation, find new recruits, raise money, organise departures to Syria, and prepare terrorist attacks. It forced Western democracies, which had focused on technical attacks, to widen their approach to take informational operations into account as well. But it didn't prevent the American administration from being taken by surprise by the interferences attributed to Russia that occurred during the 2016 presidential campaign, for which they were evidently not prepared (François and Lin 2020). Operations of information manipulation interfering with, or destabilising, democratic countries are now under the spotlight.\nIn 2016, a long-feared scenario materialised when the servers of the company Dyn were attacked after its network of connected objects (cameras, printers...) was manipulated, expanding the field of vulnerabilities and the vectors of attacks. Finally, the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks in 2017 inaugurated an era of massive propagating attacks, both swift and uncontrollable, and caused the greatest damage ever recorded by indiscriminately affecting dozens of companies and institutions in more than 150 countries that had not been initially targeted. It stressed the need to protect the systems but also to be able to react quickly to block a rapid contamination. This systemic risk is linked to the interconnection of digital networks.\nThese strategic surprises highlighted the vulnerability, and the unpreparedness, of states -- including the most advanced ones -- as they faced a ever-changing threat. They forcefully influenced the representation of cyberspace as a new military field that required the mobilisation of exceptional resources in the name of national security. This representation led to an institutional reorganisation: many countries created cybersecurity agencies and cybercommands within their armed forces to prepare their cyberdefence. It also encouraged the development of new offensive tools to be used for intelligence or surveillance, or during military operations. The inhibitions against such a dynamic arms race, during which countries strengthen their power, have paradoxically been loosened following Edward Snowden's revelations, as many states started claiming the development of offensive capabilities. For example, the cyber strategy of the Trump administration unambiguously endorsed the proliferation of offensive tools, as well as the penetration of digital systems to deter adversaries. In addition, the revelations spurred many countries in Europe and around the world into investing more in digital intelligence capabilities and boosting the commercial marketplace of digital surveillance technologies. The exportation of such technologies has, in some cases, permitted population surveillance by states that had not yet developed their own capabilities for the purpose of detecting and managing threats to the stability of their regime.\nHence, the ‘materialisation of cyber war' during the past decade has reinforced the securitization and militarisation of cyberspace that debuted during the 2000s. The notion of security remains ambiguous because, as noted by Dunn Cavelty (2012), the military conception of security can be associated with serious risks. The tools developed by the states to ensure their national security can increase the risks they are exposed to, especially in cyberspace as we will see later. They can also bring about insecurity in other domains of security -- economic, social or political (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998). Information and communication networks are shared by institutions, civil society and the economic and military spheres. Thus, cyberspace offers a multitude of complex interactions and interconnections between these areas where issues are overlapping. Hence, cyberspace is used by a multitude of actors for different ends, and their interests and representations of security may prove widely divergent. The debate over encryption illustrates the profound antagonisms generated by digital technologies between the different actors of security, putting the proponents of encryption to protect states' and companies' secrets against the proponents of an access to data limited to the courts or the police, and even against the proponents of deeper protections for personal data and civil liberties (East West Institute 2018). Within a government, divergent conceptions of security can coexist and sometimes oppose each other, as different ministries and agencies implement different (sometimes contradictory) security objectives in cyberspace.\nLikewise, there is no uniform representation of cyberspace among states. On the contrary, it depends on the geopolitical context, the relationships between regional powers, on the level of development of the digital economy, on cyberdefence capabilities, and on their strategic culture. Besides, representations are shaped by imbalances in commanding technologies, infrastructures, data flows, or on the ability to act in the digital space. For instance, cyberspace is first and foremost an issue of connectivity and economic development in many African countries, but also a territory where cybercrime needs to be fought. Among authoritarian regimes, the informational dimension of cyberspace is seen as the main threat against political stability, as it opens a space for the expression of dissident opinions, the propagation of rumours and the risk of subversion.\nBut the military representation of cyberspace predominates in large Western countries that have advanced capabilities and a central role in international negotiations. They also influence political decision-makers at the expense of other approaches to risks that could better take into account the security of private actors and individual users. Finally, this militarisation of cyberspace also invites risks of which states are progressively growing aware, but they face a security dilemma.\n## Geopolitical risk v. systemic risk: states' security dilemma States have become aware of the risks of proliferation as tools they have developed are used against them. In the digital sphere, offensive tools can be stolen, copied, retrieved, analysed, transformed, reused and repurposed, as the examples of the Shadow Brokers or Vault 7 have shown. New offensive concepts and tactics can be imitated and re-employed. In other words, cyberattacks are liable to teach lessons and to improve the capabilities of their adversaries. A classified NSA document from 2013 divulged by Edward Snowden and published in The Intercept in 2015 confirmed what many had feared before: the Iranian regime learned from the cyberattacks it had suffered and it used this knowledge to improve its own capabilities. The report specified that Iran probably imitated the offensive techniques of an attack against its oil industry to launch the Shamoon attack against Saudi Aramco in 2012 which sabotaged 30,000 computers in one stroke. Hence, proliferation leads to improved skills among actors, including adversaries and criminals, and directly participates in the heightened sophistication of attacks and in the threats against the whole digital environment.\nFurthermore, because technologies and networks are shared by armies, private actors, institutions and civil society, these attacks are liable to propagate quickly, and sometimes uncontrollably. The risk of uncontrollable collateral damage is a serious hindrance to the work of armies in the digital space; for instance, the notion of a ‘surgical' attack appears to be a contradiction in terms, as the interactions and interconnections between the systems and their points of vulnerability are difficult to anticipate on this territory. The Stuxnet virus, specifically conceived for the Natanz nuclear infrastructure as it wasn't connected to the internet, did propagate through cyberspace, probably though a USB key. Although Stuxnet did not unleash its payload on third-party victims' computers, part of its code was later reused in other cyberattacks, hence demonstrating that highly targeted code is no guarantee against proliferation.\nThe WannaCry and NotPetya attacks were emblematic of the systemic risk posed by the proliferation of cyberweapons in our societies. These attacks were rapidly and uncontrollably propagated throughout the world, targeting hospitals and causing hundreds of millions of euros' worth of damage for companies that weren't initially targeted. In May 2017, the ransomware WannaCry infected more than 200,000 computers in 150 countries until the discovery of a kill switch stopped it. Subsequent investigations brought the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia to dismiss the possibility of a criminal endeavour and they attributed the attack to North Korea. The NotPetya attack, which initially resembled a ransomware attack, was entirely conceived to sabotage systems. The White House estimated that this sole attack cost $10 billion, the most devastating ever, and it was attributed to Russia, first by the United Kingdom, and then by the other Five Eyes countries. These two attacks used EternalBlue, an offensive tool that took advantage of a Microsoft vulnerability and was developed by the NSA. This tool was stolen from the NSA, made publicly available online, and later used by other actors to launch attacks that propagated uncontrollably and hit the very country that created this offensive tool.\nThese attacks thus demonstrated the security dilemma faced by states regarding offensive operations in cyberspace (Segal; Buchanan) and which pit two non-exclusive (but coexisting) representations of cyber risk against each other, leading to complex tensions and sometimes irreconcilable objectives between and within governments.\nOn the one hand, the states see a cyberthreat as systemic: an extremely complex, cross-border risk, not necessarily of state origin, which, like pandemics, can spread very rapidly, be very difficult to stop and cause massive damage. It is therefore in the interest of all actors to stop contagions that could have disastrous consequences. This approach to risks calls for enhanced cooperation between governments -- but also within governments and between private and public actors -- and arms control, in the common interest of system stability.\nOn the other hand, a cyberthreat is primarily a geopolitical threat for states because the offensive tools are used by their adversaries but also by their allies and economic rivals to increase their power through espionage, influence, or even military operations. Focusing on this risk takes states in the opposite direction: enhancing their offensive arsenal, limiting cooperation and protecting their sovereign capabilities. This approach clearly dominates the representations of states with the most advanced capabilities, as seen in the ongoing race for cyberweapons and in the offensive doctrines they have developed recently (Buchanan).\nThe dominant representation of the geopolitical risk is a source of distrust among states and it encourages them to reinforce their ‘territorial' control over cyberspace as well as their sovereign capabilities. It limits their ability to come to an agreement on the modalities for regulating states' behaviour in cyberspace and interpreting international law. It also explains why international discussions exclude a central issue linked to the offensive practices of states: espionage. That said, the search for an equilibrium between the two approaches is at the heart of the international intergovernmental discussions on the regulation of cyberspace as states start to acknowledge their own vulnerability in the face of systemic risk.\n## Diplomats launched an attack on the ‘digital far west' For years, the most advanced states took advantage of the opacity of the digital space to discretely conduct offensive operations with impunity. But with the materialisation of cyber-war and the multiplication of large-scale attacks that targeted them, states have progressively acknowledged the risks they are exposed to -- and which are now becoming systemic.\nFirst, the technology is both more widely accessible and less expensive, making it available to a larger number of state and non-state actors, all increasingly enterprising and creative in how they use it. The 2010s were marked by a diversification of targets -- strategic attacks against private companies -- of actors involved, with sometimes blurry relations to state authorities, and of the operating modes as attackers are only limited by their imagination in hijacking digital technologies. Threats are more pressing, complex, protean and unpredictable.\nIn fact, the digital transformation of societies makes them increasingly dependent on cyberspace, the stability of which is now essential to their proper functioning. But the multiplication of badly-secured connected objects, the embedded computing in medical devices, vehicles and even in military armament, constantly expands the space that can be targeted. In other words, the more connected and dependent on data a society is, the more points of vulnerability there are. The rise of quantum computing -- which promises to revolutionise encryption by increasing computing power -- and of artificial intelligence suggests sophisticated and potentially destabilising attacks, even though these technologies could also be used to improve cybersecurity.\nStates are thus faced with the same type of dilemma as when they became aware of the dangers of nuclear power. Except that digital technology is within the reach of many actors (not only states), it is easier to steal and reuse than a nuclear missile, and it is by nature dual-use and ubiquitous, which makes controlling the possession of offensive tools and organising verification impossible. It therefore requires a totally different approach to counter-proliferation. But because it can turn against the states that develop it, at the risk of threatening international security and the very stability of cyberspace, it raises the question of systemic risk, which was at the heart of the balance of terror doctrine. This risk led states, at the end of the 1990s, to initiate discussions on the regulation of cyberspace which, after years of stalemate and the change of posture of the United States in favour of multilateralism under the Obama administration (Douzet and Géry 2020), have led to significant progress.\nAfter the first resolution introduced by Russia in 1998, the General Assembly of the United Nations created a group of governmental experts (GGE) to begin discussions on information and communication technologies (ICTs). Only 15 states were initially represented, including the five permanent members of the Security Council -- due to the format chosen but also to the limited number of countries with competences in the field. Overall, 5 GGEs were successively convened and, when membership was progressively widened, it remained rather limited (25 states in 2016--2017). Only three GGEs agreed on a report -- in 2010 (A/65/201), 2013 (A/68/98) and 2015 (A/74/170) -- as the others couldn't reach a consensus.\nThe content of these three reports illustrates the progressive acknowledgment by states of their own vulnerabilities and of the existence of a systemic risk, on the one hand, and the domination of the geopolitical risk on the systemic risk on the other hand. All of this limits progress in regulating the digital space. It is necessary to note that these reports were only recommendations to the General Assembly and not binding instruments creating obligations for states. They shared a willingness to commit themselves politically without being legally constrained and, as such, acknowledged a need to identify limits to preserve the security and stability of cyberspace.\nIn the 2010 report, states recognised that ‘The global network of ICTs [communication and information technologies] has become an arena for disruptive activity' [para. 4] in which different actors intervene. They recommended reinforcing the cybersecurity capabilities of states, implementing confidence-building measures and a ‘[f]urther dialogue among States to discuss norms pertaining to State use of ICTs, to reduce collective risk and protect critical national and international infrastructure' (para. 18i).\nIn 2013, states recognised for the first time, in an international document, that international law applies to cyberspace: ‘International law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment' (GGE Report 2013, para. 19). This strengthened the territorialisation of digital space, further affirmed in the following paragraph: ‘State sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to State conduct of ICT-related activities, and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory' (ibid, para. 20). The recognition of the applicability of international law in cyberspace led to the delimitation of states' rights and obligations related to cyberoperations because states were now proscribed from conducting operations contrary to their international obligations. For example, they are not allowed to conduct cyberoperations that intervene in the internal affairs of another state; they would otherwise be in violation of the principle of non-intervention.\nThis decision also reflected the willingness of states to inscribe their behaviour in the international legal order. The digital space is therefore no longer a ‘digital Wild West' in which only the law of the strongest dominates, at least in theory. There are rules that derive from international law, but the question is how they should be applied or, in other words, what the rights and duties of states ought to be. But interpreting international law in such a new, complex and dynamic environment poses serious difficulties. For that reason, the member countries of the third GGE recommended the elaboration of ‘norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour by States' to reduce the risks threatening the security and stability of cyberspace. These norms, which are derived from international law according to the report, set out principles or good practices to guide the behaviour of states. The mission entrusted to the fourth GGE, created shortly after the publication of the 2013 report, and which met in 2014 and 2015, was to further develop these norms.\nHowever, this apparent UN consensus hides profound disagreements on the modalities of the regulation of cyberspace, based on the representation of the geopolitical risk, and they can be surmised from the 2015 report. Reading the table of contents, we see the first cracks in the consensus between the states. Indeed, the report includes six parts, the third and sixth respectively dealing with the norms of responsible behaviour of states and international law. Contrary to the 2013 report, a strict separation -- at least in appearance -- is established between the norms and rules of international law. As such, the report highlighted an opposition among states on the necessity to elaborate (or not) new rules of international law to ensure the security of the digital space. On one side, some countries, including the United States, believe that existing international law is enough to regulate behaviour and they demand political commitments instead, via non-binding norms, to translate the expectations of the international community and enable a better predictability of states' behaviour. These norms could be built on existing obligations but without creating new international obligations. On the other side, some states -- such as Russia -- display a more legalist approach to international law and believe that existing law isn't enough to regulate the behaviour of states in cyberspace because of its specificities. New rules, and binding new rights and obligations, are necessary to complete international law, via a treaty (Delerue and Géry 2017). But, by separating norms from questions of international law, the report gives the impression that norms are autonomous and that their implementation isn't dependent on existing obligations set in international law.\nUnderlying this position is the belief that international law is sufficient and does not need to be clarified. And mentioning the purpose and the value of the norms limits their scope: they are non-binding and serve as a standard of measurement to assess the behaviour of states, but are not intended to limit the rights of states (2015 GGE Report, para. 10). They are purely declaratory as they need to be specified to be implemented. Furthermore, the part dedicated to international law only reiterates, to a large extent, what was already written in the 2013 report. Conversely, separating the norms can be interpreted either as a need for new rules or states' willingness to limit their commitment (this is the way Russia interprets it). These two interpretations coexist and highlight the difficult elaboration of a consensus among states (Delerue, Douzet, and Géry 2020).\nThat said, the report did bring notable progress. Indeed, states came to an agreement on a series of non-binding norms to reduce the risks to global peace, security and stability. They forbade cyberoperations causing intentional damage to vital infrastructure and attacks on computer emergency response teams (CERTs). States shouldn't purposely authorise malicious cyberoperations organised from their territory, either. They committed themselves to notifying vulnerabilities in a responsible manner, but also to combating the proliferation of malicious computer technologies and tools, to exchanging information, to providing mutual assistance, and to implementing measures recommended by the General Assembly for the protection of critical infrastructures.\nThe adoption of these norms shows a common willingness to ensure the security and stability of the digital space. But it remains the product of a compromise between states and, more importantly, of the search for an equilibrium to limit systemic risk while continuing to use the digital space for offensive purposes, a realistic principle with regard to the current geopolitical context. The numerous caveats in the formulation of the recommendations, such as the use of the conditional (states should, should not) or the ambiguity in the formulation of proscribed cyberoperations all testify to this balancing act. Hence, the cyberoperations against vitally important infrastructures are not proscribed, but the ones contrary to international law and causing ‘intentional damages' against the infrastructures are.\nThe General Assembly of the United Nations hoped to pursue the discussions with a fifth GGE. But the negotiations failed in 2016--2017 in the face of profound disagreements on international law and its interpretation. The communiqués and statements of the United States, Cuba and Russia highlighted apparent doubts on the applicability of certain clauses of international law (self-defence, law of international responsibility, international humanitarian law) and, more importantly, profound dissensions on the interpretation of these branches of law. They could partly be explained by the particularly tense geopolitical context, marked by the affirmation of state power in cyberspace: accusations of Russian interferences in the American presidential elections, rising informational threats, trade tensions between China and the United States that focused on digital technologies, cyberattacks with systemic propagation, and the beginning of public attributions and retaliating threats. In this context, some states -- notably China -- questioned the scope and potential consequences of their legal commitments. From the outset, this geopolitical context foreshadowed the reluctance of states to agree on progress in the regulation of the digital space. This risk is all the greater because, apart from confidence-building measures and capacity-building, the discussions on international law and norms need to go into a level of detail that could further limit the behaviour of states. Hence, the geopolitical risk brought the negotiations on security and stability in the digital space to a stalemate. As a consequence, non-state actors confronted with systemic risk sought to become directly involved in these discussions through various new initiatives.\n## Much ado about nothing?\nOn 14 February 2017, Brad Smith, the President of Microsoft, called to convene a Digital Geneva Convention. Drawing from the 1949 Geneva Conventions, he invited states to protect infrastructures and citizens from computer attacks in times of peace. He also called for the creation of an international organisation modelled on the International Atomic Energy Agency to handle the attribution of cyberoperations. Meanwhile, during the Munich Security Conference, the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) debuted its work. This independent commission of 28 international experts from the private sector, academia, the technical community and NGOs was created by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the support of prominent companies and several states. It was tasked with offering new norms of responsible behaviour to maintain security and stability in the digital space, which is the objective of its final report presented at the Paris Peace Forum in November 2019. Between 2017 and 2019, these private (Microsoft) and multi-stakeholder (GCSC) settings played an important role in discussions on the security and stability of the digital space. They first maintained these questions on the global agenda through more or less formal contacts between states and international organisations when uncertainty prevailed over the future of international negotiations. They then launched initiatives and elaborated proposals to regulate the digital space. The GCSC listed eight norms of responsible behaviour, several of which were integrated in the Paris Call in November 2018 and in the Cybersecurity Act adopted in May 2019 by the European Union. Other initiatives emerged, such as private commitments (Charter of Trust by Siemens, Cybersecurity Tech Accord by Microsoft) and new NGOs (Cyber Peace Institute).\nAll these initiatives were symptomatic of a willingness among private actors and civil society to get involved in the discussions on a domain of sovereignty and to try to impose the multi-stakeholder model -- long limited to the governance of other aspects of the internet -- on matters of international security. These actors are historically legitimate, technically competent, and they have the necessary resources to ensure the stability and security of cyberspace. The internet was conceived by academic actors and then developed and commercialised by private actors who own most of the infrastructures. Global companies have superior technical capabilities, data and resources compared to those of states and they are often the first to detect attacks and to offer a response. They have become essential partners to ensure the security of states.\nActors from the business and academic sectors, the technical community and civil society are heavily involved in the governance of the internet and their expertise can prove essential due to the technicity of the issues (Ríos Rodríguez 2010), as shown by the Wassenaar Arrangement. The implementation of this agreement regulating the exports of dual-use technologies was limited by its weak definition. Above all, these actors can help push states beyond some of the bottlenecks that limit the development and scope of norms because they have a common interest in the stability of cyberspace and in high user confidence.\nThe culmination of this logic lies in the creation, at the end of 2019, by Microsoft, MasterCard and the Hewlett Foundation, of the Cyber Peace Institute which, without having official attribution power, has an accountability function to evaluate states' respect of international law and of the norms of good behaviour. Similarly, the designation by Microsoft, in January 2020, of a representative for UN-related questions illustrated the company's willingness to directly weigh in into international discussions.\nHowever, these initiatives are limited by the reluctance of many states to leave non-state actors to get involved in the definition of states' rights, obligations and responsibilities. Although they recognise the importance of the multi-stakeholder model of internet governance and the need to closely involve the private sector and civil society in initiatives to promote the security and stability of cyberspace, they defend the exclusive dimension of some of their prerogatives. The role of non-state actors in the security and stability of cyberspace was recognised in 2013 and 2015 by the member states of the GGE, but they nevertheless reasserted their primary responsibility in this area. On the one hand, non-state actors, unless they have a specially granted title, are not allowed to participate in these discussions, because they are not subjects of international law. On the other hand, the representation of cyberspace as a field of confrontation and as an object of national security makes it the sole prerogative of states and limits the willingness of states to involve non-state actors in the discussions.\nIn any case, the input of non-state actors in international discussions has increasingly been recognised globally, even though disparities exist between states. Moreover, states are taking part in many multi-stakeholder forums dealing with issues of security and stability in cyberspace, which are being debated at the Internet Governance Forum, ICANN, but also in diplomatic dialogues and more specific initiatives (London Process, Raisina Dialogue, Sino-European Cyber Dialogue, US--China Cyber Dialogue, Canada--EU Cyber Dialogue and so on). They seek to advance ideas and build consensus outside multilateral processes in order to facilitate international discussions and/or create a balance of power by rallying states and organisations to their positions beforehand. This recognition of the role played by non-state actors is best illustrated by the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace initiated by France and largely promoted by Microsoft. The Paris Call -- not endorsed by the United States, China or Russia -- testifies to the signatories' public commitment to ensuring the security and stability of cyberspace globally.\nIt was not until a little over a year after the failure of the UN negotiations that new proposals emerged. And the way discussions resumed was emblematic of the tensions between two apprehensions of the risks in a deteriorated geopolitical context. Indeed, two processes (an open-ended working group and a group of governmental experts) actually debuted almost simultaneously in the autumn of 2019, one led by Russia, the other by the United States, with largely overlapping mandates. In October 2018, Russia introduced a new resolution on ICTs in the context of international security, listing several norms of behaviour and proposing to convene an open-ended working group (OEWG), i.e. a negotiation setting open to all UN member states. The First Commission at the UN was then the theatre of a sharp confrontation between the supporters of the Russian proposal and Western states which, in reaction, proposed their own draft resolution, offering another GGE restricted to 25 states. Despite important modifications on the Russian project, the United States -- followed by the European Union -- didn't withdraw its draft, leading to the adoption of two resolutions, amidst heightened tensions, by the General Assembly on 5 and 22 December 2018 (A/RES/73/27 and A/RES/73/266). A large majority of states voted in favour of the two resolutions which nevertheless reflected a deep divide between the major powers, both on their objectives and on the means of achieving them. Indeed, Russia hasn't renounced its original objective, stated in 1998, of a treaty to underpin the negotiations in the working group.\nInterestingly, the working group shepherded by Russia is the one consulting non-state actors (companies, NGOs...), some of which (but not all) also demand a treaty. On the contrary, the GGE only consults regional state organisations. This fracture was accentuated in December 2019 when the General Assembly adopted a new Russian-led resolution (A/RES/74/247) that created a new negotiation process responsible for elaborating a treaty on cybercrime. Western countries are strongly opposed to it because they believe that the 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, open for signature to states not belonging to the Council of Europe, and already ratified by 64 states, should be universalised instead.\nThese two negotiation processes have been produced by major geopolitical tensions, in a context in which the United States is being offensive while denouncing, with several of their global partners, Russian and Chinese cyberoperations. For their part, countries such as Russia and China -- even though they have adopted different strategies (Broeders, Adamson, and Creemers 2019) -- fully take advantage of the offensive potentialities offered by networks while they call for limits on the militarisation of the digital space. Europe, for its part, seeks to offer a third path, but with limited opposition to the United States, which remains its main ally. That said, Europe is plagued by its own dissensions.\nTo many observers' surprise, the OEWG adopted its final report on 12 March 2021, demonstrating that despite the context of strategic competition exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic, states were still able to achieve consensus. The report consolidates the achievements of the previous GGEs, encourages more transparency in the implementation of the recommendations of the 2015 GGE report and promotes the pursuit of international negotiations. It also shows some progress, such as the recognition of health infrastructures as critical infrastructures that need to be protected, along with the integrity and the general availability of the internet. However, many contentious points persist as revealed by the Chair's summary, published with the report, that contains most of the state propositions that were not adopted by the OEWG, short of a consensus between states.\nIn addition, states rushed to launch the next round of international negotiations even before the two processes had finalised their respective reports. France proposed a programme of action within the OEWG to merge the two processes into a single one that could provide incremental progress as opposed to requiring a final consensus report. But Russia and its allies sponsored a UNGA resolution launching a new OEWG in October 2020. The same day, the United States and its allies sponsored another resolution, that acknowledges the ongoing negotiations, leaving the door open for further negotiations as the GGE is scheduled to achieve its report in May 2021. Both resolutions were adopted by the UNGA in December 2020. In addition to the OEWG being renewed, the GGE could potentially be continued and a new programme of action created depending on what states propose at the UNGA's 76th session, starting in October 2021.\nThe landscape of international negotiations is thus becoming particularly crowded and even confused, with a multiplication of actors, initiatives and proposals aimed at promoting peace and stability in cyberspace. It risks leading to inconsistencies or ambiguities that would leave room for states to pursue their hijinks with relative impunity, even if the two groups' chairs have worked together to reach a consensus and limit contradictions. However, this proliferation is creating a dynamic that is making it possible for states and all actors to become more aware of the risks and challenges associated with the proliferation of cyberweapons. But it is also part of a geopolitical context that is particularly conducive to an arms race.\n## Conclusion Cyberspace has thus become a field of confrontations between states during the 2010s, to the point of becoming a military domain in its own right for many of them, which have engaged in a cyberweapons race. The proliferation of cyber operations and offensive tools has contributed to increasing the scope and sophistication of the threat they face in the digital space. The tools and attack concepts they have developed have escaped them and are increasingly turned against them, the vulnerabilities they exploit in adversary systems also affect the systems of their own companies and institutions, which can become strategic targets. Last but not least, the uncontrolled spread of certain attacks has had devastating consequences that raise important ethical, legal and economic liability issues but also awareness of the systemic risk that proliferation poses to the security and stability of cyberspace.\nFor these reasons, and despite a notably tense geopolitical context, states have chosen to resume international discussions on security and stability in cyberspace, and have taken part in multiple initiatives with private actors and civil society to try to contain the threat. And yet, we cannot but note that the representation of cyberthreat as a geopolitical risk continues to predominate over the representation of systemic risk, leading some states room for offensive operations, in order to ensure their own power in cyberspace, which they see as a condition for their security.\nAt the time of writing, negotiations are still ongoing at the UN, and it is difficult to predict their outcome. In the end, it will depend on what states perceive as their primary interest: to curb systemic threat or to continue waging wars. Whatever the outcome of the negotiations, systemic risk will necessarily remain high because of the divergent strategic interests among states and because the exploitation of a network vulnerability by one actor for a specific purpose is in fact exploited by all and for multiple purposes. It also shows that, whatever the initiatives and propositions made, cyberspace JOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY # remains, first and foremost, used to wage war, and its regulation remains the product of the 'external legal policies' (Ladreit de Lacharrière 1983) of states, thus ultimately a byproduct of the defence of their respective interests."

In April 2018, UNESCO had previously hosted a symposium convened by the National Cybersecurity Agency of France (ANSSI) and the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs entitled 'Building international peace and security in the digital society'. These initiatives were in line with the numerous others that have been carried out globally by governments, civil society and major digital companies since the early 2010s.

    "at the United Nations General Assembly to address ‘Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security'. As the strongest advocate for an international treaty on cyberspace, Russia has since sponsored a resolution almost every year, while other international dialogues and processes have progressively been established. How can we explain such activism? Very simply because cyberspace is used -- first and foremost -- to wage wars.\n\nBeyond a pleasant homage to its author, the analogy to Yves Lacoste's seminal work La géographie, ça sert, d'abord, à faire la guerre (1976), is justified by the apparent explosion of conflict in cyberspace, which has become a new vector for geopolitical rivalries and even a new military field in the strategies and doctrines of many nations. It has also increasingly been militarised -- a set of social, political and economic processes have made a military approach to solving cyber problems more acceptable (Rech et al. 2014) -- with the proliferation of weapons and threats that now structure its evolution and regulation. Obviously, cyberspace wasn't invented to wage wars and isn't only used for that (Douzet and Desforges 2018). We can even say that the attacks conducted until today have remained below the threshold of war according to international law. However, setting severity thresholds has been made more difficult by the boldness and provocations of the most enterprising protagonists (Forteau 2019). Cyberspace has altogether revolutionised our modes of life, disrupted our economies, and enabled important progress in our societies. But the benefits brought by the digital revolution are now threatened by a sharp increase in the number and sophistication of malicious acts in cyberspace.\n\nFirst, the use of cyberspace for offensive purposes, by states and a diverse array of other actors, entails the risk of conflict escalation and of a destabilisation of our societies that, in turn, threatens international peace and security. Evidently, the catastrophic scenarios of ‘digital Pearl Harbors' or massive deadly attacks on vital infrastructures, which were popular worries in the early 2010s, haven't materialised. But several attacks have been uncontrollably propagated throughout the world, highlighting the potentially devastating threat of conflict in cyberspace and the systemic risks it entails. The proliferation of cyberweapons -- i.e. malicious tools to conduct cyberattacks -- threatens the stability of cyberspace, on which our societies have grown increasingly dependent, because its underlying infrastructures are constantly targeted. Cyberspace is also increasingly used to conduct digital influence and subversion operations. However, in most cases, the weaponization of information does not involve cyberattacks that could contribute to the proliferation of cyberweapons.\n\nSecond, in an unstable geopolitical context marked by a persistent terrorist threat, weakened multilateral institutions and the evident return of a strategic competition between large powers, states hold onto their ability to act and aren't ready to abandon certain practices that otherwise threaten the security and stability of cyberspace. This context of distrust and power rivalries limits global cooperation and constitutes a rein on efforts to adopt the necessary regulation to ensure the security and stability of cyberspace in the face of a systemic risk -- and also questions the very notion of security in cyberspace.\n\nHow can we define a threat to national or international security in cyberspace? What does the ‘security of cyberspace' mean? These questions provoke debates and oppose a multiplicity of points of views among state and non-state protagonists. The notion of securitisation developed by Barry Buzan and Ole Wæver in the 1990s -- that is, the way in which a political actor seizes upon an object that he treats, in his speeches, as a security",
    "issue in order to justify the sometimes extraordinary means of defending it -- offers an interesting analytical framework in this context (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998). It brings a better understanding of the complexity of international discussions that involve multiple actors, starting with states, to define security in cyberspace, what is necessary to implement it, and the underlying political choices it implies.\n\nThis article explores the security dilemma faced by states when dealing with cyber issues and the ambivalence of the notion of security in cyberspace. It shows how, within a decade, cyberspace has become a battlefield and an absolute strategic priority for many states, leading them to view it as a geopolitical threat to their national security. Hence, they have endorsed its militarisation despite a progressive understanding of the systemic risk that results from the proliferation of offensive weapons and operations. This dilemma lies at the heart of the ongoing tensions in multilateral discussions on the regulation of cyberspace, in which non-state actors have invited themselves through a multitude of initiatives that demonstrate the importance of the stakes but also the difficulties in dealing with them.\n\n## The emergence of a new military domain\n\nThe representation of cyberspace as a new military domain emerged during the 2010s, the last step in the territorialisation of cyberspace by states in reaction to the multiplication of the strategic surprises they had faced there since the late 2000s. The territorialisation of cyberspace, which had been initiated by pioneers of the internet to represent the digital space and protect it from the geopolitical rivalries that prevailed in the physical world, became an imperative of securitisation quickly associated with its militarisation in the discourse of states (Desforges 2014; Dunn Cavelty 2008; Haddad 2018).\n\nThis association between cyberattacks and the militarisation of cyberspace was, however, not self-evident based on the growing challenges posed by the cybercrimes perpetrated by non-state actors against private and individual interests. And it could have become the focus of attention. Instead, states have built a representation of cyberspace first and foremost as a threat to their national security at the expense of other characterisation, such as a criminal danger, an economic risk or a threat to individual user security and privacy. (Dunn Cavelty 2012; Nissenbaum 2005). As a consequence, even though states have tackled the overall issues of cybersecurity and cybercrime, they have structured their strategies mostly under the umbrella of national security, primarily reinforced military means of action (both defensive and offensive) and subsequently designated enemies in cyberspace, an eminently political act (Rid and Buchanan 2015).\n\nThis militarisation of cyberspace can be partly explained by a deeper understanding of the internet and of digital technologies among defence protagonists, which allowed them to better foresee threats and publicise them. As they quickly allocated funds to this new field, they took part in defining state priorities on questions of national security. That said, it is the increasing number of state-sponsored attacks conducted for strategic reasons, together with the growing digitalisation of the battlefield, and the new opportunities arising from the association of digital operations with other traditional weapons, that led to the representation of cyberspace as a military battlefield. That representation has been predominant in Western democracies yet immediately contested by China",
    "and Russia, who have regularly denounced the risks of a militarisation of cyberspace, in which they have fully participated, however, according to the volume of cyberattacks officially attributed to them. Both countries had initially preferred the concept of informational space -- or information security -- to cyberspace, which reflects both their perception of the threat as being primarily informational and their priority of ensuring the stability of their political regimes (Goldsmith and Wu 2006; Limonier 2018). Their military doctrines have however considered this space as a strategic domain from the outset, even before Western countries. The most prominent cyber powers -- starting with the United States, France and the United Kingdom -- have since characterised cyberspace as the fifth military domain after land, sea, air and space. In turn, NATO recognised cyberspace as an operational military domain in 2016 (Ablon et al. 2019).\n\nThe pertinence of this representation has led to intense debates in the academic literature due to the specificities of cyberspace. Martin Libicki first denounced this label as inadequate to understand this hyper-dynamic environment in permanent and rapid reconfiguration, the plasticity of which requires constant adaptation and great agility (Libicki 2012). He noted that this development brought us back to classic concepts of warfare such as ‘control, manoeuvre, superiority' whereas control is illusory in cyberspace and armies don't manoeuvre in the same battlefield as their enemies. Indeed, the latter can reduce their vulnerabilities and limit the impact of an attack through measures of cyberdefence. Hence, the success of an attack in cyberspace partly depends on targets that evolve rapidly and dynamically.\n\nFurthermore, there is no academic consensus on the very notion of cyberwar, despite its large media and political echo. In his book Cyber War Will Not Take Place, Thomas Rid (2013, 37) stated that past operations couldn't be labelled warfare because an ‘act of war must be instrumental, political, and potentially lethal'. And even if a future cyberattack were to meet these criteria, the response would most likely not be confined to cyberspace but escalate into a kinetic conflict. Ultimately, these attacks were only more sophisticated versions -- involving malicious code -- of methods as old as war: espionage, sabotage and subversion. Even from the perspective of international law, the only operation that could have qualified as an act of war -- but wasn't declared one by the Iranian government -- was the Stuxnet attack against the nuclear centrifuges at Natanz in 2010. According to the New York Times, the attack was led by the United States with the help of Israeli intelligence services (Sanger 2012; Zetter 2014). To this day, no state has officially denounced an act of war in cyberspace.\n\nThe threshold of what is acceptable -- and accepted -- in terms of offensive operations also seems to be constantly pushed back, in view of the increasingly open hostilities conducted by states that push their advantage in cyberspace without necessarily triggering a forceful response. Current debates here suggest that it is a matter of time, more than a matter of threshold, before cyberwar reaches its cruising speed. But the reality is more complex. On the one hand, states show a certain restraint compared to their full capacity for action, which enables them to remain below the threshold for triggering an open conflict, despite testing this limit. On the other hand, the use of cyber operations is most often part of a combination of modes of action -- technical and non-technical, online and offline, direct and indirect, state and non-state -- which adds to the fog around (cyber)warfare, as it is not always clear where it starts and where it ends.\n\nHere, the only certainty is that cyber operations have now been integrated into the arsenal of the largest armies, supporting all the existing means used in the conduct of",
    "war. But the clear risk of conflict escalation between nuclear powers have also led to constant and ambiguous confrontations between antagonist state actors into the grey zone, below the threshold of war -- a peacetime competition that opposes in particular Russia to Western democracies. As a result, cyberspace has become a new space of confrontation in the geopolitical power rivalries that oppose a multitude of actors, leading to the proliferation of operations -- the most sophisticated of which come from states -- and eventually to the materialisation of cyberwar.\n\n## The ‘materialisation of cyber war': a series of strategic surprises\n\nAccording to Robert Kaiser, the 2007 cyberattacks against Estonia were a catalyst for the ‘materialisation of cyber war' as a new policy object -- even though no attack has yet been said to reach the threshold of an armed attack and been qualified as an act of war -- that keeps influencing the way states perceive future threats of cyberwar (Kaiser 2015). These attacks occurred as protests proliferated among the Russian minority against the decision to move the statue of the Bronze Soldier in Tallinn. These DDOS attacks paralysed the websites of numerous organisations in the country, including banks, media outlets, ministries and the parliament. The following year, in July 2008, a wave of cyberattacks against Georgian websites preceded the arrival of Russian tanks in the country, the first known cyberattack combined with a land military operation. Despite their rudimentary nature, the public and spectacular dimension of these attacks forced states to come to term with them. Since then, cyberattacks have multiplied and, more importantly, they have become more targeted, sophisticated, creative and damaging, leading states to constantly adapt themselves to an evolving landscape of threats, marked by a succession of strategic surprises and a constant expansion of scope.\n\nIn 2010, Stuxnet became the first major attack against a critical infrastructure, in a joint attempt by the United States and Israel to halt the Iranian nuclear programme. In 2013, Edward Snowden's revelations disclosed that American espionage techniques could reach an unprecedented depth on an unsuspected scale thanks to the global interconnection of information and communication systems. Other countries -- including European states -- had to acknowledge their dependency on US digital platforms and technologies. The attacks that targeted the entertainment company Sony Pictures in 2014 took the American government completely by surprise: strategic attacks could also target large firms now. The 2015 attack against TV5 Monde in France reiterated that possibility.\n\nThen, in 2015, the Islamic State surprised everyone with its sophisticated use of social networks to distribute its propaganda, encourage online radicalisation, find new recruits, raise money, organise departures to Syria, and prepare terrorist attacks. It forced Western democracies, which had focused on technical attacks, to widen their approach to take informational operations into account as well. But it didn't prevent the American administration from being taken by surprise by the interferences attributed to Russia that occurred during the 2016 presidential campaign, for which they were evidently not prepared (François and Lin 2020). Operations of information manipulation interfering with, or destabilising, democratic countries are now under the spotlight.\n\nIn 2016, a long-feared scenario materialised when the servers of the company Dyn were attacked after its network of connected objects (cameras, printers ...) was manipulated, expanding the field of vulnerabilities and the vectors of attacks. Finally, the",
    "WannaCry and NotPetya attacks in 2017 inaugurated an era of massive propagating attacks, both swift and uncontrollable, and caused the greatest damage ever recorded by indiscriminately affecting dozens of companies and institutions in more than 150 countries that had not been initially targeted. It stressed the need to protect the systems but also to be able to react quickly to block a rapid contamination. This systemic risk is linked to the interconnection of digital networks.\n\nThese strategic surprises highlighted the vulnerability, and the unpreparedness, of states -- including the most advanced ones -- as they faced a ever-changing threat. They forcefully influenced the representation of cyberspace as a new military field that required the mobilisation of exceptional resources in the name of national security. This representation led to an institutional reorganisation: many countries created cybersecurity agencies and cybercommands within their armed forces to prepare their cyberdefence. It also encouraged the development of new offensive tools to be used for intelligence or surveillance, or during military operations. The inhibitions against such a dynamic arms race, during which countries strengthen their power, have paradoxically been loosened following Edward Snowden's revelations, as many states started claiming the development of offensive capabilities. For example, the cyber strategy of the Trump administration unambiguously endorsed the proliferation of offensive tools, as well as the penetration of digital systems to deter adversaries (Smeets 2020; Taillat 2020). In addition, the revelations spurred many countries in Europe and around the world into investing more in digital intelligence capabilities and boosting the commercial marketplace of digital surveillance technologies. The exportation of such technologies has, in some cases, permitted population surveillance by states that had not yet developed their own capabilities for the purpose of detecting and managing threats to the stability of their regime.\n\nHence, the ‘materialisation of cyber war' during the past decade has reinforced the securitization and militarisation of cyberspace that debuted during the 2000s. The notion of security remains ambiguous because, as noted by Dunn Cavelty (2012), the military conception of security can be associated with serious risks. The tools developed by the states to ensure their national security can increase the risks they are exposed to, especially in cyberspace as we will see later. They can also bring about insecurity in other domains of security -- economic, social or political (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998). Information and communication networks are shared by institutions, civil society and the economic and military spheres. Thus, cyberspace offers a multitude of complex interactions and interconnections between these areas where issues are overlapping. Hence, cyberspace is used by a multitude of actors for different ends, and their interests and representations of security may prove widely divergent. The debate over encryption illustrates the profound antagonisms generated by digital technologies between the different actors of security (Gasser et al. 2016), putting the proponents of encryption to protect states' and companies' secrets against the proponents of an access to data limited to the courts or the police, and even against the proponents of deeper protections for personal data and civil liberties (East West Institute 2018). Within a government, divergent conceptions of security can coexist and sometimes oppose each other, as different ministries and agencies implement different (sometimes contradictory) security objectives in cyberspace.\n\nLikewise, there is no uniform representation of cyberspace among states. On the contrary, it depends on the geopolitical context, the relationships between regional powers, on the level of development of the digital economy, on cyberdefence capabilities, and on",
    "their strategic culture. Besides, representations are shaped by imbalances in commanding technologies, infrastructures, data flows, or on the ability to act in the digital space. For instance, cyberspace is first and foremost an issue of connectivity and economic development in many African countries, but also a territory where cybercrime needs to be fought. Among authoritarian regimes, the informational dimension of cyberspace is seen as the main threat against political stability, as it opens a space for the expression of dissident opinions, the propagation of rumours and the risk of subversion.\n\nBut the military representation of cyberspace predominates in large Western countries that have advanced capabilities and a central role in international negotiations. They also influence political decision-makers at the expense of other approaches to risks that could better take into account the security of private actors and individual users. Finally, this militarisation of cyberspace also invites risks of which states are progressively growing aware, but they face a security dilemma.\n\n## Geopolitical risk v. systemic risk: states' security dilemma\n\nStates have become aware of the risks of proliferation as tools they have developed are used against them. In the digital sphere, offensive tools can be stolen, copied, retrieved, analysed, transformed, reused and repurposed, as the examples of the Shadow Brokers or Vault 7 have shown (Buchanan 2020). New offensive concepts and tactics can be imitated and re-employed. In other words, cyberattacks are liable to teach lessons and to improve the capabilities of their adversaries. A classified NSA document from 2013 divulged by Edward Snowden and published in The Intercept in 2015 confirmed what many had feared before: the Iranian regime learned from the cyberattacks it had suffered and it used this knowledge to improve its own capabilities (Zetter 2014). The report specified that Iran probably imitated the offensive techniques of an attack against its oil industry to launch the Shamoon attack against Saudi Aramco in 2012 which sabotaged 30,000 computers in one stroke. Hence, proliferation leads to improved skills among actors, including adversaries and criminals, and directly participates in the heightened sophistication of attacks and in the threats against the whole digital environment.\n\nFurthermore, because technologies and networks are shared by armies, private actors, institutions and civil society, these attacks are liable to propagate quickly, and sometimes uncontrollably. The risk of uncontrollable collateral damage is a serious hindrance to the work of armies in the digital space; for instance, the notion of a ‘surgical' attack appears to be a contradiction in terms, as the interactions and interconnections between the systems and their points of vulnerability are difficult to anticipate on this territory. The Stuxnet virus, specifically conceived for the Natanz nuclear infrastructure as it wasn't connected to the internet, did propagate through cyberspace, probably though a USB key. Although Stuxnet did not unleash its payload on third-party victims' computers, part of its code was later reused in other cyberattacks, hence demonstrating that highly targeted code is no guarantee against proliferation.\n\nThe WannaCry and NotPetya attacks were emblematic of the systemic risk posed by the proliferation of cyberweapons in our societies. These attacks were rapidly and uncontrollably propagated throughout the world, targeting hospitals and causing hundreds of millions of euros' worth of damage for companies that weren't initially targeted. In May 2017, the ransomware WannaCry infected more than 200,000 computers in 150 countries until",
    "the discovery of a kill switch stopped it. Subsequent investigations brought the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia to dismiss the possibility of a criminal endeavour and they attributed the attack to North Korea. The NotPetya attack, which initially resembled a ransomware attack, was entirely conceived to sabotage systems. The White House estimated that this sole attack cost $10 billion, the most devastating ever, and it was attributed to Russia, first by the United Kingdom, and then by the other Five Eyes countries. These two attacks used EternalBlue, an offensive tool that took advantage of a Microsoft vulnerability and was developed by the NSA. This tool was stolen from the NSA, made publicly available online, and later used by other actors to launch attacks that propagated uncontrollably and hit the very country that created this offensive tool.\n\nThese attacks thus demonstrated the security dilemma faced by states regarding offensive operations in cyberspace (Segal ; Buchanan) and which pit two non-exclusive (but coexisting) representations of cyber risk against each other, leading to complex tensions and sometimes irreconcilable objectives between and within governments.\n\nOn the one hand, the states see a cyberthreat as systemic: an extremely complex, cross-border risk, not necessarily of state origin, which, like pandemics, can spread very rapidly, be very difficult to stop and cause massive damage. It is therefore in the interest of all actors to stop contagions that could have disastrous consequences. This approach to risks calls for enhanced cooperation between governments -- but also within governments and between private and public actors -- and arms control, in the common interest of system stability.\n\nOn the other hand, a cyberthreat is primarily a geopolitical threat for states because the offensive tools are used by their adversaries but also by their allies and economic rivals to increase their power through espionage, influence, or even military operations. Focusing on this risk takes states in the opposite direction: enhancing their offensive arsenal, limiting cooperation and protecting their sovereign capabilities. This approach clearly dominates the representations of states with the most advanced capabilities, as seen in the ongoing race for cyberweapons and in the offensive doctrines they have developed recently (Buchanan).\n\nThe dominant representation of the geopolitical risk is a source of distrust among states and it encourages them to reinforce their ‘territorial' control over cyberspace as well as their sovereign capabilities. It limits their ability to come to an agreement on the modalities for regulating states' behaviour in cyberspace and interpreting international law. It also explains why international discussions exclude a central issue linked to the offensive practices of states: espionage. That said, the search for an equilibrium between the two approaches is at the heart of the international intergovernmental discussions on the regulation of cyberspace as states start to acknowledge their own vulnerability in the face of systemic risk.\n\n## Diplomats launched an attack on the ‘digital far west'\n\nFor years, the most advanced states took advantage of the opacity of the digital space to discretely conduct offensive operations with impunity. But with the materialisation of cyber-war and the multiplication of large-scale attacks that targeted them, states have progressively acknowledged the risks they are exposed to -- and which are now becoming systemic.",
    "First, the technology is both more widely accessible and less expensive, making it available to a larger number of state and non-state actors, all increasingly enterprising and creative in how they use it. The 2010s were marked by a diversification of targets -- strategic attacks against private companies -- of actors involved, with sometimes blurry relations to state authorities, and of the operating modes as attackers are only limited by their imagination in hijacking digital technologies. Threats are more pressing, complex, protean and unpredictable.\n\nIn fact, the digital transformation of societies makes them increasingly dependent on cyberspace, the stability of which is now essential to their proper functioning. But the multiplication of badly-secured connected objects, the embedded computing in medical devices, vehicles and even in military armament, constantly expands the space that can be targeted. In other words, the more connected and dependent on data a society is, the more points of vulnerability there are. The rise of quantum computing -- which promises to revolutionise encryption by increasing computing power -- and of artificial intelligence suggests sophisticated and potentially destabilising attacks, even though these technologies could also be used to improve cybersecurity.\n\nStates are thus faced with the same type of dilemma as when they became aware of the dangers of nuclear power. Except that digital technology is within the reach of many actors (not only states), it is easier to steal and reuse than a nuclear missile, and it is by nature dual-use and ubiquitous, which makes controlling the possession of offensive tools and organising verification impossible. It therefore requires a totally different approach to counter-proliferation. But because it can turn against the states that develop it, at the risk of threatening international security and the very stability of cyberspace, it raises the question of systemic risk, which was at the heart of the balance of terror doctrine. This risk led states, at the end of the 1990s, to initiate discussions on the regulation of cyberspace which, after years of stalemate (Maurer 2011) and the change of posture of the United States in favour of multilateralism under the Obama administration (Douzet and Géry 2020), have led to significant progress.\n\nAfter the first resolution introduced by Russia in 1998, the General Assembly of the United Nations created a group of governmental experts (GGE) to begin discussions on information and communication technologies (ICTs). Only 15 states were initially represented, including the five permanent members of the Security Council -- due to the format chosen but also to the limited number of countries with competences in the field. Overall, 5 GGEs were successively convened and, when membership was progressively widened, it remained rather limited (25 states in 2016--2017). Only three GGEs agreed on a report -- in 2010 (A/65/201), 2013 (A/68/98) and 2015 (A/74/170) -- as the others couldn't reach a consensus.\n\nThe content of these three reports illustrates the progressive acknowledgment by states of their own vulnerabilities and of the existence of a systemic risk, on the one hand, and the domination of the geopolitical risk on the systemic risk on the other hand. All of this limits progress in regulating the digital space. It is necessary to note that these reports were only recommendations to the General Assembly and not binding instruments creating obligations for states. They shared a willingness to commit themselves politically without being legally constrained and, as such, acknowledged a need to identify limits to preserve the security and stability of cyberspace.",
    "In the 2010 report, states recognised that ‘The global network of ICTs [communication and information technologies] has become an arena for disruptive activity' [para. 4] in which different actors intervene. They recommended reinforcing the cybersecurity capabilities of states, implementing confidence-building measures and a ‘[f]urther dialogue among States to discuss norms pertaining to State use of ICTs, to reduce collective risk and protect critical national and international infrastructure' (para. 18i).\n\nIn 2013, states recognised for the first time, in an international document, that international law applies to cyberspace: ‘International law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment' (GGE Report 2013, para. 19). This strengthened the territorialisation of digital space, further affirmed in the following paragraph: ‘State sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to State conduct of ICT-related activities, and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory' (ibid, para. 20). The recognition of the applicability of international law in cyberspace led to the delimitation of states' rights and obligations related to cyberoperations because states were now proscribed from conducting operations contrary to their international obligations. For example, they are not allowed to conduct cyberoperations that intervene in the internal affairs of another state; they would otherwise be in violation of the principle of non-intervention (Delerue 2020).\n\nThis decision also reflected the willingness of states to inscribe their behaviour in the international legal order. The digital space is therefore no longer a ‘digital Wild West' in which only the law of the strongest dominates, at least in theory. There are rules that derive from international law, but the question is how they should be applied or, in other words, what the rights and duties of states ought to be. But interpreting international law in such a new, complex and dynamic environment poses serious difficulties. For that reason, the member countries of the third GGE recommended the elaboration of ‘norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour by States' to reduce the risks threatening the security and stability of cyberspace. These norms, which are derived from international law according to the report, set out principles or good practices to guide the behaviour of states. The mission entrusted to the fourth GGE, created shortly after the publication of the 2013 report, and which met in 2014 and 2015, was to further develop these norms.\n\nHowever, this apparent UN consensus hides profound disagreements on the modalities of the regulation of cyberspace, based on the representation of the geopolitical risk, and they can be surmised from the 2015 report. Reading the table of contents, we see the first cracks in the consensus between the states. Indeed, the report includes six parts, the third and sixth respectively dealing with the norms of responsible behaviour of states and international law. Contrary to the 2013 report, a strict separation -- at least in appearance -- is established between the norms and rules of international law. As such, the report highlighted an opposition among states on the necessity to elaborate (or not) new rules of international law to ensure the security of the digital space. On one side, some countries, including the United States, believe that existing international law is enough to regulate behaviour and they demand political commitments instead, via non-binding norms, to translate the expectations of the international community and enable a better predictability of states' behaviour. These norms could be built on existing",
    "obligations but without creating new international obligations. On the other side, some states -- such as Russia -- display a more legalist approach to international law and believe that existing law isn't enough to regulate the behaviour of states in cyberspace because of its specificities. New rules, and binding new rights and obligations, are necessary to complete international law, via a treaty (Delerue and Géry 2017). But, by separating norms from questions of international law, the report gives the impression that norms are autonomous and that their implementation isn't dependent on existing obligations set in international law.\n\nUnderlying this position is the belief that international law is sufficient and does not need to be clarified. And mentioning the purpose and the value of the norms limits their scope: they are non-binding and serve as a standard of measurement to assess the behaviour of states, but are not intended to limit the rights of states (2015 GGE Report, para. 10). They are purely declaratory as they need to be specified to be implemented. Furthermore, the part dedicated to international law only reiterates, to a large extent, what was already written in the 2013 report. Conversely, separating the norms can be interpreted either as a need for new rules or states' willingness to limit their commitment (this is the way Russia interprets it). These two interpretations coexist and highlight the difficult elaboration of a consensus among states (Delerue, Douzet, and Géry 2020).\n\nThat said, the report did bring notable progress. Indeed, states came to an agreement on a series of non-binding norms to reduce the risks to global peace, security and stability. They forbade cyberoperations causing intentional damage to vital infrastructure and attacks on computer emergency response teams (CERTs). States shouldn't purposely authorise malicious cyberoperations organised from their territory, either. They committed themselves to notifying vulnerabilities in a responsible manner, but also to combating the proliferation of malicious computer technologies and tools, to exchanging information, to providing mutual assistance, and to implementing measures recommended by the General Assembly for the protection of critical infrastructures.\n\nThe adoption of these norms shows a common willingness to ensure the security and stability of the digital space. But it remains the product of a compromise between states and, more importantly, of the search for an equilibrium to limit systemic risk while continuing to use the digital space for offensive purposes, a realistic principle with regard to the current geopolitical context (Lewis 2018). The numerous caveats in the formulation of the recommendations, such as the use of the conditional (states should, should not) or the ambiguity in the formulation of proscribed cyberoperations all testify to this balancing act. Hence, the cyberoperations against vitally important infrastructures are not proscribed, but the ones contrary to international law and causing ‘intentional damages' against the infrastructures are.\n\nThe General Assembly of the United Nations hoped to pursue the discussions with a fifth GGE. But the negotiations failed in 2016--2017 in the face of profound disagreements on international law and its interpretation. The communiqués and statements of the United States, Cuba and Russia highlighted apparent doubts on the applicability of certain clauses of international law (self-defence, law of international responsibility, international humanitarian law) and, more importantly, profound dissensions on the interpretation of these branches of law. They could partly be explained by the particularly tense geopolitical context, marked by the affirmation of state power in cyberspace: accusations",
    "of Russian interferences in the American presidential elections, rising informational threats, trade tensions between China and the United States that focused on digital technologies, cyberattacks with systemic propagation, and the beginning of public attributions and retaliating threats. In this context, some states -- notably China -- questioned the scope and potential consequences of their legal commitments. From the outset, this geopolitical context foreshadowed the reluctance of states to agree on progress in the regulation of the digital space. This risk is all the greater because, apart from confidence-building measures and capacity-building, the discussions on international law and norms need to go into a level of detail that could further limit the behaviour of states. Hence, the geopolitical risk brought the negotiations on security and stability in the digital space to a stalemate. As a consequence, non-state actors confronted with systemic risk sought to become directly involved in these discussions through various new initiatives.\n\n## Much ado about nothing?\n\nOn 14 February 2017, Brad Smith, the President of Microsoft, called to convene a Digital Geneva Convention. Drawing from the 1949 Geneva Conventions, he invited states to protect infrastructures and citizens from computer attacks in times of peace. He also called for the creation of an international organisation modelled on the International Atomic Energy Agency to handle the attribution of cyberoperations. Meanwhile, during the Munich Security Conference, the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) debuted its work. This independent commission of 28 international experts from the private sector, academia, the technical community and NGOs was created by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the support of prominent companies and several states. It was tasked with offering new norms of responsible behaviour to maintain security and stability in the digital space, which is the objective of its final report presented at the Paris Peace Forum in November 2019. Between 2017 and 2019, these private (Microsoft) and multi-stakeholder (GCSC) settings played an important role in discussions on the security and stability of the digital space. They first maintained these questions on the global agenda through more or less formal contacts between states and international organisations when uncertainty prevailed over the future of international negotiations. They then launched initiatives and elaborated proposals to regulate the digital space. The GCSC listed eight norms of responsible behaviour, several of which were integrated in the Paris Call in November 2018 and in the Cybersecurity Act adopted in May 2019 by the European Union. Other initiatives emerged, such as private commitments (Charter of Trust by Siemens, Cybersecurity Tech Accord by Microsoft) and new NGOs (Cyber Peace Institute).\n\nAll these initiatives were symptomatic of a willingness among private actors and civil society to get involved in the discussions on a domain of sovereignty and to try to impose the multi-stakeholder model -- long limited to the governance of other aspects of the internet -- on matters of international security. These actors are historically legitimate, technically competent, and they have the necessary resources to ensure the stability and security of cyberspace. The internet was conceived by academic actors and then developed and commercialised by private actors who own most of the infrastructures. Global companies have superior technical capabilities, data and resources compared to",
    "those of states and they are often the first to detect attacks and to offer a response. They have become essential partners to ensure the security of states.\n\nActors from the business and academic sectors, the technical community and civil society are heavily involved in the governance of the internet and their expertise can prove essential due to the technicity of the issues (Ríos Rodríguez 2010), as shown by the Wassenaar Arrangement. The implementation of this agreement regulating the exports of dual-use technologies was limited by its weak definition. Above all, these actors can help push states beyond some of the bottlenecks that limit the development and scope of norms because they have a common interest in the stability of cyberspace and in high user confidence.\n\nThe culmination of this logic lies in the creation, at the end of 2019, by Microsoft, MasterCard and the Hewlett Foundation, of the Cyber Peace Institute which, without having official attribution power, has an accountability function to evaluate states' respect of international law and of the norms of good behaviour. Similarly, the designation by Microsoft, in January 2020, of a representative for UN-related questions illustrated the company's willingness to directly weigh in into international discussions.\n\nHowever, these initiatives are limited by the reluctance of many states to leave non-state actors to get involved in the definition of states' rights, obligations and responsibilities. Although they recognise the importance of the multi-stakeholder model of internet governance and the need to closely involve the private sector and civil society in initiatives to promote the security and stability of cyberspace, they defend the exclusive dimension of some of their prerogatives. The role of non-state actors in the security and stability of cyberspace was recognised in 2013 and 2015 by the member states of the GGE, but they nevertheless reasserted their primary responsibility in this area. On the one hand, non-state actors, unless they have a specially granted title, are not allowed to participate in these discussions, because they are not subjects of international law. On the other hand, the representation of cyberspace as a field of confrontation and as an object of national security makes it the sole prerogative of states and limits the willingness of states to involve non-state actors in the discussions.\n\nIn any case, the input of non-state actors in international discussions has increasingly been recognised globally, even though disparities exist between states. Moreover, states are taking part in many multi-stakeholder forums dealing with issues of security and stability in cyberspace, which are being debated at the Internet Governance Forum, ICANN, but also in diplomatic dialogues and more specific initiatives (London Process, Raisina Dialogue, Sino-European Cyber Dialogue, US--China Cyber Dialogue, Canada--EU Cyber Dialogue and so on). They seek to advance ideas and build consensus outside multilateral processes in order to facilitate international discussions and/or create a balance of power by rallying states and organisations to their positions beforehand (Ruhl et al. 2020). This recognition of the role played by non-state actors is best illustrated by the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace initiated by France and largely promoted by Microsoft. The Paris Call -- not endorsed by the United States, China or Russia -- testifies to the signatories' public commitment to ensuring the security and stability of cyberspace globally.\n\nIt was not until a little over a year after the failure of the UN negotiations that new proposals emerged. And the way discussions resumed was emblematic of the tensions between two apprehensions of the risks in a deteriorated geopolitical context. Indeed,",
    "two processes (an open-ended working group and a group of governmental experts) actually debuted almost simultaneously in the autumn of 2019, one led by Russia, the other by the United States, with largely overlapping mandates. In October 2018, Russia introduced a new resolution on ICTs in the context of international security, listing several norms of behaviour and proposing to convene an open-ended working group (OEWG), i.e. a negotiation setting open to all UN member states. The First Commission at the UN was then the theatre of a sharp confrontation between the supporters of the Russian proposal and Western states which, in reaction, proposed their own draft resolution, offering another GGE restricted to 25 states. Despite important modifications on the Russian project, the United States -- followed by the European Union -- didn't withdraw its draft, leading to the adoption of two resolutions, amidst heightened tensions, by the General Assembly on 5 and 22 December 2018 (A/RES/73/27 and A/RES/73/266). A large majority of states voted in favour of the two resolutions which nevertheless reflected a deep divide between the major powers, both on their objectives and on the means of achieving them. Indeed, Russia hasn't renounced its original objective, stated in 1998, of a treaty to underpin the negotiations in the working group.\n\nInterestingly, the working group shepherded by Russia is the one consulting non-state actors (companies, NGOs ...), some of which (but not all) also demand a treaty. On the contrary, the GGE only consults regional state organisations. This fracture was accentuated in December 2019 when the General Assembly adopted a new Russian-led resolution (A/RES/74/247) that created a new negotiation process responsible for elaborating a treaty on cybercrime. Western countries are strongly opposed to it because they believe that the 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, open for signature to states not belonging to the Council of Europe, and already ratified by 64 states, should be universalised instead.\n\nThese two negotiation processes have been produced by major geopolitical tensions, in a context in which the United States is being offensive while denouncing, with several of their global partners, Russian and Chinese cyberoperations. For their part, countries such as Russia and China -- even though they have adopted different strategies (Broeders, Adamson, and Creemers 2019) -- fully take advantage of the offensive potentialities offered by networks while they call for limits on the militarisation of the digital space. Europe, for its part, seeks to offer a third path, but with limited opposition to the United States, which remains its main ally. That said, Europe is plagued by its own dissensions.\n\nTo many observers' surprise, the OEWG adopted its final report on 12 March 2021, demonstrating that despite the context of strategic competition exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic, states were still able to achieve consensus. The report consolidates the achievements of the previous GGEs, encourages more transparency in the implementation of the recommendations of the 2015 GGE report and promotes the pursuit of international negotiations. It also shows some progress, such as the recognition of health infrastructures as critical infrastructures that need to be protected, along with the integrity and the general availability of the internet. However, many contentious points persist as revealed by the Chair's summary, published with the report, that contains most of the state propositions that were not adopted by the OEWG, short of a consensus between states.\n\nIn addition, states rushed to launch the next round of international negotiations even before the two processes had finalised their respective reports. France proposed a",
    "programme of action within the OEWG to merge the two processes into a single one that could provide incremental progress as opposed to requiring a final consensus report. But Russia and its allies sponsored a UNGA resolution launching a new OEWG in October 2020. The same day, the United States and its allies sponsored another resolution, that acknowledges the ongoing negotiations, leaving the door open for further negotiations as the GGE is scheduled to achieve its report in May 2021. Both resolutions were adopted by the UNGA in December 2020. In addition to the OEWG being renewed, the GGE could potentially be continued and a new programme of action created depending on what states propose at the UNGA's 76th session, starting in October 2021.\n\nThe landscape of international negotiations is thus becoming particularly crowded and even confused, with a multiplication of actors, initiatives and proposals aimed at promoting peace and stability in cyberspace. It risks leading to inconsistencies or ambiguities that would leave room for states to pursue their hijinks with relative impunity, even if the two groups' chairs have worked together to reach a consensus and limit contradictions. However, this proliferation is creating a dynamic that is making it possible for states and all actors to become more aware of the risks and challenges associated with the proliferation of cyberweapons. But it is also part of a geopolitical context that is particularly conducive to an arms race.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCyberspace has thus become a field of confrontations between states during the 2010s, to the point of becoming a military domain in its own right for many of them, which have engaged in a cyberweapons race. The proliferation of cyber operations and offensive tools has contributed to increasing the scope and sophistication of the threat they face in the digital space. The tools and attack concepts they have developed have escaped them and are increasingly turned against them, the vulnerabilities they exploit in adversary systems also affect the systems of their own companies and institutions, which can become strategic targets. Last but not least, the uncontrolled spread of certain attacks has had devastating consequences that raise important ethical, legal and economic liability issues but also awareness of the systemic risk that proliferation poses to the security and stability of cyberspace.\n\nFor these reasons, and despite a notably tense geopolitical context, states have chosen to resume international discussions on security and stability in cyberspace, and have taken part in multiple initiatives with private actors and civil society to try to contain the threat. And yet, we cannot but note that the representation of cyberthreat as a geopolitical risk continues to predominate over the representation of systemic risk, leading some states room for offensive operations, in order to ensure their own power in cyberspace, which they see as a condition for their security.\n\nAt the time of writing, negotiations are still ongoing at the UN, and it is difficult to predict their outcome. In the end, it will depend on what states perceive as their primary interest: to curb systemic threat or to continue waging wars. Whatever the outcome of the negotiations, systemic risk will necessarily remain high because of the divergent strategic interests among states and because the exploitation of a network vulnerability by one actor for a specific purpose is in fact exploited by all and for multiple purposes. It also shows that, whatever the initiatives and propositions made, cyberspace",

    "abstract": "Cyberspace has completely revolutionised our ways of life, disrupted our economies, and allowed for important progress in our societies. But the advantages of the digital revolution are now threatened by the use of cyberspace for war purposes. This article explores the states' security dilemma as they face cyber challenges and the ambivalence of the notion of security in cyberspace. It highlights how, in ten years, cyberspace has become a battlefield and a strategic priority for many states that have represented it as a geopolitical threat for their national security, hence justifying its progressive militarisation. Meanwhile, they have become cognizant to the systemic risk of proliferation of offensive cybertools and cyber-operations. This security dilemma – one that opposes a representation of cyber threats as a geopolitical risk to that of cyberspace as a systemic risk – is at the heart of the multilateral negotiations on the regulation of cyberspace. There, a multiplicity of non-state actors has forced their way to the table through a multitude of initiatives that emphasize the importance of the challenges at stake and how difficult it will be for the states to face them.",
