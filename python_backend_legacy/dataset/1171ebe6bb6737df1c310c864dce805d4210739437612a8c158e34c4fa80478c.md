It argues that norm (f) introduces complexity to the application of the law in this context that is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are prohibited by international law. This is due to the subjectivity of the concept of CI, the contradictory legal status of norm (f), and due to existing uncertainties in how international law applies to state conduct in cyberspace which are compounded by norm (f).

Section two considers what constitutes CI and the threat posed by malicious cyber operations against CI. Section three examines the norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace with a focus on norm (f) which prohibits states from conducting cyber operations that cause intentional damage or impairment to the operation of CI in other states. This section outlines the debate about the legal status of norm (f) and demonstrates its contradictory legal status. Section four then examines how states' existing international law obligations are considered to apply to cyber operations causing effects on another state's CI. The focus is on international law on the use of force, non-intervention, and sovereignty. This section demonstrates that there continues to be a degree of uncertainty about when cyber operations against CI violate international law, particularly those falling below the use of force threshold. Section five examines the implications of norm (f) for international law in this context. It demonstrates how norm (f) introduces complexity to the legal analysis which is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are prohibited by international law. Section six provides a conclusion.\n# CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND CYBER OPERATIONS\nIn June 2020, the Australian Government revealed that it had been subject to a campaign of cyber attacks targeting its federal- and state-level governments, various companies and CI. Given the scale and nature of the operations, Australia maintained a foreign state actor was responsible, however, it stopped short of publicly attributing the operations to a specific state. Despite this, some have suggested China was responsible. The cyber operations are understood to have involved compromising the computer systems and networks of the various organisations that were targeted through vulnerabilities in their software. However, despite the media attention Australia's revelation of the incident received, the cyber operations did not cause any effects, such as disrupting the operation of the compromised organisations. Instead, according to the Australian Cyber Security Centre, there was no evidence of 'intent by the actor to carry out any disruptive or destructive activities within victim environments'.\nThere is growing concern about the threat posed by low-level cyber operations that do not necessarily result in immediate disruptive or destructive effects but are nonetheless significant in their scale or have the potential to be used in preparation for more harmful operations. For example, the Australian Department of Defence has specifically highlighted the threat posed by 'all kinds of preparation, pre-positioning, [and] collection of intelligence' activities in the cyber context. This was echoed by the Director General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation who expressed concerns about 'the potential for Australia's adversaries to pre-position malicious code in critical infrastructure ... [which] could be used to damage critical\n1.

These concerns have been exacerbated by reports about malicious cyber operations conducted against hospitals and vaccine research centres during the pandemic in 2020,⁸ as well as ransomware crippling the operation of Colonial Pipeline in 2021 in the US.⁹\nIn light of these concerns, states have highlighted the need for international agreement that certain CI should be ‘off limits’ from malicious cyber activities. In 2015, for example, Australia’s then Foreign Minister Julie Bishop maintained that:\nThe effective functioning of critical infrastructure underpins the global economy. States should prevent and refrain from online activity which damages or impairs critical infrastructure, whether it be in banking, telecos, energy structures. While states define their critical infrastructure sectors differently and harmonisation is important, agreeing that key sectors should be off limits is a priority for the international community.¹⁰\nAnd in 2021, following the Colonial Pipeline incident, US President Joe Biden told Russia’s President Vladimir Putin that ‘certain critical infrastructure should be “off limits” to attack’, and provided Russia with a list of 16 sectors the US considers CI.¹¹\nIn Australia, as part of the effort to counter the broader threat posed by malicious cyber activities by foreign actors, the ‘National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Act 2018’ (NSLA) was recently passed into law. The NSLA was primarily introduced to address the threat of foreign interference in its political processes,¹² but it also contains provisions relating to foreign cyber activities against Australia’s CI. These include a range of new sabotage offences designed to ‘criminalise conduct causing damage to a broad range of critical infrastructure where it could prejudice Australia’s national security’.¹³ For example, under the NSLA it is a criminal offence to engage in conduct that results in damage to Australia’s infrastructure where this is done on behalf of a foreign actor and it undermines Australia’s national\n⁶ Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, ASIO Annual Report 2020-21 (2021) 5 <https: annual%20report%202020-21%20web.pdf=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\" www.asio.gov.au=\"\">.\n⁷ The White House, ‘National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America’ (September 2018) 3 <https: 09=\"\" 2018=\"\" annual%20report%202020-21%20web.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" national-cyber-strategy.pdf=\"\" uploads=\"\" wp-content=\"\" www.wytimes.com=\"\">.\n⁸ See Marko Milanovic and Michael Schmitt, ‘Cyber Attacks and Cyber (Mis)information Operations During a Pandemic’ (2020) 11 JNSLP 247.\n⁹ David Sanger, Clifford Krauss, and Nicole Perlroth, ‘Cyberattack Forces a Shutdown of a Top U.S. Pipeline’ The New York Times (8 May 2021) <https: 05=\"\" 2021=\"\" 09=\"\" a=\"\" cw=\"\" cw-weights=\"\" for=\"\" hyperattack-colonial-pipeline.html=\"\" upolitics=\"\" us=\"\" politics=\"\" paucities=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n¹⁰ Julie Bishop, ‘Statement for Plenary Session on International Peace and Security, Global Conference on Cyberspace’ Minister for Foreign Affairs The Hon Julie Bishop MP (17 April 2015) <https: 05=\"\" 2021-06-16=\"\" 2021=\"\" julie-bishop=\"\" minister=\"\" minister.julie-bishop=\"\" speech=\"\" www.foreignminister.gov.au=\"\">.\n¹¹ Vladimir Soldatkin and Humeyra Pamuk, ‘Biden Tells Putin Certain Cyberattacks should be “Off-limits”’ Reuters (17 June 2021) <https: biden-tells-putin-certain-cyber-attacks-should-be-off-limits-2021-06-16=\"\" technology=\"\" www.reuters.com=\"\">.\n¹² See Henry Belot, ‘Malcolm Turnbull Announces Biggest Overhaul of Espionage, Intelligence Laws in Decades’ ABC News (5 December 2017) <https: 2017-12-05=\"\" news=\"\" turnbull-announces-foreign-interference-laws=\"\" www.abc.net.au=\"\">; Louise Yaxley, ‘Sam Dastyari and the Murky Links with Chinese Businessmen that Ended his Political Career’ ABC News (12 December 2017) <http: 2017-12-12=\"\" 9249216=\"\" am-dastyari-murky-links-with-chinese-businessmen-ended-career=\"\" news=\"\" www.abc.net.au=\"\">.\n¹³ National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Act 2018 (Cth) (NSLA Act) sch 1 pt 1 div 82–Sabotage; Revised Explanatory Memorandum, National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017 (Cth) 62 [137].</http:></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:>\nSAMULI HAATAJA\nsecurity.¹⁴ Similarly, it is a criminal offence to introduce vulnerabilities – such as the installation of malicious software (malware) or creation of backdoors – onto public infrastructure where this is done to undermine Australia's national security.¹⁵ As such, the NSLA includes offences that specifically apply to activities involved in the preparation of potential future intrusions into, for example, Australian government networks and systems.¹⁶ However, while Australia has legislated to protect CI from foreign cyber activities on a domestic level, international agreement around what activities or sectors are to be ‘off limits’ is necessary to ensure the protection of CI from state-sponsored cyber threats.\n## Definitions of critical infrastructure\nPart of the problem around what activities or sectors should be ‘off limits’ revolves around differences in what constitutes CI among states. As highlighted by Australia’s former foreign minister above, there is no universal definition of CI and states in fact have the ability to designate any infrastructure asset as CI. Generally, CI includes various infrastructures such as those related to energy, health and transportation, and many of these infrastructures are dual-use. In Australia, for example, CI is defined as referring to the\nphysical facilities, supply chains, information technologies and communication networks which, if destroyed, degraded or rendered unavailable for an extended period, would significantly impact on the social or economic wellbeing of the nation or affect Australia’s ability to conduct national defence and ensure national security.¹⁷\nIn Australia, CI thus ‘provides services that are essential for everyday life such as energy, communications, water, transport, health, food and grocery, banking and finance and the Australian Government’.¹⁸\nThe United Kingdom (UK) in turn adopts the term ‘critical national infrastructure’ and this refers to the ‘critical elements of infrastructure (namely, assets, facilities, systems, networks or processes and the essential workers that operate and facilitate them)’ where the loss or compromise of those elements would result in a ‘major detrimental impact on the availability, integrity or delivery of essential services’ and/or a ‘significant impact on national security, national defence or the functioning of the state’.¹⁹\nIn the US, CI refers to ‘systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the US that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety or any combination of those matters’.²⁰ The ‘critical infrastructure sectors’, as identified by the recently established US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, include 16 sectors across energy, commerce, finance, food and agriculture, healthcare, emergency services, water, waste, transportation and defence.²¹\nIn the European Union (EU), CI refers to\n¹⁴ NSLA Act (n 13) ss 82.3, 82.4.\n¹⁵ See NSLA Act (n 13) ss 82.7, 82.8.\n¹⁶ Revised NSLA Explanatory Memorandum (n 13) 80 [236].\n¹⁷ Commonwealth of Australia, Critical Infrastructure Resilience Strategy: Policy Statement (2015) 8 <https: criticalinfrastructureresiliencestrategypolicystatement.pdf=\"\" site%20documents=\"\" www.tisn.gov.au=\"\">.\n¹⁸ Australian Government, ‘What is the Critical Infrastructure Centre?’ Critical Infrastructure Centre <https: ctc-factsheet-what-is-critical-infrastructure-centre.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" nat-security=\"\" www.homeaffairs.gov.au=\"\">.\n¹⁹ Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure, ‘Critical National Infrastructure’ (2020) <https: critical-national-infrastructure-0=\"\" www.cpni.gov.uk=\"\">.\n²⁰ USA Patriot Act of 2001, 42 USC §§5195c(e), 1016(e).\n²¹ United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, ‘Critical Infrastructure Sectors’ (24 March 2020) <https: critical-infrastructure-sectors=\"\" www.cisa.gov=\"\">.</https:></https:></https:></https:>\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 417\nan asset, system or part thereof located in Member States which is essential for the maintenance of vital societal functions, health, safety, security, economic or social well-being of people, and the disruption or destruction of which would have a significant impact in a Member State as a result of the failure to maintain those functions.²²\nThis essentially refers to the physical infrastructure which is vital for the proper functioning of society. The EU uses the term ‘critical information infrastructure’ (CII) to describe both the essential information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructures and those that are essential for the operation of its physical CI.²³\nAt the United Nations (UN) level, states have noted in a General Assembly resolution on the ‘creation of a global culture of cybersecurity and the protection of critical information infrastructures’ that CI involves, among other things, the infrastructures used for ‘the generation, transmission and distribution of energy, air and maritime transport, banking and financial services, e-commerce, water supply, food distribution and public health’ and that these infrastructures are increasingly interconnected with CII.²⁴ But here too it is recognized that each state has the right to determine what constitutes its CI.²⁵\nAccordingly, in the Australian, UK, US, EU and UN contexts, CI refers to infrastructures essential to the proper functioning and well-being of the state and society. The term encompasses physical infrastructures (such as power plants and hospitals) located within a state’s territory, as well as the virtual infrastructure allowing the physical components to operate. Generally, this infrastructure is critical where its disruption or destruction would have a detrimental impact (whether significant, major, debilitating and so on) on the provision of key services that relate to the social or economic well-being of the state or its national security. However, states also have the prerogative to designate any infrastructure assets or sectors as critical. For example, the above UK definition includes the human personnel required to operate CI, and in Australia, the relevant government minister has the power to designate any asset as critical.²⁶ As such, while there are core sectors that most states consider to constitute CI, the scope of what constitutes CI is subjective as evident in the differences in terminology and approaches that states adopt in determining this. Consequently, when considering relevant laws and norms surrounding CI protection, there is uncertainty about the specific infrastructures against which malicious cyber activities are prohibited.\n## Cyber operations against critical infrastructure\nIn addition to the 2020 cyber attacks against Australia, there are various other examples of known incidents differing in kind and intensity from low-level information collection operations to more disruptive and even destructive attacks against states’ CI. For example, in 2010 the infamous Stuxnet malware was discovered which had infected an Iranian uranium enrichment facility and, by changing the settings according to which the centrifuge machines operated, caused physical damage to approximately 1000 centrifuges.²⁷ Similarly, in a non-destructive but highly disruptive attack, in December 2015 parts of Ukraine’s power grid were shut down for\n²² Council Directive 2008/114/EC of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection [2008] OJ L 345/75 art 2.\n²³ Commission of the European Communities, ‘Green Paper on a European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection’ (COM/2005/576 final, 17 November 2005) 19.\n²⁴ United Nations General Assembly, UNGA Res 58/199 (23 December 2003) UN Doc A/RES/58/199, 1.\n²⁵ Ibid.\n²⁶ See ss 50 and 51 of the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 (Cth).\n²⁷ Joby Warrick, ‘Iran’s Natanz Nuclear Facility Recovered Quickly from Stuxnet Cyberattack’ The Washington Post (16 February 2011) <http: 02=\"\" 15=\"\" 2011=\"\" ar2011021505395.html=\"\" content=\"\" article=\"\" wp-dyn=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\">.

These operations can be used to gather information that can potentially be used in preparation for more disruptive future operations.³⁰ As an example, in 2018 the US Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation released a report on Russian cyber activities targeting its energy and other CI sectors.³¹ According to this report, Russian actors had since at least 2016 ‘targeted government entities and multiple US critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy, nuclear, commercial facilities, water, aviation and critical manufacturing sectors’.³² This was characterized by these agencies ‘as a multi-stage intrusion campaign by Russian government cyber actors’ in which these actors obtained unauthorized access to various networks and installed malware allowing them to conduct reconnaissance and collect information about industrial control systems.³³ Similarly, in 2019 it was reported that the US had moved beyond mere reconnaissance operations into Russia’s power grid to the placement of malware onto those systems that could be used to disrupt its operation.³⁴ Furthermore, in December 2020, it was reported that Russia had, through software provided by the company SolarWinds, compromised a range of US government agencies³⁵ and companies responsible for CI in the electricity, oil and manufacturing industries.³⁶ While the SolarWinds incident is mainly understood to have compromised data in the affected sectors, Anne Neuberger, the US Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology, expressed concerns that Russia’s ability to access these systems has the potential to be used for disruptive operations in the future.³⁷ And in January 2022, during increased tensions between the US and Russia in the lead-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the US Cybersecurity Advisory issued an advisory encouraging the US cybersecurity community and especially CI operators ‘to adopt a heightened state of awareness’ given the threat posed by Russian-state-sponsored cyber operations against US CI.³⁸ Accordingly, states like the US and Russia are using malicious cyber operations to obtain unauthorized access and maintaining a ‘persistent presence’ in other states’ CI systems. The concern is that these preparatory cyber operations can be used to damage or disrupt the operation of CI in the future.\n²⁸ See Kim Zetter, ‘Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid’ Wired (3 March 2016) <https: 03=\"\" 2016=\"\" 03=\"\" inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\">.\n²⁹ David Sanger, ‘Utilities Cautioned about Potential for a Cyberattack’ The New York Times (29 February 2016) <https: 03=\"\" 2016=\"\" 00=\"\" http:=\"\" us=\"\" politics=\"\" politics.cautioned-about-potential-for-a-cyberattack-after-ukraines.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n³⁰ See Symantec Critical Attack Discovery and Intelligence Team, ‘Dragonfly: Western Energy Sector Targeted by Sophisticated Attack Group’ Symantec Threat Intelligence (20 October 2017) <https: dragonfly-energy-sector-cyber-attacks=\"\" blogs=\"\" symantec-blogs.broadcom.com=\"\">.\n³¹ United States Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation, ‘Russian Government Cyber Activity Targeting Energy and Other Critical Infrastructure Sectors’ (Technical Alert TA18-074A, 15 March 2018) <https: alerts=\"\" a18-074a=\"\" ncas=\"\" ta18-074a=\"\" www.us-cert.gov=\"\">.\n³² Ibid.\n³³ Ibid.\n³⁴ David Sanger and Nicole Perlroth, ‘U.S. Escalates Online Attacks on Russia’s Power Grid’ The New York Times (15 June 2019) <https: 06=\"\" 15=\"\" 2019=\"\" us=\"\" politics=\"\" prurip-cyber-russia-grid.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n³⁵ David Sanger, ‘Russian Hackers Broke into Federal Agencies, U.S. Officials Suspect’ The New York Times (13 December 2020) <https: 12=\"\" 2020=\"\" 22=\"\" 2020=\"\" politics=\"\" russian-hackers-us-government-treasury-commerce.html?=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n³⁶ Kim Zetter, ‘SolarWinds Hack Infected Critical Infrastructure, including Power Industry’ The Intercept (25 December 2020) <https: 02=\"\" 2020=\"\" 22=\"\" 24=\"\" solarwinds-hack-power-infrastructure=\"\" theintercept.com=\"\">.\n³⁷ David Sanger, ‘After Russian Cyberattack, Looking for Answers and Debating Retaliation’ The New York Times (23 February 2021) <https: 02=\"\" 2021=\"\" 23=\"\" polities=\"\" solarwinds-hack-senate-intelligence-russia.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n³⁸ Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, ‘Understanding and Mitigating Russian State Sponsored Cyber Threats to U.S. Critical Infrastructure’ (11 January 2022) 1 <https: 02=\"\" 2022=\"\" 23=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" publications=\"\" us=\"\" uscert=\"\" sites=\"\" www.cisa.gov=\"\" uscert=\"\" publications=\"\" uscertisites=\"\"></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:>\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 419\nThis concern crystallized during the war in Ukraine in 2022 which involved a range of cyber operations and activities that Russia had pre-positioned for.³⁹\n# NORMS OF RESPONSIBLE STATE BEHAVIOUR IN CYBERSPACE\nThe international security issues surrounding states' use of digital technologies and activities in cyberspace have been considered at the UN level since the late 1990s, and in this context, states have agreed to norms around responsible behaviour in cyberspace including around CI protection. Since 1998, the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) of the UN General Assembly has regularly considered 'Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security'.⁴⁰ In 2004 it established a Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) to examine existing and potential threats from cyberspace.⁴¹ A second GGE was established in 2009 and it issued a consensus report in 2010⁴² which highlighted the risk of how '[t]he growing use of ICTs in critical infrastructures creates new vulnerabilities and opportunities for disruption'.⁴³ It also recommended that states should engage in further dialogue 'to discuss norms pertaining to State use of ICTs, to reduce collective risk and protect critical national and international infrastructure'.⁴⁴ This was echoed in the 2013 report from the third GGE which also, for the first time, confirmed the general application of international law and UN Charter principles in the cyber context.⁴⁵\nThe 2015 report by the fourth GGE was significant as it introduced a set of norms for responsible state behaviour in their use of ICTs.⁴⁶ The UN General Assembly also passed resolutions in 2018 and 2019 on 'Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security' where it called on states to be guided by the UN GGE reports and these norms in their use of ICTs.⁴⁷ This was echoed in the 2021 consensus report of the UN Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security in which states emphasized the importance of these norms.⁴⁸\nFrom these norms, three are particularly relevant to CI protection. Norm (g) provides that states should take appropriate measures to protect their own CI, and norm (h) provides that states should mitigate malicious cyber activities emanating from their territory that are directed against the CI of other states.⁴⁹ Of most relevance to malicious cyber operations against CI, however, is norm (f). It provides that:\n³⁹ Microsoft, 'Special Report: Ukraine' (27 April 2022) § <https: am=\"\" app=\"\" am=\"\" binary=\"\" re4vwwd=\"\" query.prod.cms=\"\" re4vwwd=\"\" www.cms=\"\">.\n⁴⁰ United Nations General Assembly, Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, GA Res 53/70, UN Doc A/RES/53/70 (4 January 1999).\n⁴¹ United Nations Secretary-General, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security: Report of the Secretary-General, UN Doc A/60/202 (5 August 2005).\n⁴² United Nations Secretary-General, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security: Note by the Secretary-General, UN Doc A/65/201 (30 July 2010).\n⁴³ Ibid 7.\n⁴⁴ Ibid 8.\n⁴⁵ United Nations Secretary-General, Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/68/98 (24 June 2013) 2.\n⁴⁶ United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/70/174 (22 July 2015) 8.\n⁴⁷ See United Nations General Assembly, Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/RES/73/266 (2 January 2019); United Nations General Assembly, Advancing Responsible State Behaviours in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/RES/74/28 (18 December 2019).\n⁴⁸ United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, 'Final Substantive Report' (10 March 2021) 4–5 <https: 03=\"\" 2021=\"\" front.un-arm.org=\"\" uploads=\"\" wp-content=\"\" wpr2.pdf=\"\" uploads=\"\">.\n⁴⁹ See Michael Berk, 'Recommendation 13(g) and (h)' in United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (ed), Voluntary, Non-Binding Norms for Responsible State Behaviour in the Use of Information and Communications Technology: A Commentary (United Nations Publication 2017).</https:></https:>\nSAMULI HAATAJA\nA State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity contrary to its obligations under international law that intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public.⁵⁰\nPrima facie, norm (f) specifically prohibits cyber operations against the CI of other states. According to the commentary to the norms, it reflects consensus about the unique importance of CI to modern societies and a recognition of the possibility of conflicts to escalate where state-to-state cyber activities adversely impact CI in particular.⁵¹ However, despite this apparent consensus, there is debate about the legal status of norm (f) and its relationship to international law. In particular, it is unclear whether it seeks to create new non-binding expectations of responsible state behaviour or to reaffirm the application of existing binding rules of international law.\nThis lack of clarity arises because norm (f) is explicitly included as a 'voluntary, non-binding' norm in the 2015 UN GGE report, and all of the norms are located in a separate section to the question of how international law applies to ICT activities.⁵² Yet the wording of norm (f) expressly refers to a state's 'obligations under international law' – that is, binding, opposed to voluntary and non-binding obligations – resulting in what others have described as a 'contradiction in terms'.⁵³ The confusion about the legal status of norm (f) is also evident among states who generally regard the norms as conceptually distinct from international law.⁵⁴ For example, Australia, in its 2017 'Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy', expresses a commitment to these norms and notes that international law can be complemented with these norms, but treats the two as distinct.⁵⁵ The US has also expressed a commitment to the promotion of these norms but regards them as conceptually distinct from international law. This is evident in the US Cyber Strategy which includes as one of its pillars the preservation of peace through strength,⁵⁶ and the means of doing so is through the promotion of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace based on international law on one hand, and 'voluntary non-binding norms' on the other.⁵⁷ Similarly, the ASEAN-EU Statement on Cybersecurity Cooperation distinguishes between the application of international law in the cyber context and, separately, acknowledges 'that voluntary and non-binding norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour of States in the use of ICTs can reduce risks to international peace, security and stability'.⁵⁸ The distinction between the non-binding norms and binding international law obligations is also evident in academic commentary. For example, according to Harriet Moynihan, norm (f) 'does not represent a binding obligation on states' and merely demonstrates 'their concern to protect\n⁵⁰ UN GGE 2015 report (n 46) 8.\n⁵¹ Jason Jolley, 'Recommendation 13 (f)' in United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (ed) Voluntary, Non-Binding Norms for Responsible State Behaviour in the Use of Information and Communications Technology: A Commentary (United Nations Publication 2017) 169–70.\n⁵² UN GGE 2015 report (n 46) 7.\n⁵³ Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco, and Talita de Souza Dias, 'Drawing the Cyber Baseline: The Applicability of Existing International Law to the Governance of Information and Communication Technologies' (2022) 99 ILS 4, 32.\n⁵⁴ Liisi Adamson, 'International Law and International Cyber Norms: A Continuum?' in Dennis Broeders and Bibi van den Berg (eds) Governing Cyberspace: Behavior, Power, and Diplomacy (Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2020) 25, 33.\n⁵⁵ Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 'Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy' (October 2017) 47–8 <https: 2020-11=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" the%20strategy.pdf=\"\" www.internationalcybertech.gov.au=\"\" sites=\"\">; Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 2019 Progress Report, Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy (2019).\n⁵⁶ The White House (7) 20.\n⁵⁷ Ibid.\n⁵⁸ Association of South East Asian Nations, 'ASEAN-EU Statement on Cybersecurity Cooperation' Association of South East Asian Nations (August 2019) [6]–[7] <https: 08=\"\" 2019=\"\" asean.org=\"\" asean-eu-statement-on-cybersecurity-cooperation-final.pdf=\"\" storage=\"\">.</https:></https:>\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE\n431\ncritical infrastructure from cyber attacks.⁵⁹ Similarly, Dennis Broeders and others note how 'these norms are not legally binding'⁶⁰ but voluntary and distinct from international law obligations. Accordingly, states have agreed to norm (f) which prohibits cyber operations against CI. However, norm (f) is expressly included as a voluntary and non-binding norm in the UN GGE reports, and the norms generally are regarded as conceptually distinct from legally binding obligations under international law.\nThe commentary to the norms, published by the UN Office for Disarmament Affairs,⁶¹ elaborates on key elements of norm (f) including its relationship with international law.⁶² Here it is noted that it is unclear 'why the [UN Group of Governmental] Experts have offered as voluntary something that by the majority of states is considered legally binding'.⁶³ The commentary explains that norm (f) is premised on the law of state responsibility and was intended to reaffirm that states' existing legal obligations extend to their cyber activities.⁶⁴ This is evident, for example, from the phrase 'conduct[s] or knowingly support[s]' within the wording of norm (f) which encompasses relevant rules of attribution of conduct under international law on state responsibility.⁶⁵ The phrase 'contrary to its obligations' in turn refers to states' existing obligations under international law and includes, for example, the prohibition on the use of force and relevant international humanitarian law obligations.⁶⁶ Therefore, according to the commentary, despite being expressly included as a voluntary and non-binding norm, norm (f) was intended to reaffirm states' existing legal obligations in relation to CI.⁶⁷\nAccordingly, the precise legal status of norm (f) is unclear and others have raised concerns about the implications of this. Writing in relation to the cyber norms generally, Kubo Mačák highlights how 'non-binding norms can never override binding legal rules' and, in the reverse, that 'a non-binding norm cannot permit action that would otherwise be forbidden by international law'.⁶⁸ He maintains that the distinction is important as only a violation of international law can trigger obligations of cessation and reparation under the law on state responsibility.⁶⁹ François Delerue, Frédérick Douzet and Aude Géry in turn maintain that the distinction between international law and norms 'complexifies the definition of rights and obligations for the states in cyberspace as it introduces a confusion on the nature of the rules'.⁷⁰ They argue that by separating the two, the potential implication is that the norm is autonomous and detached from international law and that state behaviour in cyberspace is based only on the goodwill of states and not legal obligations.⁷¹ Similarly, Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco and Talita de Souza Dias argue that the inclusion of norm (f) as a voluntary, non-binding norm by the UN GGE can\n⁵⁹ Harriet Moynihan, 'The Application of International Law to State Cyberattacks Sovereignty and Non-intervention' (Chatham House Research Paper 2019) 44 <https: 12=\"\" 2019=\"\" application-international-law-state-cyberattacks=\"\" www.chathamhouse.org=\"\">.\n⁶⁰ Dennis Broeders, Els de Busser, Fabio Cristiano, and Tatiana Tropina, 'Revisiting Past Cyber Operations in Light of New Cyber Norms and Interpretations of International Law: Inching towards Lines in the Sand?'

He gives the example that 'if a State conducts a cyber operation that amounts to a prohibited intervention in the internal affairs of another State, it is legally obliged to cease its wrongful conduct (if it is continuing) and to provide full reparation to the injured State for the harm caused'.\n⁷⁰ François Delerue, Frédérick Douzet and Aude Géry, 'The Geopolitical Representations of International Law in the International Negotiations on the Security and Stability of Syberspace' (Report No. 75, IRSEM/EU Cyber Direct, November 2020) 29.\n⁷¹ Ibid 32.</https:>\nSAMULI HAATAJA\nhave the effect of reducing well-established rules of international law to 'non-binding recommendations'.[72] The 2021 UN OEWG report seeks to clarify the role of the norms and their relationship to international law, but it ultimately reaffirms the conceptual distinction between the two. It provides that the 'norms do not replace or alter' binding obligations under international law, and do not seek to limit or prohibit action that is otherwise consistent with international law.\"[73] Instead, the norms 'provide additional specific guidance' on what constitutes responsible state behaviour in the cyber context.[74] As such, the legal status of norm (f) is contradictory given it was both intended to reaffirm states' legal obligations in relation to CI and, without replacing or altering the law, to provide non-binding additional specific guidance on what constitutes responsible state behaviour in this context. This is problematic as it is unclear what kinds of cyber operations are prohibited by binding international law obligations in contrast to those that are only contrary to non-binding norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.\nIn addition to its legal status, the commentary to norm (f) also discusses the degree of harm that is required for the norm to be violated. Norm (f) refers to activities that 'intentionally damage[] critical infrastructure or otherwise impair[] the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public'.[75] Essentially, this involves two types of harm: either intentional damage to CI or the use and operation of CI is impaired in its provision of services to the public. The commentary elaborates on both of these. In relation to the first, this requires a state to deliberately cause damage to CI irrespective of whether the damage impacts public services connected to the CI. Here the degree of damage is irrelevant as long as the damage is physical in nature.[76] Given the requirement of intention, however, where a state unintentionally causes physical damage to CI (provided it does not impair the use or operation of CI in its provision of services to the public) then this would fall outside the scope of norm (f).[77]\nThe second type of harm involves situations where a cyber operation does not cause any damage but impairs the use and operation of CI in its provision of services to the public. According to the commentary, impairment in this context refers to:\nany damage, physical or electronic, including the loss of data or software, or interruption of digital services provided by critical infrastructure, that makes the critical infrastructure less effective, less valuable, operate worse, or inhibit use by the public, the threshold being that the public must be impacted, even minimally.[78]\nAs such, the term 'impairment' encompasses physical impairment but does not require it, and captures a range of circumstances where the functionality of CI is undermined provided it results in a detrimental impact on its use by the public. This excludes cyber operations that do not disrupt the operation of CI, as well as cyber operations that disrupt the operation of CI without any impact on the public.[79] Unlike the requirement for intentional damage, the need for impairment is based on a strict liability approach where there is no need for the responsible state to have intended to cause the impairment.[80]\nIn summary, states have agreed to norms of responsible behaviour in cyberspace at the UN level including norm (f) which specifically prohibits certain cyber operations against CI.\n72 Akande, Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 53) 31.\n73 UN OEWG 2021 report (n 48) 5.\n74 Ibid.\n75 UN GGE 2015 report (n 46) 8.\n76 Jolley (n 51) 188.\n77 Ibid.\n78 Ibid 189.\n79 Ibid 188.\n80 Ibid.\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 433\nHowever, the legal status of norm (f) is contradictory. On one hand, it seeks to reaffirm states' existing obligations in relation to CI and is not intended to modify those obligations. On the other, it provides non-binding 'additional specific guidance' on responsible state behaviour in this context, particularly in relation to the degree of harm that should not be caused to CI.⁸¹ As will be demonstrated below, this guidance is concerning as it is inconsistent with the harm requirements under international law, and this further compounds existing uncertainties about how the law applies in this context.⁸²\n# INTERNATIONAL LAW AND CYBER OPERATIONS\nThis section examines how relevant rules of international law that norm (f) reaffirms apply to state activities in cyberspace. The focus is on three primary areas of international law that provide limits to cyber operations in peacetime, namely the law on the use of force, non-intervention and sovereignty. These are of particular relevance to cyber operations attributable to states targeting another state's CI given the broad spectrum of effects that remotely conducted cyber operations can cause.⁸³\nThere is widespread agreement that international law generally applies to state activities in cyberspace. This was highlighted in the 2015 UN GGE report which recognized that international law and the UN Charter in particular apply in the cyber context.⁸⁴ This was reaffirmed in the 2021 UN OEWG consensus report.⁸⁵ Despite this general agreement, however, there continues to be uncertainty about how particular rules of international law apply. As such, UN Member States have been invited to provide their national views on the UN GGE reports and to make submissions or provide working papers in connection with the UN OEWG which ran parallel to the UN GGE. In connection with these processes, states have provided more detailed accounts about how they consider the law to apply. The views of states are important as they contribute to more clarity about how international law applies in the cyber context, and to the development of customary international law applicable to state conduct in this context.⁸⁶ However, the different positions evident in these statements have given rise to some debate about how the law applies. The implication of this is that, while there are some areas where a degree of consensus is emerging, there continues to be a degree of uncertainty about when cyber operations against CI will violate international law.\n# Use of force\nA cyber operation that causes physical damage to CI can potentially violate the prohibition on the use of force. Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits states from the use of force. Force in this context is generally understood to refer to 'armed force'.⁸⁷ Despite being drafted in the\n⁸¹ However, as Delerue, Douzet and Géry note, the non-binding norms nonetheless 'can contribute to the interpretation of existing obligations in international law, or to the formation of new international obligations'. Delerue, Douzet and Géry (n 70) 31.\n⁸² See section 5.\n⁸³ Other areas of law, such as international humanitarian law which applies in an armed conflict, while important given the dual-use nature of CI, are outside of the article's scope. On these obligations in relation to CI, see David Fidler 'Whither the Web?: International Law, Cybersecurity, and Critical Infrastructure Protection' (2015) 16 GJIA 8, 12.

This is a rule of customary international law that prohibits states from using coercive means to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another state as these are matters which states have the right to decide freely by virtue of their sovereignty. A violation of international law based on the non-intervention principle requires two elements. First, there must be coercive interference, and second, it must be directed towards the matters that sovereign states should be able to decide freely.97\n88 Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Advisory Opinion) [1996] ICJ Rep 226, 244.

The majority of the Tallinn Manual experts, for example, adopted a narrow approach to the term defining it as ‘an affirmative act designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way.’⁹⁸ They distinguished it from activities that seek to influence (as opposed to factually compel) a state to behave in a particular way such as public criticism or propaganda.⁹⁹ Others, however, have defined coercion more broadly as a form of pressure that seeks to deprive the target state of its free will.¹⁰⁰ This view was echoed by the minority of the Tallinn Manual experts who maintained that it is sufficient that the activity ‘has the effect of depriving the State of control over the matter in question.’¹⁰¹ This broader approach to coercion is also supported by some states in the cyber context. For example, according to Australia coercion involves ‘effectively deprive[ing] another state of the ability to control, decide upon or govern matters of an inherently sovereign nature.’¹⁰² Similarly, the German position maintains that coercion involves where a state’s ‘will is manifestly bent by the foreign State’s conduct.’¹⁰³\nThe second element requires that the coercion is directed at matters that states are able to decide freely by virtue of their sovereignty.¹⁰⁴ These include, according to the ICJ, the ‘choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy’.¹⁰⁵ States have also endorsed this view in the cyber context. Australia’s position is that the law requires the coercion to affect ‘matters of an inherently sovereign nature’,¹⁰⁶ according to the UK the coercion must affect ‘matters of government which are at the heart of a state’s sovereignty’,¹⁰⁷ and for New Zealand, coercion must deprive the state from control over ‘matters falling within the scope of its inherently sovereign functions’.¹⁰⁸\nA number of states have also provided examples of situations in which the non-intervention principle would be violated in the cyber context.

For example, the Tallinn Manual distinguishes between a state’s ‘inherently governmental functions’ (relevant for a sovereignty violation) from the concept of domaine réservé (relevant to the non-intervention principle). Schmitt (n 90) 24. However, it is argued that the notion of ‘matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely’ (using the ICJ’s wording) is preferred. This is not confined to a state’s internal affairs as it also includes their external affairs (eg membership of international organisations, and decisions to recognise states) which can be subject to coercive interference. Additionally, even if a matter is regulated by international law (and thus it is no longer within a state’s domaine réservé meaning the state no longer has exclusive regulatory authority over the matter), the state still has the authority to make choices within that area of law. As such, the ‘matters that sovereign states are permitted to decide freely’ is a more useful concept opposed to the narrow notion of a state’s domaine réservé.

Australia and the UK also maintain that using cyber means involving coercion to undermine the stability of their financial system would constitute a violation.¹¹³ This is echoed by New Zealand which also maintains that disruptive cyber operations against its healthcare system, electricity network or telecommunications network would, where coercive, constitute violations of the non-intervention principle.¹¹⁴ Accordingly, cyber operations without physical effects can constitute violations of the non-intervention principle. However, this requires the element of coercion but the identity and intention of the state responsible for a cyber operation can be difficult to determine in the cyber context. This leads to uncertainty around whether cyber operations without physical effects that fall below the use of force threshold constitute violations of the non-intervention principle.\n## Sovereignty\nFinally, cyber operations against CI can also constitute violations of sovereignty. Sovereignty generally refers to a state's supreme authority within its territory, and it involves three interrelated rights and correlating duties in relation to a state's territorial sovereignty, independence and sovereign equality.¹¹⁵ In relation to territorial sovereignty, usually non-consensual activities within a state's territory, such as flying military aircraft over its airspace without permission, or navigating a vessel through its territorial sea without its consent are prohibited. In the cyber context, while states agree that sovereignty extends to the cyber infrastructure within their territory, there is uncertainty around whether and the threshold at which remotely conducted cyber operations will violate sovereignty. This is a critical question given that international law is largely silent on espionage conducted by states, and this means that states are generally permitted to engage in cyber espionage.¹¹⁶\nThis uncertainty about whether and when a cyber operation violates sovereignty arises from the debate about whether or not sovereignty operates as a rule of international law independent of the use of force and non-intervention principles that prohibits certain malicious cyber activities. According to the 'sovereignty as a rule' approach, sovereignty operates as a primary rule of international law that can be violated, and under certain circumstances, remotely conducted cyber operations can amount to violations of sovereignty. The Tallinn Manual advocated for this approach,¹¹⁷ and a growing number of states have adopted this approach including the Netherlands,¹¹⁸ France,¹¹⁹ Austria,¹²⁰\n¹¹² Finnish Government, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, 'Finland Published Its Positions on Public International Law in Cyberspace' (15 October 2020) <https: en=\"\" full=\"\" valtioneuvosto.fi=\"\" valtioneuvosto.fi=\"\"> / 'finland-published-its-positions-on-public-international-law-in-cyberspace'.\n¹¹³ Wright (n 107); Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy, 2019 International Law Supplement (n 102) 5.\n¹¹⁴ New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade (n 89).\n¹¹⁵ Moynihan (n 59) 11.\n¹¹⁶ See Russell Buchan, Cyber Espionage and International Law (Hart 2019).

Cyber espionage is defined here as the use of cyber means to copy confidential data from computer systems or networks without authorisation. Buchan (n 116) 17–18. However, this does not mean that any form of cyber espionage is permitted. Instead, determining whether cyber espionage violates international law will depend on the techniques involved and the effects caused by the cyber operation. As noted by the Tallinn Manual, the 'mere characterisation of a cyber operation as espionage or not has no legal significance ...

A similar position has been adopted by some recent academic commentators who argue that cyber operations amount to violations of sovereignty when they penetrate another state’s computers or networks even without physical damage of effects in the territory of the state. For example, Russell Buchan adopts this position and maintains that a violation occurs on the basis of the act of ‘the unauthorised intrusion into a domain protected by state sovereignty’.

Another example given is cyber operations that interfere ‘with any data or services which are essential for the exercise of inherently governmental functions, and thereby significantly disrupting the exercise of those functions; for example, distributing ransomware which encrypts the computers used by a government and thus significantly delaying the payment of retirement pensions’.\n¹³⁵ The Federal Government of Germany (n 89) 4.</http:></https:></https:>\nSAMULI HAATAJA\nterritorial sovereignty, among other states there is no consensus on whether every unauthorized intrusion violates sovereignty or what degree of effects are required for a violation to occur.^[136]^\nIn contrast to the rule approach to sovereignty, according to the 'sovereignty as a principle' approach, sovereignty is a fundamental principle of international law involving a state's independent right to exercise state functions to the exclusion of others (the internal element), and the recognition of the absolute equality and independence of all states (the external element).^[137]^ However, sovereignty cannot be violated in its own right independent of other rules of international law that are based on it as it does not operate as a standalone primary rule of international law capable of being violated. This approach has been suggested by the US in a 2017 US Department of Defence memorandum (US DoD memo),^[138]^ and the UK has expressly adopted this position.^[139]^\nFrom the sovereignty as a principle approach, given that sovereignty does not operate as a standalone rule of international law, it cannot be violated in itself. Instead, to amount to a violation of international law, a cyber operation needs to constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force or an intervention (ie a violation of existing rules of international law that arise from sovereignty).^[140]^ This means that, under this approach, a range of cyber operations are considered lawful under international law as they are not expressly prohibited. For example, according to the US DoD memo, sovereignty does not limit states from engaging in cyber activities 'that result in effects occurring on the infrastructure located in another State'.^[141]^ Similarly, according to the UK, the non-consensual interference into another state's computer networks is not a violation of their 'territorial sovereignty' because such a rule does not exist in international law in relation to cyber.^[142]^ As such, pursuant to the sovereignty as a principle approach, unauthorized cyber intrusions cannot constitute violations of sovereignty and will only amount to violations of international law where they rise to the threshold of a use of force or intervention and thus violate other existing rules of international law.\nTo summarize, when it comes to states' existing legal obligations most relevant to cyber operations that target or cause effects on another state's CI in peacetime, there is a degree of consensus in some areas but uncertainty in others. There is agreement that cyber operations will violate the prohibition on the use of force where their effects are similar to the use of armed force by kinetic means. However, there is no consensus around the precise threshold or about non-destructive but disruptive cyber operations in this context. The non-intervention principle generally applies to disruptive cyber operations provided they are coercive, however, this can be difficult to determine in the cyber context. Finally, while an increasing number of states have expressed support for the 'sovereignty as a rule' approach, there is no consensus on the threshold\n^[136]^ The Tallinn Manual experts were also divided on this.

As a result, particularly in relation to low-level cyber operations that merely involve pre-positioning or preparatory activities such as unauthorised access, information collection or the installation of malware that do not cause any immediate disruption or destruction, there is uncertainty about whether these activities would constitute violations of states' existing obligations under international law.\n# IMPLICATIONS FOR CYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW\nThis section demonstrates how norm (f) adds counterproductive complexity to the application of international law to cyber operations against CI. This is evident in the subjective nature of what constitutes CI within the scope of norm (f), and the additional specific guidance provided by norm (f) which contradicts some of the harm requirements under international law.\n# Norm (f) and CI\nNorm (f) applies to cyber operations against CI, however, despite that there are core sectors that most states consider to constitute CI, the notion of CI remains subjective. This means that the precise scope of norm (f) is not clearly defined. States have the prerogative to determine which infrastructures to designate as CI, $^{143}$ and, from 'critical information infrastructure' $^{144}$ and 'critical national infrastructure' $^{145}$ to 'national, transnational and supranational critical infrastructure' $^{146}$ — there is little consistency in the terminology adopted by states. The lack of agreement about what constitutes CI for the purposes of norm (f) can be problematic. For instance, election infrastructure in the US was only designated as critical in January 2017 following Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. $^{147}$ Some states have also been hesitant to designate specific sectors as CI due to concerns that this would implicitly condone malicious activities against sectors that are not specified. $^{148}$ The 2021 UN GGE report expressly acknowledges these concerns, noting that, even where a sector is not designated as CI, it does not amount to condoning malicious activities against those sectors. $^{149}$ Furthermore, even where states specify certain sectors as CI, they are not precluded from designating other sectors as such in the future. $^{150}$ There have also been calls to extend norm (f) to mention specific sectors, even if those sectors are already widely considered to be CI. For example, in February 2020 the International Committee of the Red Cross proposed extending the application of norm (f) to address the\n143 UN OEWG 2021 report (n 48) 4.\n144 Council Directive 2008/114/EC of 8 December 2008 (n 22) art 2.\n145 Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (n 19).\n146 UN Open Ended Working Group, 'Second \"Pre-draft\" of the Report of the OEWG on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security' (27 May 2020) 4 <https: 05=\"\" 200527-oewg-ict-revised-pre-draft.pdf=\"\" 2020=\"\" front.un-arm.org=\"\" uploads=\"\" wp-content=\"\">.\n147 Homeland Security, 'Statement by Secretary Jeh Johnson on the Designation of Election Infrastructure as a Critical Infrastructure Subsector' (6 January 2017) <https: 01=\"\" 06=\"\" 2017=\"\" statement-secretary-johnson-designation-election-infrastructure-critical=\"\" news=\"\" www.dhs.gov=\"\">.\n148 Johanna Weaver, 'Submission of Australia's Independent Expert to the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (GGE)' (29 May 2020) 8 <https: default=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\" submission-by-australias-representative-to-the-gge-norm-implementation-may-2020.pdf=\"\" www.dfat.gov.au=\"\">.\n149 United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/76/135 (14 July 2021) 13.\n150 Ibid.</https:></https:></https:>\nSAMULI HAATAJA\n'particular vulnerability of health care facilities'¹⁵¹ in response to cyber operations against hospitals and vaccine research centres during the pandemic.\nWhile agreement about what sectors constitute CI for the purposes of norm (f) is useful in providing clarity for the scope of the norm, this introduces unnecessary additional complexity to how international law applies in this context. The contested nature of CI and focus on whether a sector is CI for the purposes of norm (f) has the potential to narrow the application of international law only to those sectors that states have agreed to constitute CI. The need for a cyber operation to affect CI also creates an additional requirement that is not evident in existing international law. This is because, irrespective of whether a sector is designated as CI or not, existing international law obligations apply to cyber operations causing effects in the territory of other states. For example, a cyber operation against election infrastructure rising to the level of a violation of sovereignty or intervention will constitute a violation of international law regardless of whether the victim state considers the infrastructure to be CI or not. Similarly, cyber operations against healthcare facilities causing sufficient effects will constitute violations of international law even if those sectors are not specifically mentioned in norm (f).¹⁵² Therefore, the focus on what constitutes CI for the purposes of norm (f), and the subjectivity of the concept of CI has the potential to introduce additional complexity to determining whether a cyber operation violates international law.\n## Norm (f) and uncertainty in international law\nNorm (f) seeks to reaffirm the existing legal obligations of states in relation to cyber operations against CI and provide additional specific guidance on responsible state behaviour in this context. However, the harm requirements within norm (f) are contradictory to those in international law, and this further compounds existing uncertainties in how the law applies to cyber operations targeting CI. As a result, there are a range of cyber operations that can constitute violations of international law but not norm (f), or vice versa.\nFor example, whether a cyber operation against CI constitutes a use of force will generally be determined based on its 'scale and effects'. Under this approach, there must be a degree of direct physical damage to the CI, or disruption of its functionality which causes damage or harm to individuals comparable to a use of force by kinetic means. The Stuxnet incident is generally considered to have crossed this threshold as it is reported to have caused damage to approximately 1000 centrifuge machines.¹⁵³ Assuming Stuxnet was attributable to a state, its use would have violated norm (f) as it caused intentional damage to CI and was contrary to the responsible state's international obligations.¹⁵⁴ However, a disruptive cyber operation with only adverse economic consequences would generally not constitute a use of force. This could include, for example, a cyber operation against a power grid that causes a temporary blackout without any indirect physical effects or harm to individuals. While a cyber operation of this kind would involve impairing the use of the CI and adversely impact its use for the public for the purposes of norm (f), it would unlikely violate a state's legal obligations under article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n¹⁵¹ International Committee of the Red Cross, 'Norms for Responsible State Behavior on Cyber Operations should Build on International Law' (11 February 2020) <https: document=\"\" en=\"\" norms-responsible-state-behavior-cyber-operations-should-build-international-law=\"\" www.icrc.org=\"\">. While norm (f) was not amended, the 2021 UN GGE report did specifically note how '[t]he COVID-19 pandemic heightened awareness of the critical importance of protecting health care and medical infrastructure and facilities, including through the implementation of the norms addressing critical infrastructure'. UN GGE 2021 report (n 150) 12.\n¹⁵² See Milanovic and Schmitt (n 8).\n¹⁵³ Haataja (n 93) 88–95.\n¹⁵⁴ See also Broeders and others (n 60) 4–7.</https:>\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 441\nFor a cyber operation of this kind without direct physical effects to violate the non-intervention principle, there is a requirement that the operation was intended to be coercive and directed at matters states have the right to decide freely. For example, where a cyber operation causing a blackout was done with the intention of coercing the targeted state to reverse its policy of recognition of another state, this would constitute an unlawful intervention. But where the cyber operation does not involve the element of coercion directed at matters states should be freely able to decide (or the responsible state's intention is unknown), then the cyber operation would fall outside the scope of the non-intervention principle. This is despite the impairment of CI and its adverse impact on the public that is consistent with the harm requirement in norm (f). Whether a cyber operation of this kind violates sovereignty is also unsettled given the divergence in views among states on the issue.\nIn relation to cyber operations against CI and violations of sovereignty, consider, for example, where a state obtains unauthorised access to another state's power grid, election infrastructure or hospital systems and installs malware that gives it the ability to cause disruptive or destructive effects on that infrastructure at a later point in time. Whether a cyber operation of this kind violates sovereignty is unsettled as the precise boundaries of states' legal obligations in this context are still developing and evolving as more state practice emerges. According to France and Iran, which adopt the rule approach to sovereignty and consider any penetration of their networks to be a violation of sovereignty, this conduct would constitute a violation of international law at the point in time at which there is unauthorized access to their systems.[155] However, for states like the Czech Republic and New Zealand, merely obtaining unauthorised access or installing malware that does not impair the functioning of the systems would not constitute violations of sovereignty.[156] Instead, for these states, it is only at the point in time at which that malware is used to cause significant disruptive or destructive effects that the cyber operation would qualify as a violation of sovereignty. Similarly, for states like the UK adopting the principle approach to sovereignty, the cyber operation could not constitute a violation of international law unless and until it rises to the level of a use of force or involves coercion and violates the non-intervention principle.[157] Accordingly, a range of cyber operations that meet the harm requirements in norm (f) would fall outside of its scope because, given the uncertainty around how international law applies in this context, it would be unclear whether those operations also violate the law as required by norm (f).\nFurther compounding the uncertainty in how existing international law applies are the harm requirements of norm (f) that are not consistent with international law. Norm (f) requires 'intentional damage', but the intent is not a requisite element for most of the rules of international law outlined above. In relation to the prohibition on the use of force, there is no requirement for intention.[158] Instead, the approach adopted by most states and in the Tallinn Manual focuses on the 'scale and effects' of a cyber operation.[159] Similarly, intention is not a requirement for a violation of sovereignty.[160] While intention is an element of the non-intervention principle,[161] the focus of the law here is on the intention of the state applying the coercion and not\n155 See United Nations Secretary-General (n 119) 22; Islamic Republic of Iran (n 123).\n156 See Czech Republic (n 121); New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade (n 89).\n157 See Wright (n 107).\n158 See Olivier Corten, The Law Against War: The Prohibition on the Use of Force in Contemporary International Law (Bloomsbury Publishing 2010) 78–80.\n159 Schmitt (n 90) 331.\n160 Corten (n 158) 83; Schmitt (n 90) 24.\n161 Jamnejad and Wood (n 97). Nicholas Tsagourias maintains that, in establishing a violation of the non-intervention principle, 'intent is critical, particularly in cyberspace, where operations are often factually indistinguishable, and their effects permeate borders unintentionally'. Nicholas Tsagourias, 'Electoral Cyber Interference, Self-Determination, and the Principle of Non-intervention in Cyberspace' in Dennis Broeders and Bibi van den Berg (eds) Governing Cyberspace: Behaviour, Power, Diplomacy (Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2020) 55.\nSAMULI HAATAJA\nwhether the particular technical effects – such as damage to CI – were intended or not. This means that there is no need for ‘intentional damage’ to be caused by a cyber operation for the non-intervention principle to be violated. Norm (f), however, specifically refers to intentional damage. As a result, where a state engages in a cyber operation against CI that causes unintentional damage to the CI, the activity could constitute a violation of sovereignty or a use of force but would fall outside the scope of the intentional damage contemplated by norm (f).¹⁶²\nThe approach to impairment evident in norm (f) is useful in terms of the specificity of the requirement for an (even minimally) adverse impact on services provided to the public by the CI. This encompasses a very broad spectrum of cyber operations against CI, including disruptive cyber operations that may fall outside the scope of the prohibition on the use of force and the non-intervention principle. However, unless these cyber operations cause sufficient effects to constitute a use of force, or are accompanied by coercive intention and satisfy the non-intervention principle, they would fall outside the scope of existing international law and also outside of norm (f). As such, while the ‘additional specific guidance’ that norm (f) provides in its approach to impairment is useful given the broad spectrum of cyber operations against CI that it captures, there is uncertainty about whether most of such cyber operations would constitute violations of international law as required under norm (f).\nFinally, when considering low-level cyber operations used to pre-position or prepare for potentially destructive cyber operations against CI in peacetime, what is revealed is the dark side of norm (f) and existing international law in this context.¹⁶³ Given that these kinds of cyber operations do not cause immediate damage or impairment and, from a technical perspective, can be indistinguishable from cyber espionage, they are effectively permitted under existing international law and generally will not be seen to constitute violations of sovereignty. But much of CI is dual-use and this means that under certain conditions it can be lawfully subject to attack through cyber means in an armed conflict.¹⁶⁴ Essentially, except in circumstances where there is evidence of an imminent armed attack,¹⁶⁵ norm (f) and existing international law allow states to engage in cyber operations against CI that involve pre-positioning and preparing for potentially destructive effects in the future.¹⁶⁶\nTherefore, norm (f) introduces additional complexity to the application of international law in this context, and this complexity is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are considered to be ‘off limits’. The subjective nature of what constitutes CI and the requirement for a sector to be CI to be captured by norm (f) creates a requirement that is not evident in international law and effectively narrows its application.\n¹⁶² However, where a cyber operation of this kind also has an adverse impact on the public then it would constitute impairment under the second type of harm within norm (f). This could amount to a violation of international law on sovereignty, but this is uncertain given the current debate about sovereignty.\n¹⁶³ The norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace only operate in peacetime.

See Fidler (n 83) 12; Jolley (n 51) 181–4. See also Broeders and others (n 60).\n¹⁶⁵ For example, according to Australia, states may exercise a right of anticipatory self-defence where ‘a threatened armed attack in the form of an offensive cyber operation’ that could be launched ‘in a split second’ and could cause ‘large-scale loss of human life and damage to critical infrastructure’. See George Brandis, ‘The Right of Self-Defence against Imminent Armed Attack in International Law’ (Lecture delivered at the University of Queensland, Brisbane, 11 April 2017) 8 <https: 05=\"\" 2017=\"\" developments-international-law-self-defence-against-imminent-armed-attack=\"\" blog=\"\" law.uq.edu.au=\"\">. Similarly, according to NATO’s Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations, non-destructive cyber operations, such as those causing temporary disruptions of service or involving information gathering where they are conducted to enable a conventional threat – including an imminent threat of one – could be considered to trigger the right of self-defence. NATO, Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations, Allied Joint Publication-3.20 (NATO Standardisation Office 2020) 20 <https: 899678=\"\" attachment_data=\"\" government=\"\" file=\"\" doctrine_nato_cyberspace_operations_ajp_3_20_1_.pdf=\"\" uploads=\"\" www.cyber-systems_ajp_3_20_1_.pdf=\"\" www.cyber-docrine_nato_cyberspace_operations_ajp_3_20_1_.pdf=\"\">.\n¹⁶⁶ This prioritizes the security interests of states over the cyber security of CI systems. David Fidler, for example, suggests a new cyber-defence norm adopting an ‘all hazards’ strategy to protect CI that does not focus on the legal regime (whether cyber crime or espionage) but instead on ensuring ‘networks are protected against infiltrations from any source’. Fidler (n 83) 13</https:></https:></https:>\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 443\nInternational law obligations apply to cyber operations conducted by states irrespective of whether they target what the victim state has designated as CI or not. While there is a degree of uncertainty around the thresholds at which violations of international law on the use of force, intervention and sovereignty occur, the harm requirements in norm (f) have the potential to compound these uncertainties as they are not consistent with these rules of international law.\nAccordingly, more clarity about the relationship between international law and norm (f) is needed, and about how international law applies to cyber operations targeting sectors that states have deemed to be CI. This is particularly the case in relation to international law on sovereignty. Especially where low-level cyber operations without immediately disruptive or destructive effects are involved, more states need to provide detailed accounts of when they consider the law to be violated and the relationship between sovereignty and sectors they consider to be CI. While a state's domestic legislation – like the Australian NSLA – may criminalise various activities such as the installation of malware onto CI on a national level, states should also expressly outline how they regard these activities on an international level. Here the approach to impairment in norm (f) can serve as useful guidance on when a cyber operation should violate sovereignty.¹⁶⁷ Similarly, the fact that CI is targeted can serve as an indicia of a violation of sovereignty. For example, this is the approach that Germany has adopted making an explicit connection between cyber operations against its CI and violations of its sovereignty.¹⁶⁸ In relation to low-level cyber operations, such as those involving the installation of malware enabling a persistent presence on CI that is generally accepted as a permissible form of espionage, these should be seen as potential violations of sovereignty given the purpose for which they are conducted.¹⁶⁹ As such, while clarity around when cyber operations violate sovereignty and the relevance of a sector's designation as CI is needed, international law applies to cyber operations by states irrespective of norm (f) which introduces counterproductive complexity to the legal analysis in this context.\n# CONCLUSION\nThis article examined the norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace and international law prohibiting malicious cyber operations against CI. It demonstrated that norm (f), which prohibits cyber operations that damage or impair CI, introduces complexity to the application of international law that is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are prohibited by international law. This is due to the subjective nature of CI, the contradictory legal status of norm (f), and the ways in which the harm requirements of norm (f) compound existing uncertainties about how international law applies to cyber operations where CI is targeted. To develop clarity about what cyber operations against CI should be 'off limits', more states need to outline their positions on the threshold at which they consider the law to be violated – especially in relation to sovereignty – to ensure that malicious low-level cyber operations, in particular, do not fall outside of these legal constraints.\n¹⁶⁷ This has been recently recognized in the UN OEWG 2021 report where it was noted that a cyber operation contrary to international law that 'intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public, could pose a threat not only to security but also to State sovereignty'. See UN OEWG 2021 report (n 48) 4.\n¹⁶⁸ According to Germany, where a cyber operation targets a state's CI it 'may indicate that a State's territorial sovereignty has been violated'. However, given, among other things, the lack of international agreement of what constitutes CI, Germany maintained that this in and of itself cannot constitute the basis for a violation.

This complexity arises from the subjective nature of what constitutes CI, the contradictory legal status of norm (f), and the existing uncertainties about how international law applies to cyber operations which are compounded by norm (f).

Section two considers what constitutes CI and the threat posed by malicious cyber operations against CI. Section three examines the norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace with a focus on norm (f) which prohibits states from conducting cyber operations that cause intentional damage or impairment to the operation of CI in other states. This section outlines the debate about the legal status of norm (f) and demonstrates its contradictory legal status. Section four then examines how states' existing international law obligations are considered to apply to cyber operations causing effects on another state's CI. The focus is on international law on the use of force, non-intervention, and sovereignty. This section demonstrates that there continues to be a degree of uncertainty about when cyber operations against CI violate international law, particularly those falling below the use of force threshold. Section five examines the implications of norm (f) for international law in this context. It demonstrates how norm (f) introduces complexity to the legal analysis which is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are prohibited by international law. Section six provides a conclusion.\n# CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND CYBER OPERATIONS\nIn June 2020, the Australian Government revealed that it had been subject to a campaign of cyber attacks targeting its federal- and state-level governments, various companies and CI. Given the scale and nature of the operations, Australia maintained a foreign state actor was responsible, however, it stopped short of publicly attributing the operations to a specific state. Despite this, some have suggested China was responsible. The cyber operations are understood to have involved compromising the computer systems and networks of the various organisations that were targeted through vulnerabilities in their software. However, despite the media attention Australia's revelation of the incident received, the cyber operations did not cause any effects, such as disrupting the operation of the compromised organisations. Instead, according to the Australian Cyber Security Centre, there was no evidence of 'intent by the actor to carry out any disruptive or destructive activities within victim environments'.\nThere is growing concern about the threat posed by low-level cyber operations that do not necessarily result in immediate disruptive or destructive effects but are nonetheless significant in their scale or have the potential to be used in preparation for more harmful operations. For example, the Australian Department of Defence has specifically highlighted the threat posed by 'all kinds of preparation, pre-positioning, [and] collection of intelligence' activities in the cyber context. This was echoed by the Director General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation who expressed concerns about 'the potential for Australia's adversaries to pre-position malicious code in critical infrastructure ...

In the United States (US), the 2018 ‘National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America’ (US Cyber Strategy) makes specific mention of Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, and provides that the US and its allies ‘are vulnerable to peacetime cyber attacks against critical infrastructure’ and that there is a growing risk ‘these countries will conduct cyber attacks against the United States during a crisis short of war’. Accordingly, there is recognition of the potentially devastating impact that cyber operations on CI can have and the threat posed by cyber activities in preparation of such operations. These concerns have been exacerbated by reports about malicious cyber operations conducted against hospitals and vaccine research centres during the pandemic in 2020, as well as ransomware crippling the operation of Colonial Pipeline in 2021 in the US.\nIn light of these concerns, states have highlighted the need for international agreement that certain CI should be ‘off limits’ from malicious cyber activities. In 2015, for example, Australia’s then Foreign Minister Julie Bishop maintained that:\nThe effective functioning of critical infrastructure underpins the global economy. States should prevent and refrain from online activity which damages or impairs critical infrastructure, whether it be in banking, telecos, energy structures. While states define their critical infrastructure sectors differently and harmonisation is important, agreeing that key sectors should be off limits is a priority for the international community.\nAnd in 2021, following the Colonial Pipeline incident, US President Joe Biden told Russia’s President Vladimir Putin that ‘certain critical infrastructure should be “off limits” to attack’, and provided Russia with a list of 16 sectors the US considers CI.\nIn Australia, as part of the effort to counter the broader threat posed by malicious cyber activities by foreign actors, the ‘National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Act 2018’ (NSLA) was recently passed into law. The NSLA was primarily introduced to address the threat of foreign interference in its political processes, but it also contains provisions relating to foreign cyber activities against Australia’s CI. These include a range of new sabotage offences designed to ‘criminalise conduct causing damage to a broad range of critical infrastructure where it could prejudice Australia’s national security’. For example, under the NSLA it is a criminal offence to engage in conduct that results in damage to Australia’s infrastructure where this is done on behalf of a foreign actor and it undermines Australia’s national\n Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, ASIO Annual Report 2020-21 (2021) 5 <https: annual%20report%202020-21%20web.pdf=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\" www.asio.gov.au=\"\">.\n The White House, ‘National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America’ (September 2018) 3 <https: 09=\"\" 2018=\"\" annual%20report%202020-21%20web.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" national-cyber-strategy.pdf=\"\" uploads=\"\" wp-content=\"\" www.wytimes.com=\"\">.\n See Marko Milanovic and Michael Schmitt, ‘Cyber Attacks and Cyber (Mis)information Operations During a Pandemic’ (2020) 11 JNSLP 247.\n David Sanger, Clifford Krauss, and Nicole Perlroth, ‘Cyberattack Forces a Shutdown of a Top U.S. Pipeline’ The New York Times (8 May 2021) <https: 05=\"\" 2021=\"\" 09=\"\" a=\"\" cw=\"\" cw-weights=\"\" for=\"\" hyperattack-colonial-pipeline.html=\"\" upolitics=\"\" us=\"\" politics=\"\" paucities=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n Julie Bishop, ‘Statement for Plenary Session on International Peace and Security, Global Conference on Cyberspace’ Minister for Foreign Affairs The Hon Julie Bishop MP (17 April 2015) <https: 05=\"\" 2021-06-16=\"\" 2021=\"\" julie-bishop=\"\" minister=\"\" minister.julie-bishop=\"\" speech=\"\" www.foreignminister.gov.au=\"\">.\n Vladimir Soldatkin and Humeyra Pamuk, ‘Biden Tells Putin Certain Cyberattacks should be “Off-limits”’ Reuters (17 June 2021) <https: biden-tells-putin-certain-cyber-attacks-should-be-off-limits-2021-06-16=\"\" technology=\"\" www.reuters.com=\"\">.\n See Henry Belot, ‘Malcolm Turnbull Announces Biggest Overhaul of Espionage, Intelligence Laws in Decades’ ABC News (5 December 2017) <https: 2017-12-05=\"\" news=\"\" turnbull-announces-foreign-interference-laws=\"\" www.abc.net.au=\"\">; Louise Yaxley, ‘Sam Dastyari and the Murky Links with Chinese Businessmen that Ended his Political Career’ ABC News (12 December 2017) <http: 2017-12-12=\"\" 9249216=\"\" am-dastyari-murky-links-with-chinese-businessmen-ended-career=\"\" news=\"\" www.abc.net.au=\"\">.\n National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Act 2018 (Cth) (NSLA Act) sch 1 pt 1 div 82–Sabotage; Revised Explanatory Memorandum, National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017 (Cth) 62 [137].</http:></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:>\nSAMULI HAATAJA\nsecurity. Similarly, it is a criminal offence to introduce vulnerabilities – such as the installation of malicious software (malware) or creation of backdoors – onto public infrastructure where this is done to undermine Australia's national security. As such, the NSLA includes offences that specifically apply to activities involved in the preparation of potential future intrusions into, for example, Australian government networks and systems. However, while Australia has legislated to protect CI from foreign cyber activities on a domestic level, international agreement around what activities or sectors are to be ‘off limits’ is necessary to ensure the protection of CI from state-sponsored cyber threats.\n## Definitions of critical infrastructure\nPart of the problem around what activities or sectors should be ‘off limits’ revolves around differences in what constitutes CI among states. As highlighted by Australia’s former foreign minister above, there is no universal definition of CI and states in fact have the ability to designate any infrastructure asset as CI. Generally, CI includes various infrastructures such as those related to energy, health and transportation, and many of these infrastructures are dual-use. In Australia, for example, CI is defined as referring to the\nphysical facilities, supply chains, information technologies and communication networks which, if destroyed, degraded or rendered unavailable for an extended period, would significantly impact on the social or economic wellbeing of the nation or affect Australia’s ability to conduct national defence and ensure national security.\nIn Australia, CI thus ‘provides services that are essential for everyday life such as energy, communications, water, transport, health, food and grocery, banking and finance and the Australian Government’.\nThe United Kingdom (UK) in turn adopts the term ‘critical national infrastructure’ and this refers to the ‘critical elements of infrastructure (namely, assets, facilities, systems, networks or processes and the essential workers that operate and facilitate them)’ where the loss or compromise of those elements would result in a ‘major detrimental impact on the availability, integrity or delivery of essential services’ and/or a ‘significant impact on national security, national defence or the functioning of the state’.\nIn the US, CI refers to ‘systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the US that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety or any combination of those matters’. The ‘critical infrastructure sectors’, as identified by the recently established US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, include 16 sectors across energy, commerce, finance, food and agriculture, healthcare, emergency services, water, waste, transportation and defence.\nIn the European Union (EU), CI refers to\n NSLA Act (n 13) ss 82.3, 82.4.\n See NSLA Act (n 13) ss 82.7, 82.8.\n Revised NSLA Explanatory Memorandum (n 13) 80 [236].\n Commonwealth of Australia, Critical Infrastructure Resilience Strategy: Policy Statement (2015) 8 <https: criticalinfrastructureresiliencestrategypolicystatement.pdf=\"\" site%20documents=\"\" www.tisn.gov.au=\"\">.\n Australian Government, ‘What is the Critical Infrastructure Centre?’ Critical Infrastructure Centre <https: ctc-factsheet-what-is-critical-infrastructure-centre.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" nat-security=\"\" www.homeaffairs.gov.au=\"\">.\n Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure, ‘Critical National Infrastructure’ (2020) <https: critical-national-infrastructure-0=\"\" www.cpni.gov.uk=\"\">.\n USA Patriot Act of 2001, 42 USC §§5195c(e), 1016(e).\n United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, ‘Critical Infrastructure Sectors’ (24 March 2020) <https: critical-infrastructure-sectors=\"\" www.cisa.gov=\"\">.</https:></https:></https:></https:>\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 417\nan asset, system or part thereof located in Member States which is essential for the maintenance of vital societal functions, health, safety, security, economic or social well-being of people, and the disruption or destruction of which would have a significant impact in a Member State as a result of the failure to maintain those functions.\nThis essentially refers to the physical infrastructure which is vital for the proper functioning of society. The EU uses the term ‘critical information infrastructure’ (CII) to describe both the essential information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructures and those that are essential for the operation of its physical CI.\nAt the United Nations (UN) level, states have noted in a General Assembly resolution on the ‘creation of a global culture of cybersecurity and the protection of critical information infrastructures’ that CI involves, among other things, the infrastructures used for ‘the generation, transmission and distribution of energy, air and maritime transport, banking and financial services, e-commerce, water supply, food distribution and public health’ and that these infrastructures are increasingly interconnected with CII. But here too it is recognized that each state has the right to determine what constitutes its CI.\nAccordingly, in the Australian, UK, US, EU and UN contexts, CI refers to infrastructures essential to the proper functioning and well-being of the state and society. The term encompasses physical infrastructures (such as power plants and hospitals) located within a state’s territory, as well as the virtual infrastructure allowing the physical components to operate. Generally, this infrastructure is critical where its disruption or destruction would have a detrimental impact (whether significant, major, debilitating and so on) on the provision of key services that relate to the social or economic well-being of the state or its national security. However, states also have the prerogative to designate any infrastructure assets or sectors as critical. For example, the above UK definition includes the human personnel required to operate CI, and in Australia, the relevant government minister has the power to designate any asset as critical. As such, while there are core sectors that most states consider to constitute CI, the scope of what constitutes CI is subjective as evident in the differences in terminology and approaches that states adopt in determining this. Consequently, when considering relevant laws and norms surrounding CI protection, there is uncertainty about the specific infrastructures against which malicious cyber activities are prohibited.\n## Cyber operations against critical infrastructure\nIn addition to the 2020 cyber attacks against Australia, there are various other examples of known incidents differing in kind and intensity from low-level information collection operations to more disruptive and even destructive attacks against states’ CI. For example, in 2010 the infamous Stuxnet malware was discovered which had infected an Iranian uranium enrichment facility and, by changing the settings according to which the centrifuge machines operated, caused physical damage to approximately 1000 centrifuges. Similarly, in a non-destructive but highly disruptive attack, in December 2015 parts of Ukraine’s power grid were shut down for\n Council Directive 2008/114/EC of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection [2008] OJ L 345/75 art 2.\n Commission of the European Communities, ‘Green Paper on a European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection’ (COM/2005/576 final, 17 November 2005) 19.\n United Nations General Assembly, UNGA Res 58/199 (23 December 2003) UN Doc A/RES/58/199, 1.\n Ibid.\n See ss 50 and 51 of the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 (Cth).\n Joby Warrick, ‘Iran’s Natanz Nuclear Facility Recovered Quickly from Stuxnet Cyberattack’ The Washington Post (16 February 2011) <http: 02=\"\" 15=\"\" 2011=\"\" ar2011021505395.html=\"\" content=\"\" article=\"\" wp-dyn=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\">.

This is believed to have been the first blackout caused by a cyber operation.\nBesides these disruptive and destructive cyber operations against CI, states are also engaging in various low-level cyber operations against CI. These operations can be used to gather information that can potentially be used in preparation for more disruptive future operations. As an example, in 2018 the US Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation released a report on Russian cyber activities targeting its energy and other CI sectors. According to this report, Russian actors had since at least 2016 ‘targeted government entities and multiple US critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy, nuclear, commercial facilities, water, aviation and critical manufacturing sectors’. This was characterized by these agencies ‘as a multi-stage intrusion campaign by Russian government cyber actors’ in which these actors obtained unauthorized access to various networks and installed malware allowing them to conduct reconnaissance and collect information about industrial control systems. Similarly, in 2019 it was reported that the US had moved beyond mere reconnaissance operations into Russia’s power grid to the placement of malware onto those systems that could be used to disrupt its operation. Furthermore, in December 2020, it was reported that Russia had, through software provided by the company SolarWinds, compromised a range of US government agencies and companies responsible for CI in the electricity, oil and manufacturing industries. While the SolarWinds incident is mainly understood to have compromised data in the affected sectors, Anne Neuberger, the US Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology, expressed concerns that Russia’s ability to access these systems has the potential to be used for disruptive operations in the future. And in January 2022, during increased tensions between the US and Russia in the lead-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the US Cybersecurity Advisory issued an advisory encouraging the US cybersecurity community and especially CI operators ‘to adopt a heightened state of awareness’ given the threat posed by Russian-state-sponsored cyber operations against US CI. Accordingly, states like the US and Russia are using malicious cyber operations to obtain unauthorized access and maintaining a ‘persistent presence’ in other states’ CI systems. The concern is that these preparatory cyber operations can be used to damage or disrupt the operation of CI in the future.\n See Kim Zetter, ‘Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid’ Wired (3 March 2016) <https: 03=\"\" 2016=\"\" 03=\"\" inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\">.\n David Sanger, ‘Utilities Cautioned about Potential for a Cyberattack’ The New York Times (29 February 2016) <https: 03=\"\" 2016=\"\" 00=\"\" http:=\"\" us=\"\" politics=\"\" politics.cautioned-about-potential-for-a-cyberattack-after-ukraines.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n See Symantec Critical Attack Discovery and Intelligence Team, ‘Dragonfly: Western Energy Sector Targeted by Sophisticated Attack Group’ Symantec Threat Intelligence (20 October 2017) <https: dragonfly-energy-sector-cyber-attacks=\"\" blogs=\"\" symantec-blogs.broadcom.com=\"\">.\n United States Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation, ‘Russian Government Cyber Activity Targeting Energy and Other Critical Infrastructure Sectors’ (Technical Alert TA18-074A, 15 March 2018) <https: alerts=\"\" a18-074a=\"\" ncas=\"\" ta18-074a=\"\" www.us-cert.gov=\"\">.\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n David Sanger and Nicole Perlroth, ‘U.S. Escalates Online Attacks on Russia’s Power Grid’ The New York Times (15 June 2019) <https: 06=\"\" 15=\"\" 2019=\"\" us=\"\" politics=\"\" prurip-cyber-russia-grid.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n David Sanger, ‘Russian Hackers Broke into Federal Agencies, U.S. Officials Suspect’ The New York Times (13 December 2020) <https: 12=\"\" 2020=\"\" 22=\"\" 2020=\"\" politics=\"\" russian-hackers-us-government-treasury-commerce.html?=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n Kim Zetter, ‘SolarWinds Hack Infected Critical Infrastructure, including Power Industry’ The Intercept (25 December 2020) <https: 02=\"\" 2020=\"\" 22=\"\" 24=\"\" solarwinds-hack-power-infrastructure=\"\" theintercept.com=\"\">.\n David Sanger, ‘After Russian Cyberattack, Looking for Answers and Debating Retaliation’ The New York Times (23 February 2021) <https: 02=\"\" 2021=\"\" 23=\"\" polities=\"\" solarwinds-hack-senate-intelligence-russia.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, ‘Understanding and Mitigating Russian State Sponsored Cyber Threats to U.S. Critical Infrastructure’ (11 January 2022) 1 <https: 02=\"\" 2022=\"\" 23=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" publications=\"\" us=\"\" uscert=\"\" sites=\"\" www.cisa.gov=\"\" uscert=\"\" publications=\"\" uscertisites=\"\"></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:>\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 419\nThis concern crystallized during the war in Ukraine in 2022 which involved a range of cyber operations and activities that Russia had pre-positioned for.\n# NORMS OF RESPONSIBLE STATE BEHAVIOUR IN CYBERSPACE\nThe international security issues surrounding states' use of digital technologies and activities in cyberspace have been considered at the UN level since the late 1990s, and in this context, states have agreed to norms around responsible behaviour in cyberspace including around CI protection. Since 1998, the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) of the UN General Assembly has regularly considered 'Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security'. In 2004 it established a Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) to examine existing and potential threats from cyberspace. A second GGE was established in 2009 and it issued a consensus report in 2010 which highlighted the risk of how '[t]he growing use of ICTs in critical infrastructures creates new vulnerabilities and opportunities for disruption'. It also recommended that states should engage in further dialogue 'to discuss norms pertaining to State use of ICTs, to reduce collective risk and protect critical national and international infrastructure'. This was echoed in the 2013 report from the third GGE which also, for the first time, confirmed the general application of international law and UN Charter principles in the cyber context.\nThe 2015 report by the fourth GGE was significant as it introduced a set of norms for responsible state behaviour in their use of ICTs. The UN General Assembly also passed resolutions in 2018 and 2019 on 'Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security' where it called on states to be guided by the UN GGE reports and these norms in their use of ICTs. This was echoed in the 2021 consensus report of the UN Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security in which states emphasized the importance of these norms.\nFrom these norms, three are particularly relevant to CI protection. Norm (g) provides that states should take appropriate measures to protect their own CI, and norm (h) provides that states should mitigate malicious cyber activities emanating from their territory that are directed against the CI of other states. Of most relevance to malicious cyber operations against CI, however, is norm (f). It provides that:\n Microsoft, 'Special Report: Ukraine' (27 April 2022) § <https: am=\"\" app=\"\" am=\"\" binary=\"\" re4vwwd=\"\" query.prod.cms=\"\" re4vwwd=\"\" www.cms=\"\">.\n United Nations General Assembly, Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, GA Res 53/70, UN Doc A/RES/53/70 (4 January 1999).\n United Nations Secretary-General, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security: Report of the Secretary-General, UN Doc A/60/202 (5 August 2005).\n United Nations Secretary-General, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security: Note by the Secretary-General, UN Doc A/65/201 (30 July 2010).\n Ibid 7.\n Ibid 8.\n United Nations Secretary-General, Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/68/98 (24 June 2013) 2.\n United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/70/174 (22 July 2015) 8.\n See United Nations General Assembly, Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/RES/73/266 (2 January 2019); United Nations General Assembly, Advancing Responsible State Behaviours in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/RES/74/28 (18 December 2019).\n United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, 'Final Substantive Report' (10 March 2021) 4–5 <https: 03=\"\" 2021=\"\" front.un-arm.org=\"\" uploads=\"\" wp-content=\"\" wpr2.pdf=\"\" uploads=\"\">.\n See Michael Berk, 'Recommendation 13(g) and (h)' in United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (ed), Voluntary, Non-Binding Norms for Responsible State Behaviour in the Use of Information and Communications Technology: A Commentary (United Nations Publication 2017).</https:></https:>\nSAMULI HAATAJA\nA State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity contrary to its obligations under international law that intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public.\nPrima facie, norm (f) specifically prohibits cyber operations against the CI of other states. According to the commentary to the norms, it reflects consensus about the unique importance of CI to modern societies and a recognition of the possibility of conflicts to escalate where state-to-state cyber activities adversely impact CI in particular. However, despite this apparent consensus, there is debate about the legal status of norm (f) and its relationship to international law. In particular, it is unclear whether it seeks to create new non-binding expectations of responsible state behaviour or to reaffirm the application of existing binding rules of international law.\nThis lack of clarity arises because norm (f) is explicitly included as a 'voluntary, non-binding' norm in the 2015 UN GGE report, and all of the norms are located in a separate section to the question of how international law applies to ICT activities. Yet the wording of norm (f) expressly refers to a state's 'obligations under international law' – that is, binding, opposed to voluntary and non-binding obligations – resulting in what others have described as a 'contradiction in terms'. The confusion about the legal status of norm (f) is also evident among states who generally regard the norms as conceptually distinct from international law. For example, Australia, in its 2017 'Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy', expresses a commitment to these norms and notes that international law can be complemented with these norms, but treats the two as distinct. The US has also expressed a commitment to the promotion of these norms but regards them as conceptually distinct from international law. This is evident in the US Cyber Strategy which includes as one of its pillars the preservation of peace through strength, and the means of doing so is through the promotion of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace based on international law on one hand, and 'voluntary non-binding norms' on the other. Similarly, the ASEAN-EU Statement on Cybersecurity Cooperation distinguishes between the application of international law in the cyber context and, separately, acknowledges 'that voluntary and non-binding norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour of States in the use of ICTs can reduce risks to international peace, security and stability'. The distinction between the non-binding norms and binding international law obligations is also evident in academic commentary. For example, according to Harriet Moynihan, norm (f) 'does not represent a binding obligation on states' and merely demonstrates 'their concern to protect\n UN GGE 2015 report (n 46) 8.\n Jason Jolley, 'Recommendation 13 (f)' in United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (ed) Voluntary, Non-Binding Norms for Responsible State Behaviour in the Use of Information and Communications Technology: A Commentary (United Nations Publication 2017) 169–70.\n UN GGE 2015 report (n 46) 7.\n Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco, and Talita de Souza Dias, 'Drawing the Cyber Baseline: The Applicability of Existing International Law to the Governance of Information and Communication Technologies' (2022) 99 ILS 4, 32.\n Liisi Adamson, 'International Law and International Cyber Norms: A Continuum?' in Dennis Broeders and Bibi van den Berg (eds) Governing Cyberspace: Behavior, Power, and Diplomacy (Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2020) 25, 33.\n Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 'Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy' (October 2017) 47–8 <https: 2020-11=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" the%20strategy.pdf=\"\" www.internationalcybertech.gov.au=\"\" sites=\"\">; Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 2019 Progress Report, Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy (2019).\n The White House (7) 20.\n Ibid.\n Association of South East Asian Nations, 'ASEAN-EU Statement on Cybersecurity Cooperation' Association of South East Asian Nations (August 2019) [6]–[7] <https: 08=\"\" 2019=\"\" asean.org=\"\" asean-eu-statement-on-cybersecurity-cooperation-final.pdf=\"\" storage=\"\">.</https:></https:>\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nThe commentary to the norms, published by the UN Office for Disarmament Affairs, elaborates on key elements of norm (f) including its relationship with international law. Here it is noted that it is unclear 'why the [UN Group of Governmental] Experts have offered as voluntary something that by the majority of states is considered legally binding'. The commentary explains that norm (f) is premised on the law of state responsibility and was intended to reaffirm that states' existing legal obligations extend to their cyber activities. This is evident, for example, from the phrase 'conduct[s] or knowingly support[s]' within the wording of norm (f) which encompasses relevant rules of attribution of conduct under international law on state responsibility. The phrase 'contrary to its obligations' in turn refers to states' existing obligations under international law and includes, for example, the prohibition on the use of force and relevant international humanitarian law obligations. Therefore, according to the commentary, despite being expressly included as a voluntary and non-binding norm, norm (f) was intended to reaffirm states' existing legal obligations in relation to CI.\nAccordingly, the precise legal status of norm (f) is unclear and others have raised concerns about the implications of this. Writing in relation to the cyber norms generally, Kubo Mačák highlights how 'non-binding norms can never override binding legal rules' and, in the reverse, that 'a non-binding norm cannot permit action that would otherwise be forbidden by international law'. He maintains that the distinction is important as only a violation of international law can trigger obligations of cessation and reparation under the law on state responsibility. François Delerue, Frédérick Douzet and Aude Géry in turn maintain that the distinction between international law and norms 'complexifies the definition of rights and obligations for the states in cyberspace as it introduces a confusion on the nature of the rules'. They argue that by separating the two, the potential implication is that the norm is autonomous and detached from international law and that state behaviour in cyberspace is based only on the goodwill of states and not legal obligations. Similarly, Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco and Talita de Souza Dias argue that the inclusion of norm (f) as a voluntary, non-binding norm by the UN GGE can\n Harriet Moynihan, 'The Application of International Law to State Cyberattacks Sovereignty and Non-intervention' (Chatham House Research Paper 2019) 44 <https: 12=\"\" 2019=\"\" application-international-law-state-cyberattacks=\"\" www.chathamhouse.org=\"\">.\n Dennis Broeders, Els de Busser, Fabio Cristiano, and Tatiana Tropina, 'Revisiting Past Cyber Operations in Light of New Cyber Norms and Interpretations of International Law: Inching towards Lines in the Sand?'

It provides that the 'norms do not replace or alter' binding obligations under international law, and do not seek to limit or prohibit action that is otherwise consistent with international law.\"[73] Instead, the norms 'provide additional specific guidance' on what constitutes responsible state behaviour in the cyber context.[74] As such, the legal status of norm (f) is contradictory given it was both intended to reaffirm states' legal obligations in relation to CI and, without replacing or altering the law, to provide non-binding additional specific guidance on what constitutes responsible state behaviour in this context. This is problematic as it is unclear what kinds of cyber operations are prohibited by binding international law obligations in contrast to those that are only contrary to non-binding norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.\nIn addition to its legal status, the commentary to norm (f) also discusses the degree of harm that is required for the norm to be violated. Norm (f) refers to activities that 'intentionally damage[] critical infrastructure or otherwise impair[] the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public'.[75] Essentially, this involves two types of harm: either intentional damage to CI or the use and operation of CI is impaired in its provision of services to the public. The commentary elaborates on both of these. In relation to the first, this requires a state to deliberately cause damage to CI irrespective of whether the damage impacts public services connected to the CI. Here the degree of damage is irrelevant as long as the damage is physical in nature.[76] Given the requirement of intention, however, where a state unintentionally causes physical damage to CI (provided it does not impair the use or operation of CI in its provision of services to the public) then this would fall outside the scope of norm (f).[77]\nThe second type of harm involves situations where a cyber operation does not cause any damage but impairs the use and operation of CI in its provision of services to the public. According to the commentary, impairment in this context refers to:\nany damage, physical or electronic, including the loss of data or software, or interruption of digital services provided by critical infrastructure, that makes the critical infrastructure less effective, less valuable, operate worse, or inhibit use by the public, the threshold being that the public must be impacted, even minimally.[78]\nAs such, the term 'impairment' encompasses physical impairment but does not require it, and captures a range of circumstances where the functionality of CI is undermined provided it results in a detrimental impact on its use by the public. This excludes cyber operations that do not disrupt the operation of CI, as well as cyber operations that disrupt the operation of CI without any impact on the public.[79] Unlike the requirement for intentional damage, the need for impairment is based on a strict liability approach where there is no need for the responsible state to have intended to cause the impairment.[80]\nIn summary, states have agreed to norms of responsible behaviour in cyberspace at the UN level including norm (f) which specifically prohibits certain cyber operations against CI.\n\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 433\nHowever, the legal status of norm (f) is contradictory. On one hand, it seeks to reaffirm states' existing obligations in relation to CI and is not intended to modify those obligations. On the other, it provides non-binding 'additional specific guidance' on responsible state behaviour in this context, particularly in relation to the degree of harm that should not be caused to CI. As will be demonstrated below, this guidance is concerning as it is inconsistent with the harm requirements under international law, and this further compounds existing uncertainties about how the law applies in this context.\n# INTERNATIONAL LAW AND CYBER OPERATIONS\nThis section examines how relevant rules of international law that norm (f) reaffirms apply to state activities in cyberspace. The focus is on three primary areas of international law that provide limits to cyber operations in peacetime, namely the law on the use of force, non-intervention and sovereignty. These are of particular relevance to cyber operations attributable to states targeting another state's CI given the broad spectrum of effects that remotely conducted cyber operations can cause.\nThere is widespread agreement that international law generally applies to state activities in cyberspace. This was highlighted in the 2015 UN GGE report which recognized that international law and the UN Charter in particular apply in the cyber context. This was reaffirmed in the 2021 UN OEWG consensus report. Despite this general agreement, however, there continues to be uncertainty about how particular rules of international law apply. As such, UN Member States have been invited to provide their national views on the UN GGE reports and to make submissions or provide working papers in connection with the UN OEWG which ran parallel to the UN GGE. In connection with these processes, states have provided more detailed accounts about how they consider the law to apply. The views of states are important as they contribute to more clarity about how international law applies in the cyber context, and to the development of customary international law applicable to state conduct in this context. However, the different positions evident in these statements have given rise to some debate about how the law applies. The implication of this is that, while there are some areas where a degree of consensus is emerging, there continues to be a degree of uncertainty about when cyber operations against CI will violate international law.\n# Use of force\nA cyber operation that causes physical damage to CI can potentially violate the prohibition on the use of force. Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits states from the use of force. Force in this context is generally understood to refer to 'armed force'. Despite being drafted in the\n However, as Delerue, Douzet and Géry note, the non-binding norms nonetheless 'can contribute to the interpretation of existing obligations in international law, or to the formation of new international obligations'. Delerue, Douzet and Géry (n 70) 31.\n See section 5.\n Other areas of law, such as international humanitarian law which applies in an armed conflict, while important given the dual-use nature of CI, are outside of the article's scope. On these obligations in relation to CI, see David Fidler 'Whither the Web?: International Law, Cybersecurity, and Critical Infrastructure Protection' (2015) 16 GJIA 8, 12.

This is a rule of customary international law that prohibits states from using coercive means to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another state as these are matters which states have the right to decide freely by virtue of their sovereignty. A violation of international law based on the non-intervention principle requires two elements. First, there must be coercive interference, and second, it must be directed towards the matters that sovereign states should be able to decide freely.97\n\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 435\nCoercion is not defined in international law. The majority of the Tallinn Manual experts, for example, adopted a narrow approach to the term defining it as ‘an affirmative act designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way.’ They distinguished it from activities that seek to influence (as opposed to factually compel) a state to behave in a particular way such as public criticism or propaganda. Others, however, have defined coercion more broadly as a form of pressure that seeks to deprive the target state of its free will. This view was echoed by the minority of the Tallinn Manual experts who maintained that it is sufficient that the activity ‘has the effect of depriving the State of control over the matter in question.’ This broader approach to coercion is also supported by some states in the cyber context. For example, according to Australia coercion involves ‘effectively deprive[ing] another state of the ability to control, decide upon or govern matters of an inherently sovereign nature.’ Similarly, the German position maintains that coercion involves where a state’s ‘will is manifestly bent by the foreign State’s conduct.’\nThe second element requires that the coercion is directed at matters that states are able to decide freely by virtue of their sovereignty. These include, according to the ICJ, the ‘choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy’. States have also endorsed this view in the cyber context. Australia’s position is that the law requires the coercion to affect ‘matters of an inherently sovereign nature’, according to the UK the coercion must affect ‘matters of government which are at the heart of a state’s sovereignty’, and for New Zealand, coercion must deprive the state from control over ‘matters falling within the scope of its inherently sovereign functions’.\nA number of states have also provided examples of situations in which the non-intervention principle would be violated in the cyber context. Many states, including Australia, the UK, the US\n Schmitt (n 90) 317 citing Robert Y Jennings and Arthur Watts (eds), *Oppenheim’s International Law, Volume 1, Peace* (9ᵗʰ edn Longman 1992) 430–1.\n Schmitt (n 90) 318.\n Moynihan (n 59) 30.\n Schmitt (n 90) 318.\n Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, ‘Australia’s International Cyber Engagement Strategy, 2019 International Law Supplement’ (2019) 5 <https: 2020-11=\"\" 2019%20legal%20supplement_0.pdf=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\" www.internationalcybertech.gov.au=\"\">.\n The Federal Government of Germany (n 89) 5.\n The concept of domaine réservé (reserved domain) is often used to refer to matters within the exclusive domestic jurisdiction of states (see Katja Ziegler, ‘Domaine Réservé’ in *Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law* (Oxford University Press 2013)) and this is sometimes distinguished from the broader state functions that states have the authority to exercise. For example, the Tallinn Manual distinguishes between a state’s ‘inherently governmental functions’ (relevant for a sovereignty violation) from the concept of domaine réservé (relevant to the non-intervention principle). Schmitt (n 90) 24. However, it is argued that the notion of ‘matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely’ (using the ICJ’s wording) is preferred. This is not confined to a state’s internal affairs as it also includes their external affairs (eg membership of international organisations, and decisions to recognise states) which can be subject to coercive interference. Additionally, even if a matter is regulated by international law (and thus it is no longer within a state’s domaine réservé meaning the state no longer has exclusive regulatory authority over the matter), the state still has the authority to make choices within that area of law. As such, the ‘matters that sovereign states are permitted to decide freely’ is a more useful concept opposed to the narrow notion of a state’s domaine réservé.

Australia and the UK also maintain that using cyber means involving coercion to undermine the stability of their financial system would constitute a violation. This is echoed by New Zealand which also maintains that disruptive cyber operations against its healthcare system, electricity network or telecommunications network would, where coercive, constitute violations of the non-intervention principle. Accordingly, cyber operations without physical effects can constitute violations of the non-intervention principle. However, this requires the element of coercion but the identity and intention of the state responsible for a cyber operation can be difficult to determine in the cyber context. This leads to uncertainty around whether cyber operations without physical effects that fall below the use of force threshold constitute violations of the non-intervention principle.\n## Sovereignty\nFinally, cyber operations against CI can also constitute violations of sovereignty. Sovereignty generally refers to a state's supreme authority within its territory, and it involves three interrelated rights and correlating duties in relation to a state's territorial sovereignty, independence and sovereign equality. In relation to territorial sovereignty, usually non-consensual activities within a state's territory, such as flying military aircraft over its airspace without permission, or navigating a vessel through its territorial sea without its consent are prohibited. In the cyber context, while states agree that sovereignty extends to the cyber infrastructure within their territory, there is uncertainty around whether and the threshold at which remotely conducted cyber operations will violate sovereignty. This is a critical question given that international law is largely silent on espionage conducted by states, and this means that states are generally permitted to engage in cyber espionage.\nThis uncertainty about whether and when a cyber operation violates sovereignty arises from the debate about whether or not sovereignty operates as a rule of international law independent of the use of force and non-intervention principles that prohibits certain malicious cyber activities. According to the 'sovereignty as a rule' approach, sovereignty operates as a primary rule of international law that can be violated, and under certain circumstances, remotely conducted cyber operations can amount to violations of sovereignty. The Tallinn Manual advocated for this approach, and a growing number of states have adopted this approach including the Netherlands, France, Austria,\n Finnish Government, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, 'Finland Published Its Positions on Public International Law in Cyberspace' (15 October 2020) <https: en=\"\" full=\"\" valtioneuvosto.fi=\"\" valtioneuvosto.fi=\"\"> / 'finland-published-its-positions-on-public-international-law-in-cyberspace'.\n Wright (n 107); Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy, 2019 International Law Supplement (n 102) 5.\n New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade (n 89).\n Moynihan (n 59) 11.\n See Russell Buchan, Cyber Espionage and International Law (Hart 2019).

Cyber espionage is defined here as the use of cyber means to copy confidential data from computer systems or networks without authorisation. Buchan (n 116) 17–18. However, this does not mean that any form of cyber espionage is permitted. Instead, determining whether cyber espionage violates international law will depend on the techniques involved and the effects caused by the cyber operation. As noted by the Tallinn Manual, the 'mere characterisation of a cyber operation as espionage or not has no legal significance ...

For example, the Netherlands did not define the boundary at which it considers its sovereignty to be violated, and Austria similarly remained silent on this issue. The French position in turn suggests that it considers a cyber operation that merely involves the ‘unauthorized penetration’ of its computer systems to be a violation of its sovereignty. Iran’s position similarly suggests that it would also view any unlawful intrusions into its (public or private) cyber infrastructure as violations of its sovereignty, as well as those that are destructive or disruptive and undermine its national security. In contrast, however, according to New Zealand not ‘every unauthorized intrusion’ into another state’s ICT systems or even all cyber activities that cause effects on another state’s territory constitutes a violation of territorial sovereignty. Here it makes reference to cyber espionage activities and ‘a range of circumstances’ in which even cyber operations that cause effects in the territory of another state will not violate international law. Finland has maintained that a violation of sovereignty will be determined on a case-by-case basis depending on the ‘nature and consequences’ of the unauthorized cyber intrusion. The Czech Republic considers that cyber operations that violate sovereignty include those that cause significant physical damage or harm to individuals and those that damage or disrupt the operation of cyber or other infrastructure where it has a ‘significant impact on national security, economy, public health or environment’. Similarly, according to Germany, a cyber operation that causes ‘physical effects and harm’ in another state’s territory will violate sovereignty, as well as disruptive cyber operations, particularly where they cause ‘substantive secondary or indirect physical effects’ in another state’s territory. As such, while some states agree that, at least cyber operations that cause physical damage or harm to individuals within another state’s territory will violate their\n Czech Republic, ‘Statement by Richard Kadlčák at Open-ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security of the First Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations’ (11 February 2020) <https: 2020=\"\" 20%20international%20law%2011.02.2020.pdf=\"\" cz%20statement%20www.nukib.cz=\"\" download=\"\" publications_en=\"\" www.nukib.cz=\"\">.\n Finnish Government, Ministry for Foreign Affairs (n 112).\n Islamic Republic of Iran, ‘Declaration of General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran Regarding International Law Applicable to the Cyberspace’ NourNews (18 August 2020) <https: 53144=\"\" en=\"\" general-staff-of-iranian-armed-forces-warns-of-tough-reaction-to-any-cyber-threat=\"\" nournews.ir=\"\">.\n New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade (n 89).\n The Federal Government of Germany (n 89) 2.\n Organisation of American States, Inter-American Judicial Committee, ‘International Law and State Cyber Operations’ (1 November 2020) 52 <http: docs=\"\" en=\"\" idc=\"\" international_law_and_state_cyber_operations_publication.pdf=\"\" sla=\"\" iajc=\"\" www.oas.org=\"\">.\n Letter from the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (n 89) 3.\n ‘Comments by Austria, Pre-Draft Report of the OEWG – ICT’ (n 120).\n United Nations Secretary-General (n 119) 22. A similar position has been adopted by some recent academic commentators who argue that cyber operations amount to violations of sovereignty when they penetrate another state’s computers or networks even without physical damage of effects in the territory of the state. For example, Russell Buchan adopts this position and maintains that a violation occurs on the basis of the act of ‘the unauthorised intrusion into a domain protected by state sovereignty’. Buchan (n 116) 54. François Delerue also argues that ‘[i]f a cyber operation penetrates the cyber infrastructures in the territory of a foreign State, this would irrefutably constitute a violation of territorial sovereignty’.

It provides the example where a state takes ‘necessary measures, with minimally destructive effects, to defend against the harmful activity of malicious cyber actors’ in another state.\n Finnish Government, Ministry for Foreign Affairs (n 112).\n Czech Republic (n 121).

This approach has been suggested by the US in a 2017 US Department of Defence memorandum (US DoD memo),^[138]^ and the UK has expressly adopted this position.^[139]^\nFrom the sovereignty as a principle approach, given that sovereignty does not operate as a standalone rule of international law, it cannot be violated in itself. Instead, to amount to a violation of international law, a cyber operation needs to constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force or an intervention (ie a violation of existing rules of international law that arise from sovereignty).^[140]^ This means that, under this approach, a range of cyber operations are considered lawful under international law as they are not expressly prohibited. For example, according to the US DoD memo, sovereignty does not limit states from engaging in cyber activities 'that result in effects occurring on the infrastructure located in another State'.^[141]^ Similarly, according to the UK, the non-consensual interference into another state's computer networks is not a violation of their 'territorial sovereignty' because such a rule does not exist in international law in relation to cyber.^[142]^ As such, pursuant to the sovereignty as a principle approach, unauthorized cyber intrusions cannot constitute violations of sovereignty and will only amount to violations of international law where they rise to the threshold of a use of force or intervention and thus violate other existing rules of international law.\nTo summarize, when it comes to states' existing legal obligations most relevant to cyber operations that target or cause effects on another state's CI in peacetime, there is a degree of consensus in some areas but uncertainty in others. There is agreement that cyber operations will violate the prohibition on the use of force where their effects are similar to the use of armed force by kinetic means. However, there is no consensus around the precise threshold or about non-destructive but disruptive cyber operations in this context. The non-intervention principle generally applies to disruptive cyber operations provided they are coercive, however, this can be difficult to determine in the cyber context. Finally, while an increasing number of states have expressed support for the 'sovereignty as a rule' approach, there is no consensus on the threshold\n^[136]^ The Tallinn Manual experts were also divided on this.

This is evident in the subjective nature of what constitutes CI within the scope of norm (f), and the additional specific guidance provided by norm (f) which contradicts some of the harm requirements under international law.\n# Norm (f) and CI\nNorm (f) applies to cyber operations against CI, however, despite that there are core sectors that most states consider to constitute CI, the notion of CI remains subjective. This means that the precise scope of norm (f) is not clearly defined. States have the prerogative to determine which infrastructures to designate as CI, $^{143}$ and, from 'critical information infrastructure' $^{144}$ and 'critical national infrastructure' $^{145}$ to 'national, transnational and supranational critical infrastructure' $^{146}$ — there is little consistency in the terminology adopted by states. The lack of agreement about what constitutes CI for the purposes of norm (f) can be problematic. For instance, election infrastructure in the US was only designated as critical in January 2017 following Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. $^{147}$ Some states have also been hesitant to designate specific sectors as CI due to concerns that this would implicitly condone malicious activities against sectors that are not specified. $^{148}$ The 2021 UN GGE report expressly acknowledges these concerns, noting that, even where a sector is not designated as CI, it does not amount to condoning malicious activities against those sectors. $^{149}$ Furthermore, even where states specify certain sectors as CI, they are not precluded from designating other sectors as such in the future. $^{150}$ There have also been calls to extend norm (f) to mention specific sectors, even if those sectors are already widely considered to be CI. For example, in February 2020 the International Committee of the Red Cross proposed extending the application of norm (f) to address the\n\nSAMULI HAATAJA\n'particular vulnerability of health care facilities' in response to cyber operations against hospitals and vaccine research centres during the pandemic.\nWhile agreement about what sectors constitute CI for the purposes of norm (f) is useful in providing clarity for the scope of the norm, this introduces unnecessary additional complexity to how international law applies in this context. The contested nature of CI and focus on whether a sector is CI for the purposes of norm (f) has the potential to narrow the application of international law only to those sectors that states have agreed to constitute CI. The need for a cyber operation to affect CI also creates an additional requirement that is not evident in existing international law. This is because, irrespective of whether a sector is designated as CI or not, existing international law obligations apply to cyber operations causing effects in the territory of other states. For example, a cyber operation against election infrastructure rising to the level of a violation of sovereignty or intervention will constitute a violation of international law regardless of whether the victim state considers the infrastructure to be CI or not. Similarly, cyber operations against healthcare facilities causing sufficient effects will constitute violations of international law even if those sectors are not specifically mentioned in norm (f). Therefore, the focus on what constitutes CI for the purposes of norm (f), and the subjectivity of the concept of CI has the potential to introduce additional complexity to determining whether a cyber operation violates international law.\n## Norm (f) and uncertainty in international law\nNorm (f) seeks to reaffirm the existing legal obligations of states in relation to cyber operations against CI and provide additional specific guidance on responsible state behaviour in this context. However, the harm requirements within norm (f) are contradictory to those in international law, and this further compounds existing uncertainties in how the law applies to cyber operations targeting CI. As a result, there are a range of cyber operations that can constitute violations of international law but not norm (f), or vice versa.\nFor example, whether a cyber operation against CI constitutes a use of force will generally be determined based on its 'scale and effects'. Under this approach, there must be a degree of direct physical damage to the CI, or disruption of its functionality which causes damage or harm to individuals comparable to a use of force by kinetic means. The Stuxnet incident is generally considered to have crossed this threshold as it is reported to have caused damage to approximately 1000 centrifuge machines. Assuming Stuxnet was attributable to a state, its use would have violated norm (f) as it caused intentional damage to CI and was contrary to the responsible state's international obligations. However, a disruptive cyber operation with only adverse economic consequences would generally not constitute a use of force. This could include, for example, a cyber operation against a power grid that causes a temporary blackout without any indirect physical effects or harm to individuals. While a cyber operation of this kind would involve impairing the use of the CI and adversely impact its use for the public for the purposes of norm (f), it would unlikely violate a state's legal obligations under article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n International Committee of the Red Cross, 'Norms for Responsible State Behavior on Cyber Operations should Build on International Law' (11 February 2020) <https: document=\"\" en=\"\" norms-responsible-state-behavior-cyber-operations-should-build-international-law=\"\" www.icrc.org=\"\">. While norm (f) was not amended, the 2021 UN GGE report did specifically note how '[t]he COVID-19 pandemic heightened awareness of the critical importance of protecting health care and medical infrastructure and facilities, including through the implementation of the norms addressing critical infrastructure'. UN GGE 2021 report (n 150) 12.\n See Milanovic and Schmitt (n 8).\n Haataja (n 93) 88–95.\n See also Broeders and others (n 60) 4–7.</https:>\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 441\nFor a cyber operation of this kind without direct physical effects to violate the non-intervention principle, there is a requirement that the operation was intended to be coercive and directed at matters states have the right to decide freely. For example, where a cyber operation causing a blackout was done with the intention of coercing the targeted state to reverse its policy of recognition of another state, this would constitute an unlawful intervention. But where the cyber operation does not involve the element of coercion directed at matters states should be freely able to decide (or the responsible state's intention is unknown), then the cyber operation would fall outside the scope of the non-intervention principle. This is despite the impairment of CI and its adverse impact on the public that is consistent with the harm requirement in norm (f). Whether a cyber operation of this kind violates sovereignty is also unsettled given the divergence in views among states on the issue.\nIn relation to cyber operations against CI and violations of sovereignty, consider, for example, where a state obtains unauthorised access to another state's power grid, election infrastructure or hospital systems and installs malware that gives it the ability to cause disruptive or destructive effects on that infrastructure at a later point in time. Whether a cyber operation of this kind violates sovereignty is unsettled as the precise boundaries of states' legal obligations in this context are still developing and evolving as more state practice emerges. According to France and Iran, which adopt the rule approach to sovereignty and consider any penetration of their networks to be a violation of sovereignty, this conduct would constitute a violation of international law at the point in time at which there is unauthorized access to their systems.[155] However, for states like the Czech Republic and New Zealand, merely obtaining unauthorised access or installing malware that does not impair the functioning of the systems would not constitute violations of sovereignty.[156] Instead, for these states, it is only at the point in time at which that malware is used to cause significant disruptive or destructive effects that the cyber operation would qualify as a violation of sovereignty. Similarly, for states like the UK adopting the principle approach to sovereignty, the cyber operation could not constitute a violation of international law unless and until it rises to the level of a use of force or involves coercion and violates the non-intervention principle.[157] Accordingly, a range of cyber operations that meet the harm requirements in norm (f) would fall outside of its scope because, given the uncertainty around how international law applies in this context, it would be unclear whether those operations also violate the law as required by norm (f).\nFurther compounding the uncertainty in how existing international law applies are the harm requirements of norm (f) that are not consistent with international law. Norm (f) requires 'intentional damage', but the intent is not a requisite element for most of the rules of international law outlined above. In relation to the prohibition on the use of force, there is no requirement for intention.[158] Instead, the approach adopted by most states and in the Tallinn Manual focuses on the 'scale and effects' of a cyber operation.[159] Similarly, intention is not a requirement for a violation of sovereignty.[160] While intention is an element of the non-intervention principle,[161] the focus of the law here is on the intention of the state applying the coercion and not\n\nSAMULI HAATAJA\nwhether the particular technical effects – such as damage to CI – were intended or not. This means that there is no need for ‘intentional damage’ to be caused by a cyber operation for the non-intervention principle to be violated. Norm (f), however, specifically refers to intentional damage. As a result, where a state engages in a cyber operation against CI that causes unintentional damage to the CI, the activity could constitute a violation of sovereignty or a use of force but would fall outside the scope of the intentional damage contemplated by norm (f).\nThe approach to impairment evident in norm (f) is useful in terms of the specificity of the requirement for an (even minimally) adverse impact on services provided to the public by the CI. This encompasses a very broad spectrum of cyber operations against CI, including disruptive cyber operations that may fall outside the scope of the prohibition on the use of force and the non-intervention principle. However, unless these cyber operations cause sufficient effects to constitute a use of force, or are accompanied by coercive intention and satisfy the non-intervention principle, they would fall outside the scope of existing international law and also outside of norm (f). As such, while the ‘additional specific guidance’ that norm (f) provides in its approach to impairment is useful given the broad spectrum of cyber operations against CI that it captures, there is uncertainty about whether most of such cyber operations would constitute violations of international law as required under norm (f).\nFinally, when considering low-level cyber operations used to pre-position or prepare for potentially destructive cyber operations against CI in peacetime, what is revealed is the dark side of norm (f) and existing international law in this context. Given that these kinds of cyber operations do not cause immediate damage or impairment and, from a technical perspective, can be indistinguishable from cyber espionage, they are effectively permitted under existing international law and generally will not be seen to constitute violations of sovereignty. But much of CI is dual-use and this means that under certain conditions it can be lawfully subject to attack through cyber means in an armed conflict. Essentially, except in circumstances where there is evidence of an imminent armed attack, norm (f) and existing international law allow states to engage in cyber operations against CI that involve pre-positioning and preparing for potentially destructive effects in the future.\nTherefore, norm (f) introduces additional complexity to the application of international law in this context, and this complexity is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are considered to be ‘off limits’. The subjective nature of what constitutes CI and the requirement for a sector to be CI to be captured by norm (f) creates a requirement that is not evident in international law and effectively narrows its application.\n However, where a cyber operation of this kind also has an adverse impact on the public then it would constitute impairment under the second type of harm within norm (f). This could amount to a violation of international law on sovereignty, but this is uncertain given the current debate about sovereignty.\n The norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace only operate in peacetime. United States Department of Defence, ‘Cyber Strategy 2018’ (2018) 5 <https: 1=\"\" 18=\"\" 2002041658=\"\" 2018=\"\" c=\"\" media.defense.gov=\"\" sep=\"\" spc=\"\" www.cyber_strategy_summary_final.pdf=\"\">; Broeders and others (n 60) 14–16.\n The attack would need to be consistent with international humanitarian law obligations. See Fidler (n 83) 12; Jolley (n 51) 181–4. See also Broeders and others (n 60).\n For example, according to Australia, states may exercise a right of anticipatory self-defence where ‘a threatened armed attack in the form of an offensive cyber operation’ that could be launched ‘in a split second’ and could cause ‘large-scale loss of human life and damage to critical infrastructure’. See George Brandis, ‘The Right of Self-Defence against Imminent Armed Attack in International Law’ (Lecture delivered at the University of Queensland, Brisbane, 11 April 2017) 8 <https: 05=\"\" 2017=\"\" developments-international-law-self-defence-against-imminent-armed-attack=\"\" blog=\"\" law.uq.edu.au=\"\">. Similarly, according to NATO’s Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations, non-destructive cyber operations, such as those causing temporary disruptions of service or involving information gathering where they are conducted to enable a conventional threat – including an imminent threat of one – could be considered to trigger the right of self-defence. NATO, Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations, Allied Joint Publication-3.20 (NATO Standardisation Office 2020) 20 <https: 899678=\"\" attachment_data=\"\" government=\"\" file=\"\" doctrine_nato_cyberspace_operations_ajp_3_20_1_.pdf=\"\" uploads=\"\" www.cyber-systems_ajp_3_20_1_.pdf=\"\" www.cyber-docrine_nato_cyberspace_operations_ajp_3_20_1_.pdf=\"\">.\n This prioritizes the security interests of states over the cyber security of CI systems. David Fidler, for example, suggests a new cyber-defence norm adopting an ‘all hazards’ strategy to protect CI that does not focus on the legal regime (whether cyber crime or espionage) but instead on ensuring ‘networks are protected against infiltrations from any source’. Fidler (n 83) 13</https:></https:></https:>\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 443\nInternational law obligations apply to cyber operations conducted by states irrespective of whether they target what the victim state has designated as CI or not. While there is a degree of uncertainty around the thresholds at which violations of international law on the use of force, intervention and sovereignty occur, the harm requirements in norm (f) have the potential to compound these uncertainties as they are not consistent with these rules of international law.\nAccordingly, more clarity about the relationship between international law and norm (f) is needed, and about how international law applies to cyber operations targeting sectors that states have deemed to be CI. This is particularly the case in relation to international law on sovereignty. Especially where low-level cyber operations without immediately disruptive or destructive effects are involved, more states need to provide detailed accounts of when they consider the law to be violated and the relationship between sovereignty and sectors they consider to be CI. While a state's domestic legislation – like the Australian NSLA – may criminalise various activities such as the installation of malware onto CI on a national level, states should also expressly outline how they regard these activities on an international level. Here the approach to impairment in norm (f) can serve as useful guidance on when a cyber operation should violate sovereignty. Similarly, the fact that CI is targeted can serve as an indicia of a violation of sovereignty. For example, this is the approach that Germany has adopted making an explicit connection between cyber operations against its CI and violations of its sovereignty. In relation to low-level cyber operations, such as those involving the installation of malware enabling a persistent presence on CI that is generally accepted as a permissible form of espionage, these should be seen as potential violations of sovereignty given the purpose for which they are conducted. As such, while clarity around when cyber operations violate sovereignty and the relevance of a sector's designation as CI is needed, international law applies to cyber operations by states irrespective of norm (f) which introduces counterproductive complexity to the legal analysis in this context.\n# CONCLUSION\nThis article examined the norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace and international law prohibiting malicious cyber operations against CI. It demonstrated that norm (f), which prohibits cyber operations that damage or impair CI, introduces complexity to the application of international law that is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are prohibited by international law. This is due to the subjective nature of CI, the contradictory legal status of norm (f), and the ways in which the harm requirements of norm (f) compound existing uncertainties about how international law applies to cyber operations where CI is targeted. To develop clarity about what cyber operations against CI should be 'off limits', more states need to outline their positions on the threshold at which they consider the law to be violated – especially in relation to sovereignty – to ensure that malicious low-level cyber operations, in particular, do not fall outside of these legal constraints.\n This has been recently recognized in the UN OEWG 2021 report where it was noted that a cyber operation contrary to international law that 'intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public, could pose a threat not only to security but also to State sovereignty'. See UN OEWG 2021 report (n 48) 4.\n According to Germany, where a cyber operation targets a state's CI it 'may indicate that a State's territorial sovereignty has been violated'. However, given, among other things, the lack of international agreement of what constitutes CI, Germany maintained that this in and of itself cannot constitute the basis for a violation. The Federal Government of Germany (n 89) 4.\n For example, Asaf Lubin maintains that cyber espionage should be unlawful where the purpose for which it is conducted is unlawful. Asaf Lubin, 'The Liberty to Spy' (2020) 61(1) HILJ 185, 238–9. Other academics have also expressed support for adopting a purpose approach in determining the lawfulness of cyber espionage.

    "# CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND CYBER OPERATIONS In June 2020, the Australian Government revealed that it had been subject to a campaign of cyber attacks targeting its federal- and state-level governments, various companies and CI. Given the scale and nature of the operations, Australia maintained a foreign state actor was responsible, however, it stopped short of publicly attributing the operations to a specific state. Despite this, some have suggested China was responsible. The cyber operations are understood to have involved compromising the computer systems and networks of the various organisations that were targeted through vulnerabilities in their software. However, despite the media attention Australia's revelation of the incident received, the cyber operations did not cause any effects, such as disrupting the operation of the compromised organisations. Instead, according to the Australian Cyber Security Centre, there was no evidence of 'intent by the actor to carry out any disruptive or destructive activities within victim environments'.": "There is growing concern about the threat posed by low-level cyber operations that do not necessarily result in immediate disruptive or destructive effects but are nonetheless significant in their scale or have the potential to be used in preparation for more harmful operations. For example, the Australian Department of Defence has specifically highlighted the threat posed by 'all kinds of preparation, pre-positioning, [and] collection of intelligence' activities in the cyber context. This was echoed by the Director General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation who expressed concerns about 'the potential for Australia's adversaries to pre-position malicious code in critical infrastructure... [which] could be used to damage critical CYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE networks in the future.⁶ In the United States (US), the 2018 ‘National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America’ (US Cyber Strategy) makes specific mention of Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, and provides that the US and its allies ‘are vulnerable to peacetime cyber attacks against critical infrastructure’ and that there is a growing risk ‘these countries will conduct cyber attacks against the United States during a crisis short of war’.⁷ Accordingly, there is recognition of the potentially devastating impact that cyber operations on CI can have and the threat posed by cyber activities in preparation of such operations. These concerns have been exacerbated by reports about malicious cyber operations conducted against hospitals and vaccine research centres during the pandemic in 2020,⁸ as well as ransomware crippling the operation of Colonial Pipeline in 2021 in the US.⁹ In light of these concerns, states have highlighted the need for international agreement that certain CI should be ‘off limits’ from malicious cyber activities. In 2015, for example, Australia’s then Foreign Minister Julie Bishop maintained that: The effective functioning of critical infrastructure underpins the global economy. States should prevent and refrain from online activity which damages or impairs critical infrastructure, whether it be in banking, telecos, energy structures. While states define their critical infrastructure sectors differently and harmonisation is important, agreeing that key sectors should be off limits is a priority for the international community.¹⁰ And in 2021, following the Colonial Pipeline incident, US President Joe Biden told Russia’s President Vladimir Putin that ‘certain critical infrastructure should be “off limits” to attack’, and provided Russia with a list of 16 sectors the US considers CI.¹¹ In Australia, as part of the effort to counter the broader threat posed by malicious cyber activities by foreign actors, the ‘National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Act 2018’ (NSLA) was recently passed into law. The NSLA was primarily introduced to address the threat of foreign interference in its political processes,¹² but it also contains provisions relating to foreign cyber activities against Australia’s CI. These include a range of new sabotage offences designed to ‘criminalise conduct causing damage to a broad range of critical infrastructure where it could prejudice Australia’s national security’.¹³ For example, under the NSLA it is a criminal offence to engage in conduct that results in damage to Australia’s infrastructure where this is done on behalf of a foreign actor and it undermines Australia’s national ⁶ Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, ASIO Annual Report 2020-21 (2021) 5 <https: annual%20report%202020-21%20web.pdf=\"\"default=\"\"files=\"\"sites=\"\"www.asio.gov.au=\"\">.\n⁷ The White House, ‘National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America’ (September 2018) 3 <https: 09=\"\"2018=\"\"annual%20report%202020-21%20web.pdf=\"\"files=\"\"national-cyber-strategy.pdf=\"\"uploads=\"\"wp-content=\"\"www.wytimes.com=\"\">.\n⁸ See Marko Milanovic and Michael Schmitt, ‘Cyber Attacks and Cyber (Mis)information Operations During a Pandemic’ (2020) 11 JNSLP 247.\n⁹ David Sanger, Clifford Krauss, and Nicole Perlroth, ‘Cyberattack Forces a Shutdown of a Top U.S. Pipeline’ The New York Times (8 May 2021) <https: 05=\"\"2021=\"\"09=\"\"a=\"\"cw=\"\"cw-weights=\"\"for=\"\"hyperattack-colonial-pipeline.html=\"\"upolitics=\"\"us=\"\"politics=\"\"paucities=\"\"www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n¹⁰ Julie Bishop, ‘Statement for Plenary Session on International Peace and Security, Global Conference on Cyberspace’ Minister for Foreign Affairs The Hon Julie Bishop MP (17 April 2015) <https: 05=\"\"2021-06-16=\"\"2021=\"\"julie-bishop=\"\"minister=\"\"minister.julie-bishop=\"\"speech=\"\"www.foreignminister.gov.au=\"\">.\n¹¹ Vladimir Soldatkin and Humeyra Pamuk, ‘Biden Tells Putin Certain Cyberattacks should be “Off-limits”’ Reuters (17 June 2021) <https: biden-tells-putin-certain-cyber-attacks-should-be-off-limits-2021-06-16=\"\"technology=\"\"www.reuters.com=\"\">.\n¹² See Henry Belot, ‘Malcolm Turnbull Announces Biggest Overhaul of Espionage, Intelligence Laws in Decades’ ABC News (5 December 2017) <https: 2017-12-05=\"\"news=\"\"turnbull-announces-foreign-interference-laws=\"\"www.abc.net.au=\"\">; Louise Yaxley, ‘Sam Dastyari and the Murky Links with Chinese Businessmen that Ended his Political Career’ ABC News (12 December 2017) <http: 2017-12-12=\"\"9249216=\"\"am-dastyari-murky-links-with-chinese-businessmen-ended-career=\"\"news=\"\"www.abc.net.au=\"\">.\n¹³ National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Act 2018 (Cth) (NSLA Act) sch 1 pt 1 div 82–Sabotage; Revised Explanatory Memorandum, National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017 (Cth) 62 [137].</http:></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:> SAMULI HAATAJA security.¹⁴ Similarly, it is a criminal offence to introduce vulnerabilities – such as the installation of malicious software (malware) or creation of backdoors – onto public infrastructure where this is done to undermine Australia's national security.¹⁵ As such, the NSLA includes offences that specifically apply to activities involved in the preparation of potential future intrusions into, for example, Australian government networks and systems.¹⁶ However, while Australia has legislated to protect CI from foreign cyber activities on a domestic level, international agreement around what activities or sectors are to be ‘off limits’ is necessary to ensure the protection of CI from state-sponsored cyber threats.\n## Definitions of critical infrastructure Part of the problem around what activities or sectors should be ‘off limits’ revolves around differences in what constitutes CI among states. As highlighted by Australia’s former foreign minister above, there is no universal definition of CI and states in fact have the ability to designate any infrastructure asset as CI. Generally, CI includes various infrastructures such as those related to energy, health and transportation, and many of these infrastructures are dual-use. In Australia, for example, CI is defined as referring to the physical facilities, supply chains, information technologies and communication networks which, if destroyed, degraded or rendered unavailable for an extended period, would significantly impact on the social or economic wellbeing of the nation or affect Australia’s ability to conduct national defence and ensure national security.¹⁷ In Australia, CI thus ‘provides services that are essential for everyday life such as energy, communications, water, transport, health, food and grocery, banking and finance and the Australian Government’.¹⁸ The United Kingdom (UK) in turn adopts the term ‘critical national infrastructure’ and this refers to the ‘critical elements of infrastructure (namely, assets, facilities, systems, networks or processes and the essential workers that operate and facilitate them)’ where the loss or compromise of those elements would result in a ‘major detrimental impact on the availability, integrity or delivery of essential services’ and/or a ‘significant impact on national security, national defence or the functioning of the state’.¹⁹ In the US, CI refers to ‘systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the US that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety or any combination of those matters’.²⁰ The ‘critical infrastructure sectors’, as identified by the recently established US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, include 16 sectors across energy, commerce, finance, food and agriculture, healthcare, emergency services, water, waste, transportation and defence.²¹ In the European Union (EU), CI refers to ¹⁴ NSLA Act (n 13) ss 82.3, 82.4.\n¹⁵ See NSLA Act (n 13) ss 82.7, 82.8.\n¹⁶ Revised NSLA Explanatory Memorandum (n 13) 80 [236].\n¹⁷ Commonwealth of Australia, Critical Infrastructure Resilience Strategy: Policy Statement (2015) 8 <https: criticalinfrastructureresiliencestrategypolicystatement.pdf=\"\"site%20documents=\"\"www.tisn.gov.au=\"\">.\n¹⁸ Australian Government, ‘What is the Critical Infrastructure Centre?’ Critical Infrastructure Centre <https: ctc-factsheet-what-is-critical-infrastructure-centre.pdf=\"\"files=\"\"nat-security=\"\"www.homeaffairs.gov.au=\"\">.\n¹⁹ Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure, ‘Critical National Infrastructure’ (2020) <https: critical-national-infrastructure-0=\"\"www.cpni.gov.uk=\"\">.\n²⁰ USA Patriot Act of 2001, 42 USC §§5195c(e), 1016(e).\n²¹ United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, ‘Critical Infrastructure Sectors’ (24 March 2020) <https: critical-infrastructure-sectors=\"\"www.cisa.gov=\"\">.</https:></https:></https:></https:> CYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 417 an asset, system or part thereof located in Member States which is essential for the maintenance of vital societal functions, health, safety, security, economic or social well-being of people, and the disruption or destruction of which would have a significant impact in a Member State as a result of the failure to maintain those functions.²² This essentially refers to the physical infrastructure which is vital for the proper functioning of society. The EU uses the term ‘critical information infrastructure’ (CII) to describe both the essential information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructures and those that are essential for the operation of its physical CI.²³ At the United Nations (UN) level, states have noted in a General Assembly resolution on the ‘creation of a global culture of cybersecurity and the protection of critical information infrastructures’ that CI involves, among other things, the infrastructures used for ‘the generation, transmission and distribution of energy, air and maritime transport, banking and financial services, e-commerce, water supply, food distribution and public health’ and that these infrastructures are increasingly interconnected with CII.²⁴ But here too it is recognized that each state has the right to determine what constitutes its CI.²⁵ Accordingly, in the Australian, UK, US, EU and UN contexts, CI refers to infrastructures essential to the proper functioning and well-being of the state and society. The term encompasses physical infrastructures (such as power plants and hospitals) located within a state’s territory, as well as the virtual infrastructure allowing the physical components to operate. Generally, this infrastructure is critical where its disruption or destruction would have a detrimental impact (whether significant, major, debilitating and so on) on the provision of key services that relate to the social or economic well-being of the state or its national security. However, states also have the prerogative to designate any infrastructure assets or sectors as critical. For example, the above UK definition includes the human personnel required to operate CI, and in Australia, the relevant government minister has the power to designate any asset as critical.²⁶ As such, while there are core sectors that most states consider to constitute CI, the scope of what constitutes CI is subjective as evident in the differences in terminology and approaches that states adopt in determining this. Consequently, when considering relevant laws and norms surrounding CI protection, there is uncertainty about the specific infrastructures against which malicious cyber activities are prohibited.\n## Cyber operations against critical infrastructure In addition to the 2020 cyber attacks against Australia, there are various other examples of known incidents differing in kind and intensity from low-level information collection operations to more disruptive and even destructive attacks against states’ CI. For example, in 2010 the infamous Stuxnet malware was discovered which had infected an Iranian uranium enrichment facility and, by changing the settings according to which the centrifuge machines operated, caused physical damage to approximately 1000 centrifuges.²⁷ Similarly, in a non-destructive but highly disruptive attack, in December 2015 parts of Ukraine’s power grid were shut down for ²² Council Directive 2008/114/EC of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection [2008] OJ L 345/75 art 2.\n²³ Commission of the European Communities, ‘Green Paper on a European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection’ (COM/2005/576 final, 17 November 2005) 19.\n²⁴ United Nations General Assembly, UNGA Res 58/199 (23 December 2003) UN Doc A/RES/58/199, 1.\n²⁵ Ibid.\n²⁶ See ss 50 and 51 of the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 (Cth).\n²⁷ Joby Warrick, ‘Iran’s Natanz Nuclear Facility Recovered Quickly from Stuxnet Cyberattack’ The Washington Post (16 February 2011) <http: 02=\"\"15=\"\"2011=\"\"ar2011021505395.html=\"\"content=\"\"article=\"\"wp-dyn=\"\"www.washingtonpost.com=\"\">.

These operations can be used to gather information that can potentially be used in preparation for more disruptive future operations.³⁰ As an example, in 2018 the US Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation released a report on Russian cyber activities targeting its energy and other CI sectors.³¹ According to this report, Russian actors had since at least 2016 ‘targeted government entities and multiple US critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy, nuclear, commercial facilities, water, aviation and critical manufacturing sectors’.³² This was characterized by these agencies ‘as a multi-stage intrusion campaign by Russian government cyber actors’ in which these actors obtained unauthorized access to various networks and installed malware allowing them to conduct reconnaissance and collect information about industrial control systems.³³ Similarly, in 2019 it was reported that the US had moved beyond mere reconnaissance operations into Russia’s power grid to the placement of malware onto those systems that could be used to disrupt its operation.³⁴ Furthermore, in December 2020, it was reported that Russia had, through software provided by the company SolarWinds, compromised a range of US government agencies³⁵ and companies responsible for CI in the electricity, oil and manufacturing industries.³⁶ While the SolarWinds incident is mainly understood to have compromised data in the affected sectors, Anne Neuberger, the US Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology, expressed concerns that Russia’s ability to access these systems has the potential to be used for disruptive operations in the future.³⁷ And in January 2022, during increased tensions between the US and Russia in the lead-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the US Cybersecurity Advisory issued an advisory encouraging the US cybersecurity community and especially CI operators ‘to adopt a heightened state of awareness’ given the threat posed by Russian-state-sponsored cyber operations against US CI.³⁸ Accordingly, states like the US and Russia are using malicious cyber operations to obtain unauthorized access and maintaining a ‘persistent presence’ in other states’ CI systems. The concern is that these preparatory cyber operations can be used to damage or disrupt the operation of CI in the future.\n²⁸ See Kim Zetter, ‘Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid’ Wired (3 March 2016) <https: 03=\"\"2016=\"\"03=\"\"inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid=\"\"www.wired.com=\"\">.\n²⁹ David Sanger, ‘Utilities Cautioned about Potential for a Cyberattack’ The New York Times (29 February 2016) <https: 03=\"\"2016=\"\"00=\"\"http:=\"\"us=\"\"politics=\"\"politics.cautioned-about-potential-for-a-cyberattack-after-ukraines.html=\"\"www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n³⁰ See Symantec Critical Attack Discovery and Intelligence Team, ‘Dragonfly: Western Energy Sector Targeted by Sophisticated Attack Group’ Symantec Threat Intelligence (20 October 2017) <https: dragonfly-energy-sector-cyber-attacks=\"\"blogs=\"\"symantec-blogs.broadcom.com=\"\">.\n³¹ United States Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation, ‘Russian Government Cyber Activity Targeting Energy and Other Critical Infrastructure Sectors’ (Technical Alert TA18-074A, 15 March 2018) <https: alerts=\"\"a18-074a=\"\"ncas=\"\"ta18-074a=\"\"www.us-cert.gov=\"\">.\n³² Ibid.\n³³ Ibid.\n³⁴ David Sanger and Nicole Perlroth, ‘U.S. Escalates Online Attacks on Russia’s Power Grid’ The New York Times (15 June 2019) <https: 06=\"\"15=\"\"2019=\"\"us=\"\"politics=\"\"prurip-cyber-russia-grid.html=\"\"www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n³⁵ David Sanger, ‘Russian Hackers Broke into Federal Agencies, U.S. Officials Suspect’ The New York Times (13 December 2020) <https: 12=\"\"2020=\"\"22=\"\"2020=\"\"politics=\"\"russian-hackers-us-government-treasury-commerce.html?=\"\"www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n³⁶ Kim Zetter, ‘SolarWinds Hack Infected Critical Infrastructure, including Power Industry’ The Intercept (25 December 2020) <https: 02=\"\"2020=\"\"22=\"\"24=\"\"solarwinds-hack-power-infrastructure=\"\"theintercept.com=\"\">.\n³⁷ David Sanger, ‘After Russian Cyberattack, Looking for Answers and Debating Retaliation’ The New York Times (23 February 2021) <https: 02=\"\"2021=\"\"23=\"\"polities=\"\"solarwinds-hack-senate-intelligence-russia.html=\"\"www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n³⁸ Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, ‘Understanding and Mitigating Russian State Sponsored Cyber Threats to U.S. Critical Infrastructure’ (11 January 2022) 1 <https: 02=\"\"2022=\"\"23=\"\"default=\"\"files=\"\"publications=\"\"us=\"\"uscert=\"\"sites=\"\"www.cisa.gov=\"\"uscert=\"\"publications=\"\"uscertisites=\"\"></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:> CYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 419 This concern crystallized during the war in Ukraine in 2022 which involved a range of cyber operations and activities that Russia had pre-positioned for.³⁹ # NORMS OF RESPONSIBLE STATE BEHAVIOUR IN CYBERSPACE The international security issues surrounding states' use of digital technologies and activities in cyberspace have been considered at the UN level since the late 1990s, and in this context, states have agreed to norms around responsible behaviour in cyberspace including around CI protection. Since 1998, the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) of the UN General Assembly has regularly considered 'Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security'.⁴⁰ In 2004 it established a Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) to examine existing and potential threats from cyberspace.⁴¹ A second GGE was established in 2009 and it issued a consensus report in 2010⁴² which highlighted the risk of how '[t]he growing use of ICTs in critical infrastructures creates new vulnerabilities and opportunities for disruption'.⁴³ It also recommended that states should engage in further dialogue 'to discuss norms pertaining to State use of ICTs, to reduce collective risk and protect critical national and international infrastructure'.⁴⁴ This was echoed in the 2013 report from the third GGE which also, for the first time, confirmed the general application of international law and UN Charter principles in the cyber context.⁴⁵ The 2015 report by the fourth GGE was significant as it introduced a set of norms for responsible state behaviour in their use of ICTs.⁴⁶ The UN General Assembly also passed resolutions in 2018 and 2019 on 'Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security' where it called on states to be guided by the UN GGE reports and these norms in their use of ICTs.⁴⁷ This was echoed in the 2021 consensus report of the UN Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security in which states emphasized the importance of these norms.⁴⁸ From these norms, three are particularly relevant to CI protection. Norm (g) provides that states should take appropriate measures to protect their own CI, and norm (h) provides that states should mitigate malicious cyber activities emanating from their territory that are directed against the CI of other states.⁴⁹ Of most relevance to malicious cyber operations against CI, however, is norm (f). It provides that: ³⁹ Microsoft, 'Special Report: Ukraine' (27 April 2022) § <https: am=\"\"app=\"\"am=\"\"binary=\"\"re4vwwd=\"\"query.prod.cms=\"\"re4vwwd=\"\"www.cms=\"\">.\n⁴⁰ United Nations General Assembly, Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, GA Res 53/70, UN Doc A/RES/53/70 (4 January 1999).\n⁴¹ United Nations Secretary-General, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security: Report of the Secretary-General, UN Doc A/60/202 (5 August 2005).\n⁴² United Nations Secretary-General, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security: Note by the Secretary-General, UN Doc A/65/201 (30 July 2010).\n⁴³ Ibid 7.\n⁴⁴ Ibid 8.\n⁴⁵ United Nations Secretary-General, Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/68/98 (24 June 2013) 2.\n⁴⁶ United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/70/174 (22 July 2015) 8.\n⁴⁷ See United Nations General Assembly, Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/RES/73/266 (2 January 2019); United Nations General Assembly, Advancing Responsible State Behaviours in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/RES/74/28 (18 December 2019).\n⁴⁸ United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, 'Final Substantive Report' (10 March 2021) 4–5 <https: 03=\"\"2021=\"\"front.un-arm.org=\"\"uploads=\"\"wp-content=\"\"wpr2.pdf=\"\"uploads=\"\">.\n⁴⁹ See Michael Berk, 'Recommendation 13(g) and (h)' in United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (ed), Voluntary, Non-Binding Norms for Responsible State Behaviour in the Use of Information and Communications Technology: A Commentary (United Nations Publication 2017).</https:></https:> SAMULI HAATAJA A State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity contrary to its obligations under international law that intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public.⁵⁰ Prima facie, norm (f) specifically prohibits cyber operations against the CI of other states. According to the commentary to the norms, it reflects consensus about the unique importance of CI to modern societies and a recognition of the possibility of conflicts to escalate where state-to-state cyber activities adversely impact CI in particular.⁵¹ However, despite this apparent consensus, there is debate about the legal status of norm (f) and its relationship to international law. In particular, it is unclear whether it seeks to create new non-binding expectations of responsible state behaviour or to reaffirm the application of existing binding rules of international law.\nThis lack of clarity arises because norm (f) is explicitly included as a 'voluntary, non-binding' norm in the 2015 UN GGE report, and all of the norms are located in a separate section to the question of how international law applies to ICT activities.⁵² Yet the wording of norm (f) expressly refers to a state's 'obligations under international law' – that is, binding, opposed to voluntary and non-binding obligations – resulting in what others have described as a 'contradiction in terms'.⁵³ The confusion about the legal status of norm (f) is also evident among states who generally regard the norms as conceptually distinct from international law.⁵⁴ For example, Australia, in its 2017 'Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy', expresses a commitment to these norms and notes that international law can be complemented with these norms, but treats the two as distinct.⁵⁵ The US has also expressed a commitment to the promotion of these norms but regards them as conceptually distinct from international law. This is evident in the US Cyber Strategy which includes as one of its pillars the preservation of peace through strength,⁵⁶ and the means of doing so is through the promotion of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace based on international law on one hand, and 'voluntary non-binding norms' on the other.⁵⁷ Similarly, the ASEAN-EU Statement on Cybersecurity Cooperation distinguishes between the application of international law in the cyber context and, separately, acknowledges 'that voluntary and non-binding norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour of States in the use of ICTs can reduce risks to international peace, security and stability'.⁵⁸ The distinction between the non-binding norms and binding international law obligations is also evident in academic commentary. For example, according to Harriet Moynihan, norm (f) 'does not represent a binding obligation on states' and merely demonstrates 'their concern to protect ⁵⁰ UN GGE 2015 report (n 46) 8.\n⁵¹ Jason Jolley, 'Recommendation 13 (f)' in United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (ed) Voluntary, Non-Binding Norms for Responsible State Behaviour in the Use of Information and Communications Technology: A Commentary (United Nations Publication 2017) 169–70.\n⁵² UN GGE 2015 report (n 46) 7.\n⁵³ Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco, and Talita de Souza Dias, 'Drawing the Cyber Baseline: The Applicability of Existing International Law to the Governance of Information and Communication Technologies' (2022) 99 ILS 4, 32.\n⁵⁴ Liisi Adamson, 'International Law and International Cyber Norms: A Continuum?' in Dennis Broeders and Bibi van den Berg (eds) Governing Cyberspace: Behavior, Power, and Diplomacy (Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2020) 25, 33.\n⁵⁵ Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 'Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy' (October 2017) 47–8 <https: 2020-11=\"\"default=\"\"files=\"\"the%20strategy.pdf=\"\"www.internationalcybertech.gov.au=\"\"sites=\"\">; Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 2019 Progress Report, Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy (2019).\n⁵⁶ The White House (7) 20.\n⁵⁷ Ibid.\n⁵⁸ Association of South East Asian Nations, 'ASEAN-EU Statement on Cybersecurity Cooperation' Association of South East Asian Nations (August 2019) [6]–[7] <https: 08=\"\"2019=\"\"asean.org=\"\"asean-eu-statement-on-cybersecurity-cooperation-final.pdf=\"\"storage=\"\">.</https:></https:> CYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE The commentary to the norms, published by the UN Office for Disarmament Affairs,⁶¹ elaborates on key elements of norm (f) including its relationship with international law.⁶² Here it is noted that it is unclear 'why the [UN Group of Governmental] Experts have offered as voluntary something that by the majority of states is considered legally binding'.⁶³ The commentary explains that norm (f) is premised on the law of state responsibility and was intended to reaffirm that states' existing legal obligations extend to their cyber activities.⁶⁴ This is evident, for example, from the phrase 'conduct[s] or knowingly support[s]' within the wording of norm (f) which encompasses relevant rules of attribution of conduct under international law on state responsibility.⁶⁵ The phrase 'contrary to its obligations' in turn refers to states' existing obligations under international law and includes, for example, the prohibition on the use of force and relevant international humanitarian law obligations.⁶⁶ Therefore, according to the commentary, despite being expressly included as a voluntary and non-binding norm, norm (f) was intended to reaffirm states' existing legal obligations in relation to CI.⁶⁷ Accordingly, the precise legal status of norm (f) is unclear and others have raised concerns about the implications of this. Writing in relation to the cyber norms generally, Kubo Mačák highlights how 'non-binding norms can never override binding legal rules' and, in the reverse, that 'a non-binding norm cannot permit action that would otherwise be forbidden by international law'.⁶⁸ He maintains that the distinction is important as only a violation of international law can trigger obligations of cessation and reparation under the law on state responsibility.⁶⁹ François Delerue, Frédérick Douzet and Aude Géry in turn maintain that the distinction between international law and norms 'complexifies the definition of rights and obligations for the states in cyberspace as it introduces a confusion on the nature of the rules'.⁷⁰ They argue that by separating the two, the potential implication is that the norm is autonomous and detached from international law and that state behaviour in cyberspace is based only on the goodwill of states and not legal obligations.⁷¹ Similarly, Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco and Talita de Souza Dias argue that the inclusion of norm (f) as a voluntary, non-binding norm by the UN GGE can ⁵⁹ Harriet Moynihan, 'The Application of International Law to State Cyberattacks Sovereignty and Non-intervention' (Chatham House Research Paper 2019) 44 <https: 12=\"\"2019=\"\"application-international-law-state-cyberattacks=\"\"www.chathamhouse.org=\"\">.\n⁶⁰ Dennis Broeders, Els de Busser, Fabio Cristiano, and Tatiana Tropina, 'Revisiting Past Cyber Operations in Light of New Cyber Norms and Interpretations of International Law: Inching towards Lines in the Sand?'

It provides that the 'norms do not replace or alter' binding obligations under international law, and do not seek to limit or prohibit action that is otherwise consistent with international law.\"[73] Instead, the norms 'provide additional specific guidance' on what constitutes responsible state behaviour in the cyber context.[74] As such, the legal status of norm (f) is contradictory given it was both intended to reaffirm states' legal obligations in relation to CI and, without replacing or altering the law, to provide non-binding additional specific guidance on what constitutes responsible state behaviour in this context. This is problematic as it is unclear what kinds of cyber operations are prohibited by binding international law obligations in contrast to those that are only contrary to non-binding norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.\nIn addition to its legal status, the commentary to norm (f) also discusses the degree of harm that is required for the norm to be violated. Norm (f) refers to activities that 'intentionally damage[] critical infrastructure or otherwise impair[] the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public'.[75] Essentially, this involves two types of harm: either intentional damage to CI or the use and operation of CI is impaired in its provision of services to the public. The commentary elaborates on both of these. In relation to the first, this requires a state to deliberately cause damage to CI irrespective of whether the damage impacts public services connected to the CI. Here the degree of damage is irrelevant as long as the damage is physical in nature.[76] Given the requirement of intention, however, where a state unintentionally causes physical damage to CI (provided it does not impair the use or operation of CI in its provision of services to the public) then this would fall outside the scope of norm (f).[77] The second type of harm involves situations where a cyber operation does not cause any damage but impairs the use and operation of CI in its provision of services to the public. According to the commentary, impairment in this context refers to: any damage, physical or electronic, including the loss of data or software, or interruption of digital services provided by critical infrastructure, that makes the critical infrastructure less effective, less valuable, operate worse, or inhibit use by the public, the threshold being that the public must be impacted, even minimally.[78] As such, the term 'impairment' encompasses physical impairment but does not require it, and captures a range of circumstances where the functionality of CI is undermined provided it results in a detrimental impact on its use by the public. This excludes cyber operations that do not disrupt the operation of CI, as well as cyber operations that disrupt the operation of CI without any impact on the public.[79] Unlike the requirement for intentional damage, the need for impairment is based on a strict liability approach where there is no need for the responsible state to have intended to cause the impairment.[80] In summary, states have agreed to norms of responsible behaviour in cyberspace at the UN level including norm (f) which specifically prohibits certain cyber operations against CI.\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 433 However, the legal status of norm (f) is contradictory. On one hand, it seeks to reaffirm states' existing obligations in relation to CI and is not intended to modify those obligations. On the other, it provides non-binding 'additional specific guidance' on responsible state behaviour in this context, particularly in relation to the degree of harm that should not be caused to CI.⁸¹ As will be demonstrated below, this guidance is concerning as it is inconsistent with the harm requirements under international law, and this further compounds existing uncertainties about how the law applies in this context.⁸² # INTERNATIONAL LAW AND CYBER OPERATIONS This section examines how relevant rules of international law that norm (f) reaffirms apply to state activities in cyberspace. The focus is on three primary areas of international law that provide limits to cyber operations in peacetime, namely the law on the use of force, non-intervention and sovereignty. These are of particular relevance to cyber operations attributable to states targeting another state's CI given the broad spectrum of effects that remotely conducted cyber operations can cause.⁸³ There is widespread agreement that international law generally applies to state activities in cyberspace. This was highlighted in the 2015 UN GGE report which recognized that international law and the UN Charter in particular apply in the cyber context.⁸⁴ This was reaffirmed in the 2021 UN OEWG consensus report.⁸⁵ Despite this general agreement, however, there continues to be uncertainty about how particular rules of international law apply. As such, UN Member States have been invited to provide their national views on the UN GGE reports and to make submissions or provide working papers in connection with the UN OEWG which ran parallel to the UN GGE. In connection with these processes, states have provided more detailed accounts about how they consider the law to apply. The views of states are important as they contribute to more clarity about how international law applies in the cyber context, and to the development of customary international law applicable to state conduct in this context.⁸⁶ However, the different positions evident in these statements have given rise to some debate about how the law applies. The implication of this is that, while there are some areas where a degree of consensus is emerging, there continues to be a degree of uncertainty about when cyber operations against CI will violate international law.",
    "# Use of force A cyber operation that causes physical damage to CI can potentially violate the prohibition on the use of force. Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits states from the use of force. Force in this context is generally understood to refer to 'armed force'.⁸⁷ Despite being drafted in the ⁸¹ However, as Delerue, Douzet and Géry note, the non-binding norms nonetheless 'can contribute to the interpretation of existing obligations in international law, or to the formation of new international obligations'. Delerue, Douzet and Géry (n 70) 31.": "⁸² See section 5.\n⁸³ Other areas of law, such as international humanitarian law which applies in an armed conflict, while important given the dual-use nature of CI, are outside of the article's scope.

This is a rule of customary international law that prohibits states from using coercive means to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another state as these are matters which states have the right to decide freely by virtue of their sovereignty. A violation of international law based on the non-intervention principle requires two elements. First, there must be coercive interference, and second, it must be directed towards the matters that sovereign states should be able to decide freely.97 CYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 435 Coercion is not defined in international law. The majority of the Tallinn Manual experts, for example, adopted a narrow approach to the term defining it as ‘an affirmative act designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way.’⁹⁸ They distinguished it from activities that seek to influence (as opposed to factually compel) a state to behave in a particular way such as public criticism or propaganda.⁹⁹ Others, however, have defined coercion more broadly as a form of pressure that seeks to deprive the target state of its free will.¹⁰⁰ This view was echoed by the minority of the Tallinn Manual experts who maintained that it is sufficient that the activity ‘has the effect of depriving the State of control over the matter in question.’¹⁰¹ This broader approach to coercion is also supported by some states in the cyber context. For example, according to Australia coercion involves ‘effectively deprive[ing] another state of the ability to control, decide upon or govern matters of an inherently sovereign nature.’¹⁰² Similarly, the German position maintains that coercion involves where a state’s ‘will is manifestly bent by the foreign State’s conduct.’¹⁰³ The second element requires that the coercion is directed at matters that states are able to decide freely by virtue of their sovereignty.¹⁰⁴ These include, according to the ICJ, the ‘choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy’.¹⁰⁵ States have also endorsed this view in the cyber context. Australia’s position is that the law requires the coercion to affect ‘matters of an inherently sovereign nature’,¹⁰⁶ according to the UK the coercion must affect ‘matters of government which are at the heart of a state’s sovereignty’,¹⁰⁷ and for New Zealand, coercion must deprive the state from control over ‘matters falling within the scope of its inherently sovereign functions’.¹⁰⁸ A number of states have also provided examples of situations in which the non-intervention principle would be violated in the cyber context. Many states, including Australia,¹⁰⁹ the UK,¹¹⁰ the US¹¹¹ ⁹⁸ Schmitt (n 90) 317 citing Robert Y Jennings and Arthur Watts (eds), *Oppenheim’s International Law, Volume 1, Peace* (9ᵗʰ edn Longman 1992) 430–1.\n⁹⁹ Schmitt (n 90) 318.\n¹⁰⁰ Moynihan (n 59) 30.\n¹⁰¹ Schmitt (n 90) 318.\n¹⁰² Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, ‘Australia’s International Cyber Engagement Strategy, 2019 International Law Supplement’ (2019) 5 <https: 2020-11=\"\"2019%20legal%20supplement_0.pdf=\"\"default=\"\"files=\"\"sites=\"\"www.internationalcybertech.gov.au=\"\">.\n¹⁰³ The Federal Government of Germany (n 89) 5.\n¹⁰⁴ The concept of domaine réservé (reserved domain) is often used to refer to matters within the exclusive domestic jurisdiction of states (see Katja Ziegler, ‘Domaine Réservé’ in *Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law* (Oxford University Press 2013)) and this is sometimes distinguished from the broader state functions that states have the authority to exercise. For example, the Tallinn Manual distinguishes between a state’s ‘inherently governmental functions’ (relevant for a sovereignty violation) from the concept of domaine réservé (relevant to the non-intervention principle). Schmitt (n 90) 24. However, it is argued that the notion of ‘matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely’ (using the ICJ’s wording) is preferred. This is not confined to a state’s internal affairs as it also includes their external affairs (eg membership of international organisations, and decisions to recognise states) which can be subject to coercive interference. Additionally, even if a matter is regulated by international law (and thus it is no longer within a state’s domaine réservé meaning the state no longer has exclusive regulatory authority over the matter), the state still has the authority to make choices within that area of law. As such, the ‘matters that sovereign states are permitted to decide freely’ is a more useful concept opposed to the narrow notion of a state’s domaine réservé.

Australia and the UK also maintain that using cyber means involving coercion to undermine the stability of their financial system would constitute a violation.¹¹³ This is echoed by New Zealand which also maintains that disruptive cyber operations against its healthcare system, electricity network or telecommunications network would, where coercive, constitute violations of the non-intervention principle.¹¹⁴ Accordingly, cyber operations without physical effects can constitute violations of the non-intervention principle. However, this requires the element of coercion but the identity and intention of the state responsible for a cyber operation can be difficult to determine in the cyber context. This leads to uncertainty around whether cyber operations without physical effects that fall below the use of force threshold constitute violations of the non-intervention principle.\n## Sovereignty Finally, cyber operations against CI can also constitute violations of sovereignty. Sovereignty generally refers to a state's supreme authority within its territory, and it involves three interrelated rights and correlating duties in relation to a state's territorial sovereignty, independence and sovereign equality.¹¹⁵ In relation to territorial sovereignty, usually non-consensual activities within a state's territory, such as flying military aircraft over its airspace without permission, or navigating a vessel through its territorial sea without its consent are prohibited. In the cyber context, while states agree that sovereignty extends to the cyber infrastructure within their territory, there is uncertainty around whether and the threshold at which remotely conducted cyber operations will violate sovereignty. This is a critical question given that international law is largely silent on espionage conducted by states, and this means that states are generally permitted to engage in cyber espionage.¹¹⁶ This uncertainty about whether and when a cyber operation violates sovereignty arises from the debate about whether or not sovereignty operates as a rule of international law independent of the use of force and non-intervention principles that prohibits certain malicious cyber activities. According to the 'sovereignty as a rule' approach, sovereignty operates as a primary rule of international law that can be violated, and under certain circumstances, remotely conducted cyber operations can amount to violations of sovereignty. The Tallinn Manual advocated for this approach,¹¹⁷ and a growing number of states have adopted this approach including the Netherlands,¹¹⁸ France,¹¹⁹ Austria,¹²⁰ ¹¹² Finnish Government, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, 'Finland Published Its Positions on Public International Law in Cyberspace' (15 October 2020) <https: en=\"\"full=\"\"valtioneuvosto.fi=\"\"valtioneuvosto.fi=\"\"> / 'finland-published-its-positions-on-public-international-law-in-cyberspace'.\n¹¹³ Wright (n 107); Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy, 2019 International Law Supplement (n 102) 5.\n¹¹⁴ New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade (n 89).\n¹¹⁵ Moynihan (n 59) 11.\n¹¹⁶ See Russell Buchan, Cyber Espionage and International Law (Hart 2019).

Cyber espionage is defined here as the use of cyber means to copy confidential data from computer systems or networks without authorisation. Buchan (n 116) 17–18. However, this does not mean that any form of cyber espionage is permitted. Instead, determining whether cyber espionage violates international law will depend on the techniques involved and the effects caused by the cyber operation. As noted by the Tallinn Manual, the 'mere characterisation of a cyber operation as espionage or not has no legal significance... [r]ather, one must look to the underlying acts to determine whether the operation in question violates international law'.

For example, the Netherlands did not define the boundary at which it considers its sovereignty to be violated,¹²⁷ and Austria similarly remained silent on this issue.¹²⁸ The French position in turn suggests that it considers a cyber operation that merely involves the ‘unauthorized penetration’ of its computer systems to be a violation of its sovereignty.¹²⁹ Iran’s position similarly suggests that it would also view any unlawful intrusions into its (public or private) cyber infrastructure as violations of its sovereignty, as well as those that are destructive or disruptive and undermine its national security.¹³⁰ In contrast, however, according to New Zealand not ‘every unauthorized intrusion’ into another state’s ICT systems or even all cyber activities that cause effects on another state’s territory constitutes a violation of territorial sovereignty.¹³¹ Here it makes reference to cyber espionage activities and ‘a range of circumstances’ in which even cyber operations that cause effects in the territory of another state will not violate international law.¹³² Finland has maintained that a violation of sovereignty will be determined on a case-by-case basis depending on the ‘nature and consequences’ of the unauthorized cyber intrusion.¹³³ The Czech Republic considers that cyber operations that violate sovereignty include those that cause significant physical damage or harm to individuals and those that damage or disrupt the operation of cyber or other infrastructure where it has a ‘significant impact on national security, economy, public health or environment’.¹³⁴ Similarly, according to Germany, a cyber operation that causes ‘physical effects and harm’ in another state’s territory will violate sovereignty, as well as disruptive cyber operations, particularly where they cause ‘substantive secondary or indirect physical effects’ in another state’s territory.¹³⁵ As such, while some states agree that, at least cyber operations that cause physical damage or harm to individuals within another state’s territory will violate their ¹²¹ Czech Republic, ‘Statement by Richard Kadlčák at Open-ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security of the First Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations’ (11 February 2020) <https: 2020=\"\"20%20international%20law%2011.02.2020.pdf=\"\"cz%20statement%20www.nukib.cz=\"\"download=\"\"publications_en=\"\"www.nukib.cz=\"\">.\n¹²² Finnish Government, Ministry for Foreign Affairs (n 112).\n¹²³ Islamic Republic of Iran, ‘Declaration of General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran Regarding International Law Applicable to the Cyberspace’ NourNews (18 August 2020) <https: 53144=\"\"en=\"\"general-staff-of-iranian-armed-forces-warns-of-tough-reaction-to-any-cyber-threat=\"\"nournews.ir=\"\">.\n¹²⁴ New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade (n 89).\n¹²⁵ The Federal Government of Germany (n 89) 2.\n¹²⁶ Organisation of American States, Inter-American Judicial Committee, ‘International Law and State Cyber Operations’ (1 November 2020) 52 <http: docs=\"\"en=\"\"idc=\"\"international_law_and_state_cyber_operations_publication.pdf=\"\"sla=\"\"iajc=\"\"www.oas.org=\"\">.\n¹²⁷ Letter from the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (n 89) 3.\n¹²⁸ ‘Comments by Austria, Pre-Draft Report of the OEWG – ICT’ (n 120).\n¹²⁹ United Nations Secretary-General (n 119) 22. A similar position has been adopted by some recent academic commentators who argue that cyber operations amount to violations of sovereignty when they penetrate another state’s computers or networks even without physical damage of effects in the territory of the state. For example, Russell Buchan adopts this position and maintains that a violation occurs on the basis of the act of ‘the unauthorised intrusion into a domain protected by state sovereignty’. Buchan (n 116) 54. François Delerue also argues that ‘[i]f a cyber operation penetrates the cyber infrastructures in the territory of a foreign State, this would irrefutably constitute a violation of territorial sovereignty’.

Another example given is cyber operations that interfere ‘with any data or services which are essential for the exercise of inherently governmental functions, and thereby significantly disrupting the exercise of those functions; for example, distributing ransomware which encrypts the computers used by a government and thus significantly delaying the payment of retirement pensions’.\n¹³⁵ The Federal Government of Germany (n 89) 4.</http:></https:></https:> SAMULI HAATAJA territorial sovereignty, among other states there is no consensus on whether every unauthorized intrusion violates sovereignty or what degree of effects are required for a violation to occur.^[136]^ In contrast to the rule approach to sovereignty, according to the 'sovereignty as a principle' approach, sovereignty is a fundamental principle of international law involving a state's independent right to exercise state functions to the exclusion of others (the internal element), and the recognition of the absolute equality and independence of all states (the external element).^[137]^ However, sovereignty cannot be violated in its own right independent of other rules of international law that are based on it as it does not operate as a standalone primary rule of international law capable of being violated. This approach has been suggested by the US in a 2017 US Department of Defence memorandum (US DoD memo),^[138]^ and the UK has expressly adopted this position.^[139]^ From the sovereignty as a principle approach, given that sovereignty does not operate as a standalone rule of international law, it cannot be violated in itself. Instead, to amount to a violation of international law, a cyber operation needs to constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force or an intervention (ie a violation of existing rules of international law that arise from sovereignty).^[140]^ This means that, under this approach, a range of cyber operations are considered lawful under international law as they are not expressly prohibited. For example, according to the US DoD memo, sovereignty does not limit states from engaging in cyber activities 'that result in effects occurring on the infrastructure located in another State'.^[141]^ Similarly, according to the UK, the non-consensual interference into another state's computer networks is not a violation of their 'territorial sovereignty' because such a rule does not exist in international law in relation to cyber.^[142]^ As such, pursuant to the sovereignty as a principle approach, unauthorized cyber intrusions cannot constitute violations of sovereignty and will only amount to violations of international law where they rise to the threshold of a use of force or intervention and thus violate other existing rules of international law.\nTo summarize, when it comes to states' existing legal obligations most relevant to cyber operations that target or cause effects on another state's CI in peacetime, there is a degree of consensus in some areas but uncertainty in others. There is agreement that cyber operations will violate the prohibition on the use of force where their effects are similar to the use of armed force by kinetic means. However, there is no consensus around the precise threshold or about non-destructive but disruptive cyber operations in this context. The non-intervention principle generally applies to disruptive cyber operations provided they are coercive, however, this can be difficult to determine in the cyber context. Finally, while an increasing number of states have expressed support for the 'sovereignty as a rule' approach, there is no consensus on the threshold ^[136]^ The Tallinn Manual experts were also divided on this.

    "# IMPLICATIONS FOR CYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW": "This section demonstrates how norm (f) adds counterproductive complexity to the application of international law to cyber operations against CI. This is evident in the subjective nature of what constitutes CI within the scope of norm (f), and the additional specific guidance provided by norm (f) which contradicts some of the harm requirements under international law.",
    "# Norm (f) and CI": "Norm (f) applies to cyber operations against CI, however, despite that there are core sectors that most states consider to constitute CI, the notion of CI remains subjective. This means that the precise scope of norm (f) is not clearly defined. States have the prerogative to determine which infrastructures to designate as CI, $^{143}$ and, from 'critical information infrastructure' $^{144}$ and 'critical national infrastructure' $^{145}$ to 'national, transnational and supranational critical infrastructure' $^{146}$ — there is little consistency in the terminology adopted by states. The lack of agreement about what constitutes CI for the purposes of norm (f) can be problematic. For instance, election infrastructure in the US was only designated as critical in January 2017 following Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. $^{147}$ Some states have also been hesitant to designate specific sectors as CI due to concerns that this would implicitly condone malicious activities against sectors that are not specified. $^{148}$ The 2021 UN GGE report expressly acknowledges these concerns, noting that, even where a sector is not designated as CI, it does not amount to condoning malicious activities against those sectors. $^{149}$ Furthermore, even where states specify certain sectors as CI, they are not precluded from designating other sectors as such in the future. $^{150}$ There have also been calls to extend norm (f) to mention specific sectors, even if those sectors are already widely considered to be CI. For example, in February 2020 the International Committee of the Red Cross proposed extending the application of norm (f) to address the\nSAMULI HAATAJA 'particular vulnerability of health care facilities'¹⁵¹ in response to cyber operations against hospitals and vaccine research centres during the pandemic.\nWhile agreement about what sectors constitute CI for the purposes of norm (f) is useful in providing clarity for the scope of the norm, this introduces unnecessary additional complexity to how international law applies in this context. The contested nature of CI and focus on whether a sector is CI for the purposes of norm (f) has the potential to narrow the application of international law only to those sectors that states have agreed to constitute CI. The need for a cyber operation to affect CI also creates an additional requirement that is not evident in existing international law. This is because, irrespective of whether a sector is designated as CI or not, existing international law obligations apply to cyber operations causing effects in the territory of other states. For example, a cyber operation against election infrastructure rising to the level of a violation of sovereignty or intervention will constitute a violation of international law regardless of whether the victim state considers the infrastructure to be CI or not. Similarly, cyber operations against healthcare facilities causing sufficient effects will constitute violations of international law even if those sectors are not specifically mentioned in norm (f).¹⁵² Therefore, the focus on what constitutes CI for the purposes of norm (f), and the subjectivity of the concept of CI has the potential to introduce additional complexity to determining whether a cyber operation violates international law.\n## Norm (f) and uncertainty in international law Norm (f) seeks to reaffirm the existing legal obligations of states in relation to cyber operations against CI and provide additional specific guidance on responsible state behaviour in this context. However, the harm requirements within norm (f) are contradictory to those in international law, and this further compounds existing uncertainties in how the law applies to cyber operations targeting CI. As a result, there are a range of cyber operations that can constitute violations of international law but not norm (f), or vice versa.\nFor example, whether a cyber operation against CI constitutes a use of force will generally be determined based on its 'scale and effects'. Under this approach, there must be a degree of direct physical damage to the CI, or disruption of its functionality which causes damage or harm to individuals comparable to a use of force by kinetic means. The Stuxnet incident is generally considered to have crossed this threshold as it is reported to have caused damage to approximately 1000 centrifuge machines.¹⁵³ Assuming Stuxnet was attributable to a state, its use would have violated norm (f) as it caused intentional damage to CI and was contrary to the responsible state's international obligations.¹⁵⁴ However, a disruptive cyber operation with only adverse economic consequences would generally not constitute a use of force. This could include, for example, a cyber operation against a power grid that causes a temporary blackout without any indirect physical effects or harm to individuals. While a cyber operation of this kind would involve impairing the use of the CI and adversely impact its use for the public for the purposes of norm (f), it would unlikely violate a state's legal obligations under article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n¹⁵¹ International Committee of the Red Cross, 'Norms for Responsible State Behavior on Cyber Operations should Build on International Law' (11 February 2020) <https: document=\"\"en=\"\"norms-responsible-state-behavior-cyber-operations-should-build-international-law=\"\"www.icrc.org=\"\">. While norm (f) was not amended, the 2021 UN GGE report did specifically note how '[t]he COVID-19 pandemic heightened awareness of the critical importance of protecting health care and medical infrastructure and facilities, including through the implementation of the norms addressing critical infrastructure'. UN GGE 2021 report (n 150) 12.\n¹⁵² See Milanovic and Schmitt (n 8).\n¹⁵³ Haataja (n 93) 88–95.\n¹⁵⁴ See also Broeders and others (n 60) 4–7.</https:> CYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 441 For a cyber operation of this kind without direct physical effects to violate the non-intervention principle, there is a requirement that the operation was intended to be coercive and directed at matters states have the right to decide freely. For example, where a cyber operation causing a blackout was done with the intention of coercing the targeted state to reverse its policy of recognition of another state, this would constitute an unlawful intervention. But where the cyber operation does not involve the element of coercion directed at matters states should be freely able to decide (or the responsible state's intention is unknown), then the cyber operation would fall outside the scope of the non-intervention principle. This is despite the impairment of CI and its adverse impact on the public that is consistent with the harm requirement in norm (f). Whether a cyber operation of this kind violates sovereignty is also unsettled given the divergence in views among states on the issue.\nIn relation to cyber operations against CI and violations of sovereignty, consider, for example, where a state obtains unauthorised access to another state's power grid, election infrastructure or hospital systems and installs malware that gives it the ability to cause disruptive or destructive effects on that infrastructure at a later point in time. Whether a cyber operation of this kind violates sovereignty is unsettled as the precise boundaries of states' legal obligations in this context are still developing and evolving as more state practice emerges. According to France and Iran, which adopt the rule approach to sovereignty and consider any penetration of their networks to be a violation of sovereignty, this conduct would constitute a violation of international law at the point in time at which there is unauthorized access to their systems.[155] However, for states like the Czech Republic and New Zealand, merely obtaining unauthorised access or installing malware that does not impair the functioning of the systems would not constitute violations of sovereignty.[156] Instead, for these states, it is only at the point in time at which that malware is used to cause significant disruptive or destructive effects that the cyber operation would qualify as a violation of sovereignty. Similarly, for states like the UK adopting the principle approach to sovereignty, the cyber operation could not constitute a violation of international law unless and until it rises to the level of a use of force or involves coercion and violates the non-intervention principle.[157] Accordingly, a range of cyber operations that meet the harm requirements in norm (f) would fall outside of its scope because, given the uncertainty around how international law applies in this context, it would be unclear whether those operations also violate the law as required by norm (f).\nFurther compounding the uncertainty in how existing international law applies are the harm requirements of norm (f) that are not consistent with international law. Norm (f) requires 'intentional damage', but the intent is not a requisite element for most of the rules of international law outlined above. In relation to the prohibition on the use of force, there is no requirement for intention.[158] Instead, the approach adopted by most states and in the Tallinn Manual focuses on the 'scale and effects' of a cyber operation.[159] Similarly, intention is not a requirement for a violation of sovereignty.[160] While intention is an element of the non-intervention principle,[161] the focus of the law here is on the intention of the state applying the coercion and not SAMULI HAATAJA whether the particular technical effects – such as damage to CI – were intended or not. This means that there is no need for ‘intentional damage’ to be caused by a cyber operation for the non-intervention principle to be violated. Norm (f), however, specifically refers to intentional damage. As a result, where a state engages in a cyber operation against CI that causes unintentional damage to the CI, the activity could constitute a violation of sovereignty or a use of force but would fall outside the scope of the intentional damage contemplated by norm (f).¹⁶² The approach to impairment evident in norm (f) is useful in terms of the specificity of the requirement for an (even minimally) adverse impact on services provided to the public by the CI. This encompasses a very broad spectrum of cyber operations against CI, including disruptive cyber operations that may fall outside the scope of the prohibition on the use of force and the non-intervention principle. However, unless these cyber operations cause sufficient effects to constitute a use of force, or are accompanied by coercive intention and satisfy the non-intervention principle, they would fall outside the scope of existing international law and also outside of norm (f). As such, while the ‘additional specific guidance’ that norm (f) provides in its approach to impairment is useful given the broad spectrum of cyber operations against CI that it captures, there is uncertainty about whether most of such cyber operations would constitute violations of international law as required under norm (f).\nFinally, when considering low-level cyber operations used to pre-position or prepare for potentially destructive cyber operations against CI in peacetime, what is revealed is the dark side of norm (f) and existing international law in this context.¹⁶³ Given that these kinds of cyber operations do not cause immediate damage or impairment and, from a technical perspective, can be indistinguishable from cyber espionage, they are effectively permitted under existing international law and generally will not be seen to constitute violations of sovereignty. But much of CI is dual-use and this means that under certain conditions it can be lawfully subject to attack through cyber means in an armed conflict.¹⁶⁴ Essentially, except in circumstances where there is evidence of an imminent armed attack,¹⁶⁵ norm (f) and existing international law allow states to engage in cyber operations against CI that involve pre-positioning and preparing for potentially destructive effects in the future.¹⁶⁶ Therefore, norm (f) introduces additional complexity to the application of international law in this context, and this complexity is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are considered to be ‘off limits’. The subjective nature of what constitutes CI and the requirement for a sector to be CI to be captured by norm (f) creates a requirement that is not evident in international law and effectively narrows its application.\n¹⁶² However, where a cyber operation of this kind also has an adverse impact on the public then it would constitute impairment under the second type of harm within norm (f). This could amount to a violation of international law on sovereignty, but this is uncertain given the current debate about sovereignty.\n¹⁶³ The norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace only operate in peacetime.

See Fidler (n 83) 12; Jolley (n 51) 181–4. See also Broeders and others (n 60).\n¹⁶⁵ For example, according to Australia, states may exercise a right of anticipatory self-defence where ‘a threatened armed attack in the form of an offensive cyber operation’ that could be launched ‘in a split second’ and could cause ‘large-scale loss of human life and damage to critical infrastructure’. See George Brandis, ‘The Right of Self-Defence against Imminent Armed Attack in International Law’ (Lecture delivered at the University of Queensland, Brisbane, 11 April 2017) 8 <https: 05=\"\"2017=\"\"developments-international-law-self-defence-against-imminent-armed-attack=\"\"blog=\"\"law.uq.edu.au=\"\">. Similarly, according to NATO’s Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations, non-destructive cyber operations, such as those causing temporary disruptions of service or involving information gathering where they are conducted to enable a conventional threat – including an imminent threat of one – could be considered to trigger the right of self-defence.

David Fidler, for example, suggests a new cyber-defence norm adopting an ‘all hazards’ strategy to protect CI that does not focus on the legal regime (whether cyber crime or espionage) but instead on ensuring ‘networks are protected against infiltrations from any source’. Fidler (n 83) 13</https:></https:></https:> CYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 443 International law obligations apply to cyber operations conducted by states irrespective of whether they target what the victim state has designated as CI or not. While there is a degree of uncertainty around the thresholds at which violations of international law on the use of force, intervention and sovereignty occur, the harm requirements in norm (f) have the potential to compound these uncertainties as they are not consistent with these rules of international law.\nAccordingly, more clarity about the relationship between international law and norm (f) is needed, and about how international law applies to cyber operations targeting sectors that states have deemed to be CI. This is particularly the case in relation to international law on sovereignty. Especially where low-level cyber operations without immediately disruptive or destructive effects are involved, more states need to provide detailed accounts of when they consider the law to be violated and the relationship between sovereignty and sectors they consider to be CI. While a state's domestic legislation – like the Australian NSLA – may criminalise various activities such as the installation of malware onto CI on a national level, states should also expressly outline how they regard these activities on an international level. Here the approach to impairment in norm (f) can serve as useful guidance on when a cyber operation should violate sovereignty.¹⁶⁷ Similarly, the fact that CI is targeted can serve as an indicia of a violation of sovereignty. For example, this is the approach that Germany has adopted making an explicit connection between cyber operations against its CI and violations of its sovereignty.¹⁶⁸ In relation to low-level cyber operations, such as those involving the installation of malware enabling a persistent presence on CI that is generally accepted as a permissible form of espionage, these should be seen as potential violations of sovereignty given the purpose for which they are conducted.¹⁶⁹ As such, while clarity around when cyber operations violate sovereignty and the relevance of a sector's designation as CI is needed, international law applies to cyber operations by states irrespective of norm (f) which introduces counterproductive complexity to the legal analysis in this context.",
    "# CONCLUSION This article examined the norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace and international law prohibiting malicious cyber operations against CI. It demonstrated that norm (f), which prohibits cyber operations that damage or impair CI, introduces complexity to the application of international law that is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are prohibited by international law. This is due to the subjective nature of CI, the contradictory legal status of norm (f), and the ways in which the harm requirements of norm (f) compound existing uncertainties about how international law applies to cyber operations where CI is targeted. To develop clarity about what cyber operations against CI should be 'off limits', more states need to outline their positions on the threshold at which they consider the law to be violated – especially in relation to sovereignty – to ensure that malicious low-level cyber operations, in particular, do not fall outside of these legal constraints.": "¹⁶⁷ This has been recently recognized in the UN OEWG 2021 report where it was noted that a cyber operation contrary to international law that 'intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public, could pose a threat not only to security but also to State sovereignty'. See UN OEWG 2021 report (n 48) 4.\n¹⁶⁸ According to Germany, where a cyber operation targets a state's CI it 'may indicate that a State's territorial sovereignty has been violated'. However, given, among other things, the lack of international agreement of what constitutes CI, Germany maintained that this in and of itself cannot constitute the basis for a violation. The Federal Government of Germany (n 89) 4.\n¹⁶⁹ For example, Asaf Lubin maintains that cyber espionage should be unlawful where the purpose for which it is conducted is unlawful. Asaf Lubin, 'The Liberty to Spy' (2020) 61(1) HILJ 185, 238–9. Other academics have also expressed support for adopting a purpose approach in determining the lawfulness of cyber espionage.

Section two considers what constitutes CI and the threat posed by malicious cyber operations against CI. Section three examines the norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace with a focus on norm (f) which prohibits states from conducting cyber operations that cause intentional damage or impairment to the operation of CI in other states. This section outlines the debate about the legal status of norm (f) and demonstrates its contradictory legal status. Section four then examines how states' existing international law obligations are considered to apply to cyber operations causing effects on another state's CI. The focus is on international law on the use of force, non-intervention, and sovereignty. This section demonstrates that there continues to be a degree of uncertainty about when cyber operations against CI violate international law, particularly those falling below the use of force threshold. Section five examines the implications of norm (f) for international law in this context. It demonstrates how norm (f) introduces complexity to the legal analysis which is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are prohibited by international law. Section six provides a conclusion.\n# CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND CYBER OPERATIONS\nIn June 2020, the Australian Government revealed that it had been subject to a campaign of cyber attacks targeting its federal- and state-level governments, various companies and CI. Given the scale and nature of the operations, Australia maintained a foreign state actor was responsible, however, it stopped short of publicly attributing the operations to a specific state. Despite this, some have suggested China was responsible. The cyber operations are understood to have involved compromising the computer systems and networks of the various organisations that were targeted through vulnerabilities in their software. However, despite the media attention Australia's revelation of the incident received, the cyber operations did not cause any effects, such as disrupting the operation of the compromised organisations. Instead, according to the Australian Cyber Security Centre, there was no evidence of 'intent by the actor to carry out any disruptive or destructive activities within victim environments'.\nThere is growing concern about the threat posed by low-level cyber operations that do not necessarily result in immediate disruptive or destructive effects but are nonetheless significant in their scale or have the potential to be used in preparation for more harmful operations. For example, the Australian Department of Defence has specifically highlighted the threat posed by 'all kinds of preparation, pre-positioning, [and] collection of intelligence' activities in the cyber context. This was echoed by the Director General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation who expressed concerns about 'the potential for Australia's adversaries to pre-position malicious code in critical infrastructure ...

In the United States (US), the 2018 ‘National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America’ (US Cyber Strategy) makes specific mention of Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, and provides that the US and its allies ‘are vulnerable to peacetime cyber attacks against critical infrastructure’ and that there is a growing risk ‘these countries will conduct cyber attacks against the United States during a crisis short of war’. Accordingly, there is recognition of the potentially devastating impact that cyber operations on CI can have and the threat posed by cyber activities in preparation of such operations. These concerns have been exacerbated by reports about malicious cyber operations conducted against hospitals and vaccine research centres during the pandemic in 2020, as well as ransomware crippling the operation of Colonial Pipeline in 2021 in the US.\nIn light of these concerns, states have highlighted the need for international agreement that certain CI should be ‘off limits’ from malicious cyber activities. In 2015, for example, Australia’s then Foreign Minister Julie Bishop maintained that:\nThe effective functioning of critical infrastructure underpins the global economy. States should prevent and refrain from online activity which damages or impairs critical infrastructure, whether it be in banking, telecos, energy structures. While states define their critical infrastructure sectors differently and harmonisation is important, agreeing that key sectors should be off limits is a priority for the international community.\nAnd in 2021, following the Colonial Pipeline incident, US President Joe Biden told Russia’s President Vladimir Putin that ‘certain critical infrastructure should be “off limits” to attack’, and provided Russia with a list of 16 sectors the US considers CI.\nIn Australia, as part of the effort to counter the broader threat posed by malicious cyber activities by foreign actors, the ‘National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Act 2018’ (NSLA) was recently passed into law. The NSLA was primarily introduced to address the threat of foreign interference in its political processes, but it also contains provisions relating to foreign cyber activities against Australia’s CI. These include a range of new sabotage offences designed to ‘criminalise conduct causing damage to a broad range of critical infrastructure where it could prejudice Australia’s national security’. For example, under the NSLA it is a criminal offence to engage in conduct that results in damage to Australia’s infrastructure where this is done on behalf of a foreign actor and it undermines Australia’s national\n Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, ASIO Annual Report 2020-21 (2021) 5 <https: annual%20report%202020-21%20web.pdf=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\" www.asio.gov.au=\"\">.\n The White House, ‘National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America’ (September 2018) 3 <https: 09=\"\" 2018=\"\" annual%20report%202020-21%20web.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" national-cyber-strategy.pdf=\"\" uploads=\"\" wp-content=\"\" www.wytimes.com=\"\">.\n See Marko Milanovic and Michael Schmitt, ‘Cyber Attacks and Cyber (Mis)information Operations During a Pandemic’ (2020) 11 JNSLP 247.\n David Sanger, Clifford Krauss, and Nicole Perlroth, ‘Cyberattack Forces a Shutdown of a Top U.S. Pipeline’ The New York Times (8 May 2021) <https: 05=\"\" 2021=\"\" 09=\"\" a=\"\" cw=\"\" cw-weights=\"\" for=\"\" hyperattack-colonial-pipeline.html=\"\" upolitics=\"\" us=\"\" politics=\"\" paucities=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n Julie Bishop, ‘Statement for Plenary Session on International Peace and Security, Global Conference on Cyberspace’ Minister for Foreign Affairs The Hon Julie Bishop MP (17 April 2015) <https: 05=\"\" 2021-06-16=\"\" 2021=\"\" julie-bishop=\"\" minister=\"\" minister.julie-bishop=\"\" speech=\"\" www.foreignminister.gov.au=\"\">.\n Vladimir Soldatkin and Humeyra Pamuk, ‘Biden Tells Putin Certain Cyberattacks should be “Off-limits”’ Reuters (17 June 2021) <https: biden-tells-putin-certain-cyber-attacks-should-be-off-limits-2021-06-16=\"\" technology=\"\" www.reuters.com=\"\">.\n See Henry Belot, ‘Malcolm Turnbull Announces Biggest Overhaul of Espionage, Intelligence Laws in Decades’ ABC News (5 December 2017) <https: 2017-12-05=\"\" news=\"\" turnbull-announces-foreign-interference-laws=\"\" www.abc.net.au=\"\">; Louise Yaxley, ‘Sam Dastyari and the Murky Links with Chinese Businessmen that Ended his Political Career’ ABC News (12 December 2017) <http: 2017-12-12=\"\" 9249216=\"\" am-dastyari-murky-links-with-chinese-businessmen-ended-career=\"\" news=\"\" www.abc.net.au=\"\">.\n National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Act 2018 (Cth) (NSLA Act) sch 1 pt 1 div 82–Sabotage; Revised Explanatory Memorandum, National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017 (Cth) 62 [137].</http:></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:>\nSAMULI HAATAJA\nsecurity. Similarly, it is a criminal offence to introduce vulnerabilities – such as the installation of malicious software (malware) or creation of backdoors – onto public infrastructure where this is done to undermine Australia's national security. As such, the NSLA includes offences that specifically apply to activities involved in the preparation of potential future intrusions into, for example, Australian government networks and systems. However, while Australia has legislated to protect CI from foreign cyber activities on a domestic level, international agreement around what activities or sectors are to be ‘off limits’ is necessary to ensure the protection of CI from state-sponsored cyber threats.\n## Definitions of critical infrastructure\nPart of the problem around what activities or sectors should be ‘off limits’ revolves around differences in what constitutes CI among states. As highlighted by Australia’s former foreign minister above, there is no universal definition of CI and states in fact have the ability to designate any infrastructure asset as CI. Generally, CI includes various infrastructures such as those related to energy, health and transportation, and many of these infrastructures are dual-use. In Australia, for example, CI is defined as referring to the\nphysical facilities, supply chains, information technologies and communication networks which, if destroyed, degraded or rendered unavailable for an extended period, would significantly impact on the social or economic wellbeing of the nation or affect Australia’s ability to conduct national defence and ensure national security.\nIn Australia, CI thus ‘provides services that are essential for everyday life such as energy, communications, water, transport, health, food and grocery, banking and finance and the Australian Government’.\nThe United Kingdom (UK) in turn adopts the term ‘critical national infrastructure’ and this refers to the ‘critical elements of infrastructure (namely, assets, facilities, systems, networks or processes and the essential workers that operate and facilitate them)’ where the loss or compromise of those elements would result in a ‘major detrimental impact on the availability, integrity or delivery of essential services’ and/or a ‘significant impact on national security, national defence or the functioning of the state’.\nIn the US, CI refers to ‘systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the US that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety or any combination of those matters’. The ‘critical infrastructure sectors’, as identified by the recently established US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, include 16 sectors across energy, commerce, finance, food and agriculture, healthcare, emergency services, water, waste, transportation and defence.\nIn the European Union (EU), CI refers to\n NSLA Act (n 13) ss 82.3, 82.4.\n See NSLA Act (n 13) ss 82.7, 82.8.\n Revised NSLA Explanatory Memorandum (n 13) 80 [236].\n Commonwealth of Australia, Critical Infrastructure Resilience Strategy: Policy Statement (2015) 8 <https: criticalinfrastructureresiliencestrategypolicystatement.pdf=\"\" site%20documents=\"\" www.tisn.gov.au=\"\">.\n Australian Government, ‘What is the Critical Infrastructure Centre?’ Critical Infrastructure Centre <https: ctc-factsheet-what-is-critical-infrastructure-centre.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" nat-security=\"\" www.homeaffairs.gov.au=\"\">.\n Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure, ‘Critical National Infrastructure’ (2020) <https: critical-national-infrastructure-0=\"\" www.cpni.gov.uk=\"\">.\n USA Patriot Act of 2001, 42 USC §§5195c(e), 1016(e).\n United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, ‘Critical Infrastructure Sectors’ (24 March 2020) <https: critical-infrastructure-sectors=\"\" www.cisa.gov=\"\">.</https:></https:></https:></https:>\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 417\nan asset, system or part thereof located in Member States which is essential for the maintenance of vital societal functions, health, safety, security, economic or social well-being of people, and the disruption or destruction of which would have a significant impact in a Member State as a result of the failure to maintain those functions.\nThis essentially refers to the physical infrastructure which is vital for the proper functioning of society. The EU uses the term ‘critical information infrastructure’ (CII) to describe both the essential information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructures and those that are essential for the operation of its physical CI.\nAt the United Nations (UN) level, states have noted in a General Assembly resolution on the ‘creation of a global culture of cybersecurity and the protection of critical information infrastructures’ that CI involves, among other things, the infrastructures used for ‘the generation, transmission and distribution of energy, air and maritime transport, banking and financial services, e-commerce, water supply, food distribution and public health’ and that these infrastructures are increasingly interconnected with CII. But here too it is recognized that each state has the right to determine what constitutes its CI.\nAccordingly, in the Australian, UK, US, EU and UN contexts, CI refers to infrastructures essential to the proper functioning and well-being of the state and society. The term encompasses physical infrastructures (such as power plants and hospitals) located within a state’s territory, as well as the virtual infrastructure allowing the physical components to operate. Generally, this infrastructure is critical where its disruption or destruction would have a detrimental impact (whether significant, major, debilitating and so on) on the provision of key services that relate to the social or economic well-being of the state or its national security. However, states also have the prerogative to designate any infrastructure assets or sectors as critical. For example, the above UK definition includes the human personnel required to operate CI, and in Australia, the relevant government minister has the power to designate any asset as critical. As such, while there are core sectors that most states consider to constitute CI, the scope of what constitutes CI is subjective as evident in the differences in terminology and approaches that states adopt in determining this. Consequently, when considering relevant laws and norms surrounding CI protection, there is uncertainty about the specific infrastructures against which malicious cyber activities are prohibited.\n## Cyber operations against critical infrastructure\nIn addition to the 2020 cyber attacks against Australia, there are various other examples of known incidents differing in kind and intensity from low-level information collection operations to more disruptive and even destructive attacks against states’ CI. For example, in 2010 the infamous Stuxnet malware was discovered which had infected an Iranian uranium enrichment facility and, by changing the settings according to which the centrifuge machines operated, caused physical damage to approximately 1000 centrifuges. Similarly, in a non-destructive but highly disruptive attack, in December 2015 parts of Ukraine’s power grid were shut down for\n Council Directive 2008/114/EC of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection [2008] OJ L 345/75 art 2.\n Commission of the European Communities, ‘Green Paper on a European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection’ (COM/2005/576 final, 17 November 2005) 19.\n United Nations General Assembly, UNGA Res 58/199 (23 December 2003) UN Doc A/RES/58/199, 1.\n Ibid.\n See ss 50 and 51 of the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 (Cth).\n Joby Warrick, ‘Iran’s Natanz Nuclear Facility Recovered Quickly from Stuxnet Cyberattack’ The Washington Post (16 February 2011) <http: 02=\"\" 15=\"\" 2011=\"\" ar2011021505395.html=\"\" content=\"\" article=\"\" wp-dyn=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\">.

This is believed to have been the first blackout caused by a cyber operation.\nBesides these disruptive and destructive cyber operations against CI, states are also engaging in various low-level cyber operations against CI. These operations can be used to gather information that can potentially be used in preparation for more disruptive future operations. As an example, in 2018 the US Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation released a report on Russian cyber activities targeting its energy and other CI sectors. According to this report, Russian actors had since at least 2016 ‘targeted government entities and multiple US critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy, nuclear, commercial facilities, water, aviation and critical manufacturing sectors’. This was characterized by these agencies ‘as a multi-stage intrusion campaign by Russian government cyber actors’ in which these actors obtained unauthorized access to various networks and installed malware allowing them to conduct reconnaissance and collect information about industrial control systems. Similarly, in 2019 it was reported that the US had moved beyond mere reconnaissance operations into Russia’s power grid to the placement of malware onto those systems that could be used to disrupt its operation. Furthermore, in December 2020, it was reported that Russia had, through software provided by the company SolarWinds, compromised a range of US government agencies and companies responsible for CI in the electricity, oil and manufacturing industries. While the SolarWinds incident is mainly understood to have compromised data in the affected sectors, Anne Neuberger, the US Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology, expressed concerns that Russia’s ability to access these systems has the potential to be used for disruptive operations in the future. And in January 2022, during increased tensions between the US and Russia in the lead-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the US Cybersecurity Advisory issued an advisory encouraging the US cybersecurity community and especially CI operators ‘to adopt a heightened state of awareness’ given the threat posed by Russian-state-sponsored cyber operations against US CI. Accordingly, states like the US and Russia are using malicious cyber operations to obtain unauthorized access and maintaining a ‘persistent presence’ in other states’ CI systems. The concern is that these preparatory cyber operations can be used to damage or disrupt the operation of CI in the future.\n See Kim Zetter, ‘Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid’ Wired (3 March 2016) <https: 03=\"\" 2016=\"\" 03=\"\" inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\">.\n David Sanger, ‘Utilities Cautioned about Potential for a Cyberattack’ The New York Times (29 February 2016) <https: 03=\"\" 2016=\"\" 00=\"\" http:=\"\" us=\"\" politics=\"\" politics.cautioned-about-potential-for-a-cyberattack-after-ukraines.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n See Symantec Critical Attack Discovery and Intelligence Team, ‘Dragonfly: Western Energy Sector Targeted by Sophisticated Attack Group’ Symantec Threat Intelligence (20 October 2017) <https: dragonfly-energy-sector-cyber-attacks=\"\" blogs=\"\" symantec-blogs.broadcom.com=\"\">.\n United States Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation, ‘Russian Government Cyber Activity Targeting Energy and Other Critical Infrastructure Sectors’ (Technical Alert TA18-074A, 15 March 2018) <https: alerts=\"\" a18-074a=\"\" ncas=\"\" ta18-074a=\"\" www.us-cert.gov=\"\">.\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n David Sanger and Nicole Perlroth, ‘U.S. Escalates Online Attacks on Russia’s Power Grid’ The New York Times (15 June 2019) <https: 06=\"\" 15=\"\" 2019=\"\" us=\"\" politics=\"\" prurip-cyber-russia-grid.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n David Sanger, ‘Russian Hackers Broke into Federal Agencies, U.S. Officials Suspect’ The New York Times (13 December 2020) <https: 12=\"\" 2020=\"\" 22=\"\" 2020=\"\" politics=\"\" russian-hackers-us-government-treasury-commerce.html?=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n Kim Zetter, ‘SolarWinds Hack Infected Critical Infrastructure, including Power Industry’ The Intercept (25 December 2020) <https: 02=\"\" 2020=\"\" 22=\"\" 24=\"\" solarwinds-hack-power-infrastructure=\"\" theintercept.com=\"\">.\n David Sanger, ‘After Russian Cyberattack, Looking for Answers and Debating Retaliation’ The New York Times (23 February 2021) <https: 02=\"\" 2021=\"\" 23=\"\" polities=\"\" solarwinds-hack-senate-intelligence-russia.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, ‘Understanding and Mitigating Russian State Sponsored Cyber Threats to U.S. Critical Infrastructure’ (11 January 2022) 1 <https: 02=\"\" 2022=\"\" 23=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" publications=\"\" us=\"\" uscert=\"\" sites=\"\" www.cisa.gov=\"\" uscert=\"\" publications=\"\" uscertisites=\"\"></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:>\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 419\nThis concern crystallized during the war in Ukraine in 2022 which involved a range of cyber operations and activities that Russia had pre-positioned for.\n# NORMS OF RESPONSIBLE STATE BEHAVIOUR IN CYBERSPACE\nThe international security issues surrounding states' use of digital technologies and activities in cyberspace have been considered at the UN level since the late 1990s, and in this context, states have agreed to norms around responsible behaviour in cyberspace including around CI protection. Since 1998, the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) of the UN General Assembly has regularly considered 'Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security'. In 2004 it established a Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) to examine existing and potential threats from cyberspace. A second GGE was established in 2009 and it issued a consensus report in 2010 which highlighted the risk of how '[t]he growing use of ICTs in critical infrastructures creates new vulnerabilities and opportunities for disruption'. It also recommended that states should engage in further dialogue 'to discuss norms pertaining to State use of ICTs, to reduce collective risk and protect critical national and international infrastructure'. This was echoed in the 2013 report from the third GGE which also, for the first time, confirmed the general application of international law and UN Charter principles in the cyber context.\nThe 2015 report by the fourth GGE was significant as it introduced a set of norms for responsible state behaviour in their use of ICTs. The UN General Assembly also passed resolutions in 2018 and 2019 on 'Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security' where it called on states to be guided by the UN GGE reports and these norms in their use of ICTs. This was echoed in the 2021 consensus report of the UN Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security in which states emphasized the importance of these norms.\nFrom these norms, three are particularly relevant to CI protection. Norm (g) provides that states should take appropriate measures to protect their own CI, and norm (h) provides that states should mitigate malicious cyber activities emanating from their territory that are directed against the CI of other states. Of most relevance to malicious cyber operations against CI, however, is norm (f). It provides that:\n Microsoft, 'Special Report: Ukraine' (27 April 2022) § <https: am=\"\" app=\"\" am=\"\" binary=\"\" re4vwwd=\"\" query.prod.cms=\"\" re4vwwd=\"\" www.cms=\"\">.\n United Nations General Assembly, Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, GA Res 53/70, UN Doc A/RES/53/70 (4 January 1999).\n United Nations Secretary-General, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security: Report of the Secretary-General, UN Doc A/60/202 (5 August 2005).\n United Nations Secretary-General, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security: Note by the Secretary-General, UN Doc A/65/201 (30 July 2010).\n Ibid 7.\n Ibid 8.\n United Nations Secretary-General, Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/68/98 (24 June 2013) 2.\n United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/70/174 (22 July 2015) 8.\n See United Nations General Assembly, Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/RES/73/266 (2 January 2019); United Nations General Assembly, Advancing Responsible State Behaviours in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/RES/74/28 (18 December 2019).\n United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, 'Final Substantive Report' (10 March 2021) 4–5 <https: 03=\"\" 2021=\"\" front.un-arm.org=\"\" uploads=\"\" wp-content=\"\" wpr2.pdf=\"\" uploads=\"\">.\n See Michael Berk, 'Recommendation 13(g) and (h)' in United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (ed), Voluntary, Non-Binding Norms for Responsible State Behaviour in the Use of Information and Communications Technology: A Commentary (United Nations Publication 2017).</https:></https:>\nSAMULI HAATAJA\nA State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity contrary to its obligations under international law that intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public.\nPrima facie, norm (f) specifically prohibits cyber operations against the CI of other states. According to the commentary to the norms, it reflects consensus about the unique importance of CI to modern societies and a recognition of the possibility of conflicts to escalate where state-to-state cyber activities adversely impact CI in particular. However, despite this apparent consensus, there is debate about the legal status of norm (f) and its relationship to international law. In particular, it is unclear whether it seeks to create new non-binding expectations of responsible state behaviour or to reaffirm the application of existing binding rules of international law.\nThis lack of clarity arises because norm (f) is explicitly included as a 'voluntary, non-binding' norm in the 2015 UN GGE report, and all of the norms are located in a separate section to the question of how international law applies to ICT activities. Yet the wording of norm (f) expressly refers to a state's 'obligations under international law' – that is, binding, opposed to voluntary and non-binding obligations – resulting in what others have described as a 'contradiction in terms'. The confusion about the legal status of norm (f) is also evident among states who generally regard the norms as conceptually distinct from international law. For example, Australia, in its 2017 'Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy', expresses a commitment to these norms and notes that international law can be complemented with these norms, but treats the two as distinct. The US has also expressed a commitment to the promotion of these norms but regards them as conceptually distinct from international law. This is evident in the US Cyber Strategy which includes as one of its pillars the preservation of peace through strength, and the means of doing so is through the promotion of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace based on international law on one hand, and 'voluntary non-binding norms' on the other. Similarly, the ASEAN-EU Statement on Cybersecurity Cooperation distinguishes between the application of international law in the cyber context and, separately, acknowledges 'that voluntary and non-binding norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour of States in the use of ICTs can reduce risks to international peace, security and stability'. The distinction between the non-binding norms and binding international law obligations is also evident in academic commentary. For example, according to Harriet Moynihan, norm (f) 'does not represent a binding obligation on states' and merely demonstrates 'their concern to protect\n UN GGE 2015 report (n 46) 8.\n Jason Jolley, 'Recommendation 13 (f)' in United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (ed) Voluntary, Non-Binding Norms for Responsible State Behaviour in the Use of Information and Communications Technology: A Commentary (United Nations Publication 2017) 169–70.\n UN GGE 2015 report (n 46) 7.\n Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco, and Talita de Souza Dias, 'Drawing the Cyber Baseline: The Applicability of Existing International Law to the Governance of Information and Communication Technologies' (2022) 99 ILS 4, 32.\n Liisi Adamson, 'International Law and International Cyber Norms: A Continuum?' in Dennis Broeders and Bibi van den Berg (eds) Governing Cyberspace: Behavior, Power, and Diplomacy (Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2020) 25, 33.\n Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 'Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy' (October 2017) 47–8 <https: 2020-11=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" the%20strategy.pdf=\"\" www.internationalcybertech.gov.au=\"\" sites=\"\">; Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 2019 Progress Report, Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy (2019).\n The White House (7) 20.\n Ibid.\n Association of South East Asian Nations, 'ASEAN-EU Statement on Cybersecurity Cooperation' Association of South East Asian Nations (August 2019) [6]–[7] <https: 08=\"\" 2019=\"\" asean.org=\"\" asean-eu-statement-on-cybersecurity-cooperation-final.pdf=\"\" storage=\"\">.</https:></https:>\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nThe commentary to the norms, published by the UN Office for Disarmament Affairs, elaborates on key elements of norm (f) including its relationship with international law. Here it is noted that it is unclear 'why the [UN Group of Governmental] Experts have offered as voluntary something that by the majority of states is considered legally binding'. The commentary explains that norm (f) is premised on the law of state responsibility and was intended to reaffirm that states' existing legal obligations extend to their cyber activities. This is evident, for example, from the phrase 'conduct[s] or knowingly support[s]' within the wording of norm (f) which encompasses relevant rules of attribution of conduct under international law on state responsibility. The phrase 'contrary to its obligations' in turn refers to states' existing obligations under international law and includes, for example, the prohibition on the use of force and relevant international humanitarian law obligations. Therefore, according to the commentary, despite being expressly included as a voluntary and non-binding norm, norm (f) was intended to reaffirm states' existing legal obligations in relation to CI.\nAccordingly, the precise legal status of norm (f) is unclear and others have raised concerns about the implications of this. Writing in relation to the cyber norms generally, Kubo Mačák highlights how 'non-binding norms can never override binding legal rules' and, in the reverse, that 'a non-binding norm cannot permit action that would otherwise be forbidden by international law'. He maintains that the distinction is important as only a violation of international law can trigger obligations of cessation and reparation under the law on state responsibility. François Delerue, Frédérick Douzet and Aude Géry in turn maintain that the distinction between international law and norms 'complexifies the definition of rights and obligations for the states in cyberspace as it introduces a confusion on the nature of the rules'. They argue that by separating the two, the potential implication is that the norm is autonomous and detached from international law and that state behaviour in cyberspace is based only on the goodwill of states and not legal obligations. Similarly, Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco and Talita de Souza Dias argue that the inclusion of norm (f) as a voluntary, non-binding norm by the UN GGE can\n Harriet Moynihan, 'The Application of International Law to State Cyberattacks Sovereignty and Non-intervention' (Chatham House Research Paper 2019) 44 <https: 12=\"\" 2019=\"\" application-international-law-state-cyberattacks=\"\" www.chathamhouse.org=\"\">.\n Dennis Broeders, Els de Busser, Fabio Cristiano, and Tatiana Tropina, 'Revisiting Past Cyber Operations in Light of New Cyber Norms and Interpretations of International Law: Inching towards Lines in the Sand?'

He gives the example that 'if a State conducts a cyber operation that amounts to a prohibited intervention in the internal affairs of another State, it is legally obliged to cease its wrongful conduct (if it is continuing) and to provide full reparation to the injured State for the harm caused'.\n François Delerue, Frédérick Douzet and Aude Géry, 'The Geopolitical Representations of International Law in the International Negotiations on the Security and Stability of Syberspace' (Report No. 75, IRSEM/EU Cyber Direct, November 2020) 29.\n Ibid 32.</https:>\nSAMULI HAATAJA\nhave the effect of reducing well-established rules of international law to 'non-binding recommendations'.[72] The 2021 UN OEWG report seeks to clarify the role of the norms and their relationship to international law, but it ultimately reaffirms the conceptual distinction between the two. It provides that the 'norms do not replace or alter' binding obligations under international law, and do not seek to limit or prohibit action that is otherwise consistent with international law.\"[73] Instead, the norms 'provide additional specific guidance' on what constitutes responsible state behaviour in the cyber context.[74] As such, the legal status of norm (f) is contradictory given it was both intended to reaffirm states' legal obligations in relation to CI and, without replacing or altering the law, to provide non-binding additional specific guidance on what constitutes responsible state behaviour in this context. This is problematic as it is unclear what kinds of cyber operations are prohibited by binding international law obligations in contrast to those that are only contrary to non-binding norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.\nIn addition to its legal status, the commentary to norm (f) also discusses the degree of harm that is required for the norm to be violated. Norm (f) refers to activities that 'intentionally damage[] critical infrastructure or otherwise impair[] the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public'.[75] Essentially, this involves two types of harm: either intentional damage to CI or the use and operation of CI is impaired in its provision of services to the public. The commentary elaborates on both of these. In relation to the first, this requires a state to deliberately cause damage to CI irrespective of whether the damage impacts public services connected to the CI. Here the degree of damage is irrelevant as long as the damage is physical in nature.[76] Given the requirement of intention, however, where a state unintentionally causes physical damage to CI (provided it does not impair the use or operation of CI in its provision of services to the public) then this would fall outside the scope of norm (f).[77]\nThe second type of harm involves situations where a cyber operation does not cause any damage but impairs the use and operation of CI in its provision of services to the public. According to the commentary, impairment in this context refers to:\nany damage, physical or electronic, including the loss of data or software, or interruption of digital services provided by critical infrastructure, that makes the critical infrastructure less effective, less valuable, operate worse, or inhibit use by the public, the threshold being that the public must be impacted, even minimally.[78]\nAs such, the term 'impairment' encompasses physical impairment but does not require it, and captures a range of circumstances where the functionality of CI is undermined provided it results in a detrimental impact on its use by the public. This excludes cyber operations that do not disrupt the operation of CI, as well as cyber operations that disrupt the operation of CI without any impact on the public.[79] Unlike the requirement for intentional damage, the need for impairment is based on a strict liability approach where there is no need for the responsible state to have intended to cause the impairment.[80]\nIn summary, states have agreed to norms of responsible behaviour in cyberspace at the UN level including norm (f) which specifically prohibits certain cyber operations against CI.\n\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 433\nHowever, the legal status of norm (f) is contradictory. On one hand, it seeks to reaffirm states' existing obligations in relation to CI and is not intended to modify those obligations. On the other, it provides non-binding 'additional specific guidance' on responsible state behaviour in this context, particularly in relation to the degree of harm that should not be caused to CI. As will be demonstrated below, this guidance is concerning as it is inconsistent with the harm requirements under international law, and this further compounds existing uncertainties about how the law applies in this context.\n# INTERNATIONAL LAW AND CYBER OPERATIONS\nThis section examines how relevant rules of international law that norm (f) reaffirms apply to state activities in cyberspace. The focus is on three primary areas of international law that provide limits to cyber operations in peacetime, namely the law on the use of force, non-intervention and sovereignty. These are of particular relevance to cyber operations attributable to states targeting another state's CI given the broad spectrum of effects that remotely conducted cyber operations can cause.\nThere is widespread agreement that international law generally applies to state activities in cyberspace. This was highlighted in the 2015 UN GGE report which recognized that international law and the UN Charter in particular apply in the cyber context. This was reaffirmed in the 2021 UN OEWG consensus report. Despite this general agreement, however, there continues to be uncertainty about how particular rules of international law apply. As such, UN Member States have been invited to provide their national views on the UN GGE reports and to make submissions or provide working papers in connection with the UN OEWG which ran parallel to the UN GGE. In connection with these processes, states have provided more detailed accounts about how they consider the law to apply. The views of states are important as they contribute to more clarity about how international law applies in the cyber context, and to the development of customary international law applicable to state conduct in this context. However, the different positions evident in these statements have given rise to some debate about how the law applies. The implication of this is that, while there are some areas where a degree of consensus is emerging, there continues to be a degree of uncertainty about when cyber operations against CI will violate international law.\n# Use of force\nA cyber operation that causes physical damage to CI can potentially violate the prohibition on the use of force. Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits states from the use of force. Force in this context is generally understood to refer to 'armed force'. Despite being drafted in the\n However, as Delerue, Douzet and Géry note, the non-binding norms nonetheless 'can contribute to the interpretation of existing obligations in international law, or to the formation of new international obligations'. Delerue, Douzet and Géry (n 70) 31.\n See section 5.\n Other areas of law, such as international humanitarian law which applies in an armed conflict, while important given the dual-use nature of CI, are outside of the article's scope. On these obligations in relation to CI, see David Fidler 'Whither the Web?: International Law, Cybersecurity, and Critical Infrastructure Protection' (2015) 16 GJIA 8, 12. See also Jolley (n 51) 181-4.\n UN GGE 2015 report (n 46) 12.\n UN OEWG 2021 report (n 48) 5-6.\n See United Nations General Assembly, UNGA Res 73/203 (20 December 2018) UN Doc A/RES/73/203.\n See Albrecht Randelzhofer, 'Article 2(4)' in Bruno Simma and others (eds) The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary (Oxford University Press 2002) 117-21.\nSAMULI HAATAJA\ntechnological context of the 1940s, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has affirmed that the prohibition on the use of force applies 'to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.'88\nIn the cyber context, most states that have expressed their position on article 2(4) have adopted the approach that a cyber operation will constitute a use of force where its 'scale and effects' are comparable to a use of force by traditional kinetic means.89 This approach is similar to the one adopted by the 'Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations' (Tallinn Manual)90 – an influential but non-binding account by a group of experts about how international law applies in the cyber context91 – which provides in Rule 69 that '[a] cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.'92 Accordingly, where a cyber operation results in damage or destruction of physical property, or injury or death of human beings, it is likely to be considered to amount to a use of force in violation of article 2(4).\nHowever, where a cyber operation results in a loss of functionality of systems without causing physical damage, it is unclear whether this would be regarded as a use of force.93 Normally, economic or diplomatic pressure is not considered to be 'force' under article 2(4),94 and only the Netherlands has suggested that a cyber operation could constitute a use of force where it had 'a very serious financial or economic impact'.95 In contrast, New Zealand has maintained that a cyber operation causing significant loss of functionality to its CI would constitute a violation of the non-intervention principle, as opposed to the use of force.96 As such, there is uncertainty around whether cyber operations that do not cause physical effects can constitute violations of article 2(4).\n## Non-intervention\nA cyber operation against CI that falls below the use of force threshold can potentially constitute a violation of the non-intervention principle. This is a rule of customary international law that prohibits states from using coercive means to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another state as these are matters which states have the right to decide freely by virtue of their sovereignty. A violation of international law based on the non-intervention principle requires two elements. First, there must be coercive interference, and second, it must be directed towards the matters that sovereign states should be able to decide freely.97\n\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 435\nCoercion is not defined in international law. The majority of the Tallinn Manual experts, for example, adopted a narrow approach to the term defining it as ‘an affirmative act designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way.’ They distinguished it from activities that seek to influence (as opposed to factually compel) a state to behave in a particular way such as public criticism or propaganda. Others, however, have defined coercion more broadly as a form of pressure that seeks to deprive the target state of its free will. This view was echoed by the minority of the Tallinn Manual experts who maintained that it is sufficient that the activity ‘has the effect of depriving the State of control over the matter in question.’ This broader approach to coercion is also supported by some states in the cyber context. For example, according to Australia coercion involves ‘effectively deprive[ing] another state of the ability to control, decide upon or govern matters of an inherently sovereign nature.’ Similarly, the German position maintains that coercion involves where a state’s ‘will is manifestly bent by the foreign State’s conduct.’\nThe second element requires that the coercion is directed at matters that states are able to decide freely by virtue of their sovereignty. These include, according to the ICJ, the ‘choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy’. States have also endorsed this view in the cyber context. Australia’s position is that the law requires the coercion to affect ‘matters of an inherently sovereign nature’, according to the UK the coercion must affect ‘matters of government which are at the heart of a state’s sovereignty’, and for New Zealand, coercion must deprive the state from control over ‘matters falling within the scope of its inherently sovereign functions’.\nA number of states have also provided examples of situations in which the non-intervention principle would be violated in the cyber context. Many states, including Australia, the UK, the US\n Schmitt (n 90) 317 citing Robert Y Jennings and Arthur Watts (eds), *Oppenheim’s International Law, Volume 1, Peace* (9ᵗʰ edn Longman 1992) 430–1.\n Schmitt (n 90) 318.\n Moynihan (n 59) 30.\n Schmitt (n 90) 318.\n Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, ‘Australia’s International Cyber Engagement Strategy, 2019 International Law Supplement’ (2019) 5 <https: 2020-11=\"\" 2019%20legal%20supplement_0.pdf=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\" www.internationalcybertech.gov.au=\"\">.\n The Federal Government of Germany (n 89) 5.\n The concept of domaine réservé (reserved domain) is often used to refer to matters within the exclusive domestic jurisdiction of states (see Katja Ziegler, ‘Domaine Réservé’ in *Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law* (Oxford University Press 2013)) and this is sometimes distinguished from the broader state functions that states have the authority to exercise. For example, the Tallinn Manual distinguishes between a state’s ‘inherently governmental functions’ (relevant for a sovereignty violation) from the concept of domaine réservé (relevant to the non-intervention principle). Schmitt (n 90) 24. However, it is argued that the notion of ‘matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely’ (using the ICJ’s wording) is preferred. This is not confined to a state’s internal affairs as it also includes their external affairs (eg membership of international organisations, and decisions to recognise states) which can be subject to coercive interference. Additionally, even if a matter is regulated by international law (and thus it is no longer within a state’s domaine réservé meaning the state no longer has exclusive regulatory authority over the matter), the state still has the authority to make choices within that area of law. As such, the ‘matters that sovereign states are permitted to decide freely’ is a more useful concept opposed to the narrow notion of a state’s domaine réservé.

Australia and the UK also maintain that using cyber means involving coercion to undermine the stability of their financial system would constitute a violation. This is echoed by New Zealand which also maintains that disruptive cyber operations against its healthcare system, electricity network or telecommunications network would, where coercive, constitute violations of the non-intervention principle. Accordingly, cyber operations without physical effects can constitute violations of the non-intervention principle. However, this requires the element of coercion but the identity and intention of the state responsible for a cyber operation can be difficult to determine in the cyber context. This leads to uncertainty around whether cyber operations without physical effects that fall below the use of force threshold constitute violations of the non-intervention principle.\n## Sovereignty\nFinally, cyber operations against CI can also constitute violations of sovereignty. Sovereignty generally refers to a state's supreme authority within its territory, and it involves three interrelated rights and correlating duties in relation to a state's territorial sovereignty, independence and sovereign equality. In relation to territorial sovereignty, usually non-consensual activities within a state's territory, such as flying military aircraft over its airspace without permission, or navigating a vessel through its territorial sea without its consent are prohibited. In the cyber context, while states agree that sovereignty extends to the cyber infrastructure within their territory, there is uncertainty around whether and the threshold at which remotely conducted cyber operations will violate sovereignty. This is a critical question given that international law is largely silent on espionage conducted by states, and this means that states are generally permitted to engage in cyber espionage.\nThis uncertainty about whether and when a cyber operation violates sovereignty arises from the debate about whether or not sovereignty operates as a rule of international law independent of the use of force and non-intervention principles that prohibits certain malicious cyber activities. According to the 'sovereignty as a rule' approach, sovereignty operates as a primary rule of international law that can be violated, and under certain circumstances, remotely conducted cyber operations can amount to violations of sovereignty. The Tallinn Manual advocated for this approach, and a growing number of states have adopted this approach including the Netherlands, France, Austria,\n Finnish Government, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, 'Finland Published Its Positions on Public International Law in Cyberspace' (15 October 2020) <https: en=\"\" full=\"\" valtioneuvosto.fi=\"\" valtioneuvosto.fi=\"\"> / 'finland-published-its-positions-on-public-international-law-in-cyberspace'.\n Wright (n 107); Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy, 2019 International Law Supplement (n 102) 5.\n New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade (n 89).\n Moynihan (n 59) 11.\n See Russell Buchan, Cyber Espionage and International Law (Hart 2019).

For example, the Netherlands did not define the boundary at which it considers its sovereignty to be violated, and Austria similarly remained silent on this issue. The French position in turn suggests that it considers a cyber operation that merely involves the ‘unauthorized penetration’ of its computer systems to be a violation of its sovereignty. Iran’s position similarly suggests that it would also view any unlawful intrusions into its (public or private) cyber infrastructure as violations of its sovereignty, as well as those that are destructive or disruptive and undermine its national security. In contrast, however, according to New Zealand not ‘every unauthorized intrusion’ into another state’s ICT systems or even all cyber activities that cause effects on another state’s territory constitutes a violation of territorial sovereignty. Here it makes reference to cyber espionage activities and ‘a range of circumstances’ in which even cyber operations that cause effects in the territory of another state will not violate international law. Finland has maintained that a violation of sovereignty will be determined on a case-by-case basis depending on the ‘nature and consequences’ of the unauthorized cyber intrusion. The Czech Republic considers that cyber operations that violate sovereignty include those that cause significant physical damage or harm to individuals and those that damage or disrupt the operation of cyber or other infrastructure where it has a ‘significant impact on national security, economy, public health or environment’. Similarly, according to Germany, a cyber operation that causes ‘physical effects and harm’ in another state’s territory will violate sovereignty, as well as disruptive cyber operations, particularly where they cause ‘substantive secondary or indirect physical effects’ in another state’s territory. As such, while some states agree that, at least cyber operations that cause physical damage or harm to individuals within another state’s territory will violate their\n Czech Republic, ‘Statement by Richard Kadlčák at Open-ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security of the First Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations’ (11 February 2020) <https: 2020=\"\" 20%20international%20law%2011.02.2020.pdf=\"\" cz%20statement%20www.nukib.cz=\"\" download=\"\" publications_en=\"\" www.nukib.cz=\"\">.\n Finnish Government, Ministry for Foreign Affairs (n 112).\n Islamic Republic of Iran, ‘Declaration of General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran Regarding International Law Applicable to the Cyberspace’ NourNews (18 August 2020) <https: 53144=\"\" en=\"\" general-staff-of-iranian-armed-forces-warns-of-tough-reaction-to-any-cyber-threat=\"\" nournews.ir=\"\">.\n New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade (n 89).\n The Federal Government of Germany (n 89) 2.\n Organisation of American States, Inter-American Judicial Committee, ‘International Law and State Cyber Operations’ (1 November 2020) 52 <http: docs=\"\" en=\"\" idc=\"\" international_law_and_state_cyber_operations_publication.pdf=\"\" sla=\"\" iajc=\"\" www.oas.org=\"\">.\n Letter from the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (n 89) 3.\n ‘Comments by Austria, Pre-Draft Report of the OEWG – ICT’ (n 120).\n United Nations Secretary-General (n 119) 22. A similar position has been adopted by some recent academic commentators who argue that cyber operations amount to violations of sovereignty when they penetrate another state’s computers or networks even without physical damage of effects in the territory of the state. For example, Russell Buchan adopts this position and maintains that a violation occurs on the basis of the act of ‘the unauthorised intrusion into a domain protected by state sovereignty’. Buchan (n 116) 54. François Delerue also argues that ‘[i]f a cyber operation penetrates the cyber infrastructures in the territory of a foreign State, this would irrefutably constitute a violation of territorial sovereignty’.

This approach has been suggested by the US in a 2017 US Department of Defence memorandum (US DoD memo),^[138]^ and the UK has expressly adopted this position.^[139]^\nFrom the sovereignty as a principle approach, given that sovereignty does not operate as a standalone rule of international law, it cannot be violated in itself. Instead, to amount to a violation of international law, a cyber operation needs to constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force or an intervention (ie a violation of existing rules of international law that arise from sovereignty).^[140]^ This means that, under this approach, a range of cyber operations are considered lawful under international law as they are not expressly prohibited. For example, according to the US DoD memo, sovereignty does not limit states from engaging in cyber activities 'that result in effects occurring on the infrastructure located in another State'.^[141]^ Similarly, according to the UK, the non-consensual interference into another state's computer networks is not a violation of their 'territorial sovereignty' because such a rule does not exist in international law in relation to cyber.^[142]^ As such, pursuant to the sovereignty as a principle approach, unauthorized cyber intrusions cannot constitute violations of sovereignty and will only amount to violations of international law where they rise to the threshold of a use of force or intervention and thus violate other existing rules of international law.\nTo summarize, when it comes to states' existing legal obligations most relevant to cyber operations that target or cause effects on another state's CI in peacetime, there is a degree of consensus in some areas but uncertainty in others. There is agreement that cyber operations will violate the prohibition on the use of force where their effects are similar to the use of armed force by kinetic means. However, there is no consensus around the precise threshold or about non-destructive but disruptive cyber operations in this context. The non-intervention principle generally applies to disruptive cyber operations provided they are coercive, however, this can be difficult to determine in the cyber context. Finally, while an increasing number of states have expressed support for the 'sovereignty as a rule' approach, there is no consensus on the threshold\n^[136]^ The Tallinn Manual experts were also divided on this.

This is evident in the subjective nature of what constitutes CI within the scope of norm (f), and the additional specific guidance provided by norm (f) which contradicts some of the harm requirements under international law.\n# Norm (f) and CI\nNorm (f) applies to cyber operations against CI, however, despite that there are core sectors that most states consider to constitute CI, the notion of CI remains subjective. This means that the precise scope of norm (f) is not clearly defined. States have the prerogative to determine which infrastructures to designate as CI, $^{143}$ and, from 'critical information infrastructure' $^{144}$ and 'critical national infrastructure' $^{145}$ to 'national, transnational and supranational critical infrastructure' $^{146}$ — there is little consistency in the terminology adopted by states. The lack of agreement about what constitutes CI for the purposes of norm (f) can be problematic. For instance, election infrastructure in the US was only designated as critical in January 2017 following Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. $^{147}$ Some states have also been hesitant to designate specific sectors as CI due to concerns that this would implicitly condone malicious activities against sectors that are not specified. $^{148}$ The 2021 UN GGE report expressly acknowledges these concerns, noting that, even where a sector is not designated as CI, it does not amount to condoning malicious activities against those sectors. $^{149}$ Furthermore, even where states specify certain sectors as CI, they are not precluded from designating other sectors as such in the future. $^{150}$ There have also been calls to extend norm (f) to mention specific sectors, even if those sectors are already widely considered to be CI. For example, in February 2020 the International Committee of the Red Cross proposed extending the application of norm (f) to address the\n\nSAMULI HAATAJA\n'particular vulnerability of health care facilities' in response to cyber operations against hospitals and vaccine research centres during the pandemic.\nWhile agreement about what sectors constitute CI for the purposes of norm (f) is useful in providing clarity for the scope of the norm, this introduces unnecessary additional complexity to how international law applies in this context. The contested nature of CI and focus on whether a sector is CI for the purposes of norm (f) has the potential to narrow the application of international law only to those sectors that states have agreed to constitute CI. The need for a cyber operation to affect CI also creates an additional requirement that is not evident in existing international law. This is because, irrespective of whether a sector is designated as CI or not, existing international law obligations apply to cyber operations causing effects in the territory of other states. For example, a cyber operation against election infrastructure rising to the level of a violation of sovereignty or intervention will constitute a violation of international law regardless of whether the victim state considers the infrastructure to be CI or not. Similarly, cyber operations against healthcare facilities causing sufficient effects will constitute violations of international law even if those sectors are not specifically mentioned in norm (f). Therefore, the focus on what constitutes CI for the purposes of norm (f), and the subjectivity of the concept of CI has the potential to introduce additional complexity to determining whether a cyber operation violates international law.\n## Norm (f) and uncertainty in international law\nNorm (f) seeks to reaffirm the existing legal obligations of states in relation to cyber operations against CI and provide additional specific guidance on responsible state behaviour in this context. However, the harm requirements within norm (f) are contradictory to those in international law, and this further compounds existing uncertainties in how the law applies to cyber operations targeting CI. As a result, there are a range of cyber operations that can constitute violations of international law but not norm (f), or vice versa.\nFor example, whether a cyber operation against CI constitutes a use of force will generally be determined based on its 'scale and effects'. Under this approach, there must be a degree of direct physical damage to the CI, or disruption of its functionality which causes damage or harm to individuals comparable to a use of force by kinetic means. The Stuxnet incident is generally considered to have crossed this threshold as it is reported to have caused damage to approximately 1000 centrifuge machines. Assuming Stuxnet was attributable to a state, its use would have violated norm (f) as it caused intentional damage to CI and was contrary to the responsible state's international obligations. However, a disruptive cyber operation with only adverse economic consequences would generally not constitute a use of force. This could include, for example, a cyber operation against a power grid that causes a temporary blackout without any indirect physical effects or harm to individuals. While a cyber operation of this kind would involve impairing the use of the CI and adversely impact its use for the public for the purposes of norm (f), it would unlikely violate a state's legal obligations under article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n International Committee of the Red Cross, 'Norms for Responsible State Behavior on Cyber Operations should Build on International Law' (11 February 2020) <https: document=\"\" en=\"\" norms-responsible-state-behavior-cyber-operations-should-build-international-law=\"\" www.icrc.org=\"\">. While norm (f) was not amended, the 2021 UN GGE report did specifically note how '[t]he COVID-19 pandemic heightened awareness of the critical importance of protecting health care and medical infrastructure and facilities, including through the implementation of the norms addressing critical infrastructure'. UN GGE 2021 report (n 150) 12.\n See Milanovic and Schmitt (n 8).\n Haataja (n 93) 88–95.\n See also Broeders and others (n 60) 4–7.</https:>\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 441\nFor a cyber operation of this kind without direct physical effects to violate the non-intervention principle, there is a requirement that the operation was intended to be coercive and directed at matters states have the right to decide freely. For example, where a cyber operation causing a blackout was done with the intention of coercing the targeted state to reverse its policy of recognition of another state, this would constitute an unlawful intervention. But where the cyber operation does not involve the element of coercion directed at matters states should be freely able to decide (or the responsible state's intention is unknown), then the cyber operation would fall outside the scope of the non-intervention principle. This is despite the impairment of CI and its adverse impact on the public that is consistent with the harm requirement in norm (f). Whether a cyber operation of this kind violates sovereignty is also unsettled given the divergence in views among states on the issue.\nIn relation to cyber operations against CI and violations of sovereignty, consider, for example, where a state obtains unauthorised access to another state's power grid, election infrastructure or hospital systems and installs malware that gives it the ability to cause disruptive or destructive effects on that infrastructure at a later point in time. Whether a cyber operation of this kind violates sovereignty is unsettled as the precise boundaries of states' legal obligations in this context are still developing and evolving as more state practice emerges. According to France and Iran, which adopt the rule approach to sovereignty and consider any penetration of their networks to be a violation of sovereignty, this conduct would constitute a violation of international law at the point in time at which there is unauthorized access to their systems.[155] However, for states like the Czech Republic and New Zealand, merely obtaining unauthorised access or installing malware that does not impair the functioning of the systems would not constitute violations of sovereignty.[156] Instead, for these states, it is only at the point in time at which that malware is used to cause significant disruptive or destructive effects that the cyber operation would qualify as a violation of sovereignty. Similarly, for states like the UK adopting the principle approach to sovereignty, the cyber operation could not constitute a violation of international law unless and until it rises to the level of a use of force or involves coercion and violates the non-intervention principle.[157] Accordingly, a range of cyber operations that meet the harm requirements in norm (f) would fall outside of its scope because, given the uncertainty around how international law applies in this context, it would be unclear whether those operations also violate the law as required by norm (f).\nFurther compounding the uncertainty in how existing international law applies are the harm requirements of norm (f) that are not consistent with international law. Norm (f) requires 'intentional damage', but the intent is not a requisite element for most of the rules of international law outlined above. In relation to the prohibition on the use of force, there is no requirement for intention.[158] Instead, the approach adopted by most states and in the Tallinn Manual focuses on the 'scale and effects' of a cyber operation.[159] Similarly, intention is not a requirement for a violation of sovereignty.[160] While intention is an element of the non-intervention principle,[161] the focus of the law here is on the intention of the state applying the coercion and not\n\nSAMULI HAATAJA\nwhether the particular technical effects – such as damage to CI – were intended or not. This means that there is no need for ‘intentional damage’ to be caused by a cyber operation for the non-intervention principle to be violated. Norm (f), however, specifically refers to intentional damage. As a result, where a state engages in a cyber operation against CI that causes unintentional damage to the CI, the activity could constitute a violation of sovereignty or a use of force but would fall outside the scope of the intentional damage contemplated by norm (f).\nThe approach to impairment evident in norm (f) is useful in terms of the specificity of the requirement for an (even minimally) adverse impact on services provided to the public by the CI. This encompasses a very broad spectrum of cyber operations against CI, including disruptive cyber operations that may fall outside the scope of the prohibition on the use of force and the non-intervention principle. However, unless these cyber operations cause sufficient effects to constitute a use of force, or are accompanied by coercive intention and satisfy the non-intervention principle, they would fall outside the scope of existing international law and also outside of norm (f). As such, while the ‘additional specific guidance’ that norm (f) provides in its approach to impairment is useful given the broad spectrum of cyber operations against CI that it captures, there is uncertainty about whether most of such cyber operations would constitute violations of international law as required under norm (f).\nFinally, when considering low-level cyber operations used to pre-position or prepare for potentially destructive cyber operations against CI in peacetime, what is revealed is the dark side of norm (f) and existing international law in this context. Given that these kinds of cyber operations do not cause immediate damage or impairment and, from a technical perspective, can be indistinguishable from cyber espionage, they are effectively permitted under existing international law and generally will not be seen to constitute violations of sovereignty. But much of CI is dual-use and this means that under certain conditions it can be lawfully subject to attack through cyber means in an armed conflict. Essentially, except in circumstances where there is evidence of an imminent armed attack, norm (f) and existing international law allow states to engage in cyber operations against CI that involve pre-positioning and preparing for potentially destructive effects in the future.\nTherefore, norm (f) introduces additional complexity to the application of international law in this context, and this complexity is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are considered to be ‘off limits’. The subjective nature of what constitutes CI and the requirement for a sector to be CI to be captured by norm (f) creates a requirement that is not evident in international law and effectively narrows its application.\n However, where a cyber operation of this kind also has an adverse impact on the public then it would constitute impairment under the second type of harm within norm (f). This could amount to a violation of international law on sovereignty, but this is uncertain given the current debate about sovereignty.\n The norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace only operate in peacetime. United States Department of Defence, ‘Cyber Strategy 2018’ (2018) 5 <https: 1=\"\" 18=\"\" 2002041658=\"\" 2018=\"\" c=\"\" media.defense.gov=\"\" sep=\"\" spc=\"\" www.cyber_strategy_summary_final.pdf=\"\">; Broeders and others (n 60) 14–16.\n The attack would need to be consistent with international humanitarian law obligations. See Fidler (n 83) 12; Jolley (n 51) 181–4. See also Broeders and others (n 60).\n For example, according to Australia, states may exercise a right of anticipatory self-defence where ‘a threatened armed attack in the form of an offensive cyber operation’ that could be launched ‘in a split second’ and could cause ‘large-scale loss of human life and damage to critical infrastructure’. See George Brandis, ‘The Right of Self-Defence against Imminent Armed Attack in International Law’ (Lecture delivered at the University of Queensland, Brisbane, 11 April 2017) 8 <https: 05=\"\" 2017=\"\" developments-international-law-self-defence-against-imminent-armed-attack=\"\" blog=\"\" law.uq.edu.au=\"\">. Similarly, according to NATO’s Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations, non-destructive cyber operations, such as those causing temporary disruptions of service or involving information gathering where they are conducted to enable a conventional threat – including an imminent threat of one – could be considered to trigger the right of self-defence. NATO, Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations, Allied Joint Publication-3.20 (NATO Standardisation Office 2020) 20 <https: 899678=\"\" attachment_data=\"\" government=\"\" file=\"\" doctrine_nato_cyberspace_operations_ajp_3_20_1_.pdf=\"\" uploads=\"\" www.cyber-systems_ajp_3_20_1_.pdf=\"\" www.cyber-docrine_nato_cyberspace_operations_ajp_3_20_1_.pdf=\"\">.\n This prioritizes the security interests of states over the cyber security of CI systems. David Fidler, for example, suggests a new cyber-defence norm adopting an ‘all hazards’ strategy to protect CI that does not focus on the legal regime (whether cyber crime or espionage) but instead on ensuring ‘networks are protected against infiltrations from any source’. Fidler (n 83) 13</https:></https:></https:>\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 443\nInternational law obligations apply to cyber operations conducted by states irrespective of whether they target what the victim state has designated as CI or not. While there is a degree of uncertainty around the thresholds at which violations of international law on the use of force, intervention and sovereignty occur, the harm requirements in norm (f) have the potential to compound these uncertainties as they are not consistent with these rules of international law.\nAccordingly, more clarity about the relationship between international law and norm (f) is needed, and about how international law applies to cyber operations targeting sectors that states have deemed to be CI. This is particularly the case in relation to international law on sovereignty. Especially where low-level cyber operations without immediately disruptive or destructive effects are involved, more states need to provide detailed accounts of when they consider the law to be violated and the relationship between sovereignty and sectors they consider to be CI. While a state's domestic legislation – like the Australian NSLA – may criminalise various activities such as the installation of malware onto CI on a national level, states should also expressly outline how they regard these activities on an international level. Here the approach to impairment in norm (f) can serve as useful guidance on when a cyber operation should violate sovereignty. Similarly, the fact that CI is targeted can serve as an indicia of a violation of sovereignty. For example, this is the approach that Germany has adopted making an explicit connection between cyber operations against its CI and violations of its sovereignty. In relation to low-level cyber operations, such as those involving the installation of malware enabling a persistent presence on CI that is generally accepted as a permissible form of espionage, these should be seen as potential violations of sovereignty given the purpose for which they are conducted. As such, while clarity around when cyber operations violate sovereignty and the relevance of a sector's designation as CI is needed, international law applies to cyber operations by states irrespective of norm (f) which introduces counterproductive complexity to the legal analysis in this context.\n# CONCLUSION\nThis article examined the norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace and international law prohibiting malicious cyber operations against CI. It demonstrated that norm (f), which prohibits cyber operations that damage or impair CI, introduces complexity to the application of international law that is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are prohibited by international law. This is due to the subjective nature of CI, the contradictory legal status of norm (f), and the ways in which the harm requirements of norm (f) compound existing uncertainties about how international law applies to cyber operations where CI is targeted. To develop clarity about what cyber operations against CI should be 'off limits', more states need to outline their positions on the threshold at which they consider the law to be violated – especially in relation to sovereignty – to ensure that malicious low-level cyber operations, in particular, do not fall outside of these legal constraints.\n This has been recently recognized in the UN OEWG 2021 report where it was noted that a cyber operation contrary to international law that 'intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public, could pose a threat not only to security but also to State sovereignty'. See UN OEWG 2021 report (n 48) 4.\n According to Germany, where a cyber operation targets a state's CI it 'may indicate that a State's territorial sovereignty has been violated'. However, given, among other things, the lack of international agreement of what constitutes CI, Germany maintained that this in and of itself cannot constitute the basis for a violation. The Federal Government of Germany (n 89) 4.\n For example, Asaf Lubin maintains that cyber espionage should be unlawful where the purpose for which it is conducted is unlawful. Asaf Lubin, 'The Liberty to Spy' (2020) 61(1) HILJ 185, 238–9. Other academics have also expressed support for adopting a purpose approach in determining the lawfulness of cyber espionage.

This article examines norm (f) in light of existing international law prohibiting malicious cyber operations against CI. It argues that norm (f) introduces complexity to the application of the law in this context that is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are prohibited by international law. This is due to the subjectivity of the concept of CI, the contradictory legal status of norm (f), and due to existing uncertainties in how international law applies to state conduct in cyberspace which are compounded by norm (f). The article concludes that states need to develop more clarity about the relationship between international law and the norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, and about how international law applies to cyber operations, particularly where CI is targeted.\nKEY WORDS: cyber norms, international law, cyber operations, critical infrastructure, cyberspace\n## INTRODUCTION\nThis article examines norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace and international law prohibiting malicious cyber operations against critical infrastructure (CI) in peacetime. It argues that, while states have agreed to a norm that cyber operations that damage CI or impair its use should be prohibited, this norm adds a degree of counterproductive complexity to the application of the law in this context. This complexity arises from the subjective nature of what constitutes CI, the contradictory legal status of norm (f), and the existing uncertainties about how international law applies to cyber operations which are compounded by norm (f).

Section two considers what constitutes CI and the threat posed by malicious cyber operations against CI. Section three examines the norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace with a focus on norm (f) which prohibits states from conducting cyber operations that cause intentional damage or impairment to the operation of CI in other states. This section outlines the debate about the legal status of norm (f) and demonstrates its contradictory legal status. Section four then examines how states' existing international law obligations are considered to apply to cyber operations causing effects on another state's CI. The focus is on international law on the use of force, non-intervention, and sovereignty. This section demonstrates that there continues to be a degree of uncertainty about when cyber operations against CI violate international law, particularly those falling below the use of force threshold. Section five examines the implications of norm (f) for international law in this context. It demonstrates how norm (f) introduces complexity to the legal analysis which is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are prohibited by international law. Section six provides a conclusion.\n# CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND CYBER OPERATIONS\nIn June 2020, the Australian Government revealed that it had been subject to a campaign of cyber attacks targeting its federal- and state-level governments, various companies and CI. Given the scale and nature of the operations, Australia maintained a foreign state actor was responsible, however, it stopped short of publicly attributing the operations to a specific state. Despite this, some have suggested China was responsible. The cyber operations are understood to have involved compromising the computer systems and networks of the various organisations that were targeted through vulnerabilities in their software. However, despite the media attention Australia's revelation of the incident received, the cyber operations did not cause any effects, such as disrupting the operation of the compromised organisations. Instead, according to the Australian Cyber Security Centre, there was no evidence of 'intent by the actor to carry out any disruptive or destructive activities within victim environments'.\nThere is growing concern about the threat posed by low-level cyber operations that do not necessarily result in immediate disruptive or destructive effects but are nonetheless significant in their scale or have the potential to be used in preparation for more harmful operations. For example, the Australian Department of Defence has specifically highlighted the threat posed by 'all kinds of preparation, pre-positioning, [and] collection of intelligence' activities in the cyber context. This was echoed by the Director General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation who expressed concerns about 'the potential for Australia's adversaries to pre-position malicious code in critical infrastructure ...

In the United States (US), the 2018 ‘National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America’ (US Cyber Strategy) makes specific mention of Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, and provides that the US and its allies ‘are vulnerable to peacetime cyber attacks against critical infrastructure’ and that there is a growing risk ‘these countries will conduct cyber attacks against the United States during a crisis short of war’. Accordingly, there is recognition of the potentially devastating impact that cyber operations on CI can have and the threat posed by cyber activities in preparation of such operations. These concerns have been exacerbated by reports about malicious cyber operations conducted against hospitals and vaccine research centres during the pandemic in 2020, as well as ransomware crippling the operation of Colonial Pipeline in 2021 in the US.\nIn light of these concerns, states have highlighted the need for international agreement that certain CI should be ‘off limits’ from malicious cyber activities. In 2015, for example, Australia’s then Foreign Minister Julie Bishop maintained that:\nThe effective functioning of critical infrastructure underpins the global economy. States should prevent and refrain from online activity which damages or impairs critical infrastructure, whether it be in banking, telecos, energy structures. While states define their critical infrastructure sectors differently and harmonisation is important, agreeing that key sectors should be off limits is a priority for the international community.\nAnd in 2021, following the Colonial Pipeline incident, US President Joe Biden told Russia’s President Vladimir Putin that ‘certain critical infrastructure should be “off limits” to attack’, and provided Russia with a list of 16 sectors the US considers CI.\nIn Australia, as part of the effort to counter the broader threat posed by malicious cyber activities by foreign actors, the ‘National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Act 2018’ (NSLA) was recently passed into law. The NSLA was primarily introduced to address the threat of foreign interference in its political processes, but it also contains provisions relating to foreign cyber activities against Australia’s CI. These include a range of new sabotage offences designed to ‘criminalise conduct causing damage to a broad range of critical infrastructure where it could prejudice Australia’s national security’. For example, under the NSLA it is a criminal offence to engage in conduct that results in damage to Australia’s infrastructure where this is done on behalf of a foreign actor and it undermines Australia’s national\n Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, ASIO Annual Report 2020-21 (2021) 5 <https: annual%20report%202020-21%20web.pdf=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\" www.asio.gov.au=\"\">.\n The White House, ‘National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America’ (September 2018) 3 <https: 09=\"\" 2018=\"\" annual%20report%202020-21%20web.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" national-cyber-strategy.pdf=\"\" uploads=\"\" wp-content=\"\" www.wytimes.com=\"\">.\n See Marko Milanovic and Michael Schmitt, ‘Cyber Attacks and Cyber (Mis)information Operations During a Pandemic’ (2020) 11 JNSLP 247.\n David Sanger, Clifford Krauss, and Nicole Perlroth, ‘Cyberattack Forces a Shutdown of a Top U.S. Pipeline’ The New York Times (8 May 2021) <https: 05=\"\" 2021=\"\" 09=\"\" a=\"\" cw=\"\" cw-weights=\"\" for=\"\" hyperattack-colonial-pipeline.html=\"\" upolitics=\"\" us=\"\" politics=\"\" paucities=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n Julie Bishop, ‘Statement for Plenary Session on International Peace and Security, Global Conference on Cyberspace’ Minister for Foreign Affairs The Hon Julie Bishop MP (17 April 2015) <https: 05=\"\" 2021-06-16=\"\" 2021=\"\" julie-bishop=\"\" minister=\"\" minister.julie-bishop=\"\" speech=\"\" www.foreignminister.gov.au=\"\">.\n Vladimir Soldatkin and Humeyra Pamuk, ‘Biden Tells Putin Certain Cyberattacks should be “Off-limits”’ Reuters (17 June 2021) <https: biden-tells-putin-certain-cyber-attacks-should-be-off-limits-2021-06-16=\"\" technology=\"\" www.reuters.com=\"\">.\n See Henry Belot, ‘Malcolm Turnbull Announces Biggest Overhaul of Espionage, Intelligence Laws in Decades’ ABC News (5 December 2017) <https: 2017-12-05=\"\" news=\"\" turnbull-announces-foreign-interference-laws=\"\" www.abc.net.au=\"\">; Louise Yaxley, ‘Sam Dastyari and the Murky Links with Chinese Businessmen that Ended his Political Career’ ABC News (12 December 2017) <http: 2017-12-12=\"\" 9249216=\"\" am-dastyari-murky-links-with-chinese-businessmen-ended-career=\"\" news=\"\" www.abc.net.au=\"\">.\n National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Act 2018 (Cth) (NSLA Act) sch 1 pt 1 div 82–Sabotage; Revised Explanatory Memorandum, National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017 (Cth) 62 [137].</http:></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:>\nSAMULI HAATAJA\nsecurity. Similarly, it is a criminal offence to introduce vulnerabilities – such as the installation of malicious software (malware) or creation of backdoors – onto public infrastructure where this is done to undermine Australia's national security. As such, the NSLA includes offences that specifically apply to activities involved in the preparation of potential future intrusions into, for example, Australian government networks and systems. However, while Australia has legislated to protect CI from foreign cyber activities on a domestic level, international agreement around what activities or sectors are to be ‘off limits’ is necessary to ensure the protection of CI from state-sponsored cyber threats.\n## Definitions of critical infrastructure\nPart of the problem around what activities or sectors should be ‘off limits’ revolves around differences in what constitutes CI among states. As highlighted by Australia’s former foreign minister above, there is no universal definition of CI and states in fact have the ability to designate any infrastructure asset as CI. Generally, CI includes various infrastructures such as those related to energy, health and transportation, and many of these infrastructures are dual-use. In Australia, for example, CI is defined as referring to the\nphysical facilities, supply chains, information technologies and communication networks which, if destroyed, degraded or rendered unavailable for an extended period, would significantly impact on the social or economic wellbeing of the nation or affect Australia’s ability to conduct national defence and ensure national security.\nIn Australia, CI thus ‘provides services that are essential for everyday life such as energy, communications, water, transport, health, food and grocery, banking and finance and the Australian Government’.\nThe United Kingdom (UK) in turn adopts the term ‘critical national infrastructure’ and this refers to the ‘critical elements of infrastructure (namely, assets, facilities, systems, networks or processes and the essential workers that operate and facilitate them)’ where the loss or compromise of those elements would result in a ‘major detrimental impact on the availability, integrity or delivery of essential services’ and/or a ‘significant impact on national security, national defence or the functioning of the state’.\nIn the US, CI refers to ‘systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the US that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety or any combination of those matters’. The ‘critical infrastructure sectors’, as identified by the recently established US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, include 16 sectors across energy, commerce, finance, food and agriculture, healthcare, emergency services, water, waste, transportation and defence.\nIn the European Union (EU), CI refers to\n NSLA Act (n 13) ss 82.3, 82.4.\n See NSLA Act (n 13) ss 82.7, 82.8.\n Revised NSLA Explanatory Memorandum (n 13) 80 [236].\n Commonwealth of Australia, Critical Infrastructure Resilience Strategy: Policy Statement (2015) 8 <https: criticalinfrastructureresiliencestrategypolicystatement.pdf=\"\" site%20documents=\"\" www.tisn.gov.au=\"\">.\n Australian Government, ‘What is the Critical Infrastructure Centre?’ Critical Infrastructure Centre <https: ctc-factsheet-what-is-critical-infrastructure-centre.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" nat-security=\"\" www.homeaffairs.gov.au=\"\">.\n Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure, ‘Critical National Infrastructure’ (2020) <https: critical-national-infrastructure-0=\"\" www.cpni.gov.uk=\"\">.\n USA Patriot Act of 2001, 42 USC §§5195c(e), 1016(e).\n United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, ‘Critical Infrastructure Sectors’ (24 March 2020) <https: critical-infrastructure-sectors=\"\" www.cisa.gov=\"\">.</https:></https:></https:></https:>\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 417\nan asset, system or part thereof located in Member States which is essential for the maintenance of vital societal functions, health, safety, security, economic or social well-being of people, and the disruption or destruction of which would have a significant impact in a Member State as a result of the failure to maintain those functions.\nThis essentially refers to the physical infrastructure which is vital for the proper functioning of society. The EU uses the term ‘critical information infrastructure’ (CII) to describe both the essential information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructures and those that are essential for the operation of its physical CI.\nAt the United Nations (UN) level, states have noted in a General Assembly resolution on the ‘creation of a global culture of cybersecurity and the protection of critical information infrastructures’ that CI involves, among other things, the infrastructures used for ‘the generation, transmission and distribution of energy, air and maritime transport, banking and financial services, e-commerce, water supply, food distribution and public health’ and that these infrastructures are increasingly interconnected with CII. But here too it is recognized that each state has the right to determine what constitutes its CI.\nAccordingly, in the Australian, UK, US, EU and UN contexts, CI refers to infrastructures essential to the proper functioning and well-being of the state and society. The term encompasses physical infrastructures (such as power plants and hospitals) located within a state’s territory, as well as the virtual infrastructure allowing the physical components to operate. Generally, this infrastructure is critical where its disruption or destruction would have a detrimental impact (whether significant, major, debilitating and so on) on the provision of key services that relate to the social or economic well-being of the state or its national security. However, states also have the prerogative to designate any infrastructure assets or sectors as critical. For example, the above UK definition includes the human personnel required to operate CI, and in Australia, the relevant government minister has the power to designate any asset as critical. As such, while there are core sectors that most states consider to constitute CI, the scope of what constitutes CI is subjective as evident in the differences in terminology and approaches that states adopt in determining this. Consequently, when considering relevant laws and norms surrounding CI protection, there is uncertainty about the specific infrastructures against which malicious cyber activities are prohibited.\n## Cyber operations against critical infrastructure\nIn addition to the 2020 cyber attacks against Australia, there are various other examples of known incidents differing in kind and intensity from low-level information collection operations to more disruptive and even destructive attacks against states’ CI. For example, in 2010 the infamous Stuxnet malware was discovered which had infected an Iranian uranium enrichment facility and, by changing the settings according to which the centrifuge machines operated, caused physical damage to approximately 1000 centrifuges. Similarly, in a non-destructive but highly disruptive attack, in December 2015 parts of Ukraine’s power grid were shut down for\n Council Directive 2008/114/EC of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection [2008] OJ L 345/75 art 2.\n Commission of the European Communities, ‘Green Paper on a European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection’ (COM/2005/576 final, 17 November 2005) 19.\n United Nations General Assembly, UNGA Res 58/199 (23 December 2003) UN Doc A/RES/58/199, 1.\n Ibid.\n See ss 50 and 51 of the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 (Cth).\n Joby Warrick, ‘Iran’s Natanz Nuclear Facility Recovered Quickly from Stuxnet Cyberattack’ The Washington Post (16 February 2011) <http: 02=\"\" 15=\"\" 2011=\"\" ar2011021505395.html=\"\" content=\"\" article=\"\" wp-dyn=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\">.

This is believed to have been the first blackout caused by a cyber operation.\nBesides these disruptive and destructive cyber operations against CI, states are also engaging in various low-level cyber operations against CI. These operations can be used to gather information that can potentially be used in preparation for more disruptive future operations. As an example, in 2018 the US Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation released a report on Russian cyber activities targeting its energy and other CI sectors. According to this report, Russian actors had since at least 2016 ‘targeted government entities and multiple US critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy, nuclear, commercial facilities, water, aviation and critical manufacturing sectors’. This was characterized by these agencies ‘as a multi-stage intrusion campaign by Russian government cyber actors’ in which these actors obtained unauthorized access to various networks and installed malware allowing them to conduct reconnaissance and collect information about industrial control systems. Similarly, in 2019 it was reported that the US had moved beyond mere reconnaissance operations into Russia’s power grid to the placement of malware onto those systems that could be used to disrupt its operation. Furthermore, in December 2020, it was reported that Russia had, through software provided by the company SolarWinds, compromised a range of US government agencies and companies responsible for CI in the electricity, oil and manufacturing industries. While the SolarWinds incident is mainly understood to have compromised data in the affected sectors, Anne Neuberger, the US Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology, expressed concerns that Russia’s ability to access these systems has the potential to be used for disruptive operations in the future. And in January 2022, during increased tensions between the US and Russia in the lead-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the US Cybersecurity Advisory issued an advisory encouraging the US cybersecurity community and especially CI operators ‘to adopt a heightened state of awareness’ given the threat posed by Russian-state-sponsored cyber operations against US CI. Accordingly, states like the US and Russia are using malicious cyber operations to obtain unauthorized access and maintaining a ‘persistent presence’ in other states’ CI systems. The concern is that these preparatory cyber operations can be used to damage or disrupt the operation of CI in the future.\n See Kim Zetter, ‘Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid’ Wired (3 March 2016) <https: 03=\"\" 2016=\"\" 03=\"\" inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\">.\n David Sanger, ‘Utilities Cautioned about Potential for a Cyberattack’ The New York Times (29 February 2016) <https: 03=\"\" 2016=\"\" 00=\"\" http:=\"\" us=\"\" politics=\"\" politics.cautioned-about-potential-for-a-cyberattack-after-ukraines.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n See Symantec Critical Attack Discovery and Intelligence Team, ‘Dragonfly: Western Energy Sector Targeted by Sophisticated Attack Group’ Symantec Threat Intelligence (20 October 2017) <https: dragonfly-energy-sector-cyber-attacks=\"\" blogs=\"\" symantec-blogs.broadcom.com=\"\">.\n United States Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation, ‘Russian Government Cyber Activity Targeting Energy and Other Critical Infrastructure Sectors’ (Technical Alert TA18-074A, 15 March 2018) <https: alerts=\"\" a18-074a=\"\" ncas=\"\" ta18-074a=\"\" www.us-cert.gov=\"\">.\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n David Sanger and Nicole Perlroth, ‘U.S. Escalates Online Attacks on Russia’s Power Grid’ The New York Times (15 June 2019) <https: 06=\"\" 15=\"\" 2019=\"\" us=\"\" politics=\"\" prurip-cyber-russia-grid.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n David Sanger, ‘Russian Hackers Broke into Federal Agencies, U.S. Officials Suspect’ The New York Times (13 December 2020) <https: 12=\"\" 2020=\"\" 22=\"\" 2020=\"\" politics=\"\" russian-hackers-us-government-treasury-commerce.html?=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n Kim Zetter, ‘SolarWinds Hack Infected Critical Infrastructure, including Power Industry’ The Intercept (25 December 2020) <https: 02=\"\" 2020=\"\" 22=\"\" 24=\"\" solarwinds-hack-power-infrastructure=\"\" theintercept.com=\"\">.\n David Sanger, ‘After Russian Cyberattack, Looking for Answers and Debating Retaliation’ The New York Times (23 February 2021) <https: 02=\"\" 2021=\"\" 23=\"\" polities=\"\" solarwinds-hack-senate-intelligence-russia.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, ‘Understanding and Mitigating Russian State Sponsored Cyber Threats to U.S. Critical Infrastructure’ (11 January 2022) 1 <https: 02=\"\" 2022=\"\" 23=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" publications=\"\" us=\"\" uscert=\"\" sites=\"\" www.cisa.gov=\"\" uscert=\"\" publications=\"\" uscertisites=\"\"></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:>\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 419\nThis concern crystallized during the war in Ukraine in 2022 which involved a range of cyber operations and activities that Russia had pre-positioned for.\n# NORMS OF RESPONSIBLE STATE BEHAVIOUR IN CYBERSPACE\nThe international security issues surrounding states' use of digital technologies and activities in cyberspace have been considered at the UN level since the late 1990s, and in this context, states have agreed to norms around responsible behaviour in cyberspace including around CI protection. Since 1998, the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) of the UN General Assembly has regularly considered 'Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security'. In 2004 it established a Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) to examine existing and potential threats from cyberspace. A second GGE was established in 2009 and it issued a consensus report in 2010 which highlighted the risk of how '[t]he growing use of ICTs in critical infrastructures creates new vulnerabilities and opportunities for disruption'. It also recommended that states should engage in further dialogue 'to discuss norms pertaining to State use of ICTs, to reduce collective risk and protect critical national and international infrastructure'. This was echoed in the 2013 report from the third GGE which also, for the first time, confirmed the general application of international law and UN Charter principles in the cyber context.\nThe 2015 report by the fourth GGE was significant as it introduced a set of norms for responsible state behaviour in their use of ICTs. The UN General Assembly also passed resolutions in 2018 and 2019 on 'Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security' where it called on states to be guided by the UN GGE reports and these norms in their use of ICTs. This was echoed in the 2021 consensus report of the UN Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security in which states emphasized the importance of these norms.\nFrom these norms, three are particularly relevant to CI protection. Norm (g) provides that states should take appropriate measures to protect their own CI, and norm (h) provides that states should mitigate malicious cyber activities emanating from their territory that are directed against the CI of other states. Of most relevance to malicious cyber operations against CI, however, is norm (f). It provides that:\n Microsoft, 'Special Report: Ukraine' (27 April 2022) § <https: am=\"\" app=\"\" am=\"\" binary=\"\" re4vwwd=\"\" query.prod.cms=\"\" re4vwwd=\"\" www.cms=\"\">.\n United Nations General Assembly, Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, GA Res 53/70, UN Doc A/RES/53/70 (4 January 1999).\n United Nations Secretary-General, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security: Report of the Secretary-General, UN Doc A/60/202 (5 August 2005).\n United Nations Secretary-General, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security: Note by the Secretary-General, UN Doc A/65/201 (30 July 2010).\n Ibid 7.\n Ibid 8.\n United Nations Secretary-General, Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/68/98 (24 June 2013) 2.\n United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/70/174 (22 July 2015) 8.\n See United Nations General Assembly, Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/RES/73/266 (2 January 2019); United Nations General Assembly, Advancing Responsible State Behaviours in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/RES/74/28 (18 December 2019).\n United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, 'Final Substantive Report' (10 March 2021) 4–5 <https: 03=\"\" 2021=\"\" front.un-arm.org=\"\" uploads=\"\" wp-content=\"\" wpr2.pdf=\"\" uploads=\"\">.\n See Michael Berk, 'Recommendation 13(g) and (h)' in United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (ed), Voluntary, Non-Binding Norms for Responsible State Behaviour in the Use of Information and Communications Technology: A Commentary (United Nations Publication 2017).</https:></https:>\nSAMULI HAATAJA\nA State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity contrary to its obligations under international law that intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public.\nPrima facie, norm (f) specifically prohibits cyber operations against the CI of other states. According to the commentary to the norms, it reflects consensus about the unique importance of CI to modern societies and a recognition of the possibility of conflicts to escalate where state-to-state cyber activities adversely impact CI in particular. However, despite this apparent consensus, there is debate about the legal status of norm (f) and its relationship to international law. In particular, it is unclear whether it seeks to create new non-binding expectations of responsible state behaviour or to reaffirm the application of existing binding rules of international law.\nThis lack of clarity arises because norm (f) is explicitly included as a 'voluntary, non-binding' norm in the 2015 UN GGE report, and all of the norms are located in a separate section to the question of how international law applies to ICT activities. Yet the wording of norm (f) expressly refers to a state's 'obligations under international law' – that is, binding, opposed to voluntary and non-binding obligations – resulting in what others have described as a 'contradiction in terms'. The confusion about the legal status of norm (f) is also evident among states who generally regard the norms as conceptually distinct from international law. For example, Australia, in its 2017 'Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy', expresses a commitment to these norms and notes that international law can be complemented with these norms, but treats the two as distinct. The US has also expressed a commitment to the promotion of these norms but regards them as conceptually distinct from international law. This is evident in the US Cyber Strategy which includes as one of its pillars the preservation of peace through strength, and the means of doing so is through the promotion of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace based on international law on one hand, and 'voluntary non-binding norms' on the other. Similarly, the ASEAN-EU Statement on Cybersecurity Cooperation distinguishes between the application of international law in the cyber context and, separately, acknowledges 'that voluntary and non-binding norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour of States in the use of ICTs can reduce risks to international peace, security and stability'. The distinction between the non-binding norms and binding international law obligations is also evident in academic commentary. For example, according to Harriet Moynihan, norm (f) 'does not represent a binding obligation on states' and merely demonstrates 'their concern to protect\n UN GGE 2015 report (n 46) 8.\n Jason Jolley, 'Recommendation 13 (f)' in United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (ed) Voluntary, Non-Binding Norms for Responsible State Behaviour in the Use of Information and Communications Technology: A Commentary (United Nations Publication 2017) 169–70.\n UN GGE 2015 report (n 46) 7.\n Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco, and Talita de Souza Dias, 'Drawing the Cyber Baseline: The Applicability of Existing International Law to the Governance of Information and Communication Technologies' (2022) 99 ILS 4, 32.\n Liisi Adamson, 'International Law and International Cyber Norms: A Continuum?' in Dennis Broeders and Bibi van den Berg (eds) Governing Cyberspace: Behavior, Power, and Diplomacy (Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2020) 25, 33.\n Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 'Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy' (October 2017) 47–8 <https: 2020-11=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" the%20strategy.pdf=\"\" www.internationalcybertech.gov.au=\"\" sites=\"\">; Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 2019 Progress Report, Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy (2019).\n The White House (7) 20.\n Ibid.\n Association of South East Asian Nations, 'ASEAN-EU Statement on Cybersecurity Cooperation' Association of South East Asian Nations (August 2019) [6]–[7] <https: 08=\"\" 2019=\"\" asean.org=\"\" asean-eu-statement-on-cybersecurity-cooperation-final.pdf=\"\" storage=\"\">.</https:></https:>\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nThe commentary to the norms, published by the UN Office for Disarmament Affairs, elaborates on key elements of norm (f) including its relationship with international law. Here it is noted that it is unclear 'why the [UN Group of Governmental] Experts have offered as voluntary something that by the majority of states is considered legally binding'. The commentary explains that norm (f) is premised on the law of state responsibility and was intended to reaffirm that states' existing legal obligations extend to their cyber activities. This is evident, for example, from the phrase 'conduct[s] or knowingly support[s]' within the wording of norm (f) which encompasses relevant rules of attribution of conduct under international law on state responsibility. The phrase 'contrary to its obligations' in turn refers to states' existing obligations under international law and includes, for example, the prohibition on the use of force and relevant international humanitarian law obligations. Therefore, according to the commentary, despite being expressly included as a voluntary and non-binding norm, norm (f) was intended to reaffirm states' existing legal obligations in relation to CI.\nAccordingly, the precise legal status of norm (f) is unclear and others have raised concerns about the implications of this. Writing in relation to the cyber norms generally, Kubo Mačák highlights how 'non-binding norms can never override binding legal rules' and, in the reverse, that 'a non-binding norm cannot permit action that would otherwise be forbidden by international law'. He maintains that the distinction is important as only a violation of international law can trigger obligations of cessation and reparation under the law on state responsibility. François Delerue, Frédérick Douzet and Aude Géry in turn maintain that the distinction between international law and norms 'complexifies the definition of rights and obligations for the states in cyberspace as it introduces a confusion on the nature of the rules'. They argue that by separating the two, the potential implication is that the norm is autonomous and detached from international law and that state behaviour in cyberspace is based only on the goodwill of states and not legal obligations. Similarly, Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco and Talita de Souza Dias argue that the inclusion of norm (f) as a voluntary, non-binding norm by the UN GGE can\n Harriet Moynihan, 'The Application of International Law to State Cyberattacks Sovereignty and Non-intervention' (Chatham House Research Paper 2019) 44 <https: 12=\"\" 2019=\"\" application-international-law-state-cyberattacks=\"\" www.chathamhouse.org=\"\">.\n Dennis Broeders, Els de Busser, Fabio Cristiano, and Tatiana Tropina, 'Revisiting Past Cyber Operations in Light of New Cyber Norms and Interpretations of International Law: Inching towards Lines in the Sand?'

He gives the example that 'if a State conducts a cyber operation that amounts to a prohibited intervention in the internal affairs of another State, it is legally obliged to cease its wrongful conduct (if it is continuing) and to provide full reparation to the injured State for the harm caused'.\n François Delerue, Frédérick Douzet and Aude Géry, 'The Geopolitical Representations of International Law in the International Negotiations on the Security and Stability of Syberspace' (Report No. 75, IRSEM/EU Cyber Direct, November 2020) 29.\n Ibid 32.</https:>\nSAMULI HAATAJA\nhave the effect of reducing well-established rules of international law to 'non-binding recommendations'.[72] The 2021 UN OEWG report seeks to clarify the role of the norms and their relationship to international law, but it ultimately reaffirms the conceptual distinction between the two. It provides that the 'norms do not replace or alter' binding obligations under international law, and do not seek to limit or prohibit action that is otherwise consistent with international law.\"[73] Instead, the norms 'provide additional specific guidance' on what constitutes responsible state behaviour in the cyber context.[74] As such, the legal status of norm (f) is contradictory given it was both intended to reaffirm states' legal obligations in relation to CI and, without replacing or altering the law, to provide non-binding additional specific guidance on what constitutes responsible state behaviour in this context. This is problematic as it is unclear what kinds of cyber operations are prohibited by binding international law obligations in contrast to those that are only contrary to non-binding norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.\nIn addition to its legal status, the commentary to norm (f) also discusses the degree of harm that is required for the norm to be violated. Norm (f) refers to activities that 'intentionally damage[] critical infrastructure or otherwise impair[] the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public'.[75] Essentially, this involves two types of harm: either intentional damage to CI or the use and operation of CI is impaired in its provision of services to the public. The commentary elaborates on both of these. In relation to the first, this requires a state to deliberately cause damage to CI irrespective of whether the damage impacts public services connected to the CI. Here the degree of damage is irrelevant as long as the damage is physical in nature.[76] Given the requirement of intention, however, where a state unintentionally causes physical damage to CI (provided it does not impair the use or operation of CI in its provision of services to the public) then this would fall outside the scope of norm (f).[77]\nThe second type of harm involves situations where a cyber operation does not cause any damage but impairs the use and operation of CI in its provision of services to the public. According to the commentary, impairment in this context refers to:\nany damage, physical or electronic, including the loss of data or software, or interruption of digital services provided by critical infrastructure, that makes the critical infrastructure less effective, less valuable, operate worse, or inhibit use by the public, the threshold being that the public must be impacted, even minimally.[78]\nAs such, the term 'impairment' encompasses physical impairment but does not require it, and captures a range of circumstances where the functionality of CI is undermined provided it results in a detrimental impact on its use by the public. This excludes cyber operations that do not disrupt the operation of CI, as well as cyber operations that disrupt the operation of CI without any impact on the public.[79] Unlike the requirement for intentional damage, the need for impairment is based on a strict liability approach where there is no need for the responsible state to have intended to cause the impairment.[80]\nIn summary, states have agreed to norms of responsible behaviour in cyberspace at the UN level including norm (f) which specifically prohibits certain cyber operations against CI.\n\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 433\nHowever, the legal status of norm (f) is contradictory. On one hand, it seeks to reaffirm states' existing obligations in relation to CI and is not intended to modify those obligations. On the other, it provides non-binding 'additional specific guidance' on responsible state behaviour in this context, particularly in relation to the degree of harm that should not be caused to CI. As will be demonstrated below, this guidance is concerning as it is inconsistent with the harm requirements under international law, and this further compounds existing uncertainties about how the law applies in this context.\n# INTERNATIONAL LAW AND CYBER OPERATIONS\nThis section examines how relevant rules of international law that norm (f) reaffirms apply to state activities in cyberspace. The focus is on three primary areas of international law that provide limits to cyber operations in peacetime, namely the law on the use of force, non-intervention and sovereignty. These are of particular relevance to cyber operations attributable to states targeting another state's CI given the broad spectrum of effects that remotely conducted cyber operations can cause.\nThere is widespread agreement that international law generally applies to state activities in cyberspace. This was highlighted in the 2015 UN GGE report which recognized that international law and the UN Charter in particular apply in the cyber context. This was reaffirmed in the 2021 UN OEWG consensus report. Despite this general agreement, however, there continues to be uncertainty about how particular rules of international law apply. As such, UN Member States have been invited to provide their national views on the UN GGE reports and to make submissions or provide working papers in connection with the UN OEWG which ran parallel to the UN GGE. In connection with these processes, states have provided more detailed accounts about how they consider the law to apply. The views of states are important as they contribute to more clarity about how international law applies in the cyber context, and to the development of customary international law applicable to state conduct in this context. However, the different positions evident in these statements have given rise to some debate about how the law applies. The implication of this is that, while there are some areas where a degree of consensus is emerging, there continues to be a degree of uncertainty about when cyber operations against CI will violate international law.\n# Use of force\nA cyber operation that causes physical damage to CI can potentially violate the prohibition on the use of force. Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits states from the use of force. Force in this context is generally understood to refer to 'armed force'. Despite being drafted in the\n However, as Delerue, Douzet and Géry note, the non-binding norms nonetheless 'can contribute to the interpretation of existing obligations in international law, or to the formation of new international obligations'. Delerue, Douzet and Géry (n 70) 31.\n See section 5.\n Other areas of law, such as international humanitarian law which applies in an armed conflict, while important given the dual-use nature of CI, are outside of the article's scope. On these obligations in relation to CI, see David Fidler 'Whither the Web?: International Law, Cybersecurity, and Critical Infrastructure Protection' (2015) 16 GJIA 8, 12. See also Jolley (n 51) 181-4.\n UN GGE 2015 report (n 46) 12.\n UN OEWG 2021 report (n 48) 5-6.\n See United Nations General Assembly, UNGA Res 73/203 (20 December 2018) UN Doc A/RES/73/203.\n See Albrecht Randelzhofer, 'Article 2(4)' in Bruno Simma and others (eds) The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary (Oxford University Press 2002) 117-21.\nSAMULI HAATAJA\ntechnological context of the 1940s, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has affirmed that the prohibition on the use of force applies 'to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.'88\nIn the cyber context, most states that have expressed their position on article 2(4) have adopted the approach that a cyber operation will constitute a use of force where its 'scale and effects' are comparable to a use of force by traditional kinetic means.89 This approach is similar to the one adopted by the 'Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations' (Tallinn Manual)90 – an influential but non-binding account by a group of experts about how international law applies in the cyber context91 – which provides in Rule 69 that '[a] cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.'92 Accordingly, where a cyber operation results in damage or destruction of physical property, or injury or death of human beings, it is likely to be considered to amount to a use of force in violation of article 2(4).\nHowever, where a cyber operation results in a loss of functionality of systems without causing physical damage, it is unclear whether this would be regarded as a use of force.93 Normally, economic or diplomatic pressure is not considered to be 'force' under article 2(4),94 and only the Netherlands has suggested that a cyber operation could constitute a use of force where it had 'a very serious financial or economic impact'.95 In contrast, New Zealand has maintained that a cyber operation causing significant loss of functionality to its CI would constitute a violation of the non-intervention principle, as opposed to the use of force.96 As such, there is uncertainty around whether cyber operations that do not cause physical effects can constitute violations of article 2(4).\n## Non-intervention\nA cyber operation against CI that falls below the use of force threshold can potentially constitute a violation of the non-intervention principle. This is a rule of customary international law that prohibits states from using coercive means to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another state as these are matters which states have the right to decide freely by virtue of their sovereignty. A violation of international law based on the non-intervention principle requires two elements. First, there must be coercive interference, and second, it must be directed towards the matters that sovereign states should be able to decide freely.97\n\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 435\nCoercion is not defined in international law. The majority of the Tallinn Manual experts, for example, adopted a narrow approach to the term defining it as ‘an affirmative act designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way.’ They distinguished it from activities that seek to influence (as opposed to factually compel) a state to behave in a particular way such as public criticism or propaganda. Others, however, have defined coercion more broadly as a form of pressure that seeks to deprive the target state of its free will. This view was echoed by the minority of the Tallinn Manual experts who maintained that it is sufficient that the activity ‘has the effect of depriving the State of control over the matter in question.’ This broader approach to coercion is also supported by some states in the cyber context. For example, according to Australia coercion involves ‘effectively deprive[ing] another state of the ability to control, decide upon or govern matters of an inherently sovereign nature.’ Similarly, the German position maintains that coercion involves where a state’s ‘will is manifestly bent by the foreign State’s conduct.’\nThe second element requires that the coercion is directed at matters that states are able to decide freely by virtue of their sovereignty. These include, according to the ICJ, the ‘choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy’. States have also endorsed this view in the cyber context. Australia’s position is that the law requires the coercion to affect ‘matters of an inherently sovereign nature’, according to the UK the coercion must affect ‘matters of government which are at the heart of a state’s sovereignty’, and for New Zealand, coercion must deprive the state from control over ‘matters falling within the scope of its inherently sovereign functions’.\nA number of states have also provided examples of situations in which the non-intervention principle would be violated in the cyber context. Many states, including Australia, the UK, the US\n Schmitt (n 90) 317 citing Robert Y Jennings and Arthur Watts (eds), *Oppenheim’s International Law, Volume 1, Peace* (9ᵗʰ edn Longman 1992) 430–1.\n Schmitt (n 90) 318.\n Moynihan (n 59) 30.\n Schmitt (n 90) 318.\n Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, ‘Australia’s International Cyber Engagement Strategy, 2019 International Law Supplement’ (2019) 5 <https: 2020-11=\"\" 2019%20legal%20supplement_0.pdf=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\" www.internationalcybertech.gov.au=\"\">.\n The Federal Government of Germany (n 89) 5.\n The concept of domaine réservé (reserved domain) is often used to refer to matters within the exclusive domestic jurisdiction of states (see Katja Ziegler, ‘Domaine Réservé’ in *Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law* (Oxford University Press 2013)) and this is sometimes distinguished from the broader state functions that states have the authority to exercise. For example, the Tallinn Manual distinguishes between a state’s ‘inherently governmental functions’ (relevant for a sovereignty violation) from the concept of domaine réservé (relevant to the non-intervention principle). Schmitt (n 90) 24. However, it is argued that the notion of ‘matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely’ (using the ICJ’s wording) is preferred. This is not confined to a state’s internal affairs as it also includes their external affairs (eg membership of international organisations, and decisions to recognise states) which can be subject to coercive interference. Additionally, even if a matter is regulated by international law (and thus it is no longer within a state’s domaine réservé meaning the state no longer has exclusive regulatory authority over the matter), the state still has the authority to make choices within that area of law. As such, the ‘matters that sovereign states are permitted to decide freely’ is a more useful concept opposed to the narrow notion of a state’s domaine réservé.

Australia and the UK also maintain that using cyber means involving coercion to undermine the stability of their financial system would constitute a violation. This is echoed by New Zealand which also maintains that disruptive cyber operations against its healthcare system, electricity network or telecommunications network would, where coercive, constitute violations of the non-intervention principle. Accordingly, cyber operations without physical effects can constitute violations of the non-intervention principle. However, this requires the element of coercion but the identity and intention of the state responsible for a cyber operation can be difficult to determine in the cyber context. This leads to uncertainty around whether cyber operations without physical effects that fall below the use of force threshold constitute violations of the non-intervention principle.\n## Sovereignty\nFinally, cyber operations against CI can also constitute violations of sovereignty. Sovereignty generally refers to a state's supreme authority within its territory, and it involves three interrelated rights and correlating duties in relation to a state's territorial sovereignty, independence and sovereign equality. In relation to territorial sovereignty, usually non-consensual activities within a state's territory, such as flying military aircraft over its airspace without permission, or navigating a vessel through its territorial sea without its consent are prohibited. In the cyber context, while states agree that sovereignty extends to the cyber infrastructure within their territory, there is uncertainty around whether and the threshold at which remotely conducted cyber operations will violate sovereignty. This is a critical question given that international law is largely silent on espionage conducted by states, and this means that states are generally permitted to engage in cyber espionage.\nThis uncertainty about whether and when a cyber operation violates sovereignty arises from the debate about whether or not sovereignty operates as a rule of international law independent of the use of force and non-intervention principles that prohibits certain malicious cyber activities. According to the 'sovereignty as a rule' approach, sovereignty operates as a primary rule of international law that can be violated, and under certain circumstances, remotely conducted cyber operations can amount to violations of sovereignty. The Tallinn Manual advocated for this approach, and a growing number of states have adopted this approach including the Netherlands, France, Austria,\n Finnish Government, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, 'Finland Published Its Positions on Public International Law in Cyberspace' (15 October 2020) <https: en=\"\" full=\"\" valtioneuvosto.fi=\"\" valtioneuvosto.fi=\"\"> / 'finland-published-its-positions-on-public-international-law-in-cyberspace'.\n Wright (n 107); Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy, 2019 International Law Supplement (n 102) 5.\n New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade (n 89).\n Moynihan (n 59) 11.\n See Russell Buchan, Cyber Espionage and International Law (Hart 2019).

Cyber espionage is defined here as the use of cyber means to copy confidential data from computer systems or networks without authorisation. Buchan (n 116) 17–18. However, this does not mean that any form of cyber espionage is permitted. Instead, determining whether cyber espionage violates international law will depend on the techniques involved and the effects caused by the cyber operation. As noted by the Tallinn Manual, the 'mere characterisation of a cyber operation as espionage or not has no legal significance ...

For example, the Netherlands did not define the boundary at which it considers its sovereignty to be violated, and Austria similarly remained silent on this issue. The French position in turn suggests that it considers a cyber operation that merely involves the ‘unauthorized penetration’ of its computer systems to be a violation of its sovereignty. Iran’s position similarly suggests that it would also view any unlawful intrusions into its (public or private) cyber infrastructure as violations of its sovereignty, as well as those that are destructive or disruptive and undermine its national security. In contrast, however, according to New Zealand not ‘every unauthorized intrusion’ into another state’s ICT systems or even all cyber activities that cause effects on another state’s territory constitutes a violation of territorial sovereignty. Here it makes reference to cyber espionage activities and ‘a range of circumstances’ in which even cyber operations that cause effects in the territory of another state will not violate international law. Finland has maintained that a violation of sovereignty will be determined on a case-by-case basis depending on the ‘nature and consequences’ of the unauthorized cyber intrusion. The Czech Republic considers that cyber operations that violate sovereignty include those that cause significant physical damage or harm to individuals and those that damage or disrupt the operation of cyber or other infrastructure where it has a ‘significant impact on national security, economy, public health or environment’. Similarly, according to Germany, a cyber operation that causes ‘physical effects and harm’ in another state’s territory will violate sovereignty, as well as disruptive cyber operations, particularly where they cause ‘substantive secondary or indirect physical effects’ in another state’s territory. As such, while some states agree that, at least cyber operations that cause physical damage or harm to individuals within another state’s territory will violate their\n Czech Republic, ‘Statement by Richard Kadlčák at Open-ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security of the First Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations’ (11 February 2020) <https: 2020=\"\" 20%20international%20law%2011.02.2020.pdf=\"\" cz%20statement%20www.nukib.cz=\"\" download=\"\" publications_en=\"\" www.nukib.cz=\"\">.\n Finnish Government, Ministry for Foreign Affairs (n 112).\n Islamic Republic of Iran, ‘Declaration of General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran Regarding International Law Applicable to the Cyberspace’ NourNews (18 August 2020) <https: 53144=\"\" en=\"\" general-staff-of-iranian-armed-forces-warns-of-tough-reaction-to-any-cyber-threat=\"\" nournews.ir=\"\">.\n New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade (n 89).\n The Federal Government of Germany (n 89) 2.\n Organisation of American States, Inter-American Judicial Committee, ‘International Law and State Cyber Operations’ (1 November 2020) 52 <http: docs=\"\" en=\"\" idc=\"\" international_law_and_state_cyber_operations_publication.pdf=\"\" sla=\"\" iajc=\"\" www.oas.org=\"\">.\n Letter from the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (n 89) 3.\n ‘Comments by Austria, Pre-Draft Report of the OEWG – ICT’ (n 120).\n United Nations Secretary-General (n 119) 22. A similar position has been adopted by some recent academic commentators who argue that cyber operations amount to violations of sovereignty when they penetrate another state’s computers or networks even without physical damage of effects in the territory of the state. For example, Russell Buchan adopts this position and maintains that a violation occurs on the basis of the act of ‘the unauthorised intrusion into a domain protected by state sovereignty’. Buchan (n 116) 54. François Delerue also argues that ‘[i]f a cyber operation penetrates the cyber infrastructures in the territory of a foreign State, this would irrefutably constitute a violation of territorial sovereignty’.

It provides the example where a state takes ‘necessary measures, with minimally destructive effects, to defend against the harmful activity of malicious cyber actors’ in another state.\n Finnish Government, Ministry for Foreign Affairs (n 112).\n Czech Republic (n 121). Another example given is cyber operations that interfere ‘with any data or services which are essential for the exercise of inherently governmental functions, and thereby significantly disrupting the exercise of those functions; for example, distributing ransomware which encrypts the computers used by a government and thus significantly delaying the payment of retirement pensions’.\n The Federal Government of Germany (n 89) 4.</http:></https:></https:>\nSAMULI HAATAJA\nterritorial sovereignty, among other states there is no consensus on whether every unauthorized intrusion violates sovereignty or what degree of effects are required for a violation to occur.^[136]^\nIn contrast to the rule approach to sovereignty, according to the 'sovereignty as a principle' approach, sovereignty is a fundamental principle of international law involving a state's independent right to exercise state functions to the exclusion of others (the internal element), and the recognition of the absolute equality and independence of all states (the external element).^[137]^ However, sovereignty cannot be violated in its own right independent of other rules of international law that are based on it as it does not operate as a standalone primary rule of international law capable of being violated. This approach has been suggested by the US in a 2017 US Department of Defence memorandum (US DoD memo),^[138]^ and the UK has expressly adopted this position.^[139]^\nFrom the sovereignty as a principle approach, given that sovereignty does not operate as a standalone rule of international law, it cannot be violated in itself. Instead, to amount to a violation of international law, a cyber operation needs to constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force or an intervention (ie a violation of existing rules of international law that arise from sovereignty).^[140]^ This means that, under this approach, a range of cyber operations are considered lawful under international law as they are not expressly prohibited. For example, according to the US DoD memo, sovereignty does not limit states from engaging in cyber activities 'that result in effects occurring on the infrastructure located in another State'.^[141]^ Similarly, according to the UK, the non-consensual interference into another state's computer networks is not a violation of their 'territorial sovereignty' because such a rule does not exist in international law in relation to cyber.^[142]^ As such, pursuant to the sovereignty as a principle approach, unauthorized cyber intrusions cannot constitute violations of sovereignty and will only amount to violations of international law where they rise to the threshold of a use of force or intervention and thus violate other existing rules of international law.\nTo summarize, when it comes to states' existing legal obligations most relevant to cyber operations that target or cause effects on another state's CI in peacetime, there is a degree of consensus in some areas but uncertainty in others. There is agreement that cyber operations will violate the prohibition on the use of force where their effects are similar to the use of armed force by kinetic means. However, there is no consensus around the precise threshold or about non-destructive but disruptive cyber operations in this context. The non-intervention principle generally applies to disruptive cyber operations provided they are coercive, however, this can be difficult to determine in the cyber context. Finally, while an increasing number of states have expressed support for the 'sovereignty as a rule' approach, there is no consensus on the threshold\n^[136]^ The Tallinn Manual experts were also divided on this.

This is evident in the subjective nature of what constitutes CI within the scope of norm (f), and the additional specific guidance provided by norm (f) which contradicts some of the harm requirements under international law.\n# Norm (f) and CI\nNorm (f) applies to cyber operations against CI, however, despite that there are core sectors that most states consider to constitute CI, the notion of CI remains subjective. This means that the precise scope of norm (f) is not clearly defined. States have the prerogative to determine which infrastructures to designate as CI, $^{143}$ and, from 'critical information infrastructure' $^{144}$ and 'critical national infrastructure' $^{145}$ to 'national, transnational and supranational critical infrastructure' $^{146}$ — there is little consistency in the terminology adopted by states. The lack of agreement about what constitutes CI for the purposes of norm (f) can be problematic. For instance, election infrastructure in the US was only designated as critical in January 2017 following Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. $^{147}$ Some states have also been hesitant to designate specific sectors as CI due to concerns that this would implicitly condone malicious activities against sectors that are not specified. $^{148}$ The 2021 UN GGE report expressly acknowledges these concerns, noting that, even where a sector is not designated as CI, it does not amount to condoning malicious activities against those sectors. $^{149}$ Furthermore, even where states specify certain sectors as CI, they are not precluded from designating other sectors as such in the future. $^{150}$ There have also been calls to extend norm (f) to mention specific sectors, even if those sectors are already widely considered to be CI. For example, in February 2020 the International Committee of the Red Cross proposed extending the application of norm (f) to address the\n\nSAMULI HAATAJA\n'particular vulnerability of health care facilities' in response to cyber operations against hospitals and vaccine research centres during the pandemic.\nWhile agreement about what sectors constitute CI for the purposes of norm (f) is useful in providing clarity for the scope of the norm, this introduces unnecessary additional complexity to how international law applies in this context. The contested nature of CI and focus on whether a sector is CI for the purposes of norm (f) has the potential to narrow the application of international law only to those sectors that states have agreed to constitute CI. The need for a cyber operation to affect CI also creates an additional requirement that is not evident in existing international law. This is because, irrespective of whether a sector is designated as CI or not, existing international law obligations apply to cyber operations causing effects in the territory of other states. For example, a cyber operation against election infrastructure rising to the level of a violation of sovereignty or intervention will constitute a violation of international law regardless of whether the victim state considers the infrastructure to be CI or not. Similarly, cyber operations against healthcare facilities causing sufficient effects will constitute violations of international law even if those sectors are not specifically mentioned in norm (f). Therefore, the focus on what constitutes CI for the purposes of norm (f), and the subjectivity of the concept of CI has the potential to introduce additional complexity to determining whether a cyber operation violates international law.\n## Norm (f) and uncertainty in international law\nNorm (f) seeks to reaffirm the existing legal obligations of states in relation to cyber operations against CI and provide additional specific guidance on responsible state behaviour in this context. However, the harm requirements within norm (f) are contradictory to those in international law, and this further compounds existing uncertainties in how the law applies to cyber operations targeting CI. As a result, there are a range of cyber operations that can constitute violations of international law but not norm (f), or vice versa.\nFor example, whether a cyber operation against CI constitutes a use of force will generally be determined based on its 'scale and effects'. Under this approach, there must be a degree of direct physical damage to the CI, or disruption of its functionality which causes damage or harm to individuals comparable to a use of force by kinetic means. The Stuxnet incident is generally considered to have crossed this threshold as it is reported to have caused damage to approximately 1000 centrifuge machines. Assuming Stuxnet was attributable to a state, its use would have violated norm (f) as it caused intentional damage to CI and was contrary to the responsible state's international obligations. However, a disruptive cyber operation with only adverse economic consequences would generally not constitute a use of force. This could include, for example, a cyber operation against a power grid that causes a temporary blackout without any indirect physical effects or harm to individuals. While a cyber operation of this kind would involve impairing the use of the CI and adversely impact its use for the public for the purposes of norm (f), it would unlikely violate a state's legal obligations under article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n International Committee of the Red Cross, 'Norms for Responsible State Behavior on Cyber Operations should Build on International Law' (11 February 2020) <https: document=\"\" en=\"\" norms-responsible-state-behavior-cyber-operations-should-build-international-law=\"\" www.icrc.org=\"\">. While norm (f) was not amended, the 2021 UN GGE report did specifically note how '[t]he COVID-19 pandemic heightened awareness of the critical importance of protecting health care and medical infrastructure and facilities, including through the implementation of the norms addressing critical infrastructure'. UN GGE 2021 report (n 150) 12.\n See Milanovic and Schmitt (n 8).\n Haataja (n 93) 88–95.\n See also Broeders and others (n 60) 4–7.</https:>\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 441\nFor a cyber operation of this kind without direct physical effects to violate the non-intervention principle, there is a requirement that the operation was intended to be coercive and directed at matters states have the right to decide freely. For example, where a cyber operation causing a blackout was done with the intention of coercing the targeted state to reverse its policy of recognition of another state, this would constitute an unlawful intervention. But where the cyber operation does not involve the element of coercion directed at matters states should be freely able to decide (or the responsible state's intention is unknown), then the cyber operation would fall outside the scope of the non-intervention principle. This is despite the impairment of CI and its adverse impact on the public that is consistent with the harm requirement in norm (f). Whether a cyber operation of this kind violates sovereignty is also unsettled given the divergence in views among states on the issue.\nIn relation to cyber operations against CI and violations of sovereignty, consider, for example, where a state obtains unauthorised access to another state's power grid, election infrastructure or hospital systems and installs malware that gives it the ability to cause disruptive or destructive effects on that infrastructure at a later point in time. Whether a cyber operation of this kind violates sovereignty is unsettled as the precise boundaries of states' legal obligations in this context are still developing and evolving as more state practice emerges. According to France and Iran, which adopt the rule approach to sovereignty and consider any penetration of their networks to be a violation of sovereignty, this conduct would constitute a violation of international law at the point in time at which there is unauthorized access to their systems.[155] However, for states like the Czech Republic and New Zealand, merely obtaining unauthorised access or installing malware that does not impair the functioning of the systems would not constitute violations of sovereignty.[156] Instead, for these states, it is only at the point in time at which that malware is used to cause significant disruptive or destructive effects that the cyber operation would qualify as a violation of sovereignty. Similarly, for states like the UK adopting the principle approach to sovereignty, the cyber operation could not constitute a violation of international law unless and until it rises to the level of a use of force or involves coercion and violates the non-intervention principle.[157] Accordingly, a range of cyber operations that meet the harm requirements in norm (f) would fall outside of its scope because, given the uncertainty around how international law applies in this context, it would be unclear whether those operations also violate the law as required by norm (f).\nFurther compounding the uncertainty in how existing international law applies are the harm requirements of norm (f) that are not consistent with international law. Norm (f) requires 'intentional damage', but the intent is not a requisite element for most of the rules of international law outlined above. In relation to the prohibition on the use of force, there is no requirement for intention.[158] Instead, the approach adopted by most states and in the Tallinn Manual focuses on the 'scale and effects' of a cyber operation.[159] Similarly, intention is not a requirement for a violation of sovereignty.[160] While intention is an element of the non-intervention principle,[161] the focus of the law here is on the intention of the state applying the coercion and not\n\nSAMULI HAATAJA\nwhether the particular technical effects – such as damage to CI – were intended or not. This means that there is no need for ‘intentional damage’ to be caused by a cyber operation for the non-intervention principle to be violated. Norm (f), however, specifically refers to intentional damage. As a result, where a state engages in a cyber operation against CI that causes unintentional damage to the CI, the activity could constitute a violation of sovereignty or a use of force but would fall outside the scope of the intentional damage contemplated by norm (f).\nThe approach to impairment evident in norm (f) is useful in terms of the specificity of the requirement for an (even minimally) adverse impact on services provided to the public by the CI. This encompasses a very broad spectrum of cyber operations against CI, including disruptive cyber operations that may fall outside the scope of the prohibition on the use of force and the non-intervention principle. However, unless these cyber operations cause sufficient effects to constitute a use of force, or are accompanied by coercive intention and satisfy the non-intervention principle, they would fall outside the scope of existing international law and also outside of norm (f). As such, while the ‘additional specific guidance’ that norm (f) provides in its approach to impairment is useful given the broad spectrum of cyber operations against CI that it captures, there is uncertainty about whether most of such cyber operations would constitute violations of international law as required under norm (f).\nFinally, when considering low-level cyber operations used to pre-position or prepare for potentially destructive cyber operations against CI in peacetime, what is revealed is the dark side of norm (f) and existing international law in this context. Given that these kinds of cyber operations do not cause immediate damage or impairment and, from a technical perspective, can be indistinguishable from cyber espionage, they are effectively permitted under existing international law and generally will not be seen to constitute violations of sovereignty. But much of CI is dual-use and this means that under certain conditions it can be lawfully subject to attack through cyber means in an armed conflict. Essentially, except in circumstances where there is evidence of an imminent armed attack, norm (f) and existing international law allow states to engage in cyber operations against CI that involve pre-positioning and preparing for potentially destructive effects in the future.\nTherefore, norm (f) introduces additional complexity to the application of international law in this context, and this complexity is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are considered to be ‘off limits’. The subjective nature of what constitutes CI and the requirement for a sector to be CI to be captured by norm (f) creates a requirement that is not evident in international law and effectively narrows its application.\n However, where a cyber operation of this kind also has an adverse impact on the public then it would constitute impairment under the second type of harm within norm (f). This could amount to a violation of international law on sovereignty, but this is uncertain given the current debate about sovereignty.\n The norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace only operate in peacetime.

See also Broeders and others (n 60).\n For example, according to Australia, states may exercise a right of anticipatory self-defence where ‘a threatened armed attack in the form of an offensive cyber operation’ that could be launched ‘in a split second’ and could cause ‘large-scale loss of human life and damage to critical infrastructure’.

Similarly, according to NATO’s Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations, non-destructive cyber operations, such as those causing temporary disruptions of service or involving information gathering where they are conducted to enable a conventional threat – including an imminent threat of one – could be considered to trigger the right of self-defence.

David Fidler, for example, suggests a new cyber-defence norm adopting an ‘all hazards’ strategy to protect CI that does not focus on the legal regime (whether cyber crime or espionage) but instead on ensuring ‘networks are protected against infiltrations from any source’.

While there is a degree of uncertainty around the thresholds at which violations of international law on the use of force, intervention and sovereignty occur, the harm requirements in norm (f) have the potential to compound these uncertainties as they are not consistent with these rules of international law.\nAccordingly, more clarity about the relationship between international law and norm (f) is needed, and about how international law applies to cyber operations targeting sectors that states have deemed to be CI. This is particularly the case in relation to international law on sovereignty. Especially where low-level cyber operations without immediately disruptive or destructive effects are involved, more states need to provide detailed accounts of when they consider the law to be violated and the relationship between sovereignty and sectors they consider to be CI. While a state's domestic legislation – like the Australian NSLA – may criminalise various activities such as the installation of malware onto CI on a national level, states should also expressly outline how they regard these activities on an international level. Here the approach to impairment in norm (f) can serve as useful guidance on when a cyber operation should violate sovereignty. Similarly, the fact that CI is targeted can serve as an indicia of a violation of sovereignty. For example, this is the approach that Germany has adopted making an explicit connection between cyber operations against its CI and violations of its sovereignty. In relation to low-level cyber operations, such as those involving the installation of malware enabling a persistent presence on CI that is generally accepted as a permissible form of espionage, these should be seen as potential violations of sovereignty given the purpose for which they are conducted. As such, while clarity around when cyber operations violate sovereignty and the relevance of a sector's designation as CI is needed, international law applies to cyber operations by states irrespective of norm (f) which introduces counterproductive complexity to the legal analysis in this context.\n# CONCLUSION\nThis article examined the norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace and international law prohibiting malicious cyber operations against CI. It demonstrated that norm (f), which prohibits cyber operations that damage or impair CI, introduces complexity to the application of international law that is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are prohibited by international law. This is due to the subjective nature of CI, the contradictory legal status of norm (f), and the ways in which the harm requirements of norm (f) compound existing uncertainties about how international law applies to cyber operations where CI is targeted. To develop clarity about what cyber operations against CI should be 'off limits', more states need to outline their positions on the threshold at which they consider the law to be violated – especially in relation to sovereignty – to ensure that malicious low-level cyber operations, in particular, do not fall outside of these legal constraints.\n This has been recently recognized in the UN OEWG 2021 report where it was noted that a cyber operation contrary to international law that 'intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public, could pose a threat not only to security but also to State sovereignty'. See UN OEWG 2021 report (n 48) 4.\n According to Germany, where a cyber operation targets a state's CI it 'may indicate that a State's territorial sovereignty has been violated'. However, given, among other things, the lack of international agreement of what constitutes CI, Germany maintained that this in and of itself cannot constitute the basis for a violation. The Federal Government of Germany (n 89) 4.\n For example, Asaf Lubin maintains that cyber espionage should be unlawful where the purpose for which it is conducted is unlawful. Asaf Lubin, 'The Liberty to Spy' (2020) 61(1) HILJ 185, 238–9. Other academics have also expressed support for adopting a purpose approach in determining the lawfulness of cyber espionage.

It argues that norm (f) introduces complexity to the application of the law in this context that is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are prohibited by international law.

Section two considers what constitutes CI and the threat posed by malicious cyber operations against CI. Section three examines the norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace with a focus on norm (f) which prohibits states from conducting cyber operations that cause intentional damage or impairment to the operation of CI in other states. This section outlines the debate about the legal status of norm (f) and demonstrates its contradictory legal status. Section four then examines how states' existing international law obligations are considered to apply to cyber operations causing effects on another state's CI. The focus is on international law on the use of force, non-intervention, and sovereignty. This section demonstrates that there continues to be a degree of uncertainty about when cyber operations against CI violate international law, particularly those falling below the use of force threshold. Section five examines the implications of norm (f) for international law in this context. It demonstrates how norm (f) introduces complexity to the legal analysis which is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are prohibited by international law. Section six provides a conclusion.\n# CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND CYBER OPERATIONS\nIn June 2020, the Australian Government revealed that it had been subject to a campaign of cyber attacks targeting its federal- and state-level governments, various companies and CI. Given the scale and nature of the operations, Australia maintained a foreign state actor was responsible, however, it stopped short of publicly attributing the operations to a specific state. Despite this, some have suggested China was responsible. The cyber operations are understood to have involved compromising the computer systems and networks of the various organisations that were targeted through vulnerabilities in their software. However, despite the media attention Australia's revelation of the incident received, the cyber operations did not cause any effects, such as disrupting the operation of the compromised organisations. Instead, according to the Australian Cyber Security Centre, there was no evidence of 'intent by the actor to carry out any disruptive or destructive activities within victim environments'.\nThere is growing concern about the threat posed by low-level cyber operations that do not necessarily result in immediate disruptive or destructive effects but are nonetheless significant in their scale or have the potential to be used in preparation for more harmful operations. For example, the Australian Department of Defence has specifically highlighted the threat posed by 'all kinds of preparation, pre-positioning, [and] collection of intelligence' activities in the cyber context. This was echoed by the Director General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation who expressed concerns about 'the potential for Australia's adversaries to pre-position malicious code in critical infrastructure ...

These concerns have been exacerbated by reports about malicious cyber operations conducted against hospitals and vaccine research centres during the pandemic in 2020,⁸ as well as ransomware crippling the operation of Colonial Pipeline in 2021 in the US.⁹\nIn light of these concerns, states have highlighted the need for international agreement that certain CI should be ‘off limits’ from malicious cyber activities. In 2015, for example, Australia’s then Foreign Minister Julie Bishop maintained that:\nThe effective functioning of critical infrastructure underpins the global economy. States should prevent and refrain from online activity which damages or impairs critical infrastructure, whether it be in banking, telecos, energy structures. While states define their critical infrastructure sectors differently and harmonisation is important, agreeing that key sectors should be off limits is a priority for the international community.¹⁰\nAnd in 2021, following the Colonial Pipeline incident, US President Joe Biden told Russia’s President Vladimir Putin that ‘certain critical infrastructure should be “off limits” to attack’, and provided Russia with a list of 16 sectors the US considers CI.¹¹\nIn Australia, as part of the effort to counter the broader threat posed by malicious cyber activities by foreign actors, the ‘National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Act 2018’ (NSLA) was recently passed into law. The NSLA was primarily introduced to address the threat of foreign interference in its political processes,¹² but it also contains provisions relating to foreign cyber activities against Australia’s CI. These include a range of new sabotage offences designed to ‘criminalise conduct causing damage to a broad range of critical infrastructure where it could prejudice Australia’s national security’.¹³ For example, under the NSLA it is a criminal offence to engage in conduct that results in damage to Australia’s infrastructure where this is done on behalf of a foreign actor and it undermines Australia’s national\n⁶ Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, ASIO Annual Report 2020-21 (2021) 5 <https: annual%20report%202020-21%20web.pdf=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\" www.asio.gov.au=\"\">.\n⁷ The White House, ‘National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America’ (September 2018) 3 <https: 09=\"\" 2018=\"\" annual%20report%202020-21%20web.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" national-cyber-strategy.pdf=\"\" uploads=\"\" wp-content=\"\" www.wytimes.com=\"\">.\n⁸ See Marko Milanovic and Michael Schmitt, ‘Cyber Attacks and Cyber (Mis)information Operations During a Pandemic’ (2020) 11 JNSLP 247.\n⁹ David Sanger, Clifford Krauss, and Nicole Perlroth, ‘Cyberattack Forces a Shutdown of a Top U.S. Pipeline’ The New York Times (8 May 2021) <https: 05=\"\" 2021=\"\" 09=\"\" a=\"\" cw=\"\" cw-weights=\"\" for=\"\" hyperattack-colonial-pipeline.html=\"\" upolitics=\"\" us=\"\" politics=\"\" paucities=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n¹⁰ Julie Bishop, ‘Statement for Plenary Session on International Peace and Security, Global Conference on Cyberspace’ Minister for Foreign Affairs The Hon Julie Bishop MP (17 April 2015) <https: 05=\"\" 2021-06-16=\"\" 2021=\"\" julie-bishop=\"\" minister=\"\" minister.julie-bishop=\"\" speech=\"\" www.foreignminister.gov.au=\"\">.\n¹¹ Vladimir Soldatkin and Humeyra Pamuk, ‘Biden Tells Putin Certain Cyberattacks should be “Off-limits”’ Reuters (17 June 2021) <https: biden-tells-putin-certain-cyber-attacks-should-be-off-limits-2021-06-16=\"\" technology=\"\" www.reuters.com=\"\">.\n¹² See Henry Belot, ‘Malcolm Turnbull Announces Biggest Overhaul of Espionage, Intelligence Laws in Decades’ ABC News (5 December 2017) <https: 2017-12-05=\"\" news=\"\" turnbull-announces-foreign-interference-laws=\"\" www.abc.net.au=\"\">; Louise Yaxley, ‘Sam Dastyari and the Murky Links with Chinese Businessmen that Ended his Political Career’ ABC News (12 December 2017) <http: 2017-12-12=\"\" 9249216=\"\" am-dastyari-murky-links-with-chinese-businessmen-ended-career=\"\" news=\"\" www.abc.net.au=\"\">.\n¹³ National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Act 2018 (Cth) (NSLA Act) sch 1 pt 1 div 82–Sabotage; Revised Explanatory Memorandum, National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017 (Cth) 62 .</http:></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:>\nSAMULI HAATAJA\nsecurity.¹⁴ Similarly, it is a criminal offence to introduce vulnerabilities – such as the installation of malicious software (malware) or creation of backdoors – onto public infrastructure where this is done to undermine Australia's national security.¹⁵ As such, the NSLA includes offences that specifically apply to activities involved in the preparation of potential future intrusions into, for example, Australian government networks and systems.¹⁶ However, while Australia has legislated to protect CI from foreign cyber activities on a domestic level, international agreement around what activities or sectors are to be ‘off limits’ is necessary to ensure the protection of CI from state-sponsored cyber threats.\n## Definitions of critical infrastructure\nPart of the problem around what activities or sectors should be ‘off limits’ revolves around differences in what constitutes CI among states. As highlighted by Australia’s former foreign minister above, there is no universal definition of CI and states in fact have the ability to designate any infrastructure asset as CI. Generally, CI includes various infrastructures such as those related to energy, health and transportation, and many of these infrastructures are dual-use. In Australia, for example, CI is defined as referring to the\nphysical facilities, supply chains, information technologies and communication networks which, if destroyed, degraded or rendered unavailable for an extended period, would significantly impact on the social or economic wellbeing of the nation or affect Australia’s ability to conduct national defence and ensure national security.¹⁷\nIn Australia, CI thus ‘provides services that are essential for everyday life such as energy, communications, water, transport, health, food and grocery, banking and finance and the Australian Government’.¹⁸\nThe United Kingdom (UK) in turn adopts the term ‘critical national infrastructure’ and this refers to the ‘critical elements of infrastructure (namely, assets, facilities, systems, networks or processes and the essential workers that operate and facilitate them)’ where the loss or compromise of those elements would result in a ‘major detrimental impact on the availability, integrity or delivery of essential services’ and/or a ‘significant impact on national security, national defence or the functioning of the state’.¹⁹\nIn the US, CI refers to ‘systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the US that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety or any combination of those matters’.²⁰ The ‘critical infrastructure sectors’, as identified by the recently established US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, include 16 sectors across energy, commerce, finance, food and agriculture, healthcare, emergency services, water, waste, transportation and defence.²¹\nIn the European Union (EU), CI refers to\n¹⁴ NSLA Act (n 13) ss 82.3, 82.4.\n¹⁵ See NSLA Act (n 13) ss 82.7, 82.8.\n¹⁶ Revised NSLA Explanatory Memorandum (n 13) 80 .\n¹⁷ Commonwealth of Australia, Critical Infrastructure Resilience Strategy: Policy Statement (2015) 8 <https: criticalinfrastructureresiliencestrategypolicystatement.pdf=\"\" site%20documents=\"\" www.tisn.gov.au=\"\">.\n¹⁸ Australian Government, ‘What is the Critical Infrastructure Centre?’ Critical Infrastructure Centre <https: ctc-factsheet-what-is-critical-infrastructure-centre.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" nat-security=\"\" www.homeaffairs.gov.au=\"\">.\n¹⁹ Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure, ‘Critical National Infrastructure’ (2020) <https: critical-national-infrastructure-0=\"\" www.cpni.gov.uk=\"\">.\n²⁰ USA Patriot Act of 2001, 42 USC §§5195c(e), 1016(e).\n²¹ United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, ‘Critical Infrastructure Sectors’ (24 March 2020) <https: critical-infrastructure-sectors=\"\" www.cisa.gov=\"\">.</https:></https:></https:></https:>\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 417\nan asset, system or part thereof located in Member States which is essential for the maintenance of vital societal functions, health, safety, security, economic or social well-being of people, and the disruption or destruction of which would have a significant impact in a Member State as a result of the failure to maintain those functions.²²\nThis essentially refers to the physical infrastructure which is vital for the proper functioning of society. The EU uses the term ‘critical information infrastructure’ (CII) to describe both the essential information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructures and those that are essential for the operation of its physical CI.²³\nAt the United Nations (UN) level, states have noted in a General Assembly resolution on the ‘creation of a global culture of cybersecurity and the protection of critical information infrastructures’ that CI involves, among other things, the infrastructures used for ‘the generation, transmission and distribution of energy, air and maritime transport, banking and financial services, e-commerce, water supply, food distribution and public health’ and that these infrastructures are increasingly interconnected with CII.²⁴ But here too it is recognized that each state has the right to determine what constitutes its CI.²⁵\nAccordingly, in the Australian, UK, US, EU and UN contexts, CI refers to infrastructures essential to the proper functioning and well-being of the state and society. The term encompasses physical infrastructures (such as power plants and hospitals) located within a state’s territory, as well as the virtual infrastructure allowing the physical components to operate. Generally, this infrastructure is critical where its disruption or destruction would have a detrimental impact (whether significant, major, debilitating and so on) on the provision of key services that relate to the social or economic well-being of the state or its national security. However, states also have the prerogative to designate any infrastructure assets or sectors as critical. For example, the above UK definition includes the human personnel required to operate CI, and in Australia, the relevant government minister has the power to designate any asset as critical.²⁶ As such, while there are core sectors that most states consider to constitute CI, the scope of what constitutes CI is subjective as evident in the differences in terminology and approaches that states adopt in determining this. Consequently, when considering relevant laws and norms surrounding CI protection, there is uncertainty about the specific infrastructures against which malicious cyber activities are prohibited.\n## Cyber operations against critical infrastructure\nIn addition to the 2020 cyber attacks against Australia, there are various other examples of known incidents differing in kind and intensity from low-level information collection operations to more disruptive and even destructive attacks against states’ CI. For example, in 2010 the infamous Stuxnet malware was discovered which had infected an Iranian uranium enrichment facility and, by changing the settings according to which the centrifuge machines operated, caused physical damage to approximately 1000 centrifuges.²⁷ Similarly, in a non-destructive but highly disruptive attack, in December 2015 parts of Ukraine’s power grid were shut down for\n²² Council Directive 2008/114/EC of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection  OJ L 345/75 art 2.\n²³ Commission of the European Communities, ‘Green Paper on a European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection’ (COM/2005/576 final, 17 November 2005) 19.\n²⁴ United Nations General Assembly, UNGA Res 58/199 (23 December 2003) UN Doc A/RES/58/199, 1.\n²⁵ Ibid.\n²⁶ See ss 50 and 51 of the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 (Cth).\n²⁷ Joby Warrick, ‘Iran’s Natanz Nuclear Facility Recovered Quickly from Stuxnet Cyberattack’ The Washington Post (16 February 2011) <http: 02=\"\" 15=\"\" 2011=\"\" ar2011021505395.html=\"\" content=\"\" article=\"\" wp-dyn=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\">.

These operations can be used to gather information that can potentially be used in preparation for more disruptive future operations.³⁰ As an example, in 2018 the US Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation released a report on Russian cyber activities targeting its energy and other CI sectors.³¹ According to this report, Russian actors had since at least 2016 ‘targeted government entities and multiple US critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy, nuclear, commercial facilities, water, aviation and critical manufacturing sectors’.³² This was characterized by these agencies ‘as a multi-stage intrusion campaign by Russian government cyber actors’ in which these actors obtained unauthorized access to various networks and installed malware allowing them to conduct reconnaissance and collect information about industrial control systems.³³ Similarly, in 2019 it was reported that the US had moved beyond mere reconnaissance operations into Russia’s power grid to the placement of malware onto those systems that could be used to disrupt its operation.³⁴ Furthermore, in December 2020, it was reported that Russia had, through software provided by the company SolarWinds, compromised a range of US government agencies³⁵ and companies responsible for CI in the electricity, oil and manufacturing industries.³⁶ While the SolarWinds incident is mainly understood to have compromised data in the affected sectors, Anne Neuberger, the US Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology, expressed concerns that Russia’s ability to access these systems has the potential to be used for disruptive operations in the future.³⁷ And in January 2022, during increased tensions between the US and Russia in the lead-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the US Cybersecurity Advisory issued an advisory encouraging the US cybersecurity community and especially CI operators ‘to adopt a heightened state of awareness’ given the threat posed by Russian-state-sponsored cyber operations against US CI.³⁸ Accordingly, states like the US and Russia are using malicious cyber operations to obtain unauthorized access and maintaining a ‘persistent presence’ in other states’ CI systems. The concern is that these preparatory cyber operations can be used to damage or disrupt the operation of CI in the future.\n²⁸ See Kim Zetter, ‘Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid’ Wired (3 March 2016) <https: 03=\"\" 2016=\"\" 03=\"\" inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\">.\n²⁹ David Sanger, ‘Utilities Cautioned about Potential for a Cyberattack’ The New York Times (29 February 2016) <https: 03=\"\" 2016=\"\" 00=\"\" http:=\"\" us=\"\" politics=\"\" politics.cautioned-about-potential-for-a-cyberattack-after-ukraines.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n³⁰ See Symantec Critical Attack Discovery and Intelligence Team, ‘Dragonfly: Western Energy Sector Targeted by Sophisticated Attack Group’ Symantec Threat Intelligence (20 October 2017) <https: dragonfly-energy-sector-cyber-attacks=\"\" blogs=\"\" symantec-blogs.broadcom.com=\"\">.\n³¹ United States Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation, ‘Russian Government Cyber Activity Targeting Energy and Other Critical Infrastructure Sectors’ (Technical Alert TA18-074A, 15 March 2018) <https: alerts=\"\" a18-074a=\"\" ncas=\"\" ta18-074a=\"\" www.us-cert.gov=\"\">.\n³² Ibid.\n³³ Ibid.\n³⁴ David Sanger and Nicole Perlroth, ‘U.S. Escalates Online Attacks on Russia’s Power Grid’ The New York Times (15 June 2019) <https: 06=\"\" 15=\"\" 2019=\"\" us=\"\" politics=\"\" prurip-cyber-russia-grid.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n³⁵ David Sanger, ‘Russian Hackers Broke into Federal Agencies, U.S. Officials Suspect’ The New York Times (13 December 2020) <https: 12=\"\" 2020=\"\" 22=\"\" 2020=\"\" politics=\"\" russian-hackers-us-government-treasury-commerce.html?=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n³⁶ Kim Zetter, ‘SolarWinds Hack Infected Critical Infrastructure, including Power Industry’ The Intercept (25 December 2020) <https: 02=\"\" 2020=\"\" 22=\"\" 24=\"\" solarwinds-hack-power-infrastructure=\"\" theintercept.com=\"\">.\n³⁷ David Sanger, ‘After Russian Cyberattack, Looking for Answers and Debating Retaliation’ The New York Times (23 February 2021) <https: 02=\"\" 2021=\"\" 23=\"\" polities=\"\" solarwinds-hack-senate-intelligence-russia.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n³⁸ Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, ‘Understanding and Mitigating Russian State Sponsored Cyber Threats to U.S. Critical Infrastructure’ (11 January 2022) 1 <https: 02=\"\" 2022=\"\" 23=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" publications=\"\" us=\"\" uscert=\"\" sites=\"\" www.cisa.gov=\"\" uscert=\"\" publications=\"\" uscertisites=\"\"></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:>\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 419\nThis concern crystallized during the war in Ukraine in 2022 which involved a range of cyber operations and activities that Russia had pre-positioned for.³⁹\n# NORMS OF RESPONSIBLE STATE BEHAVIOUR IN CYBERSPACE\nThe international security issues surrounding states' use of digital technologies and activities in cyberspace have been considered at the UN level since the late 1990s, and in this context, states have agreed to norms around responsible behaviour in cyberspace including around CI protection. Since 1998, the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) of the UN General Assembly has regularly considered 'Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security'.⁴⁰ In 2004 it established a Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) to examine existing and potential threats from cyberspace.⁴¹ A second GGE was established in 2009 and it issued a consensus report in 2010⁴² which highlighted the risk of how '[t]he growing use of ICTs in critical infrastructures creates new vulnerabilities and opportunities for disruption'.⁴³ It also recommended that states should engage in further dialogue 'to discuss norms pertaining to State use of ICTs, to reduce collective risk and protect critical national and international infrastructure'.⁴⁴ This was echoed in the 2013 report from the third GGE which also, for the first time, confirmed the general application of international law and UN Charter principles in the cyber context.⁴⁵\nThe 2015 report by the fourth GGE was significant as it introduced a set of norms for responsible state behaviour in their use of ICTs.⁴⁶ The UN General Assembly also passed resolutions in 2018 and 2019 on 'Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security' where it called on states to be guided by the UN GGE reports and these norms in their use of ICTs.⁴⁷ This was echoed in the 2021 consensus report of the UN Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security in which states emphasized the importance of these norms.⁴⁸\nFrom these norms, three are particularly relevant to CI protection. Norm (g) provides that states should take appropriate measures to protect their own CI, and norm (h) provides that states should mitigate malicious cyber activities emanating from their territory that are directed against the CI of other states.⁴⁹ Of most relevance to malicious cyber operations against CI, however, is norm (f). It provides that:\n³⁹ Microsoft, 'Special Report: Ukraine' (27 April 2022) § <https: am=\"\" app=\"\" am=\"\" binary=\"\" re4vwwd=\"\" query.prod.cms=\"\" re4vwwd=\"\" www.cms=\"\">.\n⁴⁰ United Nations General Assembly, Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, GA Res 53/70, UN Doc A/RES/53/70 (4 January 1999).\n⁴¹ United Nations Secretary-General, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security: Report of the Secretary-General, UN Doc A/60/202 (5 August 2005).\n⁴² United Nations Secretary-General, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security: Note by the Secretary-General, UN Doc A/65/201 (30 July 2010).\n⁴³ Ibid 7.\n⁴⁴ Ibid 8.\n⁴⁵ United Nations Secretary-General, Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/68/98 (24 June 2013) 2.\n⁴⁶ United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/70/174 (22 July 2015) 8.\n⁴⁷ See United Nations General Assembly, Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/RES/73/266 (2 January 2019); United Nations General Assembly, Advancing Responsible State Behaviours in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/RES/74/28 (18 December 2019).\n⁴⁸ United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, 'Final Substantive Report' (10 March 2021) 4–5 <https: 03=\"\" 2021=\"\" front.un-arm.org=\"\" uploads=\"\" wp-content=\"\" wpr2.pdf=\"\" uploads=\"\">.\n⁴⁹ See Michael Berk, 'Recommendation 13(g) and (h)' in United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (ed), Voluntary, Non-Binding Norms for Responsible State Behaviour in the Use of Information and Communications Technology: A Commentary (United Nations Publication 2017).</https:></https:>\nSAMULI HAATAJA\nA State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity contrary to its obligations under international law that intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public.⁵⁰\nPrima facie, norm (f) specifically prohibits cyber operations against the CI of other states. According to the commentary to the norms, it reflects consensus about the unique importance of CI to modern societies and a recognition of the possibility of conflicts to escalate where state-to-state cyber activities adversely impact CI in particular.⁵¹ However, despite this apparent consensus, there is debate about the legal status of norm (f) and its relationship to international law. In particular, it is unclear whether it seeks to create new non-binding expectations of responsible state behaviour or to reaffirm the application of existing binding rules of international law.\nThis lack of clarity arises because norm (f) is explicitly included as a 'voluntary, non-binding' norm in the 2015 UN GGE report, and all of the norms are located in a separate section to the question of how international law applies to ICT activities.⁵² Yet the wording of norm (f) expressly refers to a state's 'obligations under international law' – that is, binding, opposed to voluntary and non-binding obligations – resulting in what others have described as a 'contradiction in terms'.⁵³ The confusion about the legal status of norm (f) is also evident among states who generally regard the norms as conceptually distinct from international law.⁵⁴ For example, Australia, in its 2017 'Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy', expresses a commitment to these norms and notes that international law can be complemented with these norms, but treats the two as distinct.⁵⁵ The US has also expressed a commitment to the promotion of these norms but regards them as conceptually distinct from international law. This is evident in the US Cyber Strategy which includes as one of its pillars the preservation of peace through strength,⁵⁶ and the means of doing so is through the promotion of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace based on international law on one hand, and 'voluntary non-binding norms' on the other.⁵⁷ Similarly, the ASEAN-EU Statement on Cybersecurity Cooperation distinguishes between the application of international law in the cyber context and, separately, acknowledges 'that voluntary and non-binding norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour of States in the use of ICTs can reduce risks to international peace, security and stability'.⁵⁸ The distinction between the non-binding norms and binding international law obligations is also evident in academic commentary. For example, according to Harriet Moynihan, norm (f) 'does not represent a binding obligation on states' and merely demonstrates 'their concern to protect\n⁵⁰ UN GGE 2015 report (n 46) 8.\n⁵¹ Jason Jolley, 'Recommendation 13 (f)' in United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (ed) Voluntary, Non-Binding Norms for Responsible State Behaviour in the Use of Information and Communications Technology: A Commentary (United Nations Publication 2017) 169–70.\n⁵² UN GGE 2015 report (n 46) 7.\n⁵³ Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco, and Talita de Souza Dias, 'Drawing the Cyber Baseline: The Applicability of Existing International Law to the Governance of Information and Communication Technologies' (2022) 99 ILS 4, 32.\n⁵⁴ Liisi Adamson, 'International Law and International Cyber Norms: A Continuum?' in Dennis Broeders and Bibi van den Berg (eds) Governing Cyberspace: Behavior, Power, and Diplomacy (Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2020) 25, 33.\n⁵⁵ Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 'Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy' (October 2017) 47–8 <https: 2020-11=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" the%20strategy.pdf=\"\" www.internationalcybertech.gov.au=\"\" sites=\"\">; Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 2019 Progress Report, Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy (2019).\n⁵⁶ The White House (7) 20.\n⁵⁷ Ibid.\n⁵⁸ Association of South East Asian Nations, 'ASEAN-EU Statement on Cybersecurity Cooperation' Association of South East Asian Nations (August 2019) – <https: 08=\"\" 2019=\"\" asean.org=\"\" asean-eu-statement-on-cybersecurity-cooperation-final.pdf=\"\" storage=\"\">.</https:></https:>\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE\n431\ncritical infrastructure from cyber attacks.⁵⁹ Similarly, Dennis Broeders and others note how 'these norms are not legally binding'⁶⁰ but voluntary and distinct from international law obligations. Accordingly, states have agreed to norm (f) which prohibits cyber operations against CI. However, norm (f) is expressly included as a voluntary and non-binding norm in the UN GGE reports, and the norms generally are regarded as conceptually distinct from legally binding obligations under international law.\nThe commentary to the norms, published by the UN Office for Disarmament Affairs,⁶¹ elaborates on key elements of norm (f) including its relationship with international law.⁶² Here it is noted that it is unclear 'why the [UN Group of Governmental] Experts have offered as voluntary something that by the majority of states is considered legally binding'.⁶³ The commentary explains that norm (f) is premised on the law of state responsibility and was intended to reaffirm that states' existing legal obligations extend to their cyber activities.⁶⁴ This is evident, for example, from the phrase 'conduct[s] or knowingly support[s]' within the wording of norm (f) which encompasses relevant rules of attribution of conduct under international law on state responsibility.⁶⁵ The phrase 'contrary to its obligations' in turn refers to states' existing obligations under international law and includes, for example, the prohibition on the use of force and relevant international humanitarian law obligations.⁶⁶ Therefore, according to the commentary, despite being expressly included as a voluntary and non-binding norm, norm (f) was intended to reaffirm states' existing legal obligations in relation to CI.⁶⁷\nAccordingly, the precise legal status of norm (f) is unclear and others have raised concerns about the implications of this. Writing in relation to the cyber norms generally, Kubo Mačák highlights how 'non-binding norms can never override binding legal rules' and, in the reverse, that 'a non-binding norm cannot permit action that would otherwise be forbidden by international law'.⁶⁸ He maintains that the distinction is important as only a violation of international law can trigger obligations of cessation and reparation under the law on state responsibility.⁶⁹ François Delerue, Frédérick Douzet and Aude Géry in turn maintain that the distinction between international law and norms 'complexifies the definition of rights and obligations for the states in cyberspace as it introduces a confusion on the nature of the rules'.⁷⁰ They argue that by separating the two, the potential implication is that the norm is autonomous and detached from international law and that state behaviour in cyberspace is based only on the goodwill of states and not legal obligations.⁷¹ Similarly, Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco and Talita de Souza Dias argue that the inclusion of norm (f) as a voluntary, non-binding norm by the UN GGE can\n⁵⁹ Harriet Moynihan, 'The Application of International Law to State Cyberattacks Sovereignty and Non-intervention' (Chatham House Research Paper 2019) 44 <https: 12=\"\" 2019=\"\" application-international-law-state-cyberattacks=\"\" www.chathamhouse.org=\"\">.\n⁶⁰ Dennis Broeders, Els de Busser, Fabio Cristiano, and Tatiana Tropina, 'Revisiting Past Cyber Operations in Light of New Cyber Norms and Interpretations of International Law: Inching towards Lines in the Sand?'

The 2021 UN OEWG report seeks to clarify the role of the norms and their relationship to international law, but it ultimately reaffirms the conceptual distinction between the two. It provides that the 'norms do not replace or alter' binding obligations under international law, and do not seek to limit or prohibit action that is otherwise consistent with international law.\" Instead, the norms 'provide additional specific guidance' on what constitutes responsible state behaviour in the cyber context. As such, the legal status of norm (f) is contradictory given it was both intended to reaffirm states' legal obligations in relation to CI and, without replacing or altering the law, to provide non-binding additional specific guidance on what constitutes responsible state behaviour in this context. This is problematic as it is unclear what kinds of cyber operations are prohibited by binding international law obligations in contrast to those that are only contrary to non-binding norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.\nIn addition to its legal status, the commentary to norm (f) also discusses the degree of harm that is required for the norm to be violated. Norm (f) refers to activities that 'intentionally damage[] critical infrastructure or otherwise impair[] the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public'. Essentially, this involves two types of harm: either intentional damage to CI or the use and operation of CI is impaired in its provision of services to the public. The commentary elaborates on both of these. In relation to the first, this requires a state to deliberately cause damage to CI irrespective of whether the damage impacts public services connected to the CI. Here the degree of damage is irrelevant as long as the damage is physical in nature. Given the requirement of intention, however, where a state unintentionally causes physical damage to CI (provided it does not impair the use or operation of CI in its provision of services to the public) then this would fall outside the scope of norm (f).\nThe second type of harm involves situations where a cyber operation does not cause any damage but impairs the use and operation of CI in its provision of services to the public. According to the commentary, impairment in this context refers to:\nany damage, physical or electronic, including the loss of data or software, or interruption of digital services provided by critical infrastructure, that makes the critical infrastructure less effective, less valuable, operate worse, or inhibit use by the public, the threshold being that the public must be impacted, even minimally.\nAs such, the term 'impairment' encompasses physical impairment but does not require it, and captures a range of circumstances where the functionality of CI is undermined provided it results in a detrimental impact on its use by the public. This excludes cyber operations that do not disrupt the operation of CI, as well as cyber operations that disrupt the operation of CI without any impact on the public. Unlike the requirement for intentional damage, the need for impairment is based on a strict liability approach where there is no need for the responsible state to have intended to cause the impairment.\nIn summary, states have agreed to norms of responsible behaviour in cyberspace at the UN level including norm (f) which specifically prohibits certain cyber operations against CI.\n72 Akande, Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 53) 31.\n73 UN OEWG 2021 report (n 48) 5.\n74 Ibid.\n75 UN GGE 2015 report (n 46) 8.\n76 Jolley (n 51) 188.\n77 Ibid.\n78 Ibid 189.\n79 Ibid 188.\n80 Ibid.\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 433\nHowever, the legal status of norm (f) is contradictory. On one hand, it seeks to reaffirm states' existing obligations in relation to CI and is not intended to modify those obligations. On the other, it provides non-binding 'additional specific guidance' on responsible state behaviour in this context, particularly in relation to the degree of harm that should not be caused to CI.⁸¹ As will be demonstrated below, this guidance is concerning as it is inconsistent with the harm requirements under international law, and this further compounds existing uncertainties about how the law applies in this context.⁸²\n# INTERNATIONAL LAW AND CYBER OPERATIONS\nThis section examines how relevant rules of international law that norm (f) reaffirms apply to state activities in cyberspace. The focus is on three primary areas of international law that provide limits to cyber operations in peacetime, namely the law on the use of force, non-intervention and sovereignty. These are of particular relevance to cyber operations attributable to states targeting another state's CI given the broad spectrum of effects that remotely conducted cyber operations can cause.⁸³\nThere is widespread agreement that international law generally applies to state activities in cyberspace. This was highlighted in the 2015 UN GGE report which recognized that international law and the UN Charter in particular apply in the cyber context.⁸⁴ This was reaffirmed in the 2021 UN OEWG consensus report.⁸⁵ Despite this general agreement, however, there continues to be uncertainty about how particular rules of international law apply. As such, UN Member States have been invited to provide their national views on the UN GGE reports and to make submissions or provide working papers in connection with the UN OEWG which ran parallel to the UN GGE. In connection with these processes, states have provided more detailed accounts about how they consider the law to apply. The views of states are important as they contribute to more clarity about how international law applies in the cyber context, and to the development of customary international law applicable to state conduct in this context.⁸⁶ However, the different positions evident in these statements have given rise to some debate about how the law applies. The implication of this is that, while there are some areas where a degree of consensus is emerging, there continues to be a degree of uncertainty about when cyber operations against CI will violate international law.\n# Use of force\nA cyber operation that causes physical damage to CI can potentially violate the prohibition on the use of force. Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits states from the use of force. Force in this context is generally understood to refer to 'armed force'.⁸⁷ Despite being drafted in the\n⁸¹ However, as Delerue, Douzet and Géry note, the non-binding norms nonetheless 'can contribute to the interpretation of existing obligations in international law, or to the formation of new international obligations'. Delerue, Douzet and Géry (n 70) 31.\n⁸² See section 5.\n⁸³ Other areas of law, such as international humanitarian law which applies in an armed conflict, while important given the dual-use nature of CI, are outside of the article's scope. On these obligations in relation to CI, see David Fidler 'Whither the Web?: International Law, Cybersecurity, and Critical Infrastructure Protection' (2015) 16 GJIA 8, 12. See also Jolley (n 51) 181-4.\n⁸⁴ UN GGE 2015 report (n 46) 12.\n⁸⁵ UN OEWG 2021 report (n 48) 5-6.\n⁸⁶ See United Nations General Assembly, UNGA Res 73/203 (20 December 2018) UN Doc A/RES/73/203.\n⁸⁷ See Albrecht Randelzhofer, 'Article 2(4)' in Bruno Simma and others (eds) The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary (Oxford University Press 2002) 117-21.\nSAMULI HAATAJA\ntechnological context of the 1940s, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has affirmed that the prohibition on the use of force applies 'to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.'88\nIn the cyber context, most states that have expressed their position on article 2(4) have adopted the approach that a cyber operation will constitute a use of force where its 'scale and effects' are comparable to a use of force by traditional kinetic means.89 This approach is similar to the one adopted by the 'Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations' (Tallinn Manual)90 – an influential but non-binding account by a group of experts about how international law applies in the cyber context91 – which provides in Rule 69 that '[a] cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.'92 Accordingly, where a cyber operation results in damage or destruction of physical property, or injury or death of human beings, it is likely to be considered to amount to a use of force in violation of article 2(4).\nHowever, where a cyber operation results in a loss of functionality of systems without causing physical damage, it is unclear whether this would be regarded as a use of force.93 Normally, economic or diplomatic pressure is not considered to be 'force' under article 2(4),94 and only the Netherlands has suggested that a cyber operation could constitute a use of force where it had 'a very serious financial or economic impact'.95 In contrast, New Zealand has maintained that a cyber operation causing significant loss of functionality to its CI would constitute a violation of the non-intervention principle, as opposed to the use of force.96 As such, there is uncertainty around whether cyber operations that do not cause physical effects can constitute violations of article 2(4).\n## Non-intervention\nA cyber operation against CI that falls below the use of force threshold can potentially constitute a violation of the non-intervention principle. This is a rule of customary international law that prohibits states from using coercive means to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another state as these are matters which states have the right to decide freely by virtue of their sovereignty. A violation of international law based on the non-intervention principle requires two elements. First, there must be coercive interference, and second, it must be directed towards the matters that sovereign states should be able to decide freely.97\n88 Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Advisory Opinion)  ICJ Rep 226, 244.

The majority of the Tallinn Manual experts, for example, adopted a narrow approach to the term defining it as ‘an affirmative act designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way.’⁹⁸ They distinguished it from activities that seek to influence (as opposed to factually compel) a state to behave in a particular way such as public criticism or propaganda.⁹⁹ Others, however, have defined coercion more broadly as a form of pressure that seeks to deprive the target state of its free will.¹⁰⁰ This view was echoed by the minority of the Tallinn Manual experts who maintained that it is sufficient that the activity ‘has the effect of depriving the State of control over the matter in question.’¹⁰¹ This broader approach to coercion is also supported by some states in the cyber context. For example, according to Australia coercion involves ‘effectively deprive[ing] another state of the ability to control, decide upon or govern matters of an inherently sovereign nature.’¹⁰² Similarly, the German position maintains that coercion involves where a state’s ‘will is manifestly bent by the foreign State’s conduct.’¹⁰³\nThe second element requires that the coercion is directed at matters that states are able to decide freely by virtue of their sovereignty.¹⁰⁴ These include, according to the ICJ, the ‘choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy’.¹⁰⁵ States have also endorsed this view in the cyber context. Australia’s position is that the law requires the coercion to affect ‘matters of an inherently sovereign nature’,¹⁰⁶ according to the UK the coercion must affect ‘matters of government which are at the heart of a state’s sovereignty’,¹⁰⁷ and for New Zealand, coercion must deprive the state from control over ‘matters falling within the scope of its inherently sovereign functions’.¹⁰⁸\nA number of states have also provided examples of situations in which the non-intervention principle would be violated in the cyber context.

For example, the Tallinn Manual distinguishes between a state’s ‘inherently governmental functions’ (relevant for a sovereignty violation) from the concept of domaine réservé (relevant to the non-intervention principle). Schmitt (n 90) 24. However, it is argued that the notion of ‘matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely’ (using the ICJ’s wording) is preferred. This is not confined to a state’s internal affairs as it also includes their external affairs (eg membership of international organisations, and decisions to recognise states) which can be subject to coercive interference. Additionally, even if a matter is regulated by international law (and thus it is no longer within a state’s domaine réservé meaning the state no longer has exclusive regulatory authority over the matter), the state still has the authority to make choices within that area of law. As such, the ‘matters that sovereign states are permitted to decide freely’ is a more useful concept opposed to the narrow notion of a state’s domaine réservé.

Australia and the UK also maintain that using cyber means involving coercion to undermine the stability of their financial system would constitute a violation.¹¹³ This is echoed by New Zealand which also maintains that disruptive cyber operations against its healthcare system, electricity network or telecommunications network would, where coercive, constitute violations of the non-intervention principle.¹¹⁴ Accordingly, cyber operations without physical effects can constitute violations of the non-intervention principle. However, this requires the element of coercion but the identity and intention of the state responsible for a cyber operation can be difficult to determine in the cyber context. This leads to uncertainty around whether cyber operations without physical effects that fall below the use of force threshold constitute violations of the non-intervention principle.\n## Sovereignty\nFinally, cyber operations against CI can also constitute violations of sovereignty. Sovereignty generally refers to a state's supreme authority within its territory, and it involves three interrelated rights and correlating duties in relation to a state's territorial sovereignty, independence and sovereign equality.¹¹⁵ In relation to territorial sovereignty, usually non-consensual activities within a state's territory, such as flying military aircraft over its airspace without permission, or navigating a vessel through its territorial sea without its consent are prohibited. In the cyber context, while states agree that sovereignty extends to the cyber infrastructure within their territory, there is uncertainty around whether and the threshold at which remotely conducted cyber operations will violate sovereignty. This is a critical question given that international law is largely silent on espionage conducted by states, and this means that states are generally permitted to engage in cyber espionage.¹¹⁶\nThis uncertainty about whether and when a cyber operation violates sovereignty arises from the debate about whether or not sovereignty operates as a rule of international law independent of the use of force and non-intervention principles that prohibits certain malicious cyber activities. According to the 'sovereignty as a rule' approach, sovereignty operates as a primary rule of international law that can be violated, and under certain circumstances, remotely conducted cyber operations can amount to violations of sovereignty. The Tallinn Manual advocated for this approach,¹¹⁷ and a growing number of states have adopted this approach including the Netherlands,¹¹⁸ France,¹¹⁹ Austria,¹²⁰\n¹¹² Finnish Government, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, 'Finland Published Its Positions on Public International Law in Cyberspace' (15 October 2020) <https: en=\"\" full=\"\" valtioneuvosto.fi=\"\" valtioneuvosto.fi=\"\"> / 'finland-published-its-positions-on-public-international-law-in-cyberspace'.\n¹¹³ Wright (n 107); Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy, 2019 International Law Supplement (n 102) 5.\n¹¹⁴ New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade (n 89).\n¹¹⁵ Moynihan (n 59) 11.\n¹¹⁶ See Russell Buchan, Cyber Espionage and International Law (Hart 2019).

Cyber espionage is defined here as the use of cyber means to copy confidential data from computer systems or networks without authorisation. Buchan (n 116) 17–18. However, this does not mean that any form of cyber espionage is permitted. Instead, determining whether cyber espionage violates international law will depend on the techniques involved and the effects caused by the cyber operation. As noted by the Tallinn Manual, the 'mere characterisation of a cyber operation as espionage or not has no legal significance ... [r]ather, one must look to the underlying acts to determine whether the operation in question violates international law'.

For example, the Netherlands did not define the boundary at which it considers its sovereignty to be violated,¹²⁷ and Austria similarly remained silent on this issue.¹²⁸ The French position in turn suggests that it considers a cyber operation that merely involves the ‘unauthorized penetration’ of its computer systems to be a violation of its sovereignty.¹²⁹ Iran’s position similarly suggests that it would also view any unlawful intrusions into its (public or private) cyber infrastructure as violations of its sovereignty, as well as those that are destructive or disruptive and undermine its national security.¹³⁰ In contrast, however, according to New Zealand not ‘every unauthorized intrusion’ into another state’s ICT systems or even all cyber activities that cause effects on another state’s territory constitutes a violation of territorial sovereignty.¹³¹ Here it makes reference to cyber espionage activities and ‘a range of circumstances’ in which even cyber operations that cause effects in the territory of another state will not violate international law.¹³² Finland has maintained that a violation of sovereignty will be determined on a case-by-case basis depending on the ‘nature and consequences’ of the unauthorized cyber intrusion.¹³³ The Czech Republic considers that cyber operations that violate sovereignty include those that cause significant physical damage or harm to individuals and those that damage or disrupt the operation of cyber or other infrastructure where it has a ‘significant impact on national security, economy, public health or environment’.¹³⁴ Similarly, according to Germany, a cyber operation that causes ‘physical effects and harm’ in another state’s territory will violate sovereignty, as well as disruptive cyber operations, particularly where they cause ‘substantive secondary or indirect physical effects’ in another state’s territory.¹³⁵ As such, while some states agree that, at least cyber operations that cause physical damage or harm to individuals within another state’s territory will violate their\n¹²¹ Czech Republic, ‘Statement by Richard Kadlčák at Open-ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security of the First Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations’ (11 February 2020) <https: 2020=\"\" 20%20international%20law%2011.02.2020.pdf=\"\" cz%20statement%20www.nukib.cz=\"\" download=\"\" publications_en=\"\" www.nukib.cz=\"\">.\n¹²² Finnish Government, Ministry for Foreign Affairs (n 112).\n¹²³ Islamic Republic of Iran, ‘Declaration of General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran Regarding International Law Applicable to the Cyberspace’ NourNews (18 August 2020) <https: 53144=\"\" en=\"\" general-staff-of-iranian-armed-forces-warns-of-tough-reaction-to-any-cyber-threat=\"\" nournews.ir=\"\">.\n¹²⁴ New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade (n 89).\n¹²⁵ The Federal Government of Germany (n 89) 2.\n¹²⁶ Organisation of American States, Inter-American Judicial Committee, ‘International Law and State Cyber Operations’ (1 November 2020) 52 <http: docs=\"\" en=\"\" idc=\"\" international_law_and_state_cyber_operations_publication.pdf=\"\" sla=\"\" iajc=\"\" www.oas.org=\"\">.\n¹²⁷ Letter from the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (n 89) 3.\n¹²⁸ ‘Comments by Austria, Pre-Draft Report of the OEWG – ICT’ (n 120).\n¹²⁹ United Nations Secretary-General (n 119) 22. A similar position has been adopted by some recent academic commentators who argue that cyber operations amount to violations of sovereignty when they penetrate another state’s computers or networks even without physical damage of effects in the territory of the state. For example, Russell Buchan adopts this position and maintains that a violation occurs on the basis of the act of ‘the unauthorised intrusion into a domain protected by state sovereignty’. Buchan (n 116) 54. François Delerue also argues that ‘[i]f a cyber operation penetrates the cyber infrastructures in the territory of a foreign State, this would irrefutably constitute a violation of territorial sovereignty’.

Another example given is cyber operations that interfere ‘with any data or services which are essential for the exercise of inherently governmental functions, and thereby significantly disrupting the exercise of those functions; for example, distributing ransomware which encrypts the computers used by a government and thus significantly delaying the payment of retirement pensions’.\n¹³⁵ The Federal Government of Germany (n 89) 4.</http:></https:></https:>\nSAMULI HAATAJA\nterritorial sovereignty, among other states there is no consensus on whether every unauthorized intrusion violates sovereignty or what degree of effects are required for a violation to occur.^^\nIn contrast to the rule approach to sovereignty, according to the 'sovereignty as a principle' approach, sovereignty is a fundamental principle of international law involving a state's independent right to exercise state functions to the exclusion of others (the internal element), and the recognition of the absolute equality and independence of all states (the external element).^^ However, sovereignty cannot be violated in its own right independent of other rules of international law that are based on it as it does not operate as a standalone primary rule of international law capable of being violated. This approach has been suggested by the US in a 2017 US Department of Defence memorandum (US DoD memo),^^ and the UK has expressly adopted this position.^^\nFrom the sovereignty as a principle approach, given that sovereignty does not operate as a standalone rule of international law, it cannot be violated in itself. Instead, to amount to a violation of international law, a cyber operation needs to constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force or an intervention (ie a violation of existing rules of international law that arise from sovereignty).^^ This means that, under this approach, a range of cyber operations are considered lawful under international law as they are not expressly prohibited. For example, according to the US DoD memo, sovereignty does not limit states from engaging in cyber activities 'that result in effects occurring on the infrastructure located in another State'.^^ Similarly, according to the UK, the non-consensual interference into another state's computer networks is not a violation of their 'territorial sovereignty' because such a rule does not exist in international law in relation to cyber.^^ As such, pursuant to the sovereignty as a principle approach, unauthorized cyber intrusions cannot constitute violations of sovereignty and will only amount to violations of international law where they rise to the threshold of a use of force or intervention and thus violate other existing rules of international law.\nTo summarize, when it comes to states' existing legal obligations most relevant to cyber operations that target or cause effects on another state's CI in peacetime, there is a degree of consensus in some areas but uncertainty in others. There is agreement that cyber operations will violate the prohibition on the use of force where their effects are similar to the use of armed force by kinetic means. However, there is no consensus around the precise threshold or about non-destructive but disruptive cyber operations in this context. The non-intervention principle generally applies to disruptive cyber operations provided they are coercive, however, this can be difficult to determine in the cyber context. Finally, while an increasing number of states have expressed support for the 'sovereignty as a rule' approach, there is no consensus on the threshold\n^^ The Tallinn Manual experts were also divided on this.

As a result, particularly in relation to low-level cyber operations that merely involve pre-positioning or preparatory activities such as unauthorised access, information collection or the installation of malware that do not cause any immediate disruption or destruction, there is uncertainty about whether these activities would constitute violations of states' existing obligations under international law.\n# IMPLICATIONS FOR CYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW\nThis section demonstrates how norm (f) adds counterproductive complexity to the application of international law to cyber operations against CI. This is evident in the subjective nature of what constitutes CI within the scope of norm (f), and the additional specific guidance provided by norm (f) which contradicts some of the harm requirements under international law.\n# Norm (f) and CI\nNorm (f) applies to cyber operations against CI, however, despite that there are core sectors that most states consider to constitute CI, the notion of CI remains subjective. This means that the precise scope of norm (f) is not clearly defined. States have the prerogative to determine which infrastructures to designate as CI, $^{143}$ and, from 'critical information infrastructure' $^{144}$ and 'critical national infrastructure' $^{145}$ to 'national, transnational and supranational critical infrastructure' $^{146}$ — there is little consistency in the terminology adopted by states. The lack of agreement about what constitutes CI for the purposes of norm (f) can be problematic. For instance, election infrastructure in the US was only designated as critical in January 2017 following Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. $^{147}$ Some states have also been hesitant to designate specific sectors as CI due to concerns that this would implicitly condone malicious activities against sectors that are not specified. $^{148}$ The 2021 UN GGE report expressly acknowledges these concerns, noting that, even where a sector is not designated as CI, it does not amount to condoning malicious activities against those sectors. $^{149}$ Furthermore, even where states specify certain sectors as CI, they are not precluded from designating other sectors as such in the future. $^{150}$ There have also been calls to extend norm (f) to mention specific sectors, even if those sectors are already widely considered to be CI. For example, in February 2020 the International Committee of the Red Cross proposed extending the application of norm (f) to address the\n143 UN OEWG 2021 report (n 48) 4.\n144 Council Directive 2008/114/EC of 8 December 2008 (n 22) art 2.\n145 Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (n 19).\n146 UN Open Ended Working Group, 'Second \"Pre-draft\" of the Report of the OEWG on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security' (27 May 2020) 4 <https: 05=\"\" 200527-oewg-ict-revised-pre-draft.pdf=\"\" 2020=\"\" front.un-arm.org=\"\" uploads=\"\" wp-content=\"\">.\n147 Homeland Security, 'Statement by Secretary Jeh Johnson on the Designation of Election Infrastructure as a Critical Infrastructure Subsector' (6 January 2017) <https: 01=\"\" 06=\"\" 2017=\"\" statement-secretary-johnson-designation-election-infrastructure-critical=\"\" news=\"\" www.dhs.gov=\"\">.\n148 Johanna Weaver, 'Submission of Australia's Independent Expert to the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (GGE)' (29 May 2020) 8 <https: default=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\" submission-by-australias-representative-to-the-gge-norm-implementation-may-2020.pdf=\"\" www.dfat.gov.au=\"\">.\n149 United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/76/135 (14 July 2021) 13.\n150 Ibid.</https:></https:></https:>\nSAMULI HAATAJA\n'particular vulnerability of health care facilities'¹⁵¹ in response to cyber operations against hospitals and vaccine research centres during the pandemic.\nWhile agreement about what sectors constitute CI for the purposes of norm (f) is useful in providing clarity for the scope of the norm, this introduces unnecessary additional complexity to how international law applies in this context. The contested nature of CI and focus on whether a sector is CI for the purposes of norm (f) has the potential to narrow the application of international law only to those sectors that states have agreed to constitute CI. The need for a cyber operation to affect CI also creates an additional requirement that is not evident in existing international law. This is because, irrespective of whether a sector is designated as CI or not, existing international law obligations apply to cyber operations causing effects in the territory of other states. For example, a cyber operation against election infrastructure rising to the level of a violation of sovereignty or intervention will constitute a violation of international law regardless of whether the victim state considers the infrastructure to be CI or not. Similarly, cyber operations against healthcare facilities causing sufficient effects will constitute violations of international law even if those sectors are not specifically mentioned in norm (f).¹⁵² Therefore, the focus on what constitutes CI for the purposes of norm (f), and the subjectivity of the concept of CI has the potential to introduce additional complexity to determining whether a cyber operation violates international law.\n## Norm (f) and uncertainty in international law\nNorm (f) seeks to reaffirm the existing legal obligations of states in relation to cyber operations against CI and provide additional specific guidance on responsible state behaviour in this context. However, the harm requirements within norm (f) are contradictory to those in international law, and this further compounds existing uncertainties in how the law applies to cyber operations targeting CI. As a result, there are a range of cyber operations that can constitute violations of international law but not norm (f), or vice versa.\nFor example, whether a cyber operation against CI constitutes a use of force will generally be determined based on its 'scale and effects'. Under this approach, there must be a degree of direct physical damage to the CI, or disruption of its functionality which causes damage or harm to individuals comparable to a use of force by kinetic means. The Stuxnet incident is generally considered to have crossed this threshold as it is reported to have caused damage to approximately 1000 centrifuge machines.¹⁵³ Assuming Stuxnet was attributable to a state, its use would have violated norm (f) as it caused intentional damage to CI and was contrary to the responsible state's international obligations.¹⁵⁴ However, a disruptive cyber operation with only adverse economic consequences would generally not constitute a use of force. This could include, for example, a cyber operation against a power grid that causes a temporary blackout without any indirect physical effects or harm to individuals. While a cyber operation of this kind would involve impairing the use of the CI and adversely impact its use for the public for the purposes of norm (f), it would unlikely violate a state's legal obligations under article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n¹⁵¹ International Committee of the Red Cross, 'Norms for Responsible State Behavior on Cyber Operations should Build on International Law' (11 February 2020) <https: document=\"\" en=\"\" norms-responsible-state-behavior-cyber-operations-should-build-international-law=\"\" www.icrc.org=\"\">. While norm (f) was not amended, the 2021 UN GGE report did specifically note how '[t]he COVID-19 pandemic heightened awareness of the critical importance of protecting health care and medical infrastructure and facilities, including through the implementation of the norms addressing critical infrastructure'. UN GGE 2021 report (n 150) 12.\n¹⁵² See Milanovic and Schmitt (n 8).\n¹⁵³ Haataja (n 93) 88–95.\n¹⁵⁴ See also Broeders and others (n 60) 4–7.</https:>\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 441\nFor a cyber operation of this kind without direct physical effects to violate the non-intervention principle, there is a requirement that the operation was intended to be coercive and directed at matters states have the right to decide freely. For example, where a cyber operation causing a blackout was done with the intention of coercing the targeted state to reverse its policy of recognition of another state, this would constitute an unlawful intervention. But where the cyber operation does not involve the element of coercion directed at matters states should be freely able to decide (or the responsible state's intention is unknown), then the cyber operation would fall outside the scope of the non-intervention principle. This is despite the impairment of CI and its adverse impact on the public that is consistent with the harm requirement in norm (f). Whether a cyber operation of this kind violates sovereignty is also unsettled given the divergence in views among states on the issue.\nIn relation to cyber operations against CI and violations of sovereignty, consider, for example, where a state obtains unauthorised access to another state's power grid, election infrastructure or hospital systems and installs malware that gives it the ability to cause disruptive or destructive effects on that infrastructure at a later point in time. Whether a cyber operation of this kind violates sovereignty is unsettled as the precise boundaries of states' legal obligations in this context are still developing and evolving as more state practice emerges. According to France and Iran, which adopt the rule approach to sovereignty and consider any penetration of their networks to be a violation of sovereignty, this conduct would constitute a violation of international law at the point in time at which there is unauthorized access to their systems. However, for states like the Czech Republic and New Zealand, merely obtaining unauthorised access or installing malware that does not impair the functioning of the systems would not constitute violations of sovereignty. Instead, for these states, it is only at the point in time at which that malware is used to cause significant disruptive or destructive effects that the cyber operation would qualify as a violation of sovereignty. Similarly, for states like the UK adopting the principle approach to sovereignty, the cyber operation could not constitute a violation of international law unless and until it rises to the level of a use of force or involves coercion and violates the non-intervention principle. Accordingly, a range of cyber operations that meet the harm requirements in norm (f) would fall outside of its scope because, given the uncertainty around how international law applies in this context, it would be unclear whether those operations also violate the law as required by norm (f).\nFurther compounding the uncertainty in how existing international law applies are the harm requirements of norm (f) that are not consistent with international law. Norm (f) requires 'intentional damage', but the intent is not a requisite element for most of the rules of international law outlined above. In relation to the prohibition on the use of force, there is no requirement for intention. Instead, the approach adopted by most states and in the Tallinn Manual focuses on the 'scale and effects' of a cyber operation. Similarly, intention is not a requirement for a violation of sovereignty. While intention is an element of the non-intervention principle, the focus of the law here is on the intention of the state applying the coercion and not\n155 See United Nations Secretary-General (n 119) 22; Islamic Republic of Iran (n 123).\n156 See Czech Republic (n 121); New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade (n 89).\n157 See Wright (n 107).\n158 See Olivier Corten, The Law Against War: The Prohibition on the Use of Force in Contemporary International Law (Bloomsbury Publishing 2010) 78–80.\n159 Schmitt (n 90) 331.\n160 Corten (n 158) 83; Schmitt (n 90) 24.\n161 Jamnejad and Wood (n 97). Nicholas Tsagourias maintains that, in establishing a violation of the non-intervention principle, 'intent is critical, particularly in cyberspace, where operations are often factually indistinguishable, and their effects permeate borders unintentionally'. Nicholas Tsagourias, 'Electoral Cyber Interference, Self-Determination, and the Principle of Non-intervention in Cyberspace' in Dennis Broeders and Bibi van den Berg (eds) Governing Cyberspace: Behaviour, Power, Diplomacy (Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2020) 55.\nSAMULI HAATAJA\nwhether the particular technical effects – such as damage to CI – were intended or not. This means that there is no need for ‘intentional damage’ to be caused by a cyber operation for the non-intervention principle to be violated. Norm (f), however, specifically refers to intentional damage. As a result, where a state engages in a cyber operation against CI that causes unintentional damage to the CI, the activity could constitute a violation of sovereignty or a use of force but would fall outside the scope of the intentional damage contemplated by norm (f).¹⁶²\nThe approach to impairment evident in norm (f) is useful in terms of the specificity of the requirement for an (even minimally) adverse impact on services provided to the public by the CI. This encompasses a very broad spectrum of cyber operations against CI, including disruptive cyber operations that may fall outside the scope of the prohibition on the use of force and the non-intervention principle. However, unless these cyber operations cause sufficient effects to constitute a use of force, or are accompanied by coercive intention and satisfy the non-intervention principle, they would fall outside the scope of existing international law and also outside of norm (f). As such, while the ‘additional specific guidance’ that norm (f) provides in its approach to impairment is useful given the broad spectrum of cyber operations against CI that it captures, there is uncertainty about whether most of such cyber operations would constitute violations of international law as required under norm (f).\nFinally, when considering low-level cyber operations used to pre-position or prepare for potentially destructive cyber operations against CI in peacetime, what is revealed is the dark side of norm (f) and existing international law in this context.¹⁶³ Given that these kinds of cyber operations do not cause immediate damage or impairment and, from a technical perspective, can be indistinguishable from cyber espionage, they are effectively permitted under existing international law and generally will not be seen to constitute violations of sovereignty. But much of CI is dual-use and this means that under certain conditions it can be lawfully subject to attack through cyber means in an armed conflict.¹⁶⁴ Essentially, except in circumstances where there is evidence of an imminent armed attack,¹⁶⁵ norm (f) and existing international law allow states to engage in cyber operations against CI that involve pre-positioning and preparing for potentially destructive effects in the future.¹⁶⁶\nTherefore, norm (f) introduces additional complexity to the application of international law in this context, and this complexity is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are considered to be ‘off limits’. The subjective nature of what constitutes CI and the requirement for a sector to be CI to be captured by norm (f) creates a requirement that is not evident in international law and effectively narrows its application.\n¹⁶² However, where a cyber operation of this kind also has an adverse impact on the public then it would constitute impairment under the second type of harm within norm (f). This could amount to a violation of international law on sovereignty, but this is uncertain given the current debate about sovereignty.\n¹⁶³ The norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace only operate in peacetime.

See Fidler (n 83) 12; Jolley (n 51) 181–4. See also Broeders and others (n 60).\n¹⁶⁵ For example, according to Australia, states may exercise a right of anticipatory self-defence where ‘a threatened armed attack in the form of an offensive cyber operation’ that could be launched ‘in a split second’ and could cause ‘large-scale loss of human life and damage to critical infrastructure’. See George Brandis, ‘The Right of Self-Defence against Imminent Armed Attack in International Law’ (Lecture delivered at the University of Queensland, Brisbane, 11 April 2017) 8 <https: 05=\"\" 2017=\"\" developments-international-law-self-defence-against-imminent-armed-attack=\"\" blog=\"\" law.uq.edu.au=\"\">. Similarly, according to NATO’s Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations, non-destructive cyber operations, such as those causing temporary disruptions of service or involving information gathering where they are conducted to enable a conventional threat – including an imminent threat of one – could be considered to trigger the right of self-defence.

David Fidler, for example, suggests a new cyber-defence norm adopting an ‘all hazards’ strategy to protect CI that does not focus on the legal regime (whether cyber crime or espionage) but instead on ensuring ‘networks are protected against infiltrations from any source’. Fidler (n 83) 13</https:></https:></https:>\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 443\nInternational law obligations apply to cyber operations conducted by states irrespective of whether they target what the victim state has designated as CI or not. While there is a degree of uncertainty around the thresholds at which violations of international law on the use of force, intervention and sovereignty occur, the harm requirements in norm (f) have the potential to compound these uncertainties as they are not consistent with these rules of international law.\nAccordingly, more clarity about the relationship between international law and norm (f) is needed, and about how international law applies to cyber operations targeting sectors that states have deemed to be CI. This is particularly the case in relation to international law on sovereignty. Especially where low-level cyber operations without immediately disruptive or destructive effects are involved, more states need to provide detailed accounts of when they consider the law to be violated and the relationship between sovereignty and sectors they consider to be CI. While a state's domestic legislation – like the Australian NSLA – may criminalise various activities such as the installation of malware onto CI on a national level, states should also expressly outline how they regard these activities on an international level. Here the approach to impairment in norm (f) can serve as useful guidance on when a cyber operation should violate sovereignty.¹⁶⁷ Similarly, the fact that CI is targeted can serve as an indicia of a violation of sovereignty. For example, this is the approach that Germany has adopted making an explicit connection between cyber operations against its CI and violations of its sovereignty.¹⁶⁸ In relation to low-level cyber operations, such as those involving the installation of malware enabling a persistent presence on CI that is generally accepted as a permissible form of espionage, these should be seen as potential violations of sovereignty given the purpose for which they are conducted.¹⁶⁹ As such, while clarity around when cyber operations violate sovereignty and the relevance of a sector's designation as CI is needed, international law applies to cyber operations by states irrespective of norm (f) which introduces counterproductive complexity to the legal analysis in this context.\n# CONCLUSION\nThis article examined the norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace and international law prohibiting malicious cyber operations against CI. It demonstrated that norm (f), which prohibits cyber operations that damage or impair CI, introduces complexity to the application of international law that is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are prohibited by international law. This is due to the subjective nature of CI, the contradictory legal status of norm (f), and the ways in which the harm requirements of norm (f) compound existing uncertainties about how international law applies to cyber operations where CI is targeted. To develop clarity about what cyber operations against CI should be 'off limits', more states need to outline their positions on the threshold at which they consider the law to be violated – especially in relation to sovereignty – to ensure that malicious low-level cyber operations, in particular, do not fall outside of these legal constraints.\n¹⁶⁷ This has been recently recognized in the UN OEWG 2021 report where it was noted that a cyber operation contrary to international law that 'intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public, could pose a threat not only to security but also to State sovereignty'. See UN OEWG 2021 report (n 48) 4.\n¹⁶⁸ According to Germany, where a cyber operation targets a state's CI it 'may indicate that a State's territorial sovereignty has been violated'. However, given, among other things, the lack of international agreement of what constitutes CI, Germany maintained that this in and of itself cannot constitute the basis for a violation. The Federal Government of Germany (n 89) 4.\n¹⁶⁹ For example, Asaf Lubin maintains that cyber espionage should be unlawful where the purpose for which it is conducted is unlawful. Asaf Lubin, 'The Liberty to Spy' (2020) 61(1) HILJ 185, 238–9. Other academics have also expressed support for adopting a purpose approach in determining the lawfulness of cyber espionage.

This article examines norm (f) in light of existing international law prohibiting malicious cyber operations against CI. It argues that norm (f) introduces complexity to the application of the law in this context that is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are prohibited by international law. This is due to the subjectivity of the concept of CI, the contradictory legal status of norm (f), and due to existing uncertainties in how international law applies to state conduct in cyberspace which are compounded by norm (f). The article concludes that states need to develop more clarity about the relationship between international law and the norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, and about how international law applies to cyber operations, particularly where CI is targeted.\nKEY WORDS: cyber norms, international law, cyber operations, critical infrastructure, cyberspace ## INTRODUCTION This article examines norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace and international law prohibiting malicious cyber operations against critical infrastructure (CI) in peacetime. It argues that, while states have agreed to a norm that cyber operations that damage CI or impair its use should be prohibited, this norm adds a degree of counterproductive complexity to the application of the law in this context. This complexity arises from the subjective nature of what constitutes CI, the contradictory legal status of norm (f), and the existing uncertainties about how international law applies to cyber operations which are compounded by norm (f).

Section two considers what constitutes CI and the threat posed by malicious cyber operations against CI. Section three examines the norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace with a focus on norm (f) which prohibits states from conducting cyber operations that cause intentional damage or impairment to the operation of CI in other states. This section outlines the debate about the legal status of norm (f) and demonstrates its contradictory legal status. Section four then examines how states' existing international law obligations are considered to apply to cyber operations causing effects on another state's CI. The focus is on international law on the use of force, non-intervention, and sovereignty. This section demonstrates that there continues to be a degree of uncertainty about when cyber operations against CI violate international law, particularly those falling below the use of force threshold. Section five examines the implications of norm (f) for international law in this context. It demonstrates how norm (f) introduces complexity to the legal analysis which is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are prohibited by international law. Section six provides a conclusion.\n# CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND CYBER OPERATIONS In June 2020, the Australian Government revealed that it had been subject to a campaign of cyber attacks targeting its federal- and state-level governments, various companies and CI. Given the scale and nature of the operations, Australia maintained a foreign state actor was responsible, however, it stopped short of publicly attributing the operations to a specific state. Despite this, some have suggested China was responsible. The cyber operations are understood to have involved compromising the computer systems and networks of the various organisations that were targeted through vulnerabilities in their software. However, despite the media attention Australia's revelation of the incident received, the cyber operations did not cause any effects, such as disrupting the operation of the compromised organisations. Instead, according to the Australian Cyber Security Centre, there was no evidence of 'intent by the actor to carry out any disruptive or destructive activities within victim environments'.\nThere is growing concern about the threat posed by low-level cyber operations that do not necessarily result in immediate disruptive or destructive effects but are nonetheless significant in their scale or have the potential to be used in preparation for more harmful operations. For example, the Australian Department of Defence has specifically highlighted the threat posed by 'all kinds of preparation, pre-positioning, [and] collection of intelligence' activities in the cyber context. This was echoed by the Director General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation who expressed concerns about 'the potential for Australia's adversaries to pre-position malicious code in critical infrastructure... [which] could be used to damage critical CYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE networks in the future.⁶ In the United States (US), the 2018 ‘National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America’ (US Cyber Strategy) makes specific mention of Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, and provides that the US and its allies ‘are vulnerable to peacetime cyber attacks against critical infrastructure’ and that there is a growing risk ‘these countries will conduct cyber attacks against the United States during a crisis short of war’.⁷ Accordingly, there is recognition of the potentially devastating impact that cyber operations on CI can have and the threat posed by cyber activities in preparation of such operations. These concerns have been exacerbated by reports about malicious cyber operations conducted against hospitals and vaccine research centres during the pandemic in 2020,⁸ as well as ransomware crippling the operation of Colonial Pipeline in 2021 in the US.⁹ In light of these concerns, states have highlighted the need for international agreement that certain CI should be ‘off limits’ from malicious cyber activities. In 2015, for example, Australia’s then Foreign Minister Julie Bishop maintained that: The effective functioning of critical infrastructure underpins the global economy. States should prevent and refrain from online activity which damages or impairs critical infrastructure, whether it be in banking, telecos, energy structures. While states define their critical infrastructure sectors differently and harmonisation is important, agreeing that key sectors should be off limits is a priority for the international community.¹⁰ And in 2021, following the Colonial Pipeline incident, US President Joe Biden told Russia’s President Vladimir Putin that ‘certain critical infrastructure should be “off limits” to attack’, and provided Russia with a list of 16 sectors the US considers CI.¹¹ In Australia, as part of the effort to counter the broader threat posed by malicious cyber activities by foreign actors, the ‘National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Act 2018’ (NSLA) was recently passed into law. The NSLA was primarily introduced to address the threat of foreign interference in its political processes,¹² but it also contains provisions relating to foreign cyber activities against Australia’s CI. These include a range of new sabotage offences designed to ‘criminalise conduct causing damage to a broad range of critical infrastructure where it could prejudice Australia’s national security’.¹³ For example, under the NSLA it is a criminal offence to engage in conduct that results in damage to Australia’s infrastructure where this is done on behalf of a foreign actor and it undermines Australia’s national ⁶ Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, ASIO Annual Report 2020-21 (2021) 5 <https: annual%20report%202020-21%20web.pdf=\"\"default=\"\"files=\"\"sites=\"\"www.asio.gov.au=\"\">.\n⁷ The White House, ‘National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America’ 3 <https: 09=\"\"2018=\"\"annual%20report%202020-21%20web.pdf=\"\"files=\"\"national-cyber-strategy.pdf=\"\"uploads=\"\"wp-content=\"\"www.wytimes.com=\"\">.\n⁸ See Marko Milanovic and Michael Schmitt, ‘Cyber Attacks and Cyber (Mis)information Operations During a Pandemic’ (2020) 11 JNSLP 247.\n⁹ David Sanger, Clifford Krauss, and Nicole Perlroth, ‘Cyberattack Forces a Shutdown of a Top U.S. Pipeline’ The New York Times (8 May 2021) <https: 05=\"\"2021=\"\"09=\"\"a=\"\"cw=\"\"cw-weights=\"\"for=\"\"hyperattack-colonial-pipeline.html=\"\"upolitics=\"\"us=\"\"politics=\"\"paucities=\"\"www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n¹⁰ Julie Bishop, ‘Statement for Plenary Session on International Peace and Security, Global Conference on Cyberspace’ Minister for Foreign Affairs The Hon Julie Bishop MP (17 April 2015) <https: 05=\"\"2021-06-16=\"\"2021=\"\"julie-bishop=\"\"minister=\"\"minister.julie-bishop=\"\"speech=\"\"www.foreignminister.gov.au=\"\">.\n¹¹ Vladimir Soldatkin and Humeyra Pamuk, ‘Biden Tells Putin Certain Cyberattacks should be “Off-limits”’ Reuters (17 June 2021) <https: biden-tells-putin-certain-cyber-attacks-should-be-off-limits-2021-06-16=\"\"technology=\"\"www.reuters.com=\"\">.\n¹² See Henry Belot, ‘Malcolm Turnbull Announces Biggest Overhaul of Espionage, Intelligence Laws in Decades’ ABC News (5 December 2017) <https: 2017-12-05=\"\"news=\"\"turnbull-announces-foreign-interference-laws=\"\"www.abc.net.au=\"\">; Louise Yaxley, ‘Sam Dastyari and the Murky Links with Chinese Businessmen that Ended his Political Career’ ABC News (12 December 2017) <http: 2017-12-12=\"\"9249216=\"\"am-dastyari-murky-links-with-chinese-businessmen-ended-career=\"\"news=\"\"www.abc.net.au=\"\">.\n¹³ National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Act 2018 (Cth) (NSLA Act) sch 1 pt 1 div 82–Sabotage; Revised Explanatory Memorandum, National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017 (Cth) 62 [137].</http:></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:> SAMULI HAATAJA security.¹⁴ Similarly, it is a criminal offence to introduce vulnerabilities – such as the installation of malicious software (malware) or creation of backdoors – onto public infrastructure where this is done to undermine Australia's national security.¹⁵ As such, the NSLA includes offences that specifically apply to activities involved in the preparation of potential future intrusions into, for example, Australian government networks and systems.¹⁶ However, while Australia has legislated to protect CI from foreign cyber activities on a domestic level, international agreement around what activities or sectors are to be ‘off limits’ is necessary to ensure the protection of CI from state-sponsored cyber threats.\n## Definitions of critical infrastructure Part of the problem around what activities or sectors should be ‘off limits’ revolves around differences in what constitutes CI among states. As highlighted by Australia’s former foreign minister above, there is no universal definition of CI and states in fact have the ability to designate any infrastructure asset as CI. Generally, CI includes various infrastructures such as those related to energy, health and transportation, and many of these infrastructures are dual-use. In Australia, for example, CI is defined as referring to the physical facilities, supply chains, information technologies and communication networks which, if destroyed, degraded or rendered unavailable for an extended period, would significantly impact on the social or economic wellbeing of the nation or affect Australia’s ability to conduct national defence and ensure national security.¹⁷ In Australia, CI thus ‘provides services that are essential for everyday life such as energy, communications, water, transport, health, food and grocery, banking and finance and the Australian Government’.¹⁸ The United Kingdom (UK) in turn adopts the term ‘critical national infrastructure’ and this refers to the ‘critical elements of infrastructure (namely, assets, facilities, systems, networks or processes and the essential workers that operate and facilitate them)’ where the loss or compromise of those elements would result in a ‘major detrimental impact on the availability, integrity or delivery of essential services’ and/or a ‘significant impact on national security, national defence or the functioning of the state’.¹⁹ In the US, CI refers to ‘systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the US that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety or any combination of those matters’.²⁰ The ‘critical infrastructure sectors’, as identified by the recently established US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, include 16 sectors across energy, commerce, finance, food and agriculture, healthcare, emergency services, water, waste, transportation and defence.²¹ In the European Union (EU), CI refers to ¹⁴ NSLA Act (n 13) ss 82.3, 82.4.\n¹⁵ See NSLA Act (n 13) ss 82.7, 82.8.\n¹⁶ Revised NSLA Explanatory Memorandum (n 13) 80 [236].\n¹⁷ Commonwealth of Australia, Critical Infrastructure Resilience Strategy: Policy Statement (2015) 8 <https: criticalinfrastructureresiliencestrategypolicystatement.pdf=\"\"site%20documents=\"\"www.tisn.gov.au=\"\">.\n¹⁸ Australian Government, ‘What is the Critical Infrastructure Centre?’ Critical Infrastructure Centre <https: ctc-factsheet-what-is-critical-infrastructure-centre.pdf=\"\"files=\"\"nat-security=\"\"www.homeaffairs.gov.au=\"\">.\n¹⁹ Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure, ‘Critical National Infrastructure’ (2020) <https: critical-national-infrastructure-0=\"\"www.cpni.gov.uk=\"\">.\n²⁰ USA Patriot Act of 2001, 42 USC §§5195c(e), 1016(e).\n²¹ United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, ‘Critical Infrastructure Sectors’ (24 March 2020) <https: critical-infrastructure-sectors=\"\"www.cisa.gov=\"\">.</https:></https:></https:></https:> CYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 417 an asset, system or part thereof located in Member States which is essential for the maintenance of vital societal functions, health, safety, security, economic or social well-being of people, and the disruption or destruction of which would have a significant impact in a Member State as a result of the failure to maintain those functions.²² This essentially refers to the physical infrastructure which is vital for the proper functioning of society. The EU uses the term ‘critical information infrastructure’ (CII) to describe both the essential information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructures and those that are essential for the operation of its physical CI.²³ At the United Nations (UN) level, states have noted in a General Assembly resolution on the ‘creation of a global culture of cybersecurity and the protection of critical information infrastructures’ that CI involves, among other things, the infrastructures used for ‘the generation, transmission and distribution of energy, air and maritime transport, banking and financial services, e-commerce, water supply, food distribution and public health’ and that these infrastructures are increasingly interconnected with CII.²⁴ But here too it is recognized that each state has the right to determine what constitutes its CI.²⁵ Accordingly, in the Australian, UK, US, EU and UN contexts, CI refers to infrastructures essential to the proper functioning and well-being of the state and society. The term encompasses physical infrastructures (such as power plants and hospitals) located within a state’s territory, as well as the virtual infrastructure allowing the physical components to operate. Generally, this infrastructure is critical where its disruption or destruction would have a detrimental impact (whether significant, major, debilitating and so on) on the provision of key services that relate to the social or economic well-being of the state or its national security. However, states also have the prerogative to designate any infrastructure assets or sectors as critical. For example, the above UK definition includes the human personnel required to operate CI, and in Australia, the relevant government minister has the power to designate any asset as critical.²⁶ As such, while there are core sectors that most states consider to constitute CI, the scope of what constitutes CI is subjective as evident in the differences in terminology and approaches that states adopt in determining this. Consequently, when considering relevant laws and norms surrounding CI protection, there is uncertainty about the specific infrastructures against which malicious cyber activities are prohibited.\n## Cyber operations against critical infrastructure In addition to the 2020 cyber attacks against Australia, there are various other examples of known incidents differing in kind and intensity from low-level information collection operations to more disruptive and even destructive attacks against states’ CI. For example, in 2010 the infamous Stuxnet malware was discovered which had infected an Iranian uranium enrichment facility and, by changing the settings according to which the centrifuge machines operated, caused physical damage to approximately 1000 centrifuges.²⁷ Similarly, in a non-destructive but highly disruptive attack, in December 2015 parts of Ukraine’s power grid were shut down for ²² Council Directive 2008/114/EC of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection [2008] OJ L 345/75 art 2.\n²³ Commission of the European Communities, ‘Green Paper on a European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection’ (COM/2005/576 final, 17 November 2005) 19.\n²⁴ United Nations General Assembly, UNGA Res 58/199 (23 December 2003) UN Doc A/RES/58/199, 1.\n²⁵ Ibid.\n²⁶ See ss 50 and 51 of the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 (Cth).\n²⁷ Joby Warrick, ‘Iran’s Natanz Nuclear Facility Recovered Quickly from Stuxnet Cyberattack’ The Washington Post (16 February 2011) <http: 02=\"\"15=\"\"2011=\"\"ar2011021505395.html=\"\"content=\"\"article=\"\"wp-dyn=\"\"www.washingtonpost.com=\"\">.

These operations can be used to gather information that can potentially be used in preparation for more disruptive future operations.³⁰ As an example, in 2018 the US Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation released a report on Russian cyber activities targeting its energy and other CI sectors.³¹ According to this report, Russian actors had since at least 2016 ‘targeted government entities and multiple US critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy, nuclear, commercial facilities, water, aviation and critical manufacturing sectors’.³² This was characterized by these agencies ‘as a multi-stage intrusion campaign by Russian government cyber actors’ in which these actors obtained unauthorized access to various networks and installed malware allowing them to conduct reconnaissance and collect information about industrial control systems.³³ Similarly, in 2019 it was reported that the US had moved beyond mere reconnaissance operations into Russia’s power grid to the placement of malware onto those systems that could be used to disrupt its operation.³⁴ Furthermore, in December 2020, it was reported that Russia had, through software provided by the company SolarWinds, compromised a range of US government agencies³⁵ and companies responsible for CI in the electricity, oil and manufacturing industries.³⁶ While the SolarWinds incident is mainly understood to have compromised data in the affected sectors, Anne Neuberger, the US Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology, expressed concerns that Russia’s ability to access these systems has the potential to be used for disruptive operations in the future.³⁷ And in January 2022, during increased tensions between the US and Russia in the lead-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the US Cybersecurity Advisory issued an advisory encouraging the US cybersecurity community and especially CI operators ‘to adopt a heightened state of awareness’ given the threat posed by Russian-state-sponsored cyber operations against US CI.³⁸ Accordingly, states like the US and Russia are using malicious cyber operations to obtain unauthorized access and maintaining a ‘persistent presence’ in other states’ CI systems. The concern is that these preparatory cyber operations can be used to damage or disrupt the operation of CI in the future.\n²⁸ See Kim Zetter, ‘Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid’ Wired (3 March 2016) <https: 03=\"\"2016=\"\"03=\"\"inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid=\"\"www.wired.com=\"\">.\n²⁹ David Sanger, ‘Utilities Cautioned about Potential for a Cyberattack’ The New York Times (29 February 2016) <https: 03=\"\"2016=\"\"00=\"\"http:=\"\"us=\"\"politics=\"\"politics.cautioned-about-potential-for-a-cyberattack-after-ukraines.html=\"\"www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n³⁰ See Symantec Critical Attack Discovery and Intelligence Team, ‘Dragonfly: Western Energy Sector Targeted by Sophisticated Attack Group’ Symantec Threat Intelligence (20 October 2017) <https: dragonfly-energy-sector-cyber-attacks=\"\"blogs=\"\"symantec-blogs.broadcom.com=\"\">.\n³¹ United States Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation, ‘Russian Government Cyber Activity Targeting Energy and Other Critical Infrastructure Sectors’ (Technical Alert TA18-074A, 15 March 2018) <https: alerts=\"\"a18-074a=\"\"ncas=\"\"ta18-074a=\"\"www.us-cert.gov=\"\">.\n³² Ibid.\n³³ Ibid.\n³⁴ David Sanger and Nicole Perlroth, ‘U.S. Escalates Online Attacks on Russia’s Power Grid’ The New York Times (15 June 2019) <https: 06=\"\"15=\"\"2019=\"\"us=\"\"politics=\"\"prurip-cyber-russia-grid.html=\"\"www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n³⁵ David Sanger, ‘Russian Hackers Broke into Federal Agencies, U.S. Officials Suspect’ The New York Times (13 December 2020) <https: 12=\"\"2020=\"\"22=\"\"2020=\"\"politics=\"\"russian-hackers-us-government-treasury-commerce.html?=\"\"www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n³⁶ Kim Zetter, ‘SolarWinds Hack Infected Critical Infrastructure, including Power Industry’ The Intercept (25 December 2020) <https: 02=\"\"2020=\"\"22=\"\"24=\"\"solarwinds-hack-power-infrastructure=\"\"theintercept.com=\"\">.\n³⁷ David Sanger, ‘After Russian Cyberattack, Looking for Answers and Debating Retaliation’ The New York Times (23 February 2021) <https: 02=\"\"2021=\"\"23=\"\"polities=\"\"solarwinds-hack-senate-intelligence-russia.html=\"\"www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n³⁸ Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, ‘Understanding and Mitigating Russian State Sponsored Cyber Threats to U.S. Critical Infrastructure’ (11 January 2022) 1 <https: 02=\"\"2022=\"\"23=\"\"default=\"\"files=\"\"publications=\"\"us=\"\"uscert=\"\"sites=\"\"www.cisa.gov=\"\"uscert=\"\"publications=\"\"uscertisites=\"\"></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:> CYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 419 This concern crystallized during the war in Ukraine in 2022 which involved a range of cyber operations and activities that Russia had pre-positioned for.³⁹ # NORMS OF RESPONSIBLE STATE BEHAVIOUR IN CYBERSPACE The international security issues surrounding states' use of digital technologies and activities in cyberspace have been considered at the UN level since the late 1990s, and in this context, states have agreed to norms around responsible behaviour in cyberspace including around CI protection. Since 1998, the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) of the UN General Assembly has regularly considered 'Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security'.⁴⁰ In 2004 it established a Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) to examine existing and potential threats from cyberspace.⁴¹ A second GGE was established in 2009 and it issued a consensus report in 2010⁴² which highlighted the risk of how '[t]he growing use of ICTs in critical infrastructures creates new vulnerabilities and opportunities for disruption'.⁴³ It also recommended that states should engage in further dialogue 'to discuss norms pertaining to State use of ICTs, to reduce collective risk and protect critical national and international infrastructure'.⁴⁴ This was echoed in the 2013 report from the third GGE which also, for the first time, confirmed the general application of international law and UN Charter principles in the cyber context.⁴⁵ The 2015 report by the fourth GGE was significant as it introduced a set of norms for responsible state behaviour in their use of ICTs.⁴⁶ The UN General Assembly also passed resolutions in 2018 and 2019 on 'Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security' where it called on states to be guided by the UN GGE reports and these norms in their use of ICTs.⁴⁷ This was echoed in the 2021 consensus report of the UN Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security in which states emphasized the importance of these norms.⁴⁸ From these norms, three are particularly relevant to CI protection. Norm (g) provides that states should take appropriate measures to protect their own CI, and norm (h) provides that states should mitigate malicious cyber activities emanating from their territory that are directed against the CI of other states.⁴⁹ Of most relevance to malicious cyber operations against CI, however, is norm (f). It provides that: ³⁹ Microsoft, 'Special Report: Ukraine' (27 April 2022) § <https: am=\"\"app=\"\"am=\"\"binary=\"\"re4vwwd=\"\"query.prod.cms=\"\"re4vwwd=\"\"www.cms=\"\">.\n⁴⁰ United Nations General Assembly, Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, GA Res 53/70, UN Doc A/RES/53/70 (4 January 1999).\n⁴¹ United Nations Secretary-General, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security: Report of the Secretary-General, UN Doc A/60/202 (5 August 2005).\n⁴² United Nations Secretary-General, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security: Note by the Secretary-General, UN Doc A/65/201 (30 July 2010).\n⁴³ Ibid 7.\n⁴⁴ Ibid 8.\n⁴⁵ United Nations Secretary-General, Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/68/98 (24 June 2013) 2.\n⁴⁶ United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/70/174 (22 July 2015) 8.\n⁴⁷ See United Nations General Assembly, Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/RES/73/266 (2 January 2019); United Nations General Assembly, Advancing Responsible State Behaviours in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/RES/74/28 (18 December 2019).\n⁴⁸ United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, 'Final Substantive Report' (10 March 2021) 4–5 <https: 03=\"\"2021=\"\"front.un-arm.org=\"\"uploads=\"\"wp-content=\"\"wpr2.pdf=\"\"uploads=\"\">.\n⁴⁹ See Michael Berk, 'Recommendation 13(g) and (h)' in United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (ed), Voluntary, Non-Binding Norms for Responsible State Behaviour in the Use of Information and Communications Technology: A Commentary (United Nations Publication 2017).</https:></https:> SAMULI HAATAJA A State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity contrary to its obligations under international law that intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public.⁵⁰ Prima facie, norm (f) specifically prohibits cyber operations against the CI of other states. According to the commentary to the norms, it reflects consensus about the unique importance of CI to modern societies and a recognition of the possibility of conflicts to escalate where state-to-state cyber activities adversely impact CI in particular.⁵¹ However, despite this apparent consensus, there is debate about the legal status of norm (f) and its relationship to international law. In particular, it is unclear whether it seeks to create new non-binding expectations of responsible state behaviour or to reaffirm the application of existing binding rules of international law.\nThis lack of clarity arises because norm (f) is explicitly included as a 'voluntary, non-binding' norm in the 2015 UN GGE report, and all of the norms are located in a separate section to the question of how international law applies to ICT activities.⁵² Yet the wording of norm (f) expressly refers to a state's 'obligations under international law' – that is, binding, opposed to voluntary and non-binding obligations – resulting in what others have described as a 'contradiction in terms'.⁵³ The confusion about the legal status of norm (f) is also evident among states who generally regard the norms as conceptually distinct from international law.⁵⁴ For example, Australia, in its 2017 'Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy', expresses a commitment to these norms and notes that international law can be complemented with these norms, but treats the two as distinct.⁵⁵ The US has also expressed a commitment to the promotion of these norms but regards them as conceptually distinct from international law. This is evident in the US Cyber Strategy which includes as one of its pillars the preservation of peace through strength,⁵⁶ and the means of doing so is through the promotion of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace based on international law on one hand, and 'voluntary non-binding norms' on the other.⁵⁷ Similarly, the ASEAN-EU Statement on Cybersecurity Cooperation distinguishes between the application of international law in the cyber context and, separately, acknowledges 'that voluntary and non-binding norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour of States in the use of ICTs can reduce risks to international peace, security and stability'.⁵⁸ The distinction between the non-binding norms and binding international law obligations is also evident in academic commentary. For example, according to Harriet Moynihan, norm (f) 'does not represent a binding obligation on states' and merely demonstrates 'their concern to protect ⁵⁰ UN GGE 2015 report (n 46) 8.\n⁵¹ Jason Jolley, 'Recommendation 13 (f)' in United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (ed) Voluntary, Non-Binding Norms for Responsible State Behaviour in the Use of Information and Communications Technology: A Commentary (United Nations Publication 2017) 169–70.\n⁵² UN GGE 2015 report (n 46) 7.\n⁵³ Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco, and Talita de Souza Dias, 'Drawing the Cyber Baseline: The Applicability of Existing International Law to the Governance of Information and Communication Technologies' (2022) 99 ILS 4, 32.\n⁵⁴ Liisi Adamson, 'International Law and International Cyber Norms: A Continuum?' in Dennis Broeders and Bibi van den Berg (eds) Governing Cyberspace: Behavior, Power, and Diplomacy (Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2020) 25, 33.\n⁵⁵ Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 'Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy' 47–8 <https: 2020-11=\"\"default=\"\"files=\"\"the%20strategy.pdf=\"\"www.internationalcybertech.gov.au=\"\"sites=\"\">; Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 2019 Progress Report, Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy (2019).\n⁵⁶ The White House (7) 20.\n⁵⁷ Ibid.\n⁵⁸ Association of South East Asian Nations, 'ASEAN-EU Statement on Cybersecurity Cooperation' Association of South East Asian Nations [6]–[7] <https: 08=\"\"2019=\"\"asean.org=\"\"asean-eu-statement-on-cybersecurity-cooperation-final.pdf=\"\"storage=\"\">.</https:></https:> CYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE The commentary to the norms, published by the UN Office for Disarmament Affairs,⁶¹ elaborates on key elements of norm (f) including its relationship with international law.⁶² Here it is noted that it is unclear 'why the [UN Group of Governmental] Experts have offered as voluntary something that by the majority of states is considered legally binding'.⁶³ The commentary explains that norm (f) is premised on the law of state responsibility and was intended to reaffirm that states' existing legal obligations extend to their cyber activities.⁶⁴ This is evident, for example, from the phrase 'conduct[s] or knowingly support[s]' within the wording of norm (f) which encompasses relevant rules of attribution of conduct under international law on state responsibility.⁶⁵ The phrase 'contrary to its obligations' in turn refers to states' existing obligations under international law and includes, for example, the prohibition on the use of force and relevant international humanitarian law obligations.⁶⁶ Therefore, according to the commentary, despite being expressly included as a voluntary and non-binding norm, norm (f) was intended to reaffirm states' existing legal obligations in relation to CI.⁶⁷ Accordingly, the precise legal status of norm (f) is unclear and others have raised concerns about the implications of this. Writing in relation to the cyber norms generally, Kubo Mačák highlights how 'non-binding norms can never override binding legal rules' and, in the reverse, that 'a non-binding norm cannot permit action that would otherwise be forbidden by international law'.⁶⁸ He maintains that the distinction is important as only a violation of international law can trigger obligations of cessation and reparation under the law on state responsibility.⁶⁹ François Delerue, Frédérick Douzet and Aude Géry in turn maintain that the distinction between international law and norms 'complexifies the definition of rights and obligations for the states in cyberspace as it introduces a confusion on the nature of the rules'.⁷⁰ They argue that by separating the two, the potential implication is that the norm is autonomous and detached from international law and that state behaviour in cyberspace is based only on the goodwill of states and not legal obligations.⁷¹ Similarly, Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco and Talita de Souza Dias argue that the inclusion of norm (f) as a voluntary, non-binding norm by the UN GGE can ⁵⁹ Harriet Moynihan, 'The Application of International Law to State Cyberattacks Sovereignty and Non-intervention' (Chatham House Research Paper 2019) 44 <https: 12=\"\"2019=\"\"application-international-law-state-cyberattacks=\"\"www.chathamhouse.org=\"\">.\n⁶⁰ Dennis Broeders, Els de Busser, Fabio Cristiano, and Tatiana Tropina, 'Revisiting Past Cyber Operations in Light of New Cyber Norms and Interpretations of International Law: Inching towards Lines in the Sand?'

He gives the example that 'if a State conducts a cyber operation that amounts to a prohibited intervention in the internal affairs of another State, it is legally obliged to cease its wrongful conduct (if it is continuing) and to provide full reparation to the injured State for the harm caused'.\n⁷⁰ François Delerue, Frédérick Douzet and Aude Géry, 'The Geopolitical Representations of International Law in the International Negotiations on the Security and Stability of Syberspace' (Report No. 75, IRSEM/EU Cyber Direct, November 2020) 29.\n⁷¹ Ibid 32.</https:> SAMULI HAATAJA have the effect of reducing well-established rules of international law to 'non-binding recommendations'.[72] The 2021 UN OEWG report seeks to clarify the role of the norms and their relationship to international law, but it ultimately reaffirms the conceptual distinction between the two. It provides that the 'norms do not replace or alter' binding obligations under international law, and do not seek to limit or prohibit action that is otherwise consistent with international law.\"[73] Instead, the norms 'provide additional specific guidance' on what constitutes responsible state behaviour in the cyber context.[74] As such, the legal status of norm (f) is contradictory given it was both intended to reaffirm states' legal obligations in relation to CI and, without replacing or altering the law, to provide non-binding additional specific guidance on what constitutes responsible state behaviour in this context. This is problematic as it is unclear what kinds of cyber operations are prohibited by binding international law obligations in contrast to those that are only contrary to non-binding norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.\nIn addition to its legal status, the commentary to norm (f) also discusses the degree of harm that is required for the norm to be violated. Norm (f) refers to activities that 'intentionally damage[] critical infrastructure or otherwise impair[] the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public'.[75] Essentially, this involves two types of harm: either intentional damage to CI or the use and operation of CI is impaired in its provision of services to the public. The commentary elaborates on both of these. In relation to the first, this requires a state to deliberately cause damage to CI irrespective of whether the damage impacts public services connected to the CI. Here the degree of damage is irrelevant as long as the damage is physical in nature.[76] Given the requirement of intention, however, where a state unintentionally causes physical damage to CI (provided it does not impair the use or operation of CI in its provision of services to the public) then this would fall outside the scope of norm (f).[77] The second type of harm involves situations where a cyber operation does not cause any damage but impairs the use and operation of CI in its provision of services to the public. According to the commentary, impairment in this context refers to: any damage, physical or electronic, including the loss of data or software, or interruption of digital services provided by critical infrastructure, that makes the critical infrastructure less effective, less valuable, operate worse, or inhibit use by the public, the threshold being that the public must be impacted, even minimally.[78] As such, the term 'impairment' encompasses physical impairment but does not require it, and captures a range of circumstances where the functionality of CI is undermined provided it results in a detrimental impact on its use by the public. This excludes cyber operations that do not disrupt the operation of CI, as well as cyber operations that disrupt the operation of CI without any impact on the public.[79] Unlike the requirement for intentional damage, the need for impairment is based on a strict liability approach where there is no need for the responsible state to have intended to cause the impairment.[80] In summary, states have agreed to norms of responsible behaviour in cyberspace at the UN level including norm (f) which specifically prohibits certain cyber operations against CI.\n\nCYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 433 However, the legal status of norm (f) is contradictory. On one hand, it seeks to reaffirm states' existing obligations in relation to CI and is not intended to modify those obligations. On the other, it provides non-binding 'additional specific guidance' on responsible state behaviour in this context, particularly in relation to the degree of harm that should not be caused to CI.⁸¹ As will be demonstrated below, this guidance is concerning as it is inconsistent with the harm requirements under international law, and this further compounds existing uncertainties about how the law applies in this context.⁸² # INTERNATIONAL LAW AND CYBER OPERATIONS This section examines how relevant rules of international law that norm (f) reaffirms apply to state activities in cyberspace. The focus is on three primary areas of international law that provide limits to cyber operations in peacetime, namely the law on the use of force, non-intervention and sovereignty. These are of particular relevance to cyber operations attributable to states targeting another state's CI given the broad spectrum of effects that remotely conducted cyber operations can cause.⁸³ There is widespread agreement that international law generally applies to state activities in cyberspace. This was highlighted in the 2015 UN GGE report which recognized that international law and the UN Charter in particular apply in the cyber context.⁸⁴ This was reaffirmed in the 2021 UN OEWG consensus report.⁸⁵ Despite this general agreement, however, there continues to be uncertainty about how particular rules of international law apply. As such, UN Member States have been invited to provide their national views on the UN GGE reports and to make submissions or provide working papers in connection with the UN OEWG which ran parallel to the UN GGE. In connection with these processes, states have provided more detailed accounts about how they consider the law to apply. The views of states are important as they contribute to more clarity about how international law applies in the cyber context, and to the development of customary international law applicable to state conduct in this context.⁸⁶ However, the different positions evident in these statements have given rise to some debate about how the law applies. The implication of this is that, while there are some areas where a degree of consensus is emerging, there continues to be a degree of uncertainty about when cyber operations against CI will violate international law.\n# Use of force A cyber operation that causes physical damage to CI can potentially violate the prohibition on the use of force. Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits states from the use of force. Force in this context is generally understood to refer to 'armed force'.⁸⁷ Despite being drafted in the ⁸¹ However, as Delerue, Douzet and Géry note, the non-binding norms nonetheless 'can contribute to the interpretation of existing obligations in international law, or to the formation of new international obligations'. Delerue, Douzet and Géry (n 70) 31.\n⁸² See section 5.\n⁸³ Other areas of law, such as international humanitarian law which applies in an armed conflict, while important given the dual-use nature of CI, are outside of the article's scope. On these obligations in relation to CI, see David Fidler 'Whither the Web?: International Law, Cybersecurity, and Critical Infrastructure Protection' (2015) 16 GJIA 8, 12. See also Jolley (n 51) 181-4.\n⁸⁴ UN GGE 2015 report (n 46) 12.\n⁸⁵ UN OEWG 2021 report (n 48) 5-6.\n⁸⁶ See United Nations General Assembly, UNGA Res 73/203 (20 December 2018) UN Doc A/RES/73/203.\n⁸⁷ See Albrecht Randelzhofer, 'Article 2(4)' in Bruno Simma and others (eds) The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary (Oxford University Press 2002) 117-21.\nSAMULI HAATAJA technological context of the 1940s, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has affirmed that the prohibition on the use of force applies 'to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.'88 In the cyber context, most states that have expressed their position on article 2(4) have adopted the approach that a cyber operation will constitute a use of force where its 'scale and effects' are comparable to a use of force by traditional kinetic means.89 This approach is similar to the one adopted by the 'Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations' (Tallinn Manual)90 – an influential but non-binding account by a group of experts about how international law applies in the cyber context91 – which provides in Rule 69 that '[a] cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.'92 Accordingly, where a cyber operation results in damage or destruction of physical property, or injury or death of human beings, it is likely to be considered to amount to a use of force in violation of article 2(4).\nHowever, where a cyber operation results in a loss of functionality of systems without causing physical damage, it is unclear whether this would be regarded as a use of force.93 Normally, economic or diplomatic pressure is not considered to be 'force' under article 2(4),94 and only the Netherlands has suggested that a cyber operation could constitute a use of force where it had 'a very serious financial or economic impact'.95 In contrast, New Zealand has maintained that a cyber operation causing significant loss of functionality to its CI would constitute a violation of the non-intervention principle, as opposed to the use of force.96 As such, there is uncertainty around whether cyber operations that do not cause physical effects can constitute violations of article 2(4).\n## Non-intervention A cyber operation against CI that falls below the use of force threshold can potentially constitute a violation of the non-intervention principle. This is a rule of customary international law that prohibits states from using coercive means to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another state as these are matters which states have the right to decide freely by virtue of their sovereignty. A violation of international law based on the non-intervention principle requires two elements. First, there must be coercive interference, and second, it must be directed towards the matters that sovereign states should be able to decide freely.97 CYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 435 Coercion is not defined in international law. The majority of the Tallinn Manual experts, for example, adopted a narrow approach to the term defining it as ‘an affirmative act designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way.’⁹⁸ They distinguished it from activities that seek to influence (as opposed to factually compel) a state to behave in a particular way such as public criticism or propaganda.⁹⁹ Others, however, have defined coercion more broadly as a form of pressure that seeks to deprive the target state of its free will.¹⁰⁰ This view was echoed by the minority of the Tallinn Manual experts who maintained that it is sufficient that the activity ‘has the effect of depriving the State of control over the matter in question.’¹⁰¹ This broader approach to coercion is also supported by some states in the cyber context. For example, according to Australia coercion involves ‘effectively deprive[ing] another state of the ability to control, decide upon or govern matters of an inherently sovereign nature.’¹⁰² Similarly, the German position maintains that coercion involves where a state’s ‘will is manifestly bent by the foreign State’s conduct.’¹⁰³ The second element requires that the coercion is directed at matters that states are able to decide freely by virtue of their sovereignty.¹⁰⁴ These include, according to the ICJ, the ‘choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy’.¹⁰⁵ States have also endorsed this view in the cyber context. Australia’s position is that the law requires the coercion to affect ‘matters of an inherently sovereign nature’,¹⁰⁶ according to the UK the coercion must affect ‘matters of government which are at the heart of a state’s sovereignty’,¹⁰⁷ and for New Zealand, coercion must deprive the state from control over ‘matters falling within the scope of its inherently sovereign functions’.¹⁰⁸ A number of states have also provided examples of situations in which the non-intervention principle would be violated in the cyber context. Many states, including Australia,¹⁰⁹ the UK,¹¹⁰ the US¹¹¹ ⁹⁸ Schmitt (n 90) 317 citing Robert Y Jennings and Arthur Watts (eds), *Oppenheim’s International Law, Volume 1, Peace* (9ᵗʰ edn Longman 1992) 430–1.\n⁹⁹ Schmitt (n 90) 318.\n¹⁰⁰ Moynihan (n 59) 30.\n¹⁰¹ Schmitt (n 90) 318.\n¹⁰² Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, ‘Australia’s International Cyber Engagement Strategy, 2019 International Law Supplement’ (2019) 5 <https: 2020-11=\"\"2019%20legal%20supplement_0.pdf=\"\"default=\"\"files=\"\"sites=\"\"www.internationalcybertech.gov.au=\"\">.\n¹⁰³ The Federal Government of Germany (n 89) 5.\n¹⁰⁴ The concept of domaine réservé (reserved domain) is often used to refer to matters within the exclusive domestic jurisdiction of states (see Katja Ziegler, ‘Domaine Réservé’ in *Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law* (Oxford University Press 2013)) and this is sometimes distinguished from the broader state functions that states have the authority to exercise. For example, the Tallinn Manual distinguishes between a state’s ‘inherently governmental functions’ (relevant for a sovereignty violation) from the concept of domaine réservé (relevant to the non-intervention principle). Schmitt (n 90) 24. However, it is argued that the notion of ‘matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely’ (using the ICJ’s wording) is preferred. This is not confined to a state’s internal affairs as it also includes their external affairs (eg membership of international organisations, and decisions to recognise states) which can be subject to coercive interference. Additionally, even if a matter is regulated by international law (and thus it is no longer within a state’s domaine réservé meaning the state no longer has exclusive regulatory authority over the matter), the state still has the authority to make choices within that area of law. As such, the ‘matters that sovereign states are permitted to decide freely’ is a more useful concept opposed to the narrow notion of a state’s domaine réservé.

Australia and the UK also maintain that using cyber means involving coercion to undermine the stability of their financial system would constitute a violation.¹¹³ This is echoed by New Zealand which also maintains that disruptive cyber operations against its healthcare system, electricity network or telecommunications network would, where coercive, constitute violations of the non-intervention principle.¹¹⁴ Accordingly, cyber operations without physical effects can constitute violations of the non-intervention principle. However, this requires the element of coercion but the identity and intention of the state responsible for a cyber operation can be difficult to determine in the cyber context. This leads to uncertainty around whether cyber operations without physical effects that fall below the use of force threshold constitute violations of the non-intervention principle.\n## Sovereignty Finally, cyber operations against CI can also constitute violations of sovereignty. Sovereignty generally refers to a state's supreme authority within its territory, and it involves three interrelated rights and correlating duties in relation to a state's territorial sovereignty, independence and sovereign equality.¹¹⁵ In relation to territorial sovereignty, usually non-consensual activities within a state's territory, such as flying military aircraft over its airspace without permission, or navigating a vessel through its territorial sea without its consent are prohibited. In the cyber context, while states agree that sovereignty extends to the cyber infrastructure within their territory, there is uncertainty around whether and the threshold at which remotely conducted cyber operations will violate sovereignty. This is a critical question given that international law is largely silent on espionage conducted by states, and this means that states are generally permitted to engage in cyber espionage.¹¹⁶ This uncertainty about whether and when a cyber operation violates sovereignty arises from the debate about whether or not sovereignty operates as a rule of international law independent of the use of force and non-intervention principles that prohibits certain malicious cyber activities. According to the 'sovereignty as a rule' approach, sovereignty operates as a primary rule of international law that can be violated, and under certain circumstances, remotely conducted cyber operations can amount to violations of sovereignty. The Tallinn Manual advocated for this approach,¹¹⁷ and a growing number of states have adopted this approach including the Netherlands,¹¹⁸ France,¹¹⁹ Austria,¹²⁰ ¹¹² Finnish Government, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, 'Finland Published Its Positions on Public International Law in Cyberspace' (15 October 2020) <https: en=\"\"full=\"\"valtioneuvosto.fi=\"\"valtioneuvosto.fi=\"\"> / 'finland-published-its-positions-on-public-international-law-in-cyberspace'.\n¹¹³ Wright (n 107); Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy, 2019 International Law Supplement (n 102) 5.\n¹¹⁴ New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade (n 89).\n¹¹⁵ Moynihan (n 59) 11.\n¹¹⁶ See Russell Buchan, Cyber Espionage and International Law.

Cyber espionage is defined here as the use of cyber means to copy confidential data from computer systems or networks without authorisation. Buchan (n 116) 17–18. However, this does not mean that any form of cyber espionage is permitted. Instead, determining whether cyber espionage violates international law will depend on the techniques involved and the effects caused by the cyber operation. As noted by the Tallinn Manual, the 'mere characterisation of a cyber operation as espionage or not has no legal significance...

For example, the Netherlands did not define the boundary at which it considers its sovereignty to be violated,¹²⁷ and Austria similarly remained silent on this issue.¹²⁸ The French position in turn suggests that it considers a cyber operation that merely involves the ‘unauthorized penetration’ of its computer systems to be a violation of its sovereignty.¹²⁹ Iran’s position similarly suggests that it would also view any unlawful intrusions into its (public or private) cyber infrastructure as violations of its sovereignty, as well as those that are destructive or disruptive and undermine its national security.¹³⁰ In contrast, however, according to New Zealand not ‘every unauthorized intrusion’ into another state’s ICT systems or even all cyber activities that cause effects on another state’s territory constitutes a violation of territorial sovereignty.¹³¹ Here it makes reference to cyber espionage activities and ‘a range of circumstances’ in which even cyber operations that cause effects in the territory of another state will not violate international law.¹³² Finland has maintained that a violation of sovereignty will be determined on a case-by-case basis depending on the ‘nature and consequences’ of the unauthorized cyber intrusion.¹³³ The Czech Republic considers that cyber operations that violate sovereignty include those that cause significant physical damage or harm to individuals and those that damage or disrupt the operation of cyber or other infrastructure where it has a ‘significant impact on national security, economy, public health or environment’.¹³⁴ Similarly, according to Germany, a cyber operation that causes ‘physical effects and harm’ in another state’s territory will violate sovereignty, as well as disruptive cyber operations, particularly where they cause ‘substantive secondary or indirect physical effects’ in another state’s territory.¹³⁵ As such, while some states agree that, at least cyber operations that cause physical damage or harm to individuals within another state’s territory will violate their ¹²¹ Czech Republic, ‘Statement by Richard Kadlčák at Open-ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security of the First Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations’ (11 February 2020) <https: 2020=\"\"20%20international%20law%2011.02.2020.pdf=\"\"cz%20statement%20www.nukib.cz=\"\"download=\"\"publications_en=\"\"www.nukib.cz=\"\">.\n¹²² Finnish Government, Ministry for Foreign Affairs (n 112).\n¹²³ Islamic Republic of Iran, ‘Declaration of General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran Regarding International Law Applicable to the Cyberspace’ NourNews (18 August 2020) <https: 53144=\"\"en=\"\"general-staff-of-iranian-armed-forces-warns-of-tough-reaction-to-any-cyber-threat=\"\"nournews.ir=\"\">.\n¹²⁴ New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade (n 89).\n¹²⁵ The Federal Government of Germany (n 89) 2.\n¹²⁶ Organisation of American States, Inter-American Judicial Committee, ‘International Law and State Cyber Operations’ (1 November 2020) 52 <http: docs=\"\"en=\"\"idc=\"\"international_law_and_state_cyber_operations_publication.pdf=\"\"sla=\"\"iajc=\"\"www.oas.org=\"\">.\n¹²⁷ Letter from the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (n 89) 3.\n¹²⁸ ‘Comments by Austria, Pre-Draft Report of the OEWG – ICT’ (n 120).\n¹²⁹ United Nations Secretary-General (n 119) 22. A similar position has been adopted by some recent academic commentators who argue that cyber operations amount to violations of sovereignty when they penetrate another state’s computers or networks even without physical damage of effects in the territory of the state. For example, Russell Buchan adopts this position and maintains that a violation occurs on the basis of the act of ‘the unauthorised intrusion into a domain protected by state sovereignty’. Buchan (n 116) 54. François Delerue also argues that ‘[i]f a cyber operation penetrates the cyber infrastructures in the territory of a foreign State, this would irrefutably constitute a violation of territorial sovereignty’.

Another example given is cyber operations that interfere ‘with any data or services which are essential for the exercise of inherently governmental functions, and thereby significantly disrupting the exercise of those functions; for example, distributing ransomware which encrypts the computers used by a government and thus significantly delaying the payment of retirement pensions’.\n¹³⁵ The Federal Government of Germany (n 89) 4.</http:></https:></https:> SAMULI HAATAJA territorial sovereignty, among other states there is no consensus on whether every unauthorized intrusion violates sovereignty or what degree of effects are required for a violation to occur.^[136]^ In contrast to the rule approach to sovereignty, according to the 'sovereignty as a principle' approach, sovereignty is a fundamental principle of international law involving a state's independent right to exercise state functions to the exclusion of others (the internal element), and the recognition of the absolute equality and independence of all states (the external element).^[137]^ However, sovereignty cannot be violated in its own right independent of other rules of international law that are based on it as it does not operate as a standalone primary rule of international law capable of being violated. This approach has been suggested by the US in a 2017 US Department of Defence memorandum (US DoD memo),^[138]^ and the UK has expressly adopted this position.^[139]^ From the sovereignty as a principle approach, given that sovereignty does not operate as a standalone rule of international law, it cannot be violated in itself. Instead, to amount to a violation of international law, a cyber operation needs to constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force or an intervention (ie a violation of existing rules of international law that arise from sovereignty).^[140]^ This means that, under this approach, a range of cyber operations are considered lawful under international law as they are not expressly prohibited. For example, according to the US DoD memo, sovereignty does not limit states from engaging in cyber activities 'that result in effects occurring on the infrastructure located in another State'.^[141]^ Similarly, according to the UK, the non-consensual interference into another state's computer networks is not a violation of their 'territorial sovereignty' because such a rule does not exist in international law in relation to cyber.^[142]^ As such, pursuant to the sovereignty as a principle approach, unauthorized cyber intrusions cannot constitute violations of sovereignty and will only amount to violations of international law where they rise to the threshold of a use of force or intervention and thus violate other existing rules of international law.\nTo summarize, when it comes to states' existing legal obligations most relevant to cyber operations that target or cause effects on another state's CI in peacetime, there is a degree of consensus in some areas but uncertainty in others. There is agreement that cyber operations will violate the prohibition on the use of force where their effects are similar to the use of armed force by kinetic means. However, there is no consensus around the precise threshold or about non-destructive but disruptive cyber operations in this context. The non-intervention principle generally applies to disruptive cyber operations provided they are coercive, however, this can be difficult to determine in the cyber context. Finally, while an increasing number of states have expressed support for the 'sovereignty as a rule' approach, there is no consensus on the threshold ^[136]^ The Tallinn Manual experts were also divided on this.

This is evident in the subjective nature of what constitutes CI within the scope of norm (f), and the additional specific guidance provided by norm (f) which contradicts some of the harm requirements under international law.\n# Norm (f) and CI\nNorm (f) applies to cyber operations against CI, however, despite that there are core sectors that most states consider to constitute CI, the notion of CI remains subjective. This means that the precise scope of norm (f) is not clearly defined. States have the prerogative to determine which infrastructures to designate as CI, $^{143}$ and, from 'critical information infrastructure' $^{144}$ and 'critical national infrastructure' $^{145}$ to 'national, transnational and supranational critical infrastructure' $^{146}$ — there is little consistency in the terminology adopted by states. The lack of agreement about what constitutes CI for the purposes of norm (f) can be problematic. For instance, election infrastructure in the US was only designated as critical in January 2017 following Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. $^{147}$ Some states have also been hesitant to designate specific sectors as CI due to concerns that this would implicitly condone malicious activities against sectors that are not specified. $^{148}$ The 2021 UN GGE report expressly acknowledges these concerns, noting that, even where a sector is not designated as CI, it does not amount to condoning malicious activities against those sectors. $^{149}$ Furthermore, even where states specify certain sectors as CI, they are not precluded from designating other sectors as such in the future. $^{150}$ There have also been calls to extend norm (f) to mention specific sectors, even if those sectors are already widely considered to be CI. For example, in February 2020 the International Committee of the Red Cross proposed extending the application of norm (f) to address the\n\nSAMULI HAATAJA 'particular vulnerability of health care facilities'¹⁵¹ in response to cyber operations against hospitals and vaccine research centres during the pandemic.\nWhile agreement about what sectors constitute CI for the purposes of norm (f) is useful in providing clarity for the scope of the norm, this introduces unnecessary additional complexity to how international law applies in this context. The contested nature of CI and focus on whether a sector is CI for the purposes of norm (f) has the potential to narrow the application of international law only to those sectors that states have agreed to constitute CI. The need for a cyber operation to affect CI also creates an additional requirement that is not evident in existing international law. This is because, irrespective of whether a sector is designated as CI or not, existing international law obligations apply to cyber operations causing effects in the territory of other states. For example, a cyber operation against election infrastructure rising to the level of a violation of sovereignty or intervention will constitute a violation of international law regardless of whether the victim state considers the infrastructure to be CI or not. Similarly, cyber operations against healthcare facilities causing sufficient effects will constitute violations of international law even if those sectors are not specifically mentioned in norm (f).¹⁵² Therefore, the focus on what constitutes CI for the purposes of norm (f), and the subjectivity of the concept of CI has the potential to introduce additional complexity to determining whether a cyber operation violates international law.\n## Norm (f) and uncertainty in international law Norm (f) seeks to reaffirm the existing legal obligations of states in relation to cyber operations against CI and provide additional specific guidance on responsible state behaviour in this context. However, the harm requirements within norm (f) are contradictory to those in international law, and this further compounds existing uncertainties in how the law applies to cyber operations targeting CI. As a result, there are a range of cyber operations that can constitute violations of international law but not norm (f), or vice versa.\nFor example, whether a cyber operation against CI constitutes a use of force will generally be determined based on its 'scale and effects'. Under this approach, there must be a degree of direct physical damage to the CI, or disruption of its functionality which causes damage or harm to individuals comparable to a use of force by kinetic means. The Stuxnet incident is generally considered to have crossed this threshold as it is reported to have caused damage to approximately 1000 centrifuge machines.¹⁵³ Assuming Stuxnet was attributable to a state, its use would have violated norm (f) as it caused intentional damage to CI and was contrary to the responsible state's international obligations.¹⁵⁴ However, a disruptive cyber operation with only adverse economic consequences would generally not constitute a use of force. This could include, for example, a cyber operation against a power grid that causes a temporary blackout without any indirect physical effects or harm to individuals. While a cyber operation of this kind would involve impairing the use of the CI and adversely impact its use for the public for the purposes of norm (f), it would unlikely violate a state's legal obligations under article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n¹⁵¹ International Committee of the Red Cross, 'Norms for Responsible State Behavior on Cyber Operations should Build on International Law' (11 February 2020) <https: document=\"\"en=\"\"norms-responsible-state-behavior-cyber-operations-should-build-international-law=\"\"www.icrc.org=\"\">. While norm (f) was not amended, the 2021 UN GGE report did specifically note how '[t]he COVID-19 pandemic heightened awareness of the critical importance of protecting health care and medical infrastructure and facilities, including through the implementation of the norms addressing critical infrastructure'. UN GGE 2021 report (n 150) 12.\n¹⁵² See Milanovic and Schmitt (n 8).\n¹⁵³ Haataja (n 93) 88–95.\n¹⁵⁴ See also Broeders and others (n 60) 4–7.</https:> CYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 441 For a cyber operation of this kind without direct physical effects to violate the non-intervention principle, there is a requirement that the operation was intended to be coercive and directed at matters states have the right to decide freely. For example, where a cyber operation causing a blackout was done with the intention of coercing the targeted state to reverse its policy of recognition of another state, this would constitute an unlawful intervention. But where the cyber operation does not involve the element of coercion directed at matters states should be freely able to decide (or the responsible state's intention is unknown), then the cyber operation would fall outside the scope of the non-intervention principle. This is despite the impairment of CI and its adverse impact on the public that is consistent with the harm requirement in norm (f). Whether a cyber operation of this kind violates sovereignty is also unsettled given the divergence in views among states on the issue.\nIn relation to cyber operations against CI and violations of sovereignty, consider, for example, where a state obtains unauthorised access to another state's power grid, election infrastructure or hospital systems and installs malware that gives it the ability to cause disruptive or destructive effects on that infrastructure at a later point in time. Whether a cyber operation of this kind violates sovereignty is unsettled as the precise boundaries of states' legal obligations in this context are still developing and evolving as more state practice emerges. According to France and Iran, which adopt the rule approach to sovereignty and consider any penetration of their networks to be a violation of sovereignty, this conduct would constitute a violation of international law at the point in time at which there is unauthorized access to their systems.[155] However, for states like the Czech Republic and New Zealand, merely obtaining unauthorised access or installing malware that does not impair the functioning of the systems would not constitute violations of sovereignty.[156] Instead, for these states, it is only at the point in time at which that malware is used to cause significant disruptive or destructive effects that the cyber operation would qualify as a violation of sovereignty. Similarly, for states like the UK adopting the principle approach to sovereignty, the cyber operation could not constitute a violation of international law unless and until it rises to the level of a use of force or involves coercion and violates the non-intervention principle.[157] Accordingly, a range of cyber operations that meet the harm requirements in norm (f) would fall outside of its scope because, given the uncertainty around how international law applies in this context, it would be unclear whether those operations also violate the law as required by norm (f).\nFurther compounding the uncertainty in how existing international law applies are the harm requirements of norm (f) that are not consistent with international law. Norm (f) requires 'intentional damage', but the intent is not a requisite element for most of the rules of international law outlined above. In relation to the prohibition on the use of force, there is no requirement for intention.[158] Instead, the approach adopted by most states and in the Tallinn Manual focuses on the 'scale and effects' of a cyber operation.[159] Similarly, intention is not a requirement for a violation of sovereignty.[160] While intention is an element of the non-intervention principle,[161] the focus of the law here is on the intention of the state applying the coercion and not SAMULI HAATAJA whether the particular technical effects – such as damage to CI – were intended or not. This means that there is no need for ‘intentional damage’ to be caused by a cyber operation for the non-intervention principle to be violated. Norm (f), however, specifically refers to intentional damage. As a result, where a state engages in a cyber operation against CI that causes unintentional damage to the CI, the activity could constitute a violation of sovereignty or a use of force but would fall outside the scope of the intentional damage contemplated by norm (f).¹⁶² The approach to impairment evident in norm (f) is useful in terms of the specificity of the requirement for an (even minimally) adverse impact on services provided to the public by the CI. This encompasses a very broad spectrum of cyber operations against CI, including disruptive cyber operations that may fall outside the scope of the prohibition on the use of force and the non-intervention principle. However, unless these cyber operations cause sufficient effects to constitute a use of force, or are accompanied by coercive intention and satisfy the non-intervention principle, they would fall outside the scope of existing international law and also outside of norm (f). As such, while the ‘additional specific guidance’ that norm (f) provides in its approach to impairment is useful given the broad spectrum of cyber operations against CI that it captures, there is uncertainty about whether most of such cyber operations would constitute violations of international law as required under norm (f).\nFinally, when considering low-level cyber operations used to pre-position or prepare for potentially destructive cyber operations against CI in peacetime, what is revealed is the dark side of norm (f) and existing international law in this context.¹⁶³ Given that these kinds of cyber operations do not cause immediate damage or impairment and, from a technical perspective, can be indistinguishable from cyber espionage, they are effectively permitted under existing international law and generally will not be seen to constitute violations of sovereignty. But much of CI is dual-use and this means that under certain conditions it can be lawfully subject to attack through cyber means in an armed conflict.¹⁶⁴ Essentially, except in circumstances where there is evidence of an imminent armed attack,¹⁶⁵ norm (f) and existing international law allow states to engage in cyber operations against CI that involve pre-positioning and preparing for potentially destructive effects in the future.¹⁶⁶ Therefore, norm (f) introduces additional complexity to the application of international law in this context, and this complexity is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are considered to be ‘off limits’. The subjective nature of what constitutes CI and the requirement for a sector to be CI to be captured by norm (f) creates a requirement that is not evident in international law and effectively narrows its application.\n¹⁶² However, where a cyber operation of this kind also has an adverse impact on the public then it would constitute impairment under the second type of harm within norm (f). This could amount to a violation of international law on sovereignty, but this is uncertain given the current debate about sovereignty.\n¹⁶³ The norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace only operate in peacetime. United States Department of Defence, ‘Cyber Strategy 2018’ (2018) 5 <https: 1=\"\"18=\"\"2002041658=\"\"2018=\"\"c=\"\"media.defense.gov=\"\"sep=\"\"spc=\"\"www.cyber_strategy_summary_final.pdf=\"\">; Broeders and others (n 60) 14–16.\n¹⁶⁴ The attack would need to be consistent with international humanitarian law obligations. See Fidler (n 83) 12; Jolley (n 51) 181–4. See also Broeders and others (n 60).\n¹⁶⁵ For example, according to Australia, states may exercise a right of anticipatory self-defence where ‘a threatened armed attack in the form of an offensive cyber operation’ that could be launched ‘in a split second’ and could cause ‘large-scale loss of human life and damage to critical infrastructure’. See George Brandis, ‘The Right of Self-Defence against Imminent Armed Attack in International Law’ (Lecture delivered at the University of Queensland, Brisbane, 11 April 2017) 8 <https: 05=\"\"2017=\"\"developments-international-law-self-defence-against-imminent-armed-attack=\"\"blog=\"\"law.uq.edu.au=\"\">. Similarly, according to NATO’s Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations, non-destructive cyber operations, such as those causing temporary disruptions of service or involving information gathering where they are conducted to enable a conventional threat – including an imminent threat of one – could be considered to trigger the right of self-defence. NATO, Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations, Allied Joint Publication-3.20 (NATO Standardisation Office 2020) 20 <https: 899678=\"\"attachment_data=\"\"government=\"\"file=\"\"doctrine_nato_cyberspace_operations_ajp_3_20_1_.pdf=\"\"uploads=\"\"www.cyber-systems_ajp_3_20_1_.pdf=\"\"www.cyber-docrine_nato_cyberspace_operations_ajp_3_20_1_.pdf=\"\">.\n¹⁶⁶ This prioritizes the security interests of states over the cyber security of CI systems. David Fidler, for example, suggests a new cyber-defence norm adopting an ‘all hazards’ strategy to protect CI that does not focus on the legal regime (whether cyber crime or espionage) but instead on ensuring ‘networks are protected against infiltrations from any source’. Fidler (n 83) 13</https:></https:></https:> CYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 443 International law obligations apply to cyber operations conducted by states irrespective of whether they target what the victim state has designated as CI or not. While there is a degree of uncertainty around the thresholds at which violations of international law on the use of force, intervention and sovereignty occur, the harm requirements in norm (f) have the potential to compound these uncertainties as they are not consistent with these rules of international law.\nAccordingly, more clarity about the relationship between international law and norm (f) is needed, and about how international law applies to cyber operations targeting sectors that states have deemed to be CI. This is particularly the case in relation to international law on sovereignty. Especially where low-level cyber operations without immediately disruptive or destructive effects are involved, more states need to provide detailed accounts of when they consider the law to be violated and the relationship between sovereignty and sectors they consider to be CI. While a state's domestic legislation – like the Australian NSLA – may criminalise various activities such as the installation of malware onto CI on a national level, states should also expressly outline how they regard these activities on an international level. Here the approach to impairment in norm (f) can serve as useful guidance on when a cyber operation should violate sovereignty.¹⁶⁷ Similarly, the fact that CI is targeted can serve as an indicia of a violation of sovereignty. For example, this is the approach that Germany has adopted making an explicit connection between cyber operations against its CI and violations of its sovereignty.¹⁶⁸ In relation to low-level cyber operations, such as those involving the installation of malware enabling a persistent presence on CI that is generally accepted as a permissible form of espionage, these should be seen as potential violations of sovereignty given the purpose for which they are conducted.¹⁶⁹ As such, while clarity around when cyber operations violate sovereignty and the relevance of a sector's designation as CI is needed, international law applies to cyber operations by states irrespective of norm (f) which introduces counterproductive complexity to the legal analysis in this context.\n# CONCLUSION This article examined the norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace and international law prohibiting malicious cyber operations against CI. It demonstrated that norm (f), which prohibits cyber operations that damage or impair CI, introduces complexity to the application of international law that is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are prohibited by international law. This is due to the subjective nature of CI, the contradictory legal status of norm (f), and the ways in which the harm requirements of norm (f) compound existing uncertainties about how international law applies to cyber operations where CI is targeted. To develop clarity about what cyber operations against CI should be 'off limits', more states need to outline their positions on the threshold at which they consider the law to be violated – especially in relation to sovereignty – to ensure that malicious low-level cyber operations, in particular, do not fall outside of these legal constraints.\n¹⁶⁷ This has been recently recognized in the UN OEWG 2021 report where it was noted that a cyber operation contrary to international law that 'intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public, could pose a threat not only to security but also to State sovereignty'. See UN OEWG 2021 report (n 48) 4.\n¹⁶⁸ According to Germany, where a cyber operation targets a state's CI it 'may indicate that a State's territorial sovereignty has been violated'. However, given, among other things, the lack of international agreement of what constitutes CI, Germany maintained that this in and of itself cannot constitute the basis for a violation. The Federal Government of Germany (n 89) 4.\n¹⁶⁹ For example, Asaf Lubin maintains that cyber espionage should be unlawful where the purpose for which it is conducted is unlawful. Asaf Lubin, 'The Liberty to Spy' (2020) 61(1) HILJ 185, 238–9. Other academics have also expressed support for adopting a purpose approach in determining the lawfulness of cyber espionage.

It demonstrated that norm (f), which prohibits cyber operations that damage or impair CI, introduces complexity to the application of international law that is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are prohibited by international law. This is due to the subjective nature of CI, the contradictory legal status of norm (f), and the ways in which the harm requirements of norm (f) compound existing uncertainties about how international law applies to cyber operations where CI is targeted. To develop clarity about what cyber operations against CI should be 'off limits', more states need to outline their positions on the threshold at which they consider the law to be violated – especially in relation to sovereignty – to ensure that malicious low-level cyber operations, in particular, do not fall outside of these legal constraints.\n\n¹⁶⁷ This has been recently recognized in the UN OEWG 2021 report where it was noted that a cyber operation contrary to international law that 'intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public, could pose a threat not only to security but also to State sovereignty'. See UN OEWG 2021 report (n 48) 4.\n¹⁶⁸ According to Germany, where a cyber operation targets a state's CI it 'may indicate that a State's territorial sovereignty has been violated'. However, given, among other things, the lack of international agreement of what constitutes CI, Germany maintained that this in and of itself cannot constitute the basis for a violation. The Federal Government of Germany (n 89) 4.\n¹⁶⁹ For example, Asaf Lubin maintains that cyber espionage should be unlawful where the purpose for which it is conducted is unlawful.

Given the scale and nature of the operations, Australia maintained a foreign state actor was responsible, however, it stopped short of publicly attributing the operations to a specific state. Despite this, some have suggested China was responsible. The cyber operations are understood to have involved compromising the computer systems and networks of the various organisations that were targeted through vulnerabilities in their software. However, despite the media attention Australia's revelation of the incident received, the cyber operations did not cause any effects, such as disrupting the operation of the compromised organisations. Instead, according to the Australian Cyber Security Centre, there was no evidence of 'intent by the actor to carry out any disruptive or destructive activities within victim environments'.\n\nThere is growing concern about the threat posed by low-level cyber operations that do not necessarily result in immediate disruptive or destructive effects but are nonetheless significant in their scale or have the potential to be used in preparation for more harmful operations. For example, the Australian Department of Defence has specifically highlighted the threat posed by 'all kinds of preparation, pre-positioning, [and] collection of intelligence' activities in the cyber context. This was echoed by the Director General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation who expressed concerns about 'the potential for Australia's adversaries to pre-position malicious code in critical infrastructure ...

    "CYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nnetworks in the future.⁶ In the United States (US), the 2018 ‘National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America’ (US Cyber Strategy) makes specific mention of Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, and provides that the US and its allies ‘are vulnerable to peacetime cyber attacks against critical infrastructure’ and that there is a growing risk ‘these countries will conduct cyber attacks against the United States during a crisis short of war’.⁷ Accordingly, there is recognition of the potentially devastating impact that cyber operations on CI can have and the threat posed by cyber activities in preparation of such operations. These concerns have been exacerbated by reports about malicious cyber operations conducted against hospitals and vaccine research centres during the pandemic in 2020,⁸ as well as ransomware crippling the operation of Colonial Pipeline in 2021 in the US.⁹\n\nIn light of these concerns, states have highlighted the need for international agreement that certain CI should be ‘off limits’ from malicious cyber activities. In 2015, for example, Australia’s then Foreign Minister Julie Bishop maintained that:\n\nThe effective functioning of critical infrastructure underpins the global economy. States should prevent and refrain from online activity which damages or impairs critical infrastructure, whether it be in banking, telecos, energy structures. While states define their critical infrastructure sectors differently and harmonisation is important, agreeing that key sectors should be off limits is a priority for the international community.¹⁰\n\nAnd in 2021, following the Colonial Pipeline incident, US President Joe Biden told Russia’s President Vladimir Putin that ‘certain critical infrastructure should be “off limits” to attack’, and provided Russia with a list of 16 sectors the US considers CI.¹¹\n\nIn Australia, as part of the effort to counter the broader threat posed by malicious cyber activities by foreign actors, the ‘National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Act 2018’ (NSLA) was recently passed into law. The NSLA was primarily introduced to address the threat of foreign interference in its political processes,¹² but it also contains provisions relating to foreign cyber activities against Australia’s CI. These include a range of new sabotage offences designed to ‘criminalise conduct causing damage to a broad range of critical infrastructure where it could prejudice Australia’s national security’.¹³ For example, under the NSLA it is a criminal offence to engage in conduct that results in damage to Australia’s infrastructure where this is done on behalf of a foreign actor and it undermines Australia’s national\n\n⁶ Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, ASIO Annual Report 2020-21 (2021) 5 <https: annual%20report%202020-21%20web.pdf=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\" www.asio.gov.au=\"\">.\n\n⁷ The White House, ‘National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America’ (September 2018) 3 <https: 09=\"\" 2018=\"\" annual%20report%202020-21%20web.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" national-cyber-strategy.pdf=\"\" uploads=\"\" wp-content=\"\" www.wytimes.com=\"\">.\n\n⁸ See Marko Milanovic and Michael Schmitt, ‘Cyber Attacks and Cyber (Mis)information Operations During a Pandemic’ (2020) 11 JNSLP 247.\n\n⁹ David Sanger, Clifford Krauss, and Nicole Perlroth, ‘Cyberattack Forces a Shutdown of a Top U.S. Pipeline’ The New York Times (8 May 2021) <https: 05=\"\" 2021=\"\" 09=\"\" a=\"\" cw=\"\" cw-weights=\"\" for=\"\" hyperattack-colonial-pipeline.html=\"\" upolitics=\"\" us=\"\" politics=\"\" paucities=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n\n¹⁰ Julie Bishop, ‘Statement for Plenary Session on International Peace and Security, Global Conference on Cyberspace’ Minister for Foreign Affairs The Hon Julie Bishop MP (17 April 2015) <https: 05=\"\" 2021-06-16=\"\" 2021=\"\" julie-bishop=\"\" minister=\"\" minister.julie-bishop=\"\" speech=\"\" www.foreignminister.gov.au=\"\">.\n\n¹¹ Vladimir Soldatkin and Humeyra Pamuk, ‘Biden Tells Putin Certain Cyberattacks should be “Off-limits”’ Reuters (17 June 2021) <https: biden-tells-putin-certain-cyber-attacks-should-be-off-limits-2021-06-16=\"\" technology=\"\" www.reuters.com=\"\">.\n\n¹² See Henry Belot, ‘Malcolm Turnbull Announces Biggest Overhaul of Espionage, Intelligence Laws in Decades’ ABC News (5 December 2017) <https: 2017-12-05=\"\" news=\"\" turnbull-announces-foreign-interference-laws=\"\" www.abc.net.au=\"\">; Louise Yaxley, ‘Sam Dastyari and the Murky Links with Chinese Businessmen that Ended his Political Career’ ABC News (12 December 2017) <http: 2017-12-12=\"\" 9249216=\"\" am-dastyari-murky-links-with-chinese-businessmen-ended-career=\"\" news=\"\" www.abc.net.au=\"\">.\n\n¹³ National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Act 2018 (Cth) (NSLA Act) sch 1 pt 1 div 82–Sabotage; Revised Explanatory Memorandum, National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017 (Cth) 62 [137].</http:></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:>",

As highlighted by Australia’s former foreign minister above, there is no universal definition of CI and states in fact have the ability to designate any infrastructure asset as CI. Generally, CI includes various infrastructures such as those related to energy, health and transportation, and many of these infrastructures are dual-use. In Australia, for example, CI is defined as referring to the\n\nphysical facilities, supply chains, information technologies and communication networks which, if destroyed, degraded or rendered unavailable for an extended period, would significantly impact on the social or economic wellbeing of the nation or affect Australia’s ability to conduct national defence and ensure national security.¹⁷\n\nIn Australia, CI thus ‘provides services that are essential for everyday life such as energy, communications, water, transport, health, food and grocery, banking and finance and the Australian Government’.¹⁸\n\nThe United Kingdom (UK) in turn adopts the term ‘critical national infrastructure’ and this refers to the ‘critical elements of infrastructure (namely, assets, facilities, systems, networks or processes and the essential workers that operate and facilitate them)’ where the loss or compromise of those elements would result in a ‘major detrimental impact on the availability, integrity or delivery of essential services’ and/or a ‘significant impact on national security, national defence or the functioning of the state’.¹⁹\n\nIn the US, CI refers to ‘systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the US that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety or any combination of those matters’.²⁰ The ‘critical infrastructure sectors’, as identified by the recently established US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, include 16 sectors across energy, commerce, finance, food and agriculture, healthcare, emergency services, water, waste, transportation and defence.²¹\n\nIn the European Union (EU), CI refers to\n\n¹⁴ NSLA Act (n 13) ss 82.3, 82.4.\n¹⁵ See NSLA Act (n 13) ss 82.7, 82.8.\n¹⁶ Revised NSLA Explanatory Memorandum (n 13) 80 [236].\n¹⁷ Commonwealth of Australia, Critical Infrastructure Resilience Strategy: Policy Statement (2015) 8 <https: criticalinfrastructureresiliencestrategypolicystatement.pdf=\"\" site%20documents=\"\" www.tisn.gov.au=\"\">.\n¹⁸ Australian Government, ‘What is the Critical Infrastructure Centre?’ Critical Infrastructure Centre <https: ctc-factsheet-what-is-critical-infrastructure-centre.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" nat-security=\"\" www.homeaffairs.gov.au=\"\">.\n¹⁹ Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure, ‘Critical National Infrastructure’ (2020) <https: critical-national-infrastructure-0=\"\" www.cpni.gov.uk=\"\">.\n²⁰ USA Patriot Act of 2001, 42 USC §§5195c(e), 1016(e).\n²¹ United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, ‘Critical Infrastructure Sectors’ (24 March 2020) <https: critical-infrastructure-sectors=\"\" www.cisa.gov=\"\">.</https:></https:></https:></https:>",

The EU uses the term ‘critical information infrastructure’ (CII) to describe both the essential information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructures and those that are essential for the operation of its physical CI.²³\n\nAt the United Nations (UN) level, states have noted in a General Assembly resolution on the ‘creation of a global culture of cybersecurity and the protection of critical information infrastructures’ that CI involves, among other things, the infrastructures used for ‘the generation, transmission and distribution of energy, air and maritime transport, banking and financial services, e-commerce, water supply, food distribution and public health’ and that these infrastructures are increasingly interconnected with CII.²⁴ But here too it is recognized that each state has the right to determine what constitutes its CI.²⁵\n\nAccordingly, in the Australian, UK, US, EU and UN contexts, CI refers to infrastructures essential to the proper functioning and well-being of the state and society. The term encompasses physical infrastructures (such as power plants and hospitals) located within a state’s territory, as well as the virtual infrastructure allowing the physical components to operate. Generally, this infrastructure is critical where its disruption or destruction would have a detrimental impact (whether significant, major, debilitating and so on) on the provision of key services that relate to the social or economic well-being of the state or its national security. However, states also have the prerogative to designate any infrastructure assets or sectors as critical. For example, the above UK definition includes the human personnel required to operate CI, and in Australia, the relevant government minister has the power to designate any asset as critical.²⁶ As such, while there are core sectors that most states consider to constitute CI, the scope of what constitutes CI is subjective as evident in the differences in terminology and approaches that states adopt in determining this. Consequently, when considering relevant laws and norms surrounding CI protection, there is uncertainty about the specific infrastructures against which malicious cyber activities are prohibited.\n\n## Cyber operations against critical infrastructure\n\nIn addition to the 2020 cyber attacks against Australia, there are various other examples of known incidents differing in kind and intensity from low-level information collection operations to more disruptive and even destructive attacks against states’ CI. For example, in 2010 the infamous Stuxnet malware was discovered which had infected an Iranian uranium enrichment facility and, by changing the settings according to which the centrifuge machines operated, caused physical damage to approximately 1000 centrifuges.²⁷ Similarly, in a non-destructive but highly disruptive attack, in December 2015 parts of Ukraine’s power grid were shut down for\n\n²² Council Directive 2008/114/EC of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection [2008] OJ L 345/75 art 2.\n²³ Commission of the European Communities, ‘Green Paper on a European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection’ (COM/2005/576 final, 17 November 2005) 19.\n²⁴ United Nations General Assembly, UNGA Res 58/199 (23 December 2003) UN Doc A/RES/58/199, 1.\n²⁵ Ibid.\n²⁶ See ss 50 and 51 of the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 (Cth).\n²⁷ Joby Warrick, ‘Iran’s Natanz Nuclear Facility Recovered Quickly from Stuxnet Cyberattack’ The Washington Post (16 February 2011) <http: 02=\"\" 15=\"\" 2011=\"\" ar2011021505395.html=\"\" content=\"\" article=\"\" wp-dyn=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\">.

These operations can be used to gather information that can potentially be used in preparation for more disruptive future operations.³⁰ As an example, in 2018 the US Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation released a report on Russian cyber activities targeting its energy and other CI sectors.³¹ According to this report, Russian actors had since at least 2016 ‘targeted government entities and multiple US critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy, nuclear, commercial facilities, water, aviation and critical manufacturing sectors’.³² This was characterized by these agencies ‘as a multi-stage intrusion campaign by Russian government cyber actors’ in which these actors obtained unauthorized access to various networks and installed malware allowing them to conduct reconnaissance and collect information about industrial control systems.³³ Similarly, in 2019 it was reported that the US had moved beyond mere reconnaissance operations into Russia’s power grid to the placement of malware onto those systems that could be used to disrupt its operation.³⁴ Furthermore, in December 2020, it was reported that Russia had, through software provided by the company SolarWinds, compromised a range of US government agencies³⁵ and companies responsible for CI in the electricity, oil and manufacturing industries.³⁶ While the SolarWinds incident is mainly understood to have compromised data in the affected sectors, Anne Neuberger, the US Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology, expressed concerns that Russia’s ability to access these systems has the potential to be used for disruptive operations in the future.³⁷ And in January 2022, during increased tensions between the US and Russia in the lead-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the US Cybersecurity Advisory issued an advisory encouraging the US cybersecurity community and especially CI operators ‘to adopt a heightened state of awareness’ given the threat posed by Russian-state-sponsored cyber operations against US CI.³⁸ Accordingly, states like the US and Russia are using malicious cyber operations to obtain unauthorized access and maintaining a ‘persistent presence’ in other states’ CI systems. The concern is that these preparatory cyber operations can be used to damage or disrupt the operation of CI in the future.\n\n²⁸ See Kim Zetter, ‘Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid’ Wired (3 March 2016) <https: 03=\"\" 2016=\"\" 03=\"\" inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\">.\n\n²⁹ David Sanger, ‘Utilities Cautioned about Potential for a Cyberattack’ The New York Times (29 February 2016) <https: 03=\"\" 2016=\"\" 00=\"\" http:=\"\" us=\"\" politics=\"\" politics.cautioned-about-potential-for-a-cyberattack-after-ukraines.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n\n³⁰ See Symantec Critical Attack Discovery and Intelligence Team, ‘Dragonfly: Western Energy Sector Targeted by Sophisticated Attack Group’ Symantec Threat Intelligence (20 October 2017) <https: dragonfly-energy-sector-cyber-attacks=\"\" blogs=\"\" symantec-blogs.broadcom.com=\"\">.\n\n³¹ United States Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation, ‘Russian Government Cyber Activity Targeting Energy and Other Critical Infrastructure Sectors’ (Technical Alert TA18-074A, 15 March 2018) <https: alerts=\"\" a18-074a=\"\" ncas=\"\" ta18-074a=\"\" www.us-cert.gov=\"\">.\n\n³² Ibid.\n\n³³ Ibid.\n\n³⁴ David Sanger and Nicole Perlroth, ‘U.S. Escalates Online Attacks on Russia’s Power Grid’ The New York Times (15 June 2019) <https: 06=\"\" 15=\"\" 2019=\"\" us=\"\" politics=\"\" prurip-cyber-russia-grid.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n\n³⁵ David Sanger, ‘Russian Hackers Broke into Federal Agencies, U.S. Officials Suspect’ The New York Times (13 December 2020) <https: 12=\"\" 2020=\"\" 22=\"\" 2020=\"\" politics=\"\" russian-hackers-us-government-treasury-commerce.html?=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n\n³⁶ Kim Zetter, ‘SolarWinds Hack Infected Critical Infrastructure, including Power Industry’ The Intercept (25 December 2020) <https: 02=\"\" 2020=\"\" 22=\"\" 24=\"\" solarwinds-hack-power-infrastructure=\"\" theintercept.com=\"\">.\n\n³⁷ David Sanger, ‘After Russian Cyberattack, Looking for Answers and Debating Retaliation’ The New York Times (23 February 2021) <https: 02=\"\" 2021=\"\" 23=\"\" polities=\"\" solarwinds-hack-senate-intelligence-russia.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\">.\n\n³⁸ Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, ‘Understanding and Mitigating Russian State Sponsored Cyber Threats to U.S. Critical Infrastructure’ (11 January 2022) 1 <https: 02=\"\" 2022=\"\" 23=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" publications=\"\" us=\"\" uscert=\"\" sites=\"\" www.cisa.gov=\"\" uscert=\"\" publications=\"\" uscertisites=\"\"></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:></https:>",
    "CYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 419\n\nThis concern crystallized during the war in Ukraine in 2022 which involved a range of cyber operations and activities that Russia had pre-positioned for.³⁹\n\n# NORMS OF RESPONSIBLE STATE BEHAVIOUR IN CYBERSPACE\n\nThe international security issues surrounding states' use of digital technologies and activities in cyberspace have been considered at the UN level since the late 1990s, and in this context, states have agreed to norms around responsible behaviour in cyberspace including around CI protection. Since 1998, the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) of the UN General Assembly has regularly considered 'Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security'.⁴⁰ In 2004 it established a Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) to examine existing and potential threats from cyberspace.⁴¹ A second GGE was established in 2009 and it issued a consensus report in 2010⁴² which highlighted the risk of how '[t]he growing use of ICTs in critical infrastructures creates new vulnerabilities and opportunities for disruption'.⁴³ It also recommended that states should engage in further dialogue 'to discuss norms pertaining to State use of ICTs, to reduce collective risk and protect critical national and international infrastructure'.⁴⁴ This was echoed in the 2013 report from the third GGE which also, for the first time, confirmed the general application of international law and UN Charter principles in the cyber context.⁴⁵\n\nThe 2015 report by the fourth GGE was significant as it introduced a set of norms for responsible state behaviour in their use of ICTs.⁴⁶ The UN General Assembly also passed resolutions in 2018 and 2019 on 'Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security' where it called on states to be guided by the UN GGE reports and these norms in their use of ICTs.⁴⁷ This was echoed in the 2021 consensus report of the UN Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security in which states emphasized the importance of these norms.⁴⁸\n\nFrom these norms, three are particularly relevant to CI protection. Norm (g) provides that states should take appropriate measures to protect their own CI, and norm (h) provides that states should mitigate malicious cyber activities emanating from their territory that are directed against the CI of other states.⁴⁹ Of most relevance to malicious cyber operations against CI, however, is norm (f). It provides that:\n\n³⁹ Microsoft, 'Special Report: Ukraine' (27 April 2022) § <https: am=\"\" app=\"\" am=\"\" binary=\"\" re4vwwd=\"\" query.prod.cms=\"\" re4vwwd=\"\" www.cms=\"\">.\n\n⁴⁰ United Nations General Assembly, Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, GA Res 53/70, UN Doc A/RES/53/70 (4 January 1999).\n\n⁴¹ United Nations Secretary-General, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security: Report of the Secretary-General, UN Doc A/60/202 (5 August 2005).\n\n⁴² United Nations Secretary-General, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security: Note by the Secretary-General, UN Doc A/65/201 (30 July 2010).\n\n⁴³ Ibid 7.\n\n⁴⁴ Ibid 8.\n\n⁴⁵ United Nations Secretary-General, Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/68/98 (24 June 2013) 2.\n\n⁴⁶ United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/70/174 (22 July 2015) 8.\n\n⁴⁷ See United Nations General Assembly, Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/RES/73/266 (2 January 2019); United Nations General Assembly, Advancing Responsible State Behaviours in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, UN Doc A/RES/74/28 (18 December 2019).\n\n⁴⁸ United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, 'Final Substantive Report' (10 March 2021) 4–5 <https: 03=\"\" 2021=\"\" front.un-arm.org=\"\" uploads=\"\" wp-content=\"\" wpr2.pdf=\"\" uploads=\"\">.\n\n⁴⁹ See Michael Berk, 'Recommendation 13(g) and (h)' in United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (ed), Voluntary, Non-Binding Norms for Responsible State Behaviour in the Use of Information and Communications Technology: A Commentary (United Nations Publication 2017).</https:></https:>",
    "SAMULI HAATAJA\n\nA State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity contrary to its obligations under international law that intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public.⁵⁰\n\nPrima facie, norm (f) specifically prohibits cyber operations against the CI of other states. According to the commentary to the norms, it reflects consensus about the unique importance of CI to modern societies and a recognition of the possibility of conflicts to escalate where state-to-state cyber activities adversely impact CI in particular.⁵¹ However, despite this apparent consensus, there is debate about the legal status of norm (f) and its relationship to international law. In particular, it is unclear whether it seeks to create new non-binding expectations of responsible state behaviour or to reaffirm the application of existing binding rules of international law.\n\nThis lack of clarity arises because norm (f) is explicitly included as a 'voluntary, non-binding' norm in the 2015 UN GGE report, and all of the norms are located in a separate section to the question of how international law applies to ICT activities.⁵² Yet the wording of norm (f) expressly refers to a state's 'obligations under international law' – that is, binding, opposed to voluntary and non-binding obligations – resulting in what others have described as a 'contradiction in terms'.⁵³ The confusion about the legal status of norm (f) is also evident among states who generally regard the norms as conceptually distinct from international law.⁵⁴ For example, Australia, in its 2017 'Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy', expresses a commitment to these norms and notes that international law can be complemented with these norms, but treats the two as distinct.⁵⁵ The US has also expressed a commitment to the promotion of these norms but regards them as conceptually distinct from international law. This is evident in the US Cyber Strategy which includes as one of its pillars the preservation of peace through strength,⁵⁶ and the means of doing so is through the promotion of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace based on international law on one hand, and 'voluntary non-binding norms' on the other.⁵⁷ Similarly, the ASEAN-EU Statement on Cybersecurity Cooperation distinguishes between the application of international law in the cyber context and, separately, acknowledges 'that voluntary and non-binding norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour of States in the use of ICTs can reduce risks to international peace, security and stability'.⁵⁸ The distinction between the non-binding norms and binding international law obligations is also evident in academic commentary. For example, according to Harriet Moynihan, norm (f) 'does not represent a binding obligation on states' and merely demonstrates 'their concern to protect\n\n⁵⁰ UN GGE 2015 report (n 46) 8.\n⁵¹ Jason Jolley, 'Recommendation 13 (f)' in United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (ed) Voluntary, Non-Binding Norms for Responsible State Behaviour in the Use of Information and Communications Technology: A Commentary (United Nations Publication 2017) 169–70.\n⁵² UN GGE 2015 report (n 46) 7.\n⁵³ Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco, and Talita de Souza Dias, 'Drawing the Cyber Baseline: The Applicability of Existing International Law to the Governance of Information and Communication Technologies' (2022) 99 ILS 4, 32.\n⁵⁴ Liisi Adamson, 'International Law and International Cyber Norms: A Continuum?' in Dennis Broeders and Bibi van den Berg (eds) Governing Cyberspace: Behavior, Power, and Diplomacy (Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2020) 25, 33.\n⁵⁵ Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 'Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy' (October 2017) 47–8 <https: 2020-11=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" the%20strategy.pdf=\"\" www.internationalcybertech.gov.au=\"\" sites=\"\">; Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 2019 Progress Report, Australia's International Cyber Engagement Strategy (2019).\n⁵⁶ The White House (7) 20.\n⁵⁷ Ibid.\n⁵⁸ Association of South East Asian Nations, 'ASEAN-EU Statement on Cybersecurity Cooperation' Association of South East Asian Nations (August 2019) [6]–[7] <https: 08=\"\" 2019=\"\" asean.org=\"\" asean-eu-statement-on-cybersecurity-cooperation-final.pdf=\"\" storage=\"\">.</https:></https:>",

Accordingly, states have agreed to norm (f) which prohibits cyber operations against CI. However, norm (f) is expressly included as a voluntary and non-binding norm in the UN GGE reports, and the norms generally are regarded as conceptually distinct from legally binding obligations under international law.\n\nThe commentary to the norms, published by the UN Office for Disarmament Affairs,⁶¹ elaborates on key elements of norm (f) including its relationship with international law.⁶² Here it is noted that it is unclear 'why the [UN Group of Governmental] Experts have offered as voluntary something that by the majority of states is considered legally binding'.⁶³ The commentary explains that norm (f) is premised on the law of state responsibility and was intended to reaffirm that states' existing legal obligations extend to their cyber activities.⁶⁴ This is evident, for example, from the phrase 'conduct[s] or knowingly support[s]' within the wording of norm (f) which encompasses relevant rules of attribution of conduct under international law on state responsibility.⁶⁵ The phrase 'contrary to its obligations' in turn refers to states' existing obligations under international law and includes, for example, the prohibition on the use of force and relevant international humanitarian law obligations.⁶⁶ Therefore, according to the commentary, despite being expressly included as a voluntary and non-binding norm, norm (f) was intended to reaffirm states' existing legal obligations in relation to CI.⁶⁷\n\nAccordingly, the precise legal status of norm (f) is unclear and others have raised concerns about the implications of this. Writing in relation to the cyber norms generally, Kubo Mačák highlights how 'non-binding norms can never override binding legal rules' and, in the reverse, that 'a non-binding norm cannot permit action that would otherwise be forbidden by international law'.⁶⁸ He maintains that the distinction is important as only a violation of international law can trigger obligations of cessation and reparation under the law on state responsibility.⁶⁹ François Delerue, Frédérick Douzet and Aude Géry in turn maintain that the distinction between international law and norms 'complexifies the definition of rights and obligations for the states in cyberspace as it introduces a confusion on the nature of the rules'.⁷⁰ They argue that by separating the two, the potential implication is that the norm is autonomous and detached from international law and that state behaviour in cyberspace is based only on the goodwill of states and not legal obligations.⁷¹ Similarly, Dapo Akande, Antonio Coco and Talita de Souza Dias argue that the inclusion of norm (f) as a voluntary, non-binding norm by the UN GGE can\n\n⁵⁹ Harriet Moynihan, 'The Application of International Law to State Cyberattacks Sovereignty and Non-intervention' (Chatham House Research Paper 2019) 44 <https: 12=\"\" 2019=\"\" application-international-law-state-cyberattacks=\"\" www.chathamhouse.org=\"\">.\n⁶⁰ Dennis Broeders, Els de Busser, Fabio Cristiano, and Tatiana Tropina, 'Revisiting Past Cyber Operations in Light of New Cyber Norms and Interpretations of International Law: Inching towards Lines in the Sand?'

It provides that the 'norms do not replace or alter' binding obligations under international law, and do not seek to limit or prohibit action that is otherwise consistent with international law.\"[73] Instead, the norms 'provide additional specific guidance' on what constitutes responsible state behaviour in the cyber context.[74] As such, the legal status of norm (f) is contradictory given it was both intended to reaffirm states' legal obligations in relation to CI and, without replacing or altering the law, to provide non-binding additional specific guidance on what constitutes responsible state behaviour in this context. This is problematic as it is unclear what kinds of cyber operations are prohibited by binding international law obligations in contrast to those that are only contrary to non-binding norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.\n\nIn addition to its legal status, the commentary to norm (f) also discusses the degree of harm that is required for the norm to be violated. Norm (f) refers to activities that 'intentionally damage[] critical infrastructure or otherwise impair[] the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public'.[75] Essentially, this involves two types of harm: either intentional damage to CI or the use and operation of CI is impaired in its provision of services to the public. The commentary elaborates on both of these. In relation to the first, this requires a state to deliberately cause damage to CI irrespective of whether the damage impacts public services connected to the CI. Here the degree of damage is irrelevant as long as the damage is physical in nature.[76] Given the requirement of intention, however, where a state unintentionally causes physical damage to CI (provided it does not impair the use or operation of CI in its provision of services to the public) then this would fall outside the scope of norm (f).[77]\n\nThe second type of harm involves situations where a cyber operation does not cause any damage but impairs the use and operation of CI in its provision of services to the public. According to the commentary, impairment in this context refers to:\n\nany damage, physical or electronic, including the loss of data or software, or interruption of digital services provided by critical infrastructure, that makes the critical infrastructure less effective, less valuable, operate worse, or inhibit use by the public, the threshold being that the public must be impacted, even minimally.[78]\n\nAs such, the term 'impairment' encompasses physical impairment but does not require it, and captures a range of circumstances where the functionality of CI is undermined provided it results in a detrimental impact on its use by the public. This excludes cyber operations that do not disrupt the operation of CI, as well as cyber operations that disrupt the operation of CI without any impact on the public.[79] Unlike the requirement for intentional damage, the need for impairment is based on a strict liability approach where there is no need for the responsible state to have intended to cause the impairment.[80]\n\nIn summary, states have agreed to norms of responsible behaviour in cyberspace at the UN level including norm (f) which specifically prohibits certain cyber operations against CI.\n\n72 Akande, Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 53) 31.\n73 UN OEWG 2021 report (n 48) 5.\n74 Ibid.\n75 UN GGE 2015 report (n 46) 8.\n76 Jolley (n 51) 188.\n77 Ibid.\n78 Ibid 189.\n79 Ibid 188.\n80 Ibid.",
    "CYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 433\n\nHowever, the legal status of norm (f) is contradictory. On one hand, it seeks to reaffirm states' existing obligations in relation to CI and is not intended to modify those obligations. On the other, it provides non-binding 'additional specific guidance' on responsible state behaviour in this context, particularly in relation to the degree of harm that should not be caused to CI.⁸¹ As will be demonstrated below, this guidance is concerning as it is inconsistent with the harm requirements under international law, and this further compounds existing uncertainties about how the law applies in this context.⁸²\n\n# INTERNATIONAL LAW AND CYBER OPERATIONS\n\nThis section examines how relevant rules of international law that norm (f) reaffirms apply to state activities in cyberspace. The focus is on three primary areas of international law that provide limits to cyber operations in peacetime, namely the law on the use of force, non-intervention and sovereignty. These are of particular relevance to cyber operations attributable to states targeting another state's CI given the broad spectrum of effects that remotely conducted cyber operations can cause.⁸³\n\nThere is widespread agreement that international law generally applies to state activities in cyberspace. This was highlighted in the 2015 UN GGE report which recognized that international law and the UN Charter in particular apply in the cyber context.⁸⁴ This was reaffirmed in the 2021 UN OEWG consensus report.⁸⁵ Despite this general agreement, however, there continues to be uncertainty about how particular rules of international law apply. As such, UN Member States have been invited to provide their national views on the UN GGE reports and to make submissions or provide working papers in connection with the UN OEWG which ran parallel to the UN GGE. In connection with these processes, states have provided more detailed accounts about how they consider the law to apply. The views of states are important as they contribute to more clarity about how international law applies in the cyber context, and to the development of customary international law applicable to state conduct in this context.⁸⁶ However, the different positions evident in these statements have given rise to some debate about how the law applies. The implication of this is that, while there are some areas where a degree of consensus is emerging, there continues to be a degree of uncertainty about when cyber operations against CI will violate international law.\n\n# Use of force\n\nA cyber operation that causes physical damage to CI can potentially violate the prohibition on the use of force. Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits states from the use of force. Force in this context is generally understood to refer to 'armed force'.⁸⁷ Despite being drafted in the\n\n⁸¹ However, as Delerue, Douzet and Géry note, the non-binding norms nonetheless 'can contribute to the interpretation of existing obligations in international law, or to the formation of new international obligations'.

    "SAMULI HAATAJA\n\ntechnological context of the 1940s, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has affirmed that the prohibition on the use of force applies 'to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.'88\n\nIn the cyber context, most states that have expressed their position on article 2(4) have adopted the approach that a cyber operation will constitute a use of force where its 'scale and effects' are comparable to a use of force by traditional kinetic means.89 This approach is similar to the one adopted by the 'Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations' (Tallinn Manual)90 – an influential but non-binding account by a group of experts about how international law applies in the cyber context91 – which provides in Rule 69 that '[a] cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.'92 Accordingly, where a cyber operation results in damage or destruction of physical property, or injury or death of human beings, it is likely to be considered to amount to a use of force in violation of article 2(4).\n\nHowever, where a cyber operation results in a loss of functionality of systems without causing physical damage, it is unclear whether this would be regarded as a use of force.93 Normally, economic or diplomatic pressure is not considered to be 'force' under article 2(4),94 and only the Netherlands has suggested that a cyber operation could constitute a use of force where it had 'a very serious financial or economic impact'.95 In contrast, New Zealand has maintained that a cyber operation causing significant loss of functionality to its CI would constitute a violation of the non-intervention principle, as opposed to the use of force.96 As such, there is uncertainty around whether cyber operations that do not cause physical effects can constitute violations of article 2(4).\n\n## Non-intervention\n\nA cyber operation against CI that falls below the use of force threshold can potentially constitute a violation of the non-intervention principle. This is a rule of customary international law that prohibits states from using coercive means to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another state as these are matters which states have the right to decide freely by virtue of their sovereignty. A violation of international law based on the non-intervention principle requires two elements. First, there must be coercive interference, and second, it must be directed towards the matters that sovereign states should be able to decide freely.97\n\n88 Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Advisory Opinion) [1996] ICJ Rep 226, 244.

    "CYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 435\n\nCoercion is not defined in international law. The majority of the Tallinn Manual experts, for example, adopted a narrow approach to the term defining it as ‘an affirmative act designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way.’⁹⁸ They distinguished it from activities that seek to influence (as opposed to factually compel) a state to behave in a particular way such as public criticism or propaganda.⁹⁹ Others, however, have defined coercion more broadly as a form of pressure that seeks to deprive the target state of its free will.¹⁰⁰ This view was echoed by the minority of the Tallinn Manual experts who maintained that it is sufficient that the activity ‘has the effect of depriving the State of control over the matter in question.’¹⁰¹ This broader approach to coercion is also supported by some states in the cyber context. For example, according to Australia coercion involves ‘effectively deprive[ing] another state of the ability to control, decide upon or govern matters of an inherently sovereign nature.’¹⁰² Similarly, the German position maintains that coercion involves where a state’s ‘will is manifestly bent by the foreign State’s conduct.’¹⁰³\n\nThe second element requires that the coercion is directed at matters that states are able to decide freely by virtue of their sovereignty.¹⁰⁴ These include, according to the ICJ, the ‘choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy’.¹⁰⁵ States have also endorsed this view in the cyber context. Australia’s position is that the law requires the coercion to affect ‘matters of an inherently sovereign nature’,¹⁰⁶ according to the UK the coercion must affect ‘matters of government which are at the heart of a state’s sovereignty’,¹⁰⁷ and for New Zealand, coercion must deprive the state from control over ‘matters falling within the scope of its inherently sovereign functions’.¹⁰⁸\n\nA number of states have also provided examples of situations in which the non-intervention principle would be violated in the cyber context.

For example, the Tallinn Manual distinguishes between a state’s ‘inherently governmental functions’ (relevant for a sovereignty violation) from the concept of domaine réservé (relevant to the non-intervention principle). Schmitt (n 90) 24. However, it is argued that the notion of ‘matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely’ (using the ICJ’s wording) is preferred. This is not confined to a state’s internal affairs as it also includes their external affairs (eg membership of international organisations, and decisions to recognise states) which can be subject to coercive interference. Additionally, even if a matter is regulated by international law (and thus it is no longer within a state’s domaine réservé meaning the state no longer has exclusive regulatory authority over the matter), the state still has the authority to make choices within that area of law. As such, the ‘matters that sovereign states are permitted to decide freely’ is a more useful concept opposed to the narrow notion of a state’s domaine réservé.

    "SAMULI HAATAJA\n\nand Finland,¹¹² maintain that election interference through cyber means will violate the principle where the election result is manipulated. Australia and the UK also maintain that using cyber means involving coercion to undermine the stability of their financial system would constitute a violation.¹¹³ This is echoed by New Zealand which also maintains that disruptive cyber operations against its healthcare system, electricity network or telecommunications network would, where coercive, constitute violations of the non-intervention principle.¹¹⁴ Accordingly, cyber operations without physical effects can constitute violations of the non-intervention principle. However, this requires the element of coercion but the identity and intention of the state responsible for a cyber operation can be difficult to determine in the cyber context. This leads to uncertainty around whether cyber operations without physical effects that fall below the use of force threshold constitute violations of the non-intervention principle.\n\n## Sovereignty\n\nFinally, cyber operations against CI can also constitute violations of sovereignty. Sovereignty generally refers to a state's supreme authority within its territory, and it involves three interrelated rights and correlating duties in relation to a state's territorial sovereignty, independence and sovereign equality.¹¹⁵ In relation to territorial sovereignty, usually non-consensual activities within a state's territory, such as flying military aircraft over its airspace without permission, or navigating a vessel through its territorial sea without its consent are prohibited. In the cyber context, while states agree that sovereignty extends to the cyber infrastructure within their territory, there is uncertainty around whether and the threshold at which remotely conducted cyber operations will violate sovereignty. This is a critical question given that international law is largely silent on espionage conducted by states, and this means that states are generally permitted to engage in cyber espionage.¹¹⁶\n\nThis uncertainty about whether and when a cyber operation violates sovereignty arises from the debate about whether or not sovereignty operates as a rule of international law independent of the use of force and non-intervention principles that prohibits certain malicious cyber activities. According to the 'sovereignty as a rule' approach, sovereignty operates as a primary rule of international law that can be violated, and under certain circumstances, remotely conducted cyber operations can amount to violations of sovereignty.

For example, the Netherlands did not define the boundary at which it considers its sovereignty to be violated,¹²⁷ and Austria similarly remained silent on this issue.¹²⁸ The French position in turn suggests that it considers a cyber operation that merely involves the ‘unauthorized penetration’ of its computer systems to be a violation of its sovereignty.¹²⁹ Iran’s position similarly suggests that it would also view any unlawful intrusions into its (public or private) cyber infrastructure as violations of its sovereignty, as well as those that are destructive or disruptive and undermine its national security.¹³⁰ In contrast, however, according to New Zealand not ‘every unauthorized intrusion’ into another state’s ICT systems or even all cyber activities that cause effects on another state’s territory constitutes a violation of territorial sovereignty.¹³¹ Here it makes reference to cyber espionage activities and ‘a range of circumstances’ in which even cyber operations that cause effects in the territory of another state will not violate international law.¹³² Finland has maintained that a violation of sovereignty will be determined on a case-by-case basis depending on the ‘nature and consequences’ of the unauthorized cyber intrusion.¹³³ The Czech Republic considers that cyber operations that violate sovereignty include those that cause significant physical damage or harm to individuals and those that damage or disrupt the operation of cyber or other infrastructure where it has a ‘significant impact on national security, economy, public health or environment’.¹³⁴ Similarly, according to Germany, a cyber operation that causes ‘physical effects and harm’ in another state’s territory will violate sovereignty, as well as disruptive cyber operations, particularly where they cause ‘substantive secondary or indirect physical effects’ in another state’s territory.¹³⁵ As such, while some states agree that, at least cyber operations that cause physical damage or harm to individuals within another state’s territory will violate their\n\n¹²¹ Czech Republic, ‘Statement by Richard Kadlčák at Open-ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security of the First Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations’ (11 February 2020) <https: 2020=\"\" 20%20international%20law%2011.02.2020.pdf=\"\" cz%20statement%20www.nukib.cz=\"\" download=\"\" publications_en=\"\" www.nukib.cz=\"\">.\n\n¹²² Finnish Government, Ministry for Foreign Affairs (n 112).\n\n¹²³ Islamic Republic of Iran, ‘Declaration of General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran Regarding International Law Applicable to the Cyberspace’ NourNews (18 August 2020) <https: 53144=\"\" en=\"\" general-staff-of-iranian-armed-forces-warns-of-tough-reaction-to-any-cyber-threat=\"\" nournews.ir=\"\">.\n\n¹²⁴ New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade (n 89).\n\n¹²⁵ The Federal Government of Germany (n 89) 2.\n\n¹²⁶ Organisation of American States, Inter-American Judicial Committee, ‘International Law and State Cyber Operations’ (1 November 2020) 52 <http: docs=\"\" en=\"\" idc=\"\" international_law_and_state_cyber_operations_publication.pdf=\"\" sla=\"\" iajc=\"\" www.oas.org=\"\">.\n\n¹²⁷ Letter from the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (n 89) 3.\n\n¹²⁸ ‘Comments by Austria, Pre-Draft Report of the OEWG – ICT’ (n 120).\n\n¹²⁹ United Nations Secretary-General (n 119) 22.

This approach has been suggested by the US in a 2017 US Department of Defence memorandum (US DoD memo),^[138]^ and the UK has expressly adopted this position.^[139]^\n\nFrom the sovereignty as a principle approach, given that sovereignty does not operate as a standalone rule of international law, it cannot be violated in itself. Instead, to amount to a violation of international law, a cyber operation needs to constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force or an intervention (ie a violation of existing rules of international law that arise from sovereignty).^[140]^ This means that, under this approach, a range of cyber operations are considered lawful under international law as they are not expressly prohibited. For example, according to the US DoD memo, sovereignty does not limit states from engaging in cyber activities 'that result in effects occurring on the infrastructure located in another State'.^[141]^ Similarly, according to the UK, the non-consensual interference into another state's computer networks is not a violation of their 'territorial sovereignty' because such a rule does not exist in international law in relation to cyber.^[142]^ As such, pursuant to the sovereignty as a principle approach, unauthorized cyber intrusions cannot constitute violations of sovereignty and will only amount to violations of international law where they rise to the threshold of a use of force or intervention and thus violate other existing rules of international law.\n\nTo summarize, when it comes to states' existing legal obligations most relevant to cyber operations that target or cause effects on another state's CI in peacetime, there is a degree of consensus in some areas but uncertainty in others. There is agreement that cyber operations will violate the prohibition on the use of force where their effects are similar to the use of armed force by kinetic means. However, there is no consensus around the precise threshold or about non-destructive but disruptive cyber operations in this context. The non-intervention principle generally applies to disruptive cyber operations provided they are coercive, however, this can be difficult to determine in the cyber context. Finally, while an increasing number of states have expressed support for the 'sovereignty as a rule' approach, there is no consensus on the threshold\n\n^[136]^ The Tallinn Manual experts were also divided on this.

As a result, particularly in relation to low-level cyber operations that merely involve pre-positioning or preparatory activities such as unauthorised access, information collection or the installation of malware that do not cause any immediate disruption or destruction, there is uncertainty about whether these activities would constitute violations of states' existing obligations under international law.\n\n# IMPLICATIONS FOR CYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW\n\nThis section demonstrates how norm (f) adds counterproductive complexity to the application of international law to cyber operations against CI. This is evident in the subjective nature of what constitutes CI within the scope of norm (f), and the additional specific guidance provided by norm (f) which contradicts some of the harm requirements under international law.\n\n# Norm (f) and CI\n\nNorm (f) applies to cyber operations against CI, however, despite that there are core sectors that most states consider to constitute CI, the notion of CI remains subjective. This means that the precise scope of norm (f) is not clearly defined. States have the prerogative to determine which infrastructures to designate as CI, $^{143}$ and, from 'critical information infrastructure' $^{144}$ and 'critical national infrastructure' $^{145}$ to 'national, transnational and supranational critical infrastructure' $^{146}$ — there is little consistency in the terminology adopted by states. The lack of agreement about what constitutes CI for the purposes of norm (f) can be problematic. For instance, election infrastructure in the US was only designated as critical in January 2017 following Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. $^{147}$ Some states have also been hesitant to designate specific sectors as CI due to concerns that this would implicitly condone malicious activities against sectors that are not specified. $^{148}$ The 2021 UN GGE report expressly acknowledges these concerns, noting that, even where a sector is not designated as CI, it does not amount to condoning malicious activities against those sectors. $^{149}$ Furthermore, even where states specify certain sectors as CI, they are not precluded from designating other sectors as such in the future. $^{150}$ There have also been calls to extend norm (f) to mention specific sectors, even if those sectors are already widely considered to be CI.

The contested nature of CI and focus on whether a sector is CI for the purposes of norm (f) has the potential to narrow the application of international law only to those sectors that states have agreed to constitute CI. The need for a cyber operation to affect CI also creates an additional requirement that is not evident in existing international law. This is because, irrespective of whether a sector is designated as CI or not, existing international law obligations apply to cyber operations causing effects in the territory of other states. For example, a cyber operation against election infrastructure rising to the level of a violation of sovereignty or intervention will constitute a violation of international law regardless of whether the victim state considers the infrastructure to be CI or not. Similarly, cyber operations against healthcare facilities causing sufficient effects will constitute violations of international law even if those sectors are not specifically mentioned in norm (f).¹⁵² Therefore, the focus on what constitutes CI for the purposes of norm (f), and the subjectivity of the concept of CI has the potential to introduce additional complexity to determining whether a cyber operation violates international law.\n\n## Norm (f) and uncertainty in international law\n\nNorm (f) seeks to reaffirm the existing legal obligations of states in relation to cyber operations against CI and provide additional specific guidance on responsible state behaviour in this context. However, the harm requirements within norm (f) are contradictory to those in international law, and this further compounds existing uncertainties in how the law applies to cyber operations targeting CI. As a result, there are a range of cyber operations that can constitute violations of international law but not norm (f), or vice versa.\n\nFor example, whether a cyber operation against CI constitutes a use of force will generally be determined based on its 'scale and effects'. Under this approach, there must be a degree of direct physical damage to the CI, or disruption of its functionality which causes damage or harm to individuals comparable to a use of force by kinetic means. The Stuxnet incident is generally considered to have crossed this threshold as it is reported to have caused damage to approximately 1000 centrifuge machines.¹⁵³ Assuming Stuxnet was attributable to a state, its use would have violated norm (f) as it caused intentional damage to CI and was contrary to the responsible state's international obligations.¹⁵⁴ However, a disruptive cyber operation with only adverse economic consequences would generally not constitute a use of force. This could include, for example, a cyber operation against a power grid that causes a temporary blackout without any indirect physical effects or harm to individuals. While a cyber operation of this kind would involve impairing the use of the CI and adversely impact its use for the public for the purposes of norm (f), it would unlikely violate a state's legal obligations under article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n\n¹⁵¹ International Committee of the Red Cross, 'Norms for Responsible State Behavior on Cyber Operations should Build on International Law' (11 February 2020) <https: document=\"\" en=\"\" norms-responsible-state-behavior-cyber-operations-should-build-international-law=\"\" www.icrc.org=\"\">.

    "CYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 441\n\nFor a cyber operation of this kind without direct physical effects to violate the non-intervention principle, there is a requirement that the operation was intended to be coercive and directed at matters states have the right to decide freely. For example, where a cyber operation causing a blackout was done with the intention of coercing the targeted state to reverse its policy of recognition of another state, this would constitute an unlawful intervention. But where the cyber operation does not involve the element of coercion directed at matters states should be freely able to decide (or the responsible state's intention is unknown), then the cyber operation would fall outside the scope of the non-intervention principle. This is despite the impairment of CI and its adverse impact on the public that is consistent with the harm requirement in norm (f). Whether a cyber operation of this kind violates sovereignty is also unsettled given the divergence in views among states on the issue.\n\nIn relation to cyber operations against CI and violations of sovereignty, consider, for example, where a state obtains unauthorised access to another state's power grid, election infrastructure or hospital systems and installs malware that gives it the ability to cause disruptive or destructive effects on that infrastructure at a later point in time. Whether a cyber operation of this kind violates sovereignty is unsettled as the precise boundaries of states' legal obligations in this context are still developing and evolving as more state practice emerges. According to France and Iran, which adopt the rule approach to sovereignty and consider any penetration of their networks to be a violation of sovereignty, this conduct would constitute a violation of international law at the point in time at which there is unauthorized access to their systems.[155] However, for states like the Czech Republic and New Zealand, merely obtaining unauthorised access or installing malware that does not impair the functioning of the systems would not constitute violations of sovereignty.[156] Instead, for these states, it is only at the point in time at which that malware is used to cause significant disruptive or destructive effects that the cyber operation would qualify as a violation of sovereignty. Similarly, for states like the UK adopting the principle approach to sovereignty, the cyber operation could not constitute a violation of international law unless and until it rises to the level of a use of force or involves coercion and violates the non-intervention principle.[157] Accordingly, a range of cyber operations that meet the harm requirements in norm (f) would fall outside of its scope because, given the uncertainty around how international law applies in this context, it would be unclear whether those operations also violate the law as required by norm (f).\n\nFurther compounding the uncertainty in how existing international law applies are the harm requirements of norm (f) that are not consistent with international law. Norm (f) requires 'intentional damage', but the intent is not a requisite element for most of the rules of international law outlined above. In relation to the prohibition on the use of force, there is no requirement for intention.[158] Instead, the approach adopted by most states and in the Tallinn Manual focuses on the 'scale and effects' of a cyber operation.[159] Similarly, intention is not a requirement for a violation of sovereignty.[160] While intention is an element of the non-intervention principle,[161] the focus of the law here is on the intention of the state applying the coercion and not\n\n155 See United Nations Secretary-General (n 119) 22; Islamic Republic of Iran (n 123).\n156 See Czech Republic (n 121); New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade (n 89).\n157 See Wright (n 107).\n158 See Olivier Corten, The Law Against War: The Prohibition on the Use of Force in Contemporary International Law (Bloomsbury Publishing 2010) 78–80.\n159 Schmitt (n 90) 331.\n160 Corten (n 158) 83; Schmitt (n 90) 24.\n161 Jamnejad and Wood (n 97).

This means that there is no need for ‘intentional damage’ to be caused by a cyber operation for the non-intervention principle to be violated. Norm (f), however, specifically refers to intentional damage. As a result, where a state engages in a cyber operation against CI that causes unintentional damage to the CI, the activity could constitute a violation of sovereignty or a use of force but would fall outside the scope of the intentional damage contemplated by norm (f).¹⁶²\n\nThe approach to impairment evident in norm (f) is useful in terms of the specificity of the requirement for an (even minimally) adverse impact on services provided to the public by the CI. This encompasses a very broad spectrum of cyber operations against CI, including disruptive cyber operations that may fall outside the scope of the prohibition on the use of force and the non-intervention principle. However, unless these cyber operations cause sufficient effects to constitute a use of force, or are accompanied by coercive intention and satisfy the non-intervention principle, they would fall outside the scope of existing international law and also outside of norm (f). As such, while the ‘additional specific guidance’ that norm (f) provides in its approach to impairment is useful given the broad spectrum of cyber operations against CI that it captures, there is uncertainty about whether most of such cyber operations would constitute violations of international law as required under norm (f).\n\nFinally, when considering low-level cyber operations used to pre-position or prepare for potentially destructive cyber operations against CI in peacetime, what is revealed is the dark side of norm (f) and existing international law in this context.¹⁶³ Given that these kinds of cyber operations do not cause immediate damage or impairment and, from a technical perspective, can be indistinguishable from cyber espionage, they are effectively permitted under existing international law and generally will not be seen to constitute violations of sovereignty. But much of CI is dual-use and this means that under certain conditions it can be lawfully subject to attack through cyber means in an armed conflict.¹⁶⁴ Essentially, except in circumstances where there is evidence of an imminent armed attack,¹⁶⁵ norm (f) and existing international law allow states to engage in cyber operations against CI that involve pre-positioning and preparing for potentially destructive effects in the future.¹⁶⁶\n\nTherefore, norm (f) introduces additional complexity to the application of international law in this context, and this complexity is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are considered to be ‘off limits’. The subjective nature of what constitutes CI and the requirement for a sector to be CI to be captured by norm (f) creates a requirement that is not evident in international law and effectively narrows its application.\n\n¹⁶² However, where a cyber operation of this kind also has an adverse impact on the public then it would constitute impairment under the second type of harm within norm (f). This could amount to a violation of international law on sovereignty, but this is uncertain given the current debate about sovereignty.\n\n¹⁶³ The norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace only operate in peacetime.

See Fidler (n 83) 12; Jolley (n 51) 181–4. See also Broeders and others (n 60).\n\n¹⁶⁵ For example, according to Australia, states may exercise a right of anticipatory self-defence where ‘a threatened armed attack in the form of an offensive cyber operation’ that could be launched ‘in a split second’ and could cause ‘large-scale loss of human life and damage to critical infrastructure’. See George Brandis, ‘The Right of Self-Defence against Imminent Armed Attack in International Law’ (Lecture delivered at the University of Queensland, Brisbane, 11 April 2017) 8 <https: 05=\"\" 2017=\"\" developments-international-law-self-defence-against-imminent-armed-attack=\"\" blog=\"\" law.uq.edu.au=\"\">. Similarly, according to NATO’s Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations, non-destructive cyber operations, such as those causing temporary disruptions of service or involving information gathering where they are conducted to enable a conventional threat – including an imminent threat of one – could be considered to trigger the right of self-defence.

David Fidler, for example, suggests a new cyber-defence norm adopting an ‘all hazards’ strategy to protect CI that does not focus on the legal regime (whether cyber crime or espionage) but instead on ensuring ‘networks are protected against infiltrations from any source’.

    "CYBER OPERATIONS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE • 443\n\nInternational law obligations apply to cyber operations conducted by states irrespective of whether they target what the victim state has designated as CI or not. While there is a degree of uncertainty around the thresholds at which violations of international law on the use of force, intervention and sovereignty occur, the harm requirements in norm (f) have the potential to compound these uncertainties as they are not consistent with these rules of international law.\n\nAccordingly, more clarity about the relationship between international law and norm (f) is needed, and about how international law applies to cyber operations targeting sectors that states have deemed to be CI. This is particularly the case in relation to international law on sovereignty. Especially where low-level cyber operations without immediately disruptive or destructive effects are involved, more states need to provide detailed accounts of when they consider the law to be violated and the relationship between sovereignty and sectors they consider to be CI. While a state's domestic legislation – like the Australian NSLA – may criminalise various activities such as the installation of malware onto CI on a national level, states should also expressly outline how they regard these activities on an international level. Here the approach to impairment in norm (f) can serve as useful guidance on when a cyber operation should violate sovereignty.¹⁶⁷ Similarly, the fact that CI is targeted can serve as an indicia of a violation of sovereignty. For example, this is the approach that Germany has adopted making an explicit connection between cyber operations against its CI and violations of its sovereignty.¹⁶⁸ In relation to low-level cyber operations, such as those involving the installation of malware enabling a persistent presence on CI that is generally accepted as a permissible form of espionage, these should be seen as potential violations of sovereignty given the purpose for which they are conducted.¹⁶⁹ As such, while clarity around when cyber operations violate sovereignty and the relevance of a sector's designation as CI is needed, international law applies to cyber operations by states irrespective of norm (f) which introduces counterproductive complexity to the legal analysis in this context.\n\n# CONCLUSION\n\nThis article examined the norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace and international law prohibiting malicious cyber operations against CI. It demonstrated that norm (f), which prohibits cyber operations that damage or impair CI, introduces complexity to the application of international law that is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are prohibited by international law. This is due to the subjective nature of CI, the contradictory legal status of norm (f), and the ways in which the harm requirements of norm (f) compound existing uncertainties about how international law applies to cyber operations where CI is targeted. To develop clarity about what cyber operations against CI should be 'off limits', more states need to outline their positions on the threshold at which they consider the law to be violated – especially in relation to sovereignty – to ensure that malicious low-level cyber operations, in particular, do not fall outside of these legal constraints.\n\n¹⁶⁷ This has been recently recognized in the UN OEWG 2021 report where it was noted that a cyber operation contrary to international law that 'intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public, could pose a threat not only to security but also to State sovereignty'. See UN OEWG 2021 report (n 48) 4.\n\n¹⁶⁸ According to Germany, where a cyber operation targets a state's CI it 'may indicate that a State's territorial sovereignty has been violated'. However, given, among other things, the lack of international agreement of what constitutes CI, Germany maintained that this in and of itself cannot constitute the basis for a violation. The Federal Government of Germany (n 89) 4.\n\n¹⁶⁹ For example, Asaf Lubin maintains that cyber espionage should be unlawful where the purpose for which it is conducted is unlawful. Asaf Lubin, 'The Liberty to Spy' (2020) 61(1) HILJ 185, 238–9. Other academics have also expressed support for adopting a purpose approach in determining the lawfulness of cyber espionage. See Broeders and others (n 60) 10."

    "abstract": "There has been agreement at the United Nations level about a set of norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, including norm (f) which prohibits cyber operations that cause intentional damage or impairment to critical infrastructure (CI). This article examines norm (f) in light of existing international law prohibiting malicious cyber operations against CI. It argues that norm (f) introduces complexity to the application of the law in this context that is counterproductive to developing clarity about the cyber operations against CI that are prohibited by international law. This is due to the subjectivity of the concept of CI, the contradictory legal status of norm (f), and due to existing uncertainties in how international law applies to state conduct in cyberspace which are compounded by norm (f). The article concludes that states need to develop more clarity about the relationship between international law and the norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, and about how international law applies to cyber operations, particularly where CI is targeted.
