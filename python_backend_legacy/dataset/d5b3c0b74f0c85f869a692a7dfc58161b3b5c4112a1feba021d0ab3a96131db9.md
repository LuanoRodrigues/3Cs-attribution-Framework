Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill.’ This emergency alert was sent out to thousands of Hawaiians on 13 January 2018, at 8:08 a.m. local time.² Luckily, it turned out to be not a drill, but rather the result of human error. An employee, it appeared, had pushed the wrong button (twice). The reactions on social media and in real life – the media was full of stories of scared Hawaiians hiding in garages – tells us a lot about our times both in terms of international security (ballistic missiles threats were a Cold War staple) and in terms of cybersecurity: Human errors can cause real damages – and humans are an integral part of cybersecurity.\nThis was the example on how cybersecurity issues are interlinked to general security issues from the first edition. Fast forward 5 years later, a similar example has occurred: During the attack by Hamas terrorists against Israel in October 2023, a hacktivist group named ‘AnonGhost’ managed to exploit flaws in the app ‘Red Alert’, which is used among others in Israel as a missile alert service.³ Similar to the false alarm sent out to Hawaiians, the hackers warned users of an upcoming nuclear attack. Dissimilar, however, this time there was no human error, but an attempt by malicious actors to influence an ongoing conflict.\nBe it online or offline,⁴ be it in the kinetic world or in cyberspace, we need norms – and have always needed them. ‘In the long march of mankind from the cave to the computer’, as Malcolm N. Shaw puts it in his introduction to international law, ‘a central role has always\n¹ Prof. Dr. Matthias C. Kettemann, LL.M.

Political and legal approaches to preventing cyberwar⁶ and cybercrime⁷ such as the negotiations on a UN Cybercrime Convention⁸ have attracted considerable attention internationally. This study shows that the Internet is critical infrastructure in itself and also functionally essential for other critical infrastructure. The UN General Assembly, in Resolution 64/211 of 21 December 2009, promoted the creation of a global culture of cybersecurity⁹ and expressed concerns in light of growing threats to the reliable functioning of the Internet (technically: ‘of critical information infrastructures and to the integrity of the information carried over those’). These affect ‘domestic, national and international welfare’. The Resolution affirms that states are obliged to deal systematically with these threats and coordinate both with national stakeholders and internationally with the goal of facilitating the achievement of cybersecurity.\nThe 2013 Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) report underlined that applying norms derived from ‘existing international law relevant to the use of ICTs by States is an essential measure to reduce risks to international peace, security and stability’. The Charter of the United Nations is applicable to the whole gamut of socio-economic activity on the Internet and thus ‘essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment’.¹⁰ Applying international law to the Internet lies in the common interest and safeguarding the Internet as such also lies in the common interest because a stable, secure and functional Internet is essential for international security. Building on this consensus, the 2015¹¹ report of the GGE again confirmed that international law, the UN Charter and\n⁵ Malcolm N.

Common criminals continue to misuse the Internet both for online variants of common scams and for Internet-specific (technology-based) attacks. The size of monetary loss is difficult to evaluate but an often-quoted estimate (e.g. by the European Commission)¹⁵ by Cybersecurity Ventures expects losses of around US$ 8 trillion for the year 2023 worldwide.¹⁶ This threat requires international cooperation. At the same time, some criminal misuses of the Internet are not direct threats to the Internet’s integrity, as criminal networks rely on the Internet to conduct their activities. But other attacks, including disruptive attacks or others not linked to monetary gain (such as attacks to cause social unrest in the introductory Israel example) can amount to substantial threats to cybersecurity and the Internet’s functionality.\nDifferent levels of Internet security awareness and capabilities globally matter to all states because of the interconnectedness of ICTs and the networked nature of the Internet. ‘These vulnerabilities are amplified’, the UN’s Group of Governmental Experts on IT and Security complained in 2013, ‘by disparities in national law, regulations and practices related to the use of ICTs’.¹⁷ Only international cooperation in the protection of the Internet can help meet these challenges. The role of the Internet’s integrity in contributing to international security and the threats posed by international cybercrime are further reasons why ensuring cybersecurity and protecting the integrity of the Internet lies in the common interest.\nThis chapter examines the protection of cybersecurity under international law and develops a future-oriented approach to increasing cybersecurity through international law. After outlining my concept of cybersecurity (2) and explaining why protecting cybersecurity lies in the common interest of all states (3), I will outline which international legal norms protect cybersecurity (4). After that, I will identify approaches to better protect cybersecurity in international law (5).

TOWARDS A COMPREHENSIVE CONCEPT OF CYBERSECURITY\nCybersecurity is defined very broadly by some states and covers risks and threats such as cyberwarfare, cyberterrorism, cybercrime and cyber-espionage.¹⁸ There is no doubt that cybersecurity is a crucial part of national, domestic, security, foreign and defence policy.¹⁹ As a central theme of Internet policy,²⁰ cybersecurity is closely linked with the stability, robustness, resilience and functionality of the Internet.²¹ Cybersecurity can be threatened by cybercrime and cyberterrorism, but also by a lack of legal and technical cooperation between states and a lack of preventive measures, such as developing crisis intervention centres and teams, as well as transnational crisis communication structures for cyber incidents.\nThe major 2017 WannaCry²² and NotPetya²³ ransomware attacks, for example, were the first world-wide felt examples of how vulnerabilities are caused by a number of factors, including software companies who fail to provide updates or no longer service vulnerabilities, affected companies that have slow patch cycles, secret services that stockpile vulnerabilities, and states that do not force essential service providers (like healthcare companies) to ensure that their systems are stable and secure.²⁴ These issues remain, even if so-called ‘Zero-day vulnerabilities’ occur and are exploited more often.²⁵\nFostering and ensuring cybersecurity are a prerequisite for the stability of national economic processes and the international business and financial system, for transnational communication flows and for the functioning of energy grids, the enforcement of human rights, and the performance of national, regional and international defence infrastructures. Ultimately, cybersecurity is fundamental to the full realization of all human rights.\nIt is too often the case that (cyber)security is contrasted with (Internet) freedom and the two concepts are played against each other to the detriment of both. This view misses the point.\n¹⁸ See Myriam Dunn Cavelty and Camino Kavanagh, Chapter 5. They differentiate between two notions of cybersecurity: a technical information security approach and a national security-focused approach. Our use of the concept encompasses elements from both conceptions.\n¹⁹ More states have Cybersecurity Strategies now.

The Cybersecurity Strategy for Germany defines cybersecurity as ‘IT security of the networked or network-capable information technology systems in cyberspace’. IT security is understood to be ensuring the ‘IT security is [...] the state in which the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and availability of information and IT are protected by appropriate measures.’²⁷ This definition is very technology-oriented and too short-sighted in light of how cybersecurity is practically perceived by business and society. The security on the Internet and of the Internet cannot simply be equated with the security of systems and data. To view cybersecurity correctly, it must be regarded holistically. Each meaningful cybersecurity concept should be comprehensive and value-based: a commitment to a stable, secure, resilient, fully functional, open and free Internet and its protection against state and private attacks of any kind.²⁸\n## 3. PROTECTING CYBERSECURITY LIES IN THE COMMON INTEREST OF ALL STATES\n## 3.1 Cybersecurity and the Common Interest\nIn 1998, experts working on behalf of the UNESCO posed the question whether the ‘United Nations General Assembly [could] affirm the principle of regarding cyberspace as “the common heritage of humanity”’²⁹ and thus safeguard it. They failed to answer the question, which was well enough because it was the wrong one. It is not ‘cyberspace’ we should concern ourselves with, but rather the Internet itself; and rather than using the concept of common heritage of mankind, which presupposes a certain historical stability the Internet does not have, we rather need to establish why protecting the Internet lies in the global common interest.\nDuring the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), which the United Nations convened in 2003 and 2005 to establish a normative trajectory for the Internet, states affirmed their common desire and commitment to build an information society that is ‘people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented’ and in which individuals, communities and peoples can:\nMatthias C. Kettemann and Martin Müller - 9781035308514\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/03/2025 03:25:18PM\nvia University College London (UCL)\n'This is not a drill'\nachieve their full potential in promoting their sustainable development and improving their quality of life premised on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and respecting fully and upholding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.³⁰\nWe have here a first clear answer to the question about what ‘vision’ the international community pursues regarding the impact of the Internet.\nClearly, achieving world peace and international security (as enshrined in the UN Charter), ensuring human development (as codified in the Millennium Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals) and respecting, protecting and implementing human rights (as normatively ordered in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)) are in the global common interest. Different normative orders within international law contribute towards achieving these common interests. By establishing finalities for a normative order, such as WSIS has done for Internet governance, the normative development of that order is anchored in the finality of ensuring the common interest, lying in peace, security and development. Creating a people-centred, development-oriented information society is thus part of the broader normative commitment in international law to protecting the common interest of ensuring world peace, international security and development.\nWe have thus established that there is a global common interest in ensuring a people-centred and development-oriented information society. But is protecting cybersecurity and thus the Internet’s integrity essential for reaching these goals? UN Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression, Frank La Rue, in a groundbreaking report on the impact of the Internet on freedom of expression, described the Internet as a ‘catalyst for individuals to exercise their right to freedom of opinion and expression’. Freedom of expression on the Internet itself is a ‘facilitator of the realisation of a range of other human rights’.³¹ The multiple challenges that the Internet brings for human rights notwithstanding,³² the absence of the Internet (or of an Internet without cybersecurity) would seriously challenge the realization of human rights. There are important corollary rights that are premised upon exercising free speech on the Internet. These include the freedom of assembly and association online, the right to (digital) education and the right of access to digital knowledge.³³ From all these rights we can also derive a right to access to online information and communication, which is crucial for human development. Similar arguments have been voiced by courts and international organizations.³⁴\n³⁰ WSIS, Geneva Declaration of Principles, WSIS-03/GENEVA/DOC/4-E (12 December 2003) para. 1.\n³¹ F.

It is similarly a facilitator for human security.\nIn the same vein, the 2013 report of the UN GGE determined that the application of norms derived from existing international law is ‘essential’ to minimize risks to world peace and international security and stability.³⁵ Viewed in the context of information technology challenges, cybersecurity is now one aspect of ‘world peace’.³⁶ When analysing the protection of cybersecurity under international law, the GGE report from 2015,³⁷ and reiterated in 2021,³⁸ which was adopted in consensus by a representative group of governmental experts, is very helpful,³⁹ stating, inter alia, that the international community aspires to regulate the Internet in a peaceful manner ‘for the common good of mankind’.\n## 3.2 Ensuing International Legal Duties\nProtecting cybersecurity is a common interest of all states. This community interest is not an aggregate of the individual sets of interests; rather, it lies at their intersection. If a protected interest is part of the community interest, this entails consequences relevant to international law. States are therefore responsible to the international community with regard to cybersecurity according to their judicial authority over critical infrastructures pertinent to it.⁴⁰\nTo the extent that a state controls Critical Internet Resources (CIRs), it has to exercise this jurisdiction mindful of threats to cybersecurity and especially the security of these CIRs in a manner that ensures the common interest. To the extent that national politics (and policies) can impact the Internet negatively, a state has to refrain from their formulation and implementation. A state’s sovereignty is reduced because of the limits the protection of the Internet as a common interest lays upon him. The United States, as former delegated manager of the CIRs, therefore only had ‘custodial sovereignty’.⁴¹ This implied that the United States had to enter into consultations with other states with regard to the management of CIRs and make sure that the management was transparent and accountable, ideally to the international community\n³⁵ Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, A/68/98 (24 June 2013) para. 16.\n³⁶ Ibid.\n³⁷ GGE Report (2015), n. 11 above.\n³⁸ Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, A/76/135 (14 July 2021) ('GGE Report (2021)') para. 5, 71(e).\n³⁹ Members: Belarus, Brazil, China, Colombia, Egypt, Estonia, France, Germany, Ghana, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Russian Federation, Spain, United Kingdom and United States.\n⁴⁰ For documentation of the reports of individual member states, see the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, www.un.org/disarmament/topics/informationsecurity.\n⁴¹ See W.

In assessing whether politics may impact the Internet negatively, it makes sense to suggest the precautionary principle as a guide to decision-making.⁴⁴\nA second consequence is that humankind – that is all actors making up the international community, and not only states – have a legitimate interest in making sure that all other actors protect the Internet (or at least do not actively harm it). Though sovereignty-oriented states⁴⁵ have suggested exclusive sovereignty over national Internet segments, the character of the Internet, as protected by international law as a common interest, limits their sovereignty. The 2005 Tunis Agenda, though valuable in its description of the normative goals of the information society, still lays down that ‘policy authority for internet-related public policy issues’ is a ‘sovereign right of States’.⁴⁶ This needs to be qualified in light of a common interest approach to protecting the Internet in that the states’ policy authority is no longer an exclusively sovereign right, but part and parcel of their sovereignty, to be exercised in the common interest. What sovereignty they have over Internet-related resources has to be understood in light of changing circumstances and the importance of the pursuance of common interests. As far as international law extends to non-state actors, these are also under obligation to support the pursuance, by state actors, of the global interest in safeguarding the Internet’s integrity. This means, for example, that there is an international law-based duty, via the Ruggie Principles,⁴⁷ for companies to respect human rights and rights of victims of business-related abuses and their right to access to remedies.\n⁴² NTIA, NTIA Finds IANA Stewardship Transition Proposal Meets Criteria to Complete Privatization (9 June 2016), available at www.ntia.doc.gov/press-release/2016/iana-stewardship-transition-proposal-meets-criteria-complete-privatization.\n⁴³ ICANN IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG), Proposal to Transition the Stewardship of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Functions from the US Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to the Global Multistakeholder Community (March 2016), available at www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/iana-stewardship-transition-proposal-10mar16-en.pdf; and ICANN CCWG Accountability, Supplemental Final Proposal on Work Stream 1 Recommendations (February 2016), available at www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/ccwg-accountability-supp-proposal-work-stream-1-recs-23 feb16-en.pdf.\n⁴⁴ See the work of the Council of Europe’s Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (MC-S-CI), www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/media/MC-S-CI/default_en.asp, especially its report International and Multi-stakeholder Co-operation on Cross-border Internet (2010).\n⁴⁵ See International Code of Conduct for Information Security, Annex to the letter dated 12 September 2011 from the Permanent Representatives of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, A/66/359 (14 September 2011).\n⁴⁶ WSIS, Tunis Agenda (2005) para. 35.\n⁴⁷ See Report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, J.

To that end, the protection of the integrity of the Internet and the guarantee of cybersecurity as a common interest are essential.\n## 4. CYBERSECURITY AND INTERNATIONAL LAW\n## 4.1 International Law and the Internet\nInternational law is the only area of law with which global (public) goods can be managed and global public interest protected.49 The ubiquity of the technology underlying the Internet, which is not restricted by national borders, renders strictly single-state regulation largely ineffective. International law is needed to legitimately and effectively ensure cybersecurity in the common interest of all states. This is not a new insight.50 Without legitimate and effective protection of cybersecurity under international law, individuals and societies cannot develop to their full potential. A similar self-commitment to an international law-based Internet policy was presented by the European Commission in 2014.51\n48 The question regarding its role: see B. Fassbender, ‘Zwischen Staatsräson und Gemeinschaftsbindung. Zur Gemeinwohlorientierung des Völkerrechts der Gegenwart’ in H. Münkler and K.

Although treaties provide (legal) certainty (especially in the eyes of powerful states or states relying on traditional sovereignty concepts),⁵⁴ bilateral cybersecurity treaties usually do not live up to the complexity of the issue due to the universality of the Internet, while multilateral treaties can only be attained through lengthy negotiation processes with an uncertain outcome.⁵⁵ There is still no treaty on cybersecurity, though.⁵⁶ Binding international law on cybersecurity can therefore only be derived to date from customary international law and the principles of international law.\n## 4.3 Cybersecurity and Customary International Law\nIn the Tunis Agenda, adopted at the UN World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), and in the Tunis Commitment (2005) (building on the Geneva documents of 2003), the signatory states of the world committed themselves to a:\npeople-centered, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society, premised on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, international law and multilateralism, and respecting fully and upholding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights⁵⁷\n⁵² The scope of this study does not allow for going into detail on all applicable principles of international law.

Communicators, recipients and the contents of communications are protected by Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), parts of which are based on customary law. Along with these state obligations based on individual human rights (prohibiting states from interfering with certain communicative rights), positive obligations related to Internet infrastructure can also be derived from the state obligations to provide protection and assurance pertaining to information- and communication-related rights. States are therefore obliged to ensure the sustainability and security of the networks in order to allow individuals to realize their human rights.\nParticularly relevant to ensuring and promoting cybersecurity are the following principles of international law,⁶⁰ some of which have been translated into treaty law in the UN Charter, are protected under customary international law or are recognized as part of the general principles of international law: sovereign equality, the ban on aggression and intervention, peaceful settlement of disputes, the protection of human rights, the cooperation principle (which draws on the principle of good neighbourliness (‘no harm’) and the precautionary principle (‘due diligence’)).\nThe principle of sovereign equality (UN Charter, Article 2(1)) is a key principle of international law. As a ‘pivotal principle’⁶¹ it is also of special importance for cybersecurity. Each state has jurisdiction and power over its territory and over the ICT infrastructure located there; this also means, however, that it bears a responsibility to ensure that no attacks against other states or institutions, which would infringe on international law, are organized or carried out from its territory.\nIn addition, the non-intervention principle (UN Charter, Article 2(7)) can be brought to fruition: an intense damage to Internet functionality in another state (e.g. by cyber-attacks) could constitute an intervention, although attribution problems will regularly arise.⁶² Only some of the attacks originating from the territory of a state represent an ‘intervention’ in terms of international law, because most attacks will be attributable to non-governmental protagonists or to protagonists whose association with governmental agencies cannot be proven.⁶³\n⁵⁸ Ibid. no. 3.\n⁵⁹ WSIS, Tunis Agenda for the Information Society, WSIS-05/TUNIS/DOC/6 (Rev. 1)-G (18 November 2005) no. 31.\n⁶⁰ GGE Report (2015), n. 11 above, para. 26.\n⁶¹ Samantha Besson, ‘Sovereignty’ in Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), MPEPIL (2011) para. 1.\n⁶² Sven-Hendrik Schulze, Cyber-‘War’, Testfall der Staatenverantwortlichkeit (Tübingen: Mohr, 2015).\n⁶³ See GGE Report (2015), n. 11 above: ‘the indication that an ICT activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or the ICT infrastructure of a State may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that State. The Group noted that the accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated’ (ibid. para. 28(f)).\nMatthias C.

In the context of the Internet, this Article could only be applied to especially serious cases of cyber-attacks with substantial kinetic effects.\nThe principle of peaceful settlement of disputes is relevant to cybersecurity insofar as any state has the duty, in the event of an incident, to first determine the facts and to collect evidence for attribution of a breach of international law to a particular state. Even if this succeeds, peaceful means of dispute settlement should first be sought.\nThe principle of the protection of human rights is a fundamental principle of international law that is also relevant to cybersecurity. What is problematic under international law are attempts by a state to enforce cybersecurity through an excessive control of the Internet (such as setting up and using surveillance capabilities or government screening of all Internet communication).\nThe principle of good neighbourliness (UN Charter, Article 74), or ‘no harm’ principle, can be considered as a global principle in the Internet era. Originally only relevant in terms of the relationship with adjacent states, the principle has been gradually extended.^[64]^ In the Corfu Channel case, the International Court of Justice described the principle as ‘every state’s obligation not to knowingly allow its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states’.^[65]^ The ‘no harm’ principle has its roots in the Trail Smelter^[66]^ and Lake Lanoux^[67]^ cases. It was formulated in Principle 21 of the Stockholm Declaration (1972)^[68]^ and Principle 2 of the Rio Declaration (1992):^[69]^ signatory states are committed ‘to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction’. This can easily be applied to other areas in analogy to the environment.\nThe obligation to prevent cross-border damage has crystallized into customary law. Contractual confirmation can be found in Article 194(2) of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea^[70]^ and Article 20(1) of the ASEAN Agreement on the Conservation of Nature and\nMatthias C. Kettemann and Martin Müller - 9781035308514\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/03/2025 03:25:18PM\nvia University College London (UCL)\nResearch handbook on human rights and digital technology\nNatural Resources (1985). Most recently, the ICJ confirmed in the Nuclear Weapons case⁷¹ that the threat to the environment is ‘no abstraction but represents the living space, the quality of life and the very health of human beings, including generations unborn’. In accordance with the ‘no harm’ principle, no state may utilize its dominion in such a manner that would cause damage to other states. In the preventive dimension of the ‘no harm’ principle, a state must take measures to prevent such hazards. Among other things, a commitment to an appropriate infrastructure, the development of emergency plans and the establishment of an international crisis cooperation structure (and culture) can be construed from this.\nThe precautionary principle (‘due diligence’) is of special importance for cybersecurity. First, the due diligence principle entails information and consultation obligations.⁷² In the scientific world, it is controversial as to what extent the precautionary principle has a ‘due diligence’ dimension or whether the precautionary obligations of states are covered in practice by the ‘no harm’ principle. The principle of due diligence was also applied in the field of combating terrorism and the financing of terrorism.⁷³\n## 4.4 Shift Towards Due Diligence\nWith some justification, normative principles for the regulation of cybersecurity can therefore be derived from the principle of due diligence. As a result, it is the responsibility of states, inter alia, ensuing from this principle, to prevent cyber-attacks originating from their own territory and to (proactively) establish a legal system that ensures and fosters cybersecurity.⁷⁴ This can be fulfilled, for instance, by ‘passing stringent criminal laws, conducting vigorous investigations, prosecuting attackers, and, during the investigation and prosecution, cooperating with the victim-states of cyberattacks that originated from within their borders’.⁷⁵\nIn its preventive dimension, the due diligence principle helps to identify the obligations of states with regard to cybersecurity, particularly with regard to cybercrime, global cooperation and establishment of capacities. Cybersecurity due diligence was described as part of customary international law, whereby particularly the following preventive duties have emerged as recognized obligations under international law:\n- that governments and other stakeholders bolster cybersecurity and develop cybersecurity strategies to protect crucial infrastructures;⁷⁶\nMatthias C. Kettemann and Martin Müller - 9781035308514\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/03/2025 03:25:18PM\nvia University College London (UCL)\n'This is not a drill' 123\n- that states (and other relevant stakeholders) work together more closely in the fight against cybercrime and cyberterrorism,⁷⁷ and that they ratify conventions such as the Convention on Cybercrime of the Council of Europe;⁷⁸\n- that states conclude treaties promoting cooperation between their police authorities;⁷⁹ and\n- that states establish confidence-building measures and increase the level of information sharing, both generally as well as (and especially) in the event of cybersecurity-related incidents.⁸⁰\nConfidence-building measures are more extensive than obligations under international law ensuing from the duty of cooperation.⁸¹ They are relevant to the evolution of legal norms, however, insofar as they indicate the direction of how obligations under international law are developing.⁸²\n# 5. EMBRACING CYBERSECURITY NORMS IN INTERNATIONAL LAW\nAny attempt to embrace cybersecurity in international law must be preceded by the recognition of the significance of the multi-stakeholder approach in the normative development of international Internet law.⁸³ Since the process of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) began, with just a few exceptions, states have been committing to the integration of all stakeholders in the normative processes relevant to Internet regulation. The multi-stakeholder approach is put into practice in the development and application of instruments and processes\nTechnologies'; 57/239 of 20 December 2002 on the 'Creation of a Global Culture of Cybersecurity' and 58/199 of 23 December 2003 on 'The Creation of a Global Culture of Cybersecurity and the Protection of Critical Information Infrastructures'; 53/70 of 4 December 1998, 54/49 of 1 December 1999, 55/28 of 20 November 2000, 56/19 of 29 November 2001, 57/53 of 22 November 2002, 58/32 of 8 December 2003, 59/61 of 3 December 2004, 60/45 of 8 December 2005, 61/54 of 6 December 2006, 62/17 of 5 December 2007 and 63/37 of 2 December 2008 on 'Developments with respect to Information Technologies in the Context of International Security').\n⁷⁷ See UNODC, Resolution 22/8 on 'Promoting Technical Assistance and Capacity Building to Strengthen National Measures and International Cooperation Against Cybercrime', UNODC/ CCPCJ/2013/RES/22/8, para. 4.\n⁷⁸ See GGE Report (2013), n. 10 above, para. 22.\n⁷⁹ Ibid. para. 22.\n⁸⁰ Ibid. para. 26 et seq.\n⁸¹ Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, Decision No. 1202, 'OSCE Confidence-Building Measures to Reduce the Risks of Conflict Stemming from the Use of Information and Communication Technologies', PC.DEC/1202 (10 March 2016).\n⁸² See Katharina Ziolkowski, 'Confidence Building Measures for Cyberspace' in Katharina Ziolkowski (ed.), *Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy* (Tallinn: NATO CCD COE Publications, 2013) 533–64.\n⁸³ See Matthias C.

They can only offer the opportunity for states (or other stakeholders) to accomplish preparatory work relevant to the normative process. Jointly discussing 'norms' can be useful, because common values will be expressed already in the process of discussion[85] and the positions taken by participating states serve as indications of their attitudes toward an international juridification of cybersecurity.\nA promising approach for embracing binding cybersecurity norms in international law in the long term is the negotiation and adoption of an international treaty. It remains the 'gold standard' of international law and is the most important authoritative source of law. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,[86] which entered into force on 4 November 2016, has shown that even today international treaties covering complex topics such as regulations relating to global public goods (for example, cybersecurity as a prerequisite for a well-functioning Internet) can be successfully concluded.\n# 6. SUMMARY\nIn the light of the importance of the Internet for states, business and society, cybersecurity – as a prerequisite for a reliably functioning and secure Internet – has become a global community interest which needs protection. The technologicalization and informationalization of many key infrastructure provision functions and of many industry control systems open up new vulnerabilities within states that can threaten, if an attack is substantial, international peace and security. Similarly, the increased use of mobile devices, Cloud computing and the use of social networks increases the vulnerability of citizens to acts of cybercrime.\nCybersecurity is a key functional condition for an era defined by information and communications technology. A secure Internet lies in the interest of each individual state and also collectively in the interest of all states of the world as a global community. Cybersecurity thus lies in the global common interest. It has a key security interest for which all the states of the world bear separate and common responsibility. This responsibility must be met through an application of the principles and processes of international law.\nInternational law is to be fully applied to the Internet, including with regard to regulating cybersecurity. Customary international law and the general principles of international law particularly restrict (and define) national Internet policy. Consequently, each state has protection obligations vis-à-vis the international community – to avert threats to the stability, integrity and functionality of the Internet – which can be derived from customary international law. At the same time, states may not restrict freedom on the Internet without limitation under the\nMatthias C.

The global, cross-border Internet traffic may not be adversely affected or in any way destabilized by states due to national legislation and policy.\nIn addition to post-incident information and communication requirements, preventive obligations also arise from the due diligence principle and the tenets of good neighbourliness and can in part only be met in cooperation with nongovernmental stakeholders. This binding cooperation principle of customary international law provides mandatory guidance to states in their development of strategies for promoting cybersecurity. But what complicates the situation is that in responding to cybersecurity threats, states are often fully dependent on private entities and their security experts.\nThe May 2017 WannaCry Ransomware attack, for example, shows how vulnerabilities are caused by a number of factors, including companies who fail to provide updates or no longer service vulnerabilities, affected companies that have slow patch cycles, secret services that stockpile vulnerabilities, and states that do not force essential service providers (like healthcare companies) to ensure that their systems are stable and secure.\nAs the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence concluded with regard to the WannaCry Ransomware attacks:\nCampaigns like WannaCry should remind decision-makers of the importance of baseline cyber security, since in this case the victims could have prevented the spread of ransomware by fairly simple security measures.^[87]^\nBe it baseline cybersecurity or more advanced forms that are necessary for states to implement in order to meet their obligations under international law: the debate on how best to ensure a stable and resilient Internet for all is far from over – and it is international law that provides the impetus, frame and objective of the debate.\nThe normative frame of cybersecurity and the real-world application of it are not yet stable enough to ensure convincingly that honest mistakes, serious crimes and international cyber-attacks are effectively stopped. This should worry us. As Dutch Ruppersberger, a long-time Democratic US Congressman from Maryland, was quoted in 2013 by Rolling Stone magazine as saying: ‘People ask me all the time, “What keeps you up at night?” And I say, “Spicy Mexican food, weapons of mass destruction, and cyber attacks”’.^[88]^ Changing one’s diet might help with the first issue, arms reduction and arms control regimes with the second, and an international law-based global cybersecurity regime with the third: less chili then, and a more nuanced normative order of cybersecurity with clear commitments for each stakeholder.\nMatthias C.

Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill.’ This emergency alert was sent out to thousands of Hawaiians on 13 January 2018, at 8:08 a.m. local time. Luckily, it turned out to be not a drill, but rather the result of human error. An employee, it appeared, had pushed the wrong button (twice). The reactions on social media and in real life – the media was full of stories of scared Hawaiians hiding in garages – tells us a lot about our times both in terms of international security (ballistic missiles threats were a Cold War staple) and in terms of cybersecurity: Human errors can cause real damages – and humans are an integral part of cybersecurity.\nThis was the example on how cybersecurity issues are interlinked to general security issues from the first edition. Fast forward 5 years later, a similar example has occurred: During the attack by Hamas terrorists against Israel in October 2023, a hacktivist group named ‘AnonGhost’ managed to exploit flaws in the app ‘Red Alert’, which is used among others in Israel as a missile alert service. Similar to the false alarm sent out to Hawaiians, the hackers warned users of an upcoming nuclear attack. Dissimilar, however, this time there was no human error, but an attempt by malicious actors to influence an ongoing conflict.\nBe it online or offline, be it in the kinetic world or in cyberspace, we need norms – and have always needed them. ‘In the long march of mankind from the cave to the computer’, as Malcolm N.

Political and legal approaches to preventing cyberwar and cybercrime such as the negotiations on a UN Cybercrime Convention have attracted considerable attention internationally. This study shows that the Internet is critical infrastructure in itself and also functionally essential for other critical infrastructure. The UN General Assembly, in Resolution 64/211 of 21 December 2009, promoted the creation of a global culture of cybersecurity and expressed concerns in light of growing threats to the reliable functioning of the Internet (technically: ‘of critical information infrastructures and to the integrity of the information carried over those’). These affect ‘domestic, national and international welfare’. The Resolution affirms that states are obliged to deal systematically with these threats and coordinate both with national stakeholders and internationally with the goal of facilitating the achievement of cybersecurity.\nThe 2013 Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) report underlined that applying norms derived from ‘existing international law relevant to the use of ICTs by States is an essential measure to reduce risks to international peace, security and stability’. The Charter of the United Nations is applicable to the whole gamut of socio-economic activity on the Internet and thus ‘essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment’. Applying international law to the Internet lies in the common interest and safeguarding the Internet as such also lies in the common interest because a stable, secure and functional Internet is essential for international security. Building on this consensus, the 2015 report of the GGE again confirmed that international law, the UN Charter and\n Malcolm N.

Common criminals continue to misuse the Internet both for online variants of common scams and for Internet-specific (technology-based) attacks. The size of monetary loss is difficult to evaluate but an often-quoted estimate (e.g. by the European Commission) by Cybersecurity Ventures expects losses of around US$ 8 trillion for the year 2023 worldwide. This threat requires international cooperation. At the same time, some criminal misuses of the Internet are not direct threats to the Internet’s integrity, as criminal networks rely on the Internet to conduct their activities. But other attacks, including disruptive attacks or others not linked to monetary gain (such as attacks to cause social unrest in the introductory Israel example) can amount to substantial threats to cybersecurity and the Internet’s functionality.\nDifferent levels of Internet security awareness and capabilities globally matter to all states because of the interconnectedness of ICTs and the networked nature of the Internet. ‘These vulnerabilities are amplified’, the UN’s Group of Governmental Experts on IT and Security complained in 2013, ‘by disparities in national law, regulations and practices related to the use of ICTs’. Only international cooperation in the protection of the Internet can help meet these challenges. The role of the Internet’s integrity in contributing to international security and the threats posed by international cybercrime are further reasons why ensuring cybersecurity and protecting the integrity of the Internet lies in the common interest.\nThis chapter examines the protection of cybersecurity under international law and develops a future-oriented approach to increasing cybersecurity through international law. After outlining my concept of cybersecurity (2) and explaining why protecting cybersecurity lies in the common interest of all states (3), I will outline which international legal norms protect cybersecurity (4). After that, I will identify approaches to better protect cybersecurity in international law (5).

TOWARDS A COMPREHENSIVE CONCEPT OF CYBERSECURITY\nCybersecurity is defined very broadly by some states and covers risks and threats such as cyberwarfare, cyberterrorism, cybercrime and cyber-espionage. There is no doubt that cybersecurity is a crucial part of national, domestic, security, foreign and defence policy. As a central theme of Internet policy, cybersecurity is closely linked with the stability, robustness, resilience and functionality of the Internet. Cybersecurity can be threatened by cybercrime and cyberterrorism, but also by a lack of legal and technical cooperation between states and a lack of preventive measures, such as developing crisis intervention centres and teams, as well as transnational crisis communication structures for cyber incidents.\nThe major 2017 WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks, for example, were the first world-wide felt examples of how vulnerabilities are caused by a number of factors, including software companies who fail to provide updates or no longer service vulnerabilities, affected companies that have slow patch cycles, secret services that stockpile vulnerabilities, and states that do not force essential service providers (like healthcare companies) to ensure that their systems are stable and secure. These issues remain, even if so-called ‘Zero-day vulnerabilities’ occur and are exploited more often.\nFostering and ensuring cybersecurity are a prerequisite for the stability of national economic processes and the international business and financial system, for transnational communication flows and for the functioning of energy grids, the enforcement of human rights, and the performance of national, regional and international defence infrastructures. Ultimately, cybersecurity is fundamental to the full realization of all human rights.\nIt is too often the case that (cyber)security is contrasted with (Internet) freedom and the two concepts are played against each other to the detriment of both. This view misses the point.\n See Myriam Dunn Cavelty and Camino Kavanagh, Chapter 5. They differentiate between two notions of cybersecurity: a technical information security approach and a national security-focused approach. Our use of the concept encompasses elements from both conceptions.\n More states have Cybersecurity Strategies now.

The Cybersecurity Strategy for Germany defines cybersecurity as ‘IT security of the networked or network-capable information technology systems in cyberspace’. IT security is understood to be ensuring the ‘IT security is [...] the state in which the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and availability of information and IT are protected by appropriate measures.’ This definition is very technology-oriented and too short-sighted in light of how cybersecurity is practically perceived by business and society. The security on the Internet and of the Internet cannot simply be equated with the security of systems and data. To view cybersecurity correctly, it must be regarded holistically. Each meaningful cybersecurity concept should be comprehensive and value-based: a commitment to a stable, secure, resilient, fully functional, open and free Internet and its protection against state and private attacks of any kind.\n## 3. PROTECTING CYBERSECURITY LIES IN THE COMMON INTEREST OF ALL STATES\n## 3.1 Cybersecurity and the Common Interest\nIn 1998, experts working on behalf of the UNESCO posed the question whether the ‘United Nations General Assembly [could] affirm the principle of regarding cyberspace as “the common heritage of humanity”’ and thus safeguard it. They failed to answer the question, which was well enough because it was the wrong one. It is not ‘cyberspace’ we should concern ourselves with, but rather the Internet itself; and rather than using the concept of common heritage of mankind, which presupposes a certain historical stability the Internet does not have, we rather need to establish why protecting the Internet lies in the global common interest.\nDuring the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), which the United Nations convened in 2003 and 2005 to establish a normative trajectory for the Internet, states affirmed their common desire and commitment to build an information society that is ‘people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented’ and in which individuals, communities and peoples can:\nMatthias C. Kettemann and Martin Müller - 9781035308514\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/03/2025 03:25:18PM\nvia University College London (UCL)\n'This is not a drill'\nachieve their full potential in promoting their sustainable development and improving their quality of life premised on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and respecting fully and upholding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nWe have here a first clear answer to the question about what ‘vision’ the international community pursues regarding the impact of the Internet.\nClearly, achieving world peace and international security (as enshrined in the UN Charter), ensuring human development (as codified in the Millennium Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals) and respecting, protecting and implementing human rights (as normatively ordered in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)) are in the global common interest. Different normative orders within international law contribute towards achieving these common interests. By establishing finalities for a normative order, such as WSIS has done for Internet governance, the normative development of that order is anchored in the finality of ensuring the common interest, lying in peace, security and development. Creating a people-centred, development-oriented information society is thus part of the broader normative commitment in international law to protecting the common interest of ensuring world peace, international security and development.\nWe have thus established that there is a global common interest in ensuring a people-centred and development-oriented information society. But is protecting cybersecurity and thus the Internet’s integrity essential for reaching these goals? UN Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression, Frank La Rue, in a groundbreaking report on the impact of the Internet on freedom of expression, described the Internet as a ‘catalyst for individuals to exercise their right to freedom of opinion and expression’. Freedom of expression on the Internet itself is a ‘facilitator of the realisation of a range of other human rights’. The multiple challenges that the Internet brings for human rights notwithstanding, the absence of the Internet (or of an Internet without cybersecurity) would seriously challenge the realization of human rights. There are important corollary rights that are premised upon exercising free speech on the Internet. These include the freedom of assembly and association online, the right to (digital) education and the right of access to digital knowledge. From all these rights we can also derive a right to access to online information and communication, which is crucial for human development. Similar arguments have been voiced by courts and international organizations.\n WSIS, Geneva Declaration of Principles, WSIS-03/GENEVA/DOC/4-E (12 December 2003) para. 1.\n F.

It is similarly a facilitator for human security.\nIn the same vein, the 2013 report of the UN GGE determined that the application of norms derived from existing international law is ‘essential’ to minimize risks to world peace and international security and stability. Viewed in the context of information technology challenges, cybersecurity is now one aspect of ‘world peace’. When analysing the protection of cybersecurity under international law, the GGE report from 2015, and reiterated in 2021, which was adopted in consensus by a representative group of governmental experts, is very helpful, stating, inter alia, that the international community aspires to regulate the Internet in a peaceful manner ‘for the common good of mankind’.\n## 3.2 Ensuing International Legal Duties\nProtecting cybersecurity is a common interest of all states. This community interest is not an aggregate of the individual sets of interests; rather, it lies at their intersection. If a protected interest is part of the community interest, this entails consequences relevant to international law. States are therefore responsible to the international community with regard to cybersecurity according to their judicial authority over critical infrastructures pertinent to it.\nTo the extent that a state controls Critical Internet Resources (CIRs), it has to exercise this jurisdiction mindful of threats to cybersecurity and especially the security of these CIRs in a manner that ensures the common interest. To the extent that national politics (and policies) can impact the Internet negatively, a state has to refrain from their formulation and implementation. A state’s sovereignty is reduced because of the limits the protection of the Internet as a common interest lays upon him. The United States, as former delegated manager of the CIRs, therefore only had ‘custodial sovereignty’. This implied that the United States had to enter into consultations with other states with regard to the management of CIRs and make sure that the management was transparent and accountable, ideally to the international community\n Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, A/68/98 (24 June 2013) para. 16.\n Ibid.\n GGE Report (2015), n. 11 above.\n Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, A/76/135 (14 July 2021) ('GGE Report (2021)') para. 5, 71(e).\n Members: Belarus, Brazil, China, Colombia, Egypt, Estonia, France, Germany, Ghana, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Russian Federation, Spain, United Kingdom and United States.\n For documentation of the reports of individual member states, see the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, www.un.org/disarmament/topics/informationsecurity.\n See W.

All other states, insofar as they can endanger the Internet’s stability, security and functionality, are pre-empted from doing so. In assessing whether politics may impact the Internet negatively, it makes sense to suggest the precautionary principle as a guide to decision-making.\nA second consequence is that humankind – that is all actors making up the international community, and not only states – have a legitimate interest in making sure that all other actors protect the Internet (or at least do not actively harm it). Though sovereignty-oriented states have suggested exclusive sovereignty over national Internet segments, the character of the Internet, as protected by international law as a common interest, limits their sovereignty. The 2005 Tunis Agenda, though valuable in its description of the normative goals of the information society, still lays down that ‘policy authority for internet-related public policy issues’ is a ‘sovereign right of States’. This needs to be qualified in light of a common interest approach to protecting the Internet in that the states’ policy authority is no longer an exclusively sovereign right, but part and parcel of their sovereignty, to be exercised in the common interest. What sovereignty they have over Internet-related resources has to be understood in light of changing circumstances and the importance of the pursuance of common interests. As far as international law extends to non-state actors, these are also under obligation to support the pursuance, by state actors, of the global interest in safeguarding the Internet’s integrity. This means, for example, that there is an international law-based duty, via the Ruggie Principles, for companies to respect human rights and rights of victims of business-related abuses and their right to access to remedies.\n NTIA, NTIA Finds IANA Stewardship Transition Proposal Meets Criteria to Complete Privatization (9 June 2016), available at www.ntia.doc.gov/press-release/2016/iana-stewardship-transition-proposal-meets-criteria-complete-privatization.\n ICANN IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG), Proposal to Transition the Stewardship of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Functions from the US Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to the Global Multistakeholder Community (March 2016), available at www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/iana-stewardship-transition-proposal-10mar16-en.pdf; and ICANN CCWG Accountability, Supplemental Final Proposal on Work Stream 1 Recommendations (February 2016), available at www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/ccwg-accountability-supp-proposal-work-stream-1-recs-23 feb16-en.pdf.\n See the work of the Council of Europe’s Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (MC-S-CI), www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/media/MC-S-CI/default_en.asp, especially its report International and Multi-stakeholder Co-operation on Cross-border Internet (2010).\n See International Code of Conduct for Information Security, Annex to the letter dated 12 September 2011 from the Permanent Representatives of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, A/66/359 (14 September 2011).\n WSIS, Tunis Agenda (2005) para. 35.\n See Report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, J.

To that end, the protection of the integrity of the Internet and the guarantee of cybersecurity as a common interest are essential.\n## 4. CYBERSECURITY AND INTERNATIONAL LAW\n## 4.1 International Law and the Internet\nInternational law is the only area of law with which global (public) goods can be managed and global public interest protected.49 The ubiquity of the technology underlying the Internet, which is not restricted by national borders, renders strictly single-state regulation largely ineffective. International law is needed to legitimately and effectively ensure cybersecurity in the common interest of all states. This is not a new insight.50 Without legitimate and effective protection of cybersecurity under international law, individuals and societies cannot develop to their full potential. A similar self-commitment to an international law-based Internet policy was presented by the European Commission in 2014.51\n\nMatthias C.

Individual norms from the UN Charter (e.g. the ban on aggression and intervention) are relevant to the international law of cybersecurity. However, there is no single treaty that is primarily concerned with the regulation of the Internet and the key topic of cybersecurity. Although treaties provide (legal) certainty (especially in the eyes of powerful states or states relying on traditional sovereignty concepts), bilateral cybersecurity treaties usually do not live up to the complexity of the issue due to the universality of the Internet, while multilateral treaties can only be attained through lengthy negotiation processes with an uncertain outcome. There is still no treaty on cybersecurity, though. Binding international law on cybersecurity can therefore only be derived to date from customary international law and the principles of international law.\n## 4.3 Cybersecurity and Customary International Law\nIn the Tunis Agenda, adopted at the UN World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), and in the Tunis Commitment (2005) (building on the Geneva documents of 2003), the signatory states of the world committed themselves to a:\npeople-centered, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society, premised on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, international law and multilateralism, and respecting fully and upholding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n The scope of this study does not allow for going into detail on all applicable principles of international law.

Of particular importance for protecting cybersecurity by means of international law is the commitment to international law and the significance of the Internet as a – stable and secure – worldwide institution.\nFor one thing, the international body of law pertaining to cybersecurity provides protection based on human rights. Communicators, recipients and the contents of communications are protected by Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), parts of which are based on customary law. Along with these state obligations based on individual human rights (prohibiting states from interfering with certain communicative rights), positive obligations related to Internet infrastructure can also be derived from the state obligations to provide protection and assurance pertaining to information- and communication-related rights. States are therefore obliged to ensure the sustainability and security of the networks in order to allow individuals to realize their human rights.\nParticularly relevant to ensuring and promoting cybersecurity are the following principles of international law, some of which have been translated into treaty law in the UN Charter, are protected under customary international law or are recognized as part of the general principles of international law: sovereign equality, the ban on aggression and intervention, peaceful settlement of disputes, the protection of human rights, the cooperation principle (which draws on the principle of good neighbourliness (‘no harm’) and the precautionary principle (‘due diligence’)).\nThe principle of sovereign equality (UN Charter, Article 2(1)) is a key principle of international law. As a ‘pivotal principle’ it is also of special importance for cybersecurity. Each state has jurisdiction and power over its territory and over the ICT infrastructure located there; this also means, however, that it bears a responsibility to ensure that no attacks against other states or institutions, which would infringe on international law, are organized or carried out from its territory.\nIn addition, the non-intervention principle (UN Charter, Article 2(7)) can be brought to fruition: an intense damage to Internet functionality in another state (e.g. by cyber-attacks) could constitute an intervention, although attribution problems will regularly arise. Only some of the attacks originating from the territory of a state represent an ‘intervention’ in terms of international law, because most attacks will be attributable to non-governmental protagonists or to protagonists whose association with governmental agencies cannot be proven.\n Ibid. no. 3.\n WSIS, Tunis Agenda for the Information Society, WSIS-05/TUNIS/DOC/6 (Rev. 1)-G (18 November 2005) no. 31.\n GGE Report (2015), n. 11 above, para. 26.\n Samantha Besson, ‘Sovereignty’ in Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), MPEPIL (2011) para. 1.\n Sven-Hendrik Schulze, Cyber-‘War’, Testfall der Staatenverantwortlichkeit (Tübingen: Mohr, 2015).\n See GGE Report (2015), n. 11 above: ‘the indication that an ICT activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or the ICT infrastructure of a State may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that State. The Group noted that the accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated’ (ibid. para. 28(f)).\nMatthias C.

In the context of the Internet, this Article could only be applied to especially serious cases of cyber-attacks with substantial kinetic effects.\nThe principle of peaceful settlement of disputes is relevant to cybersecurity insofar as any state has the duty, in the event of an incident, to first determine the facts and to collect evidence for attribution of a breach of international law to a particular state. Even if this succeeds, peaceful means of dispute settlement should first be sought.\nThe principle of the protection of human rights is a fundamental principle of international law that is also relevant to cybersecurity. What is problematic under international law are attempts by a state to enforce cybersecurity through an excessive control of the Internet (such as setting up and using surveillance capabilities or government screening of all Internet communication).\nThe principle of good neighbourliness (UN Charter, Article 74), or ‘no harm’ principle, can be considered as a global principle in the Internet era. Originally only relevant in terms of the relationship with adjacent states, the principle has been gradually extended.^[64]^ In the Corfu Channel case, the International Court of Justice described the principle as ‘every state’s obligation not to knowingly allow its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states’.^[65]^ The ‘no harm’ principle has its roots in the Trail Smelter^[66]^ and Lake Lanoux^[67]^ cases. It was formulated in Principle 21 of the Stockholm Declaration (1972)^[68]^ and Principle 2 of the Rio Declaration (1992):^[69]^ signatory states are committed ‘to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction’. This can easily be applied to other areas in analogy to the environment.\nThe obligation to prevent cross-border damage has crystallized into customary law. Contractual confirmation can be found in Article 194(2) of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea^[70]^ and Article 20(1) of the ASEAN Agreement on the Conservation of Nature and\nMatthias C. Kettemann and Martin Müller - 9781035308514\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/03/2025 03:25:18PM\nvia University College London (UCL)\nResearch handbook on human rights and digital technology\nNatural Resources (1985). Most recently, the ICJ confirmed in the Nuclear Weapons case that the threat to the environment is ‘no abstraction but represents the living space, the quality of life and the very health of human beings, including generations unborn’. In accordance with the ‘no harm’ principle, no state may utilize its dominion in such a manner that would cause damage to other states. In the preventive dimension of the ‘no harm’ principle, a state must take measures to prevent such hazards. Among other things, a commitment to an appropriate infrastructure, the development of emergency plans and the establishment of an international crisis cooperation structure (and culture) can be construed from this.\nThe precautionary principle (‘due diligence’) is of special importance for cybersecurity. First, the due diligence principle entails information and consultation obligations. In the scientific world, it is controversial as to what extent the precautionary principle has a ‘due diligence’ dimension or whether the precautionary obligations of states are covered in practice by the ‘no harm’ principle. The principle of due diligence was also applied in the field of combating terrorism and the financing of terrorism.\n## 4.4 Shift Towards Due Diligence\nWith some justification, normative principles for the regulation of cybersecurity can therefore be derived from the principle of due diligence. As a result, it is the responsibility of states, inter alia, ensuing from this principle, to prevent cyber-attacks originating from their own territory and to (proactively) establish a legal system that ensures and fosters cybersecurity. This can be fulfilled, for instance, by ‘passing stringent criminal laws, conducting vigorous investigations, prosecuting attackers, and, during the investigation and prosecution, cooperating with the victim-states of cyberattacks that originated from within their borders’.\nIn its preventive dimension, the due diligence principle helps to identify the obligations of states with regard to cybersecurity, particularly with regard to cybercrime, global cooperation and establishment of capacities. Cybersecurity due diligence was described as part of customary international law, whereby particularly the following preventive duties have emerged as recognized obligations under international law:\n- that governments and other stakeholders bolster cybersecurity and develop cybersecurity strategies to protect crucial infrastructures;\nMatthias C. Kettemann and Martin Müller - 9781035308514\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/03/2025 03:25:18PM\nvia University College London (UCL)\n'This is not a drill' 123\n- that states (and other relevant stakeholders) work together more closely in the fight against cybercrime and cyberterrorism, and that they ratify conventions such as the Convention on Cybercrime of the Council of Europe;\n- that states conclude treaties promoting cooperation between their police authorities; and\n- that states establish confidence-building measures and increase the level of information sharing, both generally as well as (and especially) in the event of cybersecurity-related incidents.\nConfidence-building measures are more extensive than obligations under international law ensuing from the duty of cooperation. They are relevant to the evolution of legal norms, however, insofar as they indicate the direction of how obligations under international law are developing.\n# 5. EMBRACING CYBERSECURITY NORMS IN INTERNATIONAL LAW\nAny attempt to embrace cybersecurity in international law must be preceded by the recognition of the significance of the multi-stakeholder approach in the normative development of international Internet law. Since the process of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) began, with just a few exceptions, states have been committing to the integration of all stakeholders in the normative processes relevant to Internet regulation. The multi-stakeholder approach is put into practice in the development and application of instruments and processes\nTechnologies'; 57/239 of 20 December 2002 on the 'Creation of a Global Culture of Cybersecurity' and 58/199 of 23 December 2003 on 'The Creation of a Global Culture of Cybersecurity and the Protection of Critical Information Infrastructures'; 53/70 of 4 December 1998, 54/49 of 1 December 1999, 55/28 of 20 November 2000, 56/19 of 29 November 2001, 57/53 of 22 November 2002, 58/32 of 8 December 2003, 59/61 of 3 December 2004, 60/45 of 8 December 2005, 61/54 of 6 December 2006, 62/17 of 5 December 2007 and 63/37 of 2 December 2008 on 'Developments with respect to Information Technologies in the Context of International Security').\n See UNODC, Resolution 22/8 on 'Promoting Technical Assistance and Capacity Building to Strengthen National Measures and International Cooperation Against Cybercrime', UNODC/ CCPCJ/2013/RES/22/8, para. 4.\n See GGE Report (2013), n. 10 above, para. 22.\n Ibid. para. 22.\n Ibid. para. 26 et seq.\n Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, Decision No. 1202, 'OSCE Confidence-Building Measures to Reduce the Risks of Conflict Stemming from the Use of Information and Communication Technologies', PC.DEC/1202 (10 March 2016).\n See Katharina Ziolkowski, 'Confidence Building Measures for Cyberspace' in Katharina Ziolkowski (ed.), *Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy* (Tallinn: NATO CCD COE Publications, 2013) 533–64.\n See Matthias C.

They can only offer the opportunity for states (or other stakeholders) to accomplish preparatory work relevant to the normative process. Jointly discussing 'norms' can be useful, because common values will be expressed already in the process of discussion[85] and the positions taken by participating states serve as indications of their attitudes toward an international juridification of cybersecurity.\nA promising approach for embracing binding cybersecurity norms in international law in the long term is the negotiation and adoption of an international treaty. It remains the 'gold standard' of international law and is the most important authoritative source of law. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,[86] which entered into force on 4 November 2016, has shown that even today international treaties covering complex topics such as regulations relating to global public goods (for example, cybersecurity as a prerequisite for a well-functioning Internet) can be successfully concluded.\n# 6. SUMMARY\nIn the light of the importance of the Internet for states, business and society, cybersecurity – as a prerequisite for a reliably functioning and secure Internet – has become a global community interest which needs protection. The technologicalization and informationalization of many key infrastructure provision functions and of many industry control systems open up new vulnerabilities within states that can threaten, if an attack is substantial, international peace and security. Similarly, the increased use of mobile devices, Cloud computing and the use of social networks increases the vulnerability of citizens to acts of cybercrime.\nCybersecurity is a key functional condition for an era defined by information and communications technology. A secure Internet lies in the interest of each individual state and also collectively in the interest of all states of the world as a global community. Cybersecurity thus lies in the global common interest. It has a key security interest for which all the states of the world bear separate and common responsibility. This responsibility must be met through an application of the principles and processes of international law.\nInternational law is to be fully applied to the Internet, including with regard to regulating cybersecurity. Customary international law and the general principles of international law particularly restrict (and define) national Internet policy. Consequently, each state has protection obligations vis-à-vis the international community – to avert threats to the stability, integrity and functionality of the Internet – which can be derived from customary international law. At the same time, states may not restrict freedom on the Internet without limitation under the\nMatthias C.

The global, cross-border Internet traffic may not be adversely affected or in any way destabilized by states due to national legislation and policy.\nIn addition to post-incident information and communication requirements, preventive obligations also arise from the due diligence principle and the tenets of good neighbourliness and can in part only be met in cooperation with nongovernmental stakeholders. This binding cooperation principle of customary international law provides mandatory guidance to states in their development of strategies for promoting cybersecurity. But what complicates the situation is that in responding to cybersecurity threats, states are often fully dependent on private entities and their security experts.\nThe May 2017 WannaCry Ransomware attack, for example, shows how vulnerabilities are caused by a number of factors, including companies who fail to provide updates or no longer service vulnerabilities, affected companies that have slow patch cycles, secret services that stockpile vulnerabilities, and states that do not force essential service providers (like healthcare companies) to ensure that their systems are stable and secure.\nAs the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence concluded with regard to the WannaCry Ransomware attacks:\nCampaigns like WannaCry should remind decision-makers of the importance of baseline cyber security, since in this case the victims could have prevented the spread of ransomware by fairly simple security measures.^[87]^\nBe it baseline cybersecurity or more advanced forms that are necessary for states to implement in order to meet their obligations under international law: the debate on how best to ensure a stable and resilient Internet for all is far from over – and it is international law that provides the impetus, frame and objective of the debate.\nThe normative frame of cybersecurity and the real-world application of it are not yet stable enough to ensure convincingly that honest mistakes, serious crimes and international cyber-attacks are effectively stopped. This should worry us. As Dutch Ruppersberger, a long-time Democratic US Congressman from Maryland, was quoted in 2013 by Rolling Stone magazine as saying: ‘People ask me all the time, “What keeps you up at night?” And I say, “Spicy Mexican food, weapons of mass destruction, and cyber attacks”’.^[88]^ Changing one’s diet might help with the first issue, arms reduction and arms control regimes with the second, and an international law-based global cybersecurity regime with the third: less chili then, and a more nuanced normative order of cybersecurity with clear commitments for each stakeholder.\nMatthias C.

    "# 2. TOWARDS A COMPREHENSIVE CONCEPT OF CYBERSECURITY": "Cybersecurity is defined very broadly by some states and covers risks and threats such as cyberwarfare, cyberterrorism, cybercrime and cyber-espionage.¹⁸ There is no doubt that cybersecurity is a crucial part of national, domestic, security, foreign and defence policy.¹⁹ As a central theme of Internet policy,²⁰ cybersecurity is closely linked with the stability, robustness, resilience and functionality of the Internet.²¹ Cybersecurity can be threatened by cybercrime and cyberterrorism, but also by a lack of legal and technical cooperation between states and a lack of preventive measures, such as developing crisis intervention centres and teams, as well as transnational crisis communication structures for cyber incidents.\nThe major 2017 WannaCry²² and NotPetya²³ ransomware attacks, for example, were the first world-wide felt examples of how vulnerabilities are caused by a number of factors, including software companies who fail to provide updates or no longer service vulnerabilities, affected companies that have slow patch cycles, secret services that stockpile vulnerabilities, and states that do not force essential service providers (like healthcare companies) to ensure that their systems are stable and secure.²⁴ These issues remain, even if so-called ‘Zero-day vulnerabilities’ occur and are exploited more often.²⁵\nFostering and ensuring cybersecurity are a prerequisite for the stability of national economic processes and the international business and financial system, for transnational communication flows and for the functioning of energy grids, the enforcement of human rights, and the performance of national, regional and international defence infrastructures. Ultimately, cybersecurity is fundamental to the full realization of all human rights.\nIt is too often the case that (cyber)security is contrasted with (Internet) freedom and the two concepts are played against each other to the detriment of both. This view misses the point.\n¹⁸ See Myriam Dunn Cavelty and Camino Kavanagh, Chapter 5. They differentiate between two notions of cybersecurity: a technical information security approach and a national security-focused approach. Our use of the concept encompasses elements from both conceptions.\n¹⁹ More states have Cybersecurity Strategies now.

The Cybersecurity Strategy for Germany defines cybersecurity as ‘IT security of the networked or network-capable information technology systems in cyberspace’. IT security is understood to be ensuring the ‘IT security is [...] the state in which the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and availability of information and IT are protected by appropriate measures.’²⁷ This definition is very technology-oriented and too short-sighted in light of how cybersecurity is practically perceived by business and society. The security on the Internet and of the Internet cannot simply be equated with the security of systems and data. To view cybersecurity correctly, it must be regarded holistically. Each meaningful cybersecurity concept should be comprehensive and value-based: a commitment to a stable, secure, resilient, fully functional, open and free Internet and its protection against state and private attacks of any kind.²⁸",
    "## 3. PROTECTING CYBERSECURITY LIES IN THE COMMON INTEREST OF ALL STATES": "## 3.1 Cybersecurity and the Common Interest\nIn 1998, experts working on behalf of the UNESCO posed the question whether the ‘United Nations General Assembly [could] affirm the principle of regarding cyberspace as “the common heritage of humanity”’²⁹ and thus safeguard it. They failed to answer the question, which was well enough because it was the wrong one. It is not ‘cyberspace’ we should concern ourselves with, but rather the Internet itself; and rather than using the concept of common heritage of mankind, which presupposes a certain historical stability the Internet does not have, we rather need to establish why protecting the Internet lies in the global common interest.\nDuring the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), which the United Nations convened in 2003 and 2005 to establish a normative trajectory for the Internet, states affirmed their common desire and commitment to build an information society that is ‘people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented’ and in which individuals, communities and peoples can:\nMatthias C. Kettemann and Martin Müller - 9781035308514\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/03/2025 03:25:18PM\nvia University College London (UCL)\n'This is not a drill'\nachieve their full potential in promoting their sustainable development and improving their quality of life premised on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and respecting fully and upholding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.³⁰\nWe have here a first clear answer to the question about what ‘vision’ the international community pursues regarding the impact of the Internet.\nClearly, achieving world peace and international security (as enshrined in the UN Charter), ensuring human development (as codified in the Millennium Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals) and respecting, protecting and implementing human rights (as normatively ordered in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)) are in the global common interest. Different normative orders within international law contribute towards achieving these common interests. By establishing finalities for a normative order, such as WSIS has done for Internet governance, the normative development of that order is anchored in the finality of ensuring the common interest, lying in peace, security and development. Creating a people-centred, development-oriented information society is thus part of the broader normative commitment in international law to protecting the common interest of ensuring world peace, international security and development.\nWe have thus established that there is a global common interest in ensuring a people-centred and development-oriented information society. But is protecting cybersecurity and thus the Internet’s integrity essential for reaching these goals? UN Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression, Frank La Rue, in a groundbreaking report on the impact of the Internet on freedom of expression, described the Internet as a ‘catalyst for individuals to exercise their right to freedom of opinion and expression’. Freedom of expression on the Internet itself is a ‘facilitator of the realisation of a range of other human rights’.³¹ The multiple challenges that the Internet brings for human rights notwithstanding,³² the absence of the Internet (or of an Internet without cybersecurity) would seriously challenge the realization of human rights. There are important corollary rights that are premised upon exercising free speech on the Internet. These include the freedom of assembly and association online, the right to (digital) education and the right of access to digital knowledge.³³ From all these rights we can also derive a right to access to online information and communication, which is crucial for human development. Similar arguments have been voiced by courts and international organizations.³⁴\n³⁰ WSIS, Geneva Declaration of Principles, WSIS-03/GENEVA/DOC/4-E (12 December 2003) para. 1.\n³¹ F.

Kettemann and Martin Müller - 9781035308514 Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/03/2025 03:25:18PM via University College London (UCL)\nResearch handbook on human rights and digital technology\nThe Internet introduces new threat vectors to human rights, but greatly enhances the potential of people to realize their human rights. It is similarly a facilitator for human security.\nIn the same vein, the 2013 report of the UN GGE determined that the application of norms derived from existing international law is ‘essential’ to minimize risks to world peace and international security and stability.³⁵ Viewed in the context of information technology challenges, cybersecurity is now one aspect of ‘world peace’.³⁶ When analysing the protection of cybersecurity under international law, the GGE report from 2015,³⁷ and reiterated in 2021,³⁸ which was adopted in consensus by a representative group of governmental experts, is very helpful,³⁹ stating, inter alia, that the international community aspires to regulate the Internet in a peaceful manner ‘for the common good of mankind’.\n## 3.2 Ensuing International Legal Duties\nProtecting cybersecurity is a common interest of all states. This community interest is not an aggregate of the individual sets of interests; rather, it lies at their intersection. If a protected interest is part of the community interest, this entails consequences relevant to international law. States are therefore responsible to the international community with regard to cybersecurity according to their judicial authority over critical infrastructures pertinent to it.⁴⁰\nTo the extent that a state controls Critical Internet Resources (CIRs), it has to exercise this jurisdiction mindful of threats to cybersecurity and especially the security of these CIRs in a manner that ensures the common interest. To the extent that national politics (and policies) can impact the Internet negatively, a state has to refrain from their formulation and implementation. A state’s sovereignty is reduced because of the limits the protection of the Internet as a common interest lays upon him. The United States, as former delegated manager of the CIRs, therefore only had ‘custodial sovereignty’.⁴¹ This implied that the United States had to enter into consultations with other states with regard to the management of CIRs and make sure that the management was transparent and accountable, ideally to the international community\n³⁵ Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, A/68/98 (24 June 2013) para. 16.\n³⁶ Ibid.\n³⁷ GGE Report (2015), n. 11 above.\n³⁸ Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, A/76/135 (14 July 2021) ('GGE Report (2021)') para. 5, 71(e).\n³⁹ Members: Belarus, Brazil, China, Colombia, Egypt, Estonia, France, Germany, Ghana, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Russian Federation, Spain, United Kingdom and United States.\n⁴⁰ For documentation of the reports of individual member states, see the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, www.un.org/disarmament/topics/informationsecurity.\n⁴¹ See W.

Kettemann and Martin Müller - 9781035308514 Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/03/2025 03:25:18PM via University College London (UCL)\n'This is not a drill'\nand now, after the transition,⁴² to the global multi-stakeholder community.⁴³ All other states, insofar as they can endanger the Internet’s stability, security and functionality, are pre-empted from doing so. In assessing whether politics may impact the Internet negatively, it makes sense to suggest the precautionary principle as a guide to decision-making.⁴⁴\nA second consequence is that humankind – that is all actors making up the international community, and not only states – have a legitimate interest in making sure that all other actors protect the Internet (or at least do not actively harm it). Though sovereignty-oriented states⁴⁵ have suggested exclusive sovereignty over national Internet segments, the character of the Internet, as protected by international law as a common interest, limits their sovereignty. The 2005 Tunis Agenda, though valuable in its description of the normative goals of the information society, still lays down that ‘policy authority for internet-related public policy issues’ is a ‘sovereign right of States’.⁴⁶ This needs to be qualified in light of a common interest approach to protecting the Internet in that the states’ policy authority is no longer an exclusively sovereign right, but part and parcel of their sovereignty, to be exercised in the common interest. What sovereignty they have over Internet-related resources has to be understood in light of changing circumstances and the importance of the pursuance of common interests. As far as international law extends to non-state actors, these are also under obligation to support the pursuance, by state actors, of the global interest in safeguarding the Internet’s integrity. This means, for example, that there is an international law-based duty, via the Ruggie Principles,⁴⁷ for companies to respect human rights and rights of victims of business-related abuses and their right to access to remedies.\n⁴² NTIA, NTIA Finds IANA Stewardship Transition Proposal Meets Criteria to Complete Privatization (9 June 2016), available at www.ntia.doc.gov/press-release/2016/iana-stewardship-transition-proposal-meets-criteria-complete-privatization.\n⁴³ ICANN IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG), Proposal to Transition the Stewardship of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Functions from the US Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to the Global Multistakeholder Community (March 2016), available at www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/iana-stewardship-transition-proposal-10mar16-en.pdf; and ICANN CCWG Accountability, Supplemental Final Proposal on Work Stream 1 Recommendations (February 2016), available at www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/ccwg-accountability-supp-proposal-work-stream-1-recs-23 feb16-en.pdf.\n⁴⁴ See the work of the Council of Europe’s Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (MC-S-CI), www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/media/MC-S-CI/default_en.asp, especially its report International and Multi-stakeholder Co-operation on Cross-border Internet (2010).\n⁴⁵ See International Code of Conduct for Information Security, Annex to the letter dated 12 September 2011 from the Permanent Representatives of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, A/66/359 (14 September 2011).\n⁴⁶ WSIS, Tunis Agenda (2005) para. 35.\n⁴⁷ See Report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, J.

    "## 4. CYBERSECURITY AND INTERNATIONAL LAW": "## 4.1 International Law and the Internet\nInternational law is the only area of law with which global (public) goods can be managed and global public interest protected.49 The ubiquity of the technology underlying the Internet, which is not restricted by national borders, renders strictly single-state regulation largely ineffective. International law is needed to legitimately and effectively ensure cybersecurity in the common interest of all states. This is not a new insight.50 Without legitimate and effective protection of cybersecurity under international law, individuals and societies cannot develop to their full potential. A similar self-commitment to an international law-based Internet policy was presented by the European Commission in 2014.51\n48 The question regarding its role: see B.

Although treaties provide (legal) certainty (especially in the eyes of powerful states or states relying on traditional sovereignty concepts),⁵⁴ bilateral cybersecurity treaties usually do not live up to the complexity of the issue due to the universality of the Internet, while multilateral treaties can only be attained through lengthy negotiation processes with an uncertain outcome.⁵⁵ There is still no treaty on cybersecurity, though.⁵⁶ Binding international law on cybersecurity can therefore only be derived to date from customary international law and the principles of international law.\n## 4.3 Cybersecurity and Customary International Law\nIn the Tunis Agenda, adopted at the UN World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), and in the Tunis Commitment (2005) (building on the Geneva documents of 2003), the signatory states of the world committed themselves to a:\npeople-centered, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society, premised on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, international law and multilateralism, and respecting fully and upholding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights⁵⁷\n⁵² The scope of this study does not allow for going into detail on all applicable principles of international law.

Communicators, recipients and the contents of communications are protected by Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), parts of which are based on customary law. Along with these state obligations based on individual human rights (prohibiting states from interfering with certain communicative rights), positive obligations related to Internet infrastructure can also be derived from the state obligations to provide protection and assurance pertaining to information- and communication-related rights. States are therefore obliged to ensure the sustainability and security of the networks in order to allow individuals to realize their human rights.\nParticularly relevant to ensuring and promoting cybersecurity are the following principles of international law,⁶⁰ some of which have been translated into treaty law in the UN Charter, are protected under customary international law or are recognized as part of the general principles of international law: sovereign equality, the ban on aggression and intervention, peaceful settlement of disputes, the protection of human rights, the cooperation principle (which draws on the principle of good neighbourliness (‘no harm’) and the precautionary principle (‘due diligence’)).\nThe principle of sovereign equality (UN Charter, Article 2(1)) is a key principle of international law. As a ‘pivotal principle’⁶¹ it is also of special importance for cybersecurity. Each state has jurisdiction and power over its territory and over the ICT infrastructure located there; this also means, however, that it bears a responsibility to ensure that no attacks against other states or institutions, which would infringe on international law, are organized or carried out from its territory.\nIn addition, the non-intervention principle (UN Charter, Article 2(7)) can be brought to fruition: an intense damage to Internet functionality in another state (e.g. by cyber-attacks) could constitute an intervention, although attribution problems will regularly arise.⁶² Only some of the attacks originating from the territory of a state represent an ‘intervention’ in terms of international law, because most attacks will be attributable to non-governmental protagonists or to protagonists whose association with governmental agencies cannot be proven.⁶³\n⁵⁸ Ibid. no. 3.\n⁵⁹ WSIS, Tunis Agenda for the Information Society, WSIS-05/TUNIS/DOC/6 (Rev. 1)-G (18 November 2005) no. 31.\n⁶⁰ GGE Report (2015), n. 11 above, para. 26.\n⁶¹ Samantha Besson, ‘Sovereignty’ in Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), MPEPIL (2011) para. 1.\n⁶² Sven-Hendrik Schulze, Cyber-‘War’, Testfall der Staatenverantwortlichkeit (Tübingen: Mohr, 2015).\n⁶³ See GGE Report (2015), n. 11 above: ‘the indication that an ICT activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or the ICT infrastructure of a State may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that State. The Group noted that the accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated’ (ibid. para. 28(f)).\nMatthias C. Kettemann and Martin Müller - 9781035308514\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/03/2025 03:25:18PM\nvia University College London (UCL)\n'This is not a drill'\nThe ban on aggression (UN Charter, Article 2(4)) prohibits states from using measures of power beyond simple ‘intervention’ (the former being stated in the non-intervention principle). In the context of the Internet, this Article could only be applied to especially serious cases of cyber-attacks with substantial kinetic effects.\nThe principle of peaceful settlement of disputes is relevant to cybersecurity insofar as any state has the duty, in the event of an incident, to first determine the facts and to collect evidence for attribution of a breach of international law to a particular state. Even if this succeeds, peaceful means of dispute settlement should first be sought.\nThe principle of the protection of human rights is a fundamental principle of international law that is also relevant to cybersecurity. What is problematic under international law are attempts by a state to enforce cybersecurity through an excessive control of the Internet (such as setting up and using surveillance capabilities or government screening of all Internet communication).\nThe principle of good neighbourliness (UN Charter, Article 74), or ‘no harm’ principle, can be considered as a global principle in the Internet era. Originally only relevant in terms of the relationship with adjacent states, the principle has been gradually extended.^^ In the Corfu Channel case, the International Court of Justice described the principle as ‘every state’s obligation not to knowingly allow its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states’.^^ The ‘no harm’ principle has its roots in the Trail Smelter^^ and Lake Lanoux^^ cases. It was formulated in Principle 21 of the Stockholm Declaration (1972)^^ and Principle 2 of the Rio Declaration (1992):^^ signatory states are committed ‘to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction’. This can easily be applied to other areas in analogy to the environment.\nThe obligation to prevent cross-border damage has crystallized into customary law. Contractual confirmation can be found in Article 194(2) of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea^^ and Article 20(1) of the ASEAN Agreement on the Conservation of Nature and\nMatthias C.

Most recently, the ICJ confirmed in the Nuclear Weapons case⁷¹ that the threat to the environment is ‘no abstraction but represents the living space, the quality of life and the very health of human beings, including generations unborn’. In accordance with the ‘no harm’ principle, no state may utilize its dominion in such a manner that would cause damage to other states. In the preventive dimension of the ‘no harm’ principle, a state must take measures to prevent such hazards. Among other things, a commitment to an appropriate infrastructure, the development of emergency plans and the establishment of an international crisis cooperation structure (and culture) can be construed from this.\nThe precautionary principle (‘due diligence’) is of special importance for cybersecurity. First, the due diligence principle entails information and consultation obligations.⁷² In the scientific world, it is controversial as to what extent the precautionary principle has a ‘due diligence’ dimension or whether the precautionary obligations of states are covered in practice by the ‘no harm’ principle. The principle of due diligence was also applied in the field of combating terrorism and the financing of terrorism.⁷³\n## 4.4 Shift Towards Due Diligence\nWith some justification, normative principles for the regulation of cybersecurity can therefore be derived from the principle of due diligence. As a result, it is the responsibility of states, inter alia, ensuing from this principle, to prevent cyber-attacks originating from their own territory and to (proactively) establish a legal system that ensures and fosters cybersecurity.⁷⁴ This can be fulfilled, for instance, by ‘passing stringent criminal laws, conducting vigorous investigations, prosecuting attackers, and, during the investigation and prosecution, cooperating with the victim-states of cyberattacks that originated from within their borders’.⁷⁵\nIn its preventive dimension, the due diligence principle helps to identify the obligations of states with regard to cybersecurity, particularly with regard to cybercrime, global cooperation and establishment of capacities. Cybersecurity due diligence was described as part of customary international law, whereby particularly the following preventive duties have emerged as recognized obligations under international law:\n- that governments and other stakeholders bolster cybersecurity and develop cybersecurity strategies to protect crucial infrastructures;⁷⁶\nMatthias C.

    "# 5. EMBRACING CYBERSECURITY NORMS IN INTERNATIONAL LAW": "Any attempt to embrace cybersecurity in international law must be preceded by the recognition of the significance of the multi-stakeholder approach in the normative development of international Internet law.⁸³ Since the process of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) began, with just a few exceptions, states have been committing to the integration of all stakeholders in the normative processes relevant to Internet regulation. The multi-stakeholder approach is put into practice in the development and application of instruments and processes\nTechnologies'; 57/239 of 20 December 2002 on the 'Creation of a Global Culture of Cybersecurity' and 58/199 of 23 December 2003 on 'The Creation of a Global Culture of Cybersecurity and the Protection of Critical Information Infrastructures'; 53/70 of 4 December 1998, 54/49 of 1 December 1999, 55/28 of 20 November 2000, 56/19 of 29 November 2001, 57/53 of 22 November 2002, 58/32 of 8 December 2003, 59/61 of 3 December 2004, 60/45 of 8 December 2005, 61/54 of 6 December 2006, 62/17 of 5 December 2007 and 63/37 of 2 December 2008 on 'Developments with respect to Information Technologies in the Context of International Security').\n⁷⁷ See UNODC, Resolution 22/8 on 'Promoting Technical Assistance and Capacity Building to Strengthen National Measures and International Cooperation Against Cybercrime', UNODC/ CCPCJ/2013/RES/22/8, para. 4.\n⁷⁸ See GGE Report (2013), n. 10 above, para. 22.\n⁷⁹ Ibid. para. 22.\n⁸⁰ Ibid. para. 26 et seq.\n⁸¹ Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, Decision No. 1202, 'OSCE Confidence-Building Measures to Reduce the Risks of Conflict Stemming from the Use of Information and Communication Technologies', PC.DEC/1202 (10 March 2016).\n⁸² See Katharina Ziolkowski, 'Confidence Building Measures for Cyberspace' in Katharina Ziolkowski (ed.), *Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy* (Tallinn: NATO CCD COE Publications, 2013) 533–64.\n⁸³ See Matthias C.

They can only offer the opportunity for states (or other stakeholders) to accomplish preparatory work relevant to the normative process. Jointly discussing 'norms' can be useful, because common values will be expressed already in the process of discussion and the positions taken by participating states serve as indications of their attitudes toward an international juridification of cybersecurity.\nA promising approach for embracing binding cybersecurity norms in international law in the long term is the negotiation and adoption of an international treaty. It remains the 'gold standard' of international law and is the most important authoritative source of law. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which entered into force on 4 November 2016, has shown that even today international treaties covering complex topics such as regulations relating to global public goods (for example, cybersecurity as a prerequisite for a well-functioning Internet) can be successfully concluded.",
    "# 6. SUMMARY": "In the light of the importance of the Internet for states, business and society, cybersecurity – as a prerequisite for a reliably functioning and secure Internet – has become a global community interest which needs protection. The technologicalization and informationalization of many key infrastructure provision functions and of many industry control systems open up new vulnerabilities within states that can threaten, if an attack is substantial, international peace and security. Similarly, the increased use of mobile devices, Cloud computing and the use of social networks increases the vulnerability of citizens to acts of cybercrime.\nCybersecurity is a key functional condition for an era defined by information and communications technology. A secure Internet lies in the interest of each individual state and also collectively in the interest of all states of the world as a global community. Cybersecurity thus lies in the global common interest. It has a key security interest for which all the states of the world bear separate and common responsibility. This responsibility must be met through an application of the principles and processes of international law.\nInternational law is to be fully applied to the Internet, including with regard to regulating cybersecurity. Customary international law and the general principles of international law particularly restrict (and define) national Internet policy. Consequently, each state has protection obligations vis-à-vis the international community – to avert threats to the stability, integrity and functionality of the Internet – which can be derived from customary international law. At the same time, states may not restrict freedom on the Internet without limitation under the\nMatthias C.

The global, cross-border Internet traffic may not be adversely affected or in any way destabilized by states due to national legislation and policy.\nIn addition to post-incident information and communication requirements, preventive obligations also arise from the due diligence principle and the tenets of good neighbourliness and can in part only be met in cooperation with nongovernmental stakeholders. This binding cooperation principle of customary international law provides mandatory guidance to states in their development of strategies for promoting cybersecurity. But what complicates the situation is that in responding to cybersecurity threats, states are often fully dependent on private entities and their security experts.\nThe May 2017 WannaCry Ransomware attack, for example, shows how vulnerabilities are caused by a number of factors, including companies who fail to provide updates or no longer service vulnerabilities, affected companies that have slow patch cycles, secret services that stockpile vulnerabilities, and states that do not force essential service providers (like healthcare companies) to ensure that their systems are stable and secure.\nAs the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence concluded with regard to the WannaCry Ransomware attacks:\nCampaigns like WannaCry should remind decision-makers of the importance of baseline cyber security, since in this case the victims could have prevented the spread of ransomware by fairly simple security measures.^^\nBe it baseline cybersecurity or more advanced forms that are necessary for states to implement in order to meet their obligations under international law: the debate on how best to ensure a stable and resilient Internet for all is far from over – and it is international law that provides the impetus, frame and objective of the debate.\nThe normative frame of cybersecurity and the real-world application of it are not yet stable enough to ensure convincingly that honest mistakes, serious crimes and international cyber-attacks are effectively stopped. This should worry us. As Dutch Ruppersberger, a long-time Democratic US Congressman from Maryland, was quoted in 2013 by Rolling Stone magazine as saying: ‘People ask me all the time, “What keeps you up at night?” And I say, “Spicy Mexican food, weapons of mass destruction, and cyber attacks”’.^^ Changing one’s diet might help with the first issue, arms reduction and arms control regimes with the second, and an international law-based global cybersecurity regime with the third: less chili then, and a more nuanced normative order of cybersecurity with clear commitments for each stakeholder.\nMatthias C.

Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill.’ This emergency alert was sent out to thousands of Hawaiians on 13 January 2018, at 8:08 a.m. local time. Luckily, it turned out to be not a drill, but rather the result of human error. An employee, it appeared, had pushed the wrong button (twice). The reactions on social media and in real life – the media was full of stories of scared Hawaiians hiding in garages – tells us a lot about our times both in terms of international security (ballistic missiles threats were a Cold War staple) and in terms of cybersecurity: Human errors can cause real damages – and humans are an integral part of cybersecurity.\nThis was the example on how cybersecurity issues are interlinked to general security issues from the first edition. Fast forward 5 years later, a similar example has occurred: During the attack by Hamas terrorists against Israel in October 2023, a hacktivist group named ‘AnonGhost’ managed to exploit flaws in the app ‘Red Alert’, which is used among others in Israel as a missile alert service. Similar to the false alarm sent out to Hawaiians, the hackers warned users of an upcoming nuclear attack. Dissimilar, however, this time there was no human error, but an attempt by malicious actors to influence an ongoing conflict.\nBe it online or offline, be it in the kinetic world or in cyberspace, we need norms – and have always needed them. ‘In the long march of mankind from the cave to the computer’, as Malcolm N. Shaw puts it in his introduction to international law, ‘a central role has always\n Prof. Dr. Matthias C. Kettemann, LL.M.

Political and legal approaches to preventing cyberwar and cybercrime such as the negotiations on a UN Cybercrime Convention have attracted considerable attention internationally. This study shows that the Internet is critical infrastructure in itself and also functionally essential for other critical infrastructure. The UN General Assembly, in Resolution 64/211 of 21 December 2009, promoted the creation of a global culture of cybersecurity and expressed concerns in light of growing threats to the reliable functioning of the Internet (technically: ‘of critical information infrastructures and to the integrity of the information carried over those’). These affect ‘domestic, national and international welfare’. The Resolution affirms that states are obliged to deal systematically with these threats and coordinate both with national stakeholders and internationally with the goal of facilitating the achievement of cybersecurity.\nThe 2013 Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) report underlined that applying norms derived from ‘existing international law relevant to the use of ICTs by States is an essential measure to reduce risks to international peace, security and stability’. The Charter of the United Nations is applicable to the whole gamut of socio-economic activity on the Internet and thus ‘essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment’. Applying international law to the Internet lies in the common interest and safeguarding the Internet as such also lies in the common interest because a stable, secure and functional Internet is essential for international security. Building on this consensus, the 2015 report of the GGE again confirmed that international law, the UN Charter and\n Malcolm N.

Common criminals continue to misuse the Internet both for online variants of common scams and for Internet-specific (technology-based) attacks. The size of monetary loss is difficult to evaluate but an often-quoted estimate (e.g. by the European Commission) by Cybersecurity Ventures expects losses of around US$ 8 trillion for the year 2023 worldwide. This threat requires international cooperation. At the same time, some criminal misuses of the Internet are not direct threats to the Internet’s integrity, as criminal networks rely on the Internet to conduct their activities. But other attacks, including disruptive attacks or others not linked to monetary gain (such as attacks to cause social unrest in the introductory Israel example) can amount to substantial threats to cybersecurity and the Internet’s functionality.\nDifferent levels of Internet security awareness and capabilities globally matter to all states because of the interconnectedness of ICTs and the networked nature of the Internet. ‘These vulnerabilities are amplified’, the UN’s Group of Governmental Experts on IT and Security complained in 2013, ‘by disparities in national law, regulations and practices related to the use of ICTs’. Only international cooperation in the protection of the Internet can help meet these challenges. The role of the Internet’s integrity in contributing to international security and the threats posed by international cybercrime are further reasons why ensuring cybersecurity and protecting the integrity of the Internet lies in the common interest.\nThis chapter examines the protection of cybersecurity under international law and develops a future-oriented approach to increasing cybersecurity through international law. After outlining my concept of cybersecurity (2) and explaining why protecting cybersecurity lies in the common interest of all states (3), I will outline which international legal norms protect cybersecurity (4). After that, I will identify approaches to better protect cybersecurity in international law (5).

TOWARDS A COMPREHENSIVE CONCEPT OF CYBERSECURITY\nCybersecurity is defined very broadly by some states and covers risks and threats such as cyberwarfare, cyberterrorism, cybercrime and cyber-espionage. There is no doubt that cybersecurity is a crucial part of national, domestic, security, foreign and defence policy. As a central theme of Internet policy, cybersecurity is closely linked with the stability, robustness, resilience and functionality of the Internet. Cybersecurity can be threatened by cybercrime and cyberterrorism, but also by a lack of legal and technical cooperation between states and a lack of preventive measures, such as developing crisis intervention centres and teams, as well as transnational crisis communication structures for cyber incidents.\nThe major 2017 WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks, for example, were the first world-wide felt examples of how vulnerabilities are caused by a number of factors, including software companies who fail to provide updates or no longer service vulnerabilities, affected companies that have slow patch cycles, secret services that stockpile vulnerabilities, and states that do not force essential service providers (like healthcare companies) to ensure that their systems are stable and secure. These issues remain, even if so-called ‘Zero-day vulnerabilities’ occur and are exploited more often.\nFostering and ensuring cybersecurity are a prerequisite for the stability of national economic processes and the international business and financial system, for transnational communication flows and for the functioning of energy grids, the enforcement of human rights, and the performance of national, regional and international defence infrastructures. Ultimately, cybersecurity is fundamental to the full realization of all human rights.\nIt is too often the case that (cyber)security is contrasted with (Internet) freedom and the two concepts are played against each other to the detriment of both. This view misses the point.\n See Myriam Dunn Cavelty and Camino Kavanagh, Chapter 5. They differentiate between two notions of cybersecurity: a technical information security approach and a national security-focused approach. Our use of the concept encompasses elements from both conceptions.\n More states have Cybersecurity Strategies now. For an overview, see NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence, ‘Cyber Security Publication Library’, https://ccdcoe.org/publication-library.\n Adam Segal, *The Hacked World Order: How Nations Fight, Trade, Maneuver, and Manipulate in the Digital Age* (New York: Public Affairs, 2016).\n Eneken Tikk-Ringas (ed.), *Evolution of the Cyber Domain: The Implications for National and Global Security* (London: Routledge, 2015).\n For a close examination, cf.

The Cybersecurity Strategy for Germany defines cybersecurity as ‘IT security of the networked or network-capable information technology systems in cyberspace’. IT security is understood to be ensuring the ‘IT security is [...] the state in which the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and availability of information and IT are protected by appropriate measures.’ This definition is very technology-oriented and too short-sighted in light of how cybersecurity is practically perceived by business and society. The security on the Internet and of the Internet cannot simply be equated with the security of systems and data. To view cybersecurity correctly, it must be regarded holistically. Each meaningful cybersecurity concept should be comprehensive and value-based: a commitment to a stable, secure, resilient, fully functional, open and free Internet and its protection against state and private attacks of any kind.\n## 3. PROTECTING CYBERSECURITY LIES IN THE COMMON INTEREST OF ALL STATES\n## 3.1 Cybersecurity and the Common Interest\nIn 1998, experts working on behalf of the UNESCO posed the question whether the ‘United Nations General Assembly [could] affirm the principle of regarding cyberspace as “the common heritage of humanity”’ and thus safeguard it. They failed to answer the question, which was well enough because it was the wrong one. It is not ‘cyberspace’ we should concern ourselves with, but rather the Internet itself; and rather than using the concept of common heritage of mankind, which presupposes a certain historical stability the Internet does not have, we rather need to establish why protecting the Internet lies in the global common interest.\nDuring the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), which the United Nations convened in 2003 and 2005 to establish a normative trajectory for the Internet, states affirmed their common desire and commitment to build an information society that is ‘people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented’ and in which individuals, communities and peoples can:\nMatthias C. Kettemann and Martin Müller - 9781035308514\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/03/2025 03:25:18PM\nvia University College London (UCL)\n'This is not a drill'\nachieve their full potential in promoting their sustainable development and improving their quality of life premised on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and respecting fully and upholding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nWe have here a first clear answer to the question about what ‘vision’ the international community pursues regarding the impact of the Internet.\nClearly, achieving world peace and international security (as enshrined in the UN Charter), ensuring human development (as codified in the Millennium Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals) and respecting, protecting and implementing human rights (as normatively ordered in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)) are in the global common interest. Different normative orders within international law contribute towards achieving these common interests. By establishing finalities for a normative order, such as WSIS has done for Internet governance, the normative development of that order is anchored in the finality of ensuring the common interest, lying in peace, security and development. Creating a people-centred, development-oriented information society is thus part of the broader normative commitment in international law to protecting the common interest of ensuring world peace, international security and development.\nWe have thus established that there is a global common interest in ensuring a people-centred and development-oriented information society. But is protecting cybersecurity and thus the Internet’s integrity essential for reaching these goals? UN Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression, Frank La Rue, in a groundbreaking report on the impact of the Internet on freedom of expression, described the Internet as a ‘catalyst for individuals to exercise their right to freedom of opinion and expression’. Freedom of expression on the Internet itself is a ‘facilitator of the realisation of a range of other human rights’. The multiple challenges that the Internet brings for human rights notwithstanding, the absence of the Internet (or of an Internet without cybersecurity) would seriously challenge the realization of human rights. There are important corollary rights that are premised upon exercising free speech on the Internet. These include the freedom of assembly and association online, the right to (digital) education and the right of access to digital knowledge. From all these rights we can also derive a right to access to online information and communication, which is crucial for human development.

It is similarly a facilitator for human security.\nIn the same vein, the 2013 report of the UN GGE determined that the application of norms derived from existing international law is ‘essential’ to minimize risks to world peace and international security and stability. Viewed in the context of information technology challenges, cybersecurity is now one aspect of ‘world peace’. When analysing the protection of cybersecurity under international law, the GGE report from 2015, and reiterated in 2021, which was adopted in consensus by a representative group of governmental experts, is very helpful, stating, inter alia, that the international community aspires to regulate the Internet in a peaceful manner ‘for the common good of mankind’.\n## 3.2 Ensuing International Legal Duties\nProtecting cybersecurity is a common interest of all states. This community interest is not an aggregate of the individual sets of interests; rather, it lies at their intersection. If a protected interest is part of the community interest, this entails consequences relevant to international law. States are therefore responsible to the international community with regard to cybersecurity according to their judicial authority over critical infrastructures pertinent to it.\nTo the extent that a state controls Critical Internet Resources (CIRs), it has to exercise this jurisdiction mindful of threats to cybersecurity and especially the security of these CIRs in a manner that ensures the common interest. To the extent that national politics (and policies) can impact the Internet negatively, a state has to refrain from their formulation and implementation. A state’s sovereignty is reduced because of the limits the protection of the Internet as a common interest lays upon him. The United States, as former delegated manager of the CIRs, therefore only had ‘custodial sovereignty’. This implied that the United States had to enter into consultations with other states with regard to the management of CIRs and make sure that the management was transparent and accountable, ideally to the international community\n Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, A/68/98 (24 June 2013) para. 16.\n Ibid.\n GGE Report (2015), n. 11 above.\n Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, A/76/135 (14 July 2021) ('GGE Report (2021)') para. 5, 71(e).\n Members: Belarus, Brazil, China, Colombia, Egypt, Estonia, France, Germany, Ghana, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Russian Federation, Spain, United Kingdom and United States.\n For documentation of the reports of individual member states, see the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, www.un.org/disarmament/topics/informationsecurity.\n See W.

All other states, insofar as they can endanger the Internet’s stability, security and functionality, are pre-empted from doing so. In assessing whether politics may impact the Internet negatively, it makes sense to suggest the precautionary principle as a guide to decision-making.\nA second consequence is that humankind – that is all actors making up the international community, and not only states – have a legitimate interest in making sure that all other actors protect the Internet (or at least do not actively harm it). Though sovereignty-oriented states have suggested exclusive sovereignty over national Internet segments, the character of the Internet, as protected by international law as a common interest, limits their sovereignty. The 2005 Tunis Agenda, though valuable in its description of the normative goals of the information society, still lays down that ‘policy authority for internet-related public policy issues’ is a ‘sovereign right of States’. This needs to be qualified in light of a common interest approach to protecting the Internet in that the states’ policy authority is no longer an exclusively sovereign right, but part and parcel of their sovereignty, to be exercised in the common interest. What sovereignty they have over Internet-related resources has to be understood in light of changing circumstances and the importance of the pursuance of common interests. As far as international law extends to non-state actors, these are also under obligation to support the pursuance, by state actors, of the global interest in safeguarding the Internet’s integrity. This means, for example, that there is an international law-based duty, via the Ruggie Principles, for companies to respect human rights and rights of victims of business-related abuses and their right to access to remedies.\n NTIA, NTIA Finds IANA Stewardship Transition Proposal Meets Criteria to Complete Privatization (9 June 2016), available at www.ntia.doc.gov/press-release/2016/iana-stewardship-transition-proposal-meets-criteria-complete-privatization.\n ICANN IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG), Proposal to Transition the Stewardship of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Functions from the US Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to the Global Multistakeholder Community (March 2016), available at www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/iana-stewardship-transition-proposal-10mar16-en.pdf; and ICANN CCWG Accountability, Supplemental Final Proposal on Work Stream 1 Recommendations (February 2016), available at www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/ccwg-accountability-supp-proposal-work-stream-1-recs-23 feb16-en.pdf.\n See the work of the Council of Europe’s Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (MC-S-CI), www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/media/MC-S-CI/default_en.asp, especially its report International and Multi-stakeholder Co-operation on Cross-border Internet (2010).\n See International Code of Conduct for Information Security, Annex to the letter dated 12 September 2011 from the Permanent Representatives of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, A/66/359 (14 September 2011).\n WSIS, Tunis Agenda (2005) para. 35.\n See Report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, J.

To that end, the protection of the integrity of the Internet and the guarantee of cybersecurity as a common interest are essential.\n## 4. CYBERSECURITY AND INTERNATIONAL LAW\n## 4.1 International Law and the Internet\nInternational law is the only area of law with which global (public) goods can be managed and global public interest protected.49 The ubiquity of the technology underlying the Internet, which is not restricted by national borders, renders strictly single-state regulation largely ineffective. International law is needed to legitimately and effectively ensure cybersecurity in the common interest of all states. This is not a new insight.50 Without legitimate and effective protection of cybersecurity under international law, individuals and societies cannot develop to their full potential. A similar self-commitment to an international law-based Internet policy was presented by the European Commission in 2014.51\n\nMatthias C.

Individual norms from the UN Charter (e.g. the ban on aggression and intervention) are relevant to the international law of cybersecurity. However, there is no single treaty that is primarily concerned with the regulation of the Internet and the key topic of cybersecurity. Although treaties provide (legal) certainty (especially in the eyes of powerful states or states relying on traditional sovereignty concepts), bilateral cybersecurity treaties usually do not live up to the complexity of the issue due to the universality of the Internet, while multilateral treaties can only be attained through lengthy negotiation processes with an uncertain outcome. There is still no treaty on cybersecurity, though. Binding international law on cybersecurity can therefore only be derived to date from customary international law and the principles of international law.\n## 4.3 Cybersecurity and Customary International Law\nIn the Tunis Agenda, adopted at the UN World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), and in the Tunis Commitment (2005) (building on the Geneva documents of 2003), the signatory states of the world committed themselves to a:\npeople-centered, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society, premised on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, international law and multilateralism, and respecting fully and upholding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n The scope of this study does not allow for going into detail on all applicable principles of international law.

Of particular importance for protecting cybersecurity by means of international law is the commitment to international law and the significance of the Internet as a – stable and secure – worldwide institution.\nFor one thing, the international body of law pertaining to cybersecurity provides protection based on human rights. Communicators, recipients and the contents of communications are protected by Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), parts of which are based on customary law. Along with these state obligations based on individual human rights (prohibiting states from interfering with certain communicative rights), positive obligations related to Internet infrastructure can also be derived from the state obligations to provide protection and assurance pertaining to information- and communication-related rights. States are therefore obliged to ensure the sustainability and security of the networks in order to allow individuals to realize their human rights.\nParticularly relevant to ensuring and promoting cybersecurity are the following principles of international law, some of which have been translated into treaty law in the UN Charter, are protected under customary international law or are recognized as part of the general principles of international law: sovereign equality, the ban on aggression and intervention, peaceful settlement of disputes, the protection of human rights, the cooperation principle (which draws on the principle of good neighbourliness (‘no harm’) and the precautionary principle (‘due diligence’)).\nThe principle of sovereign equality (UN Charter, Article 2(1)) is a key principle of international law. As a ‘pivotal principle’ it is also of special importance for cybersecurity. Each state has jurisdiction and power over its territory and over the ICT infrastructure located there; this also means, however, that it bears a responsibility to ensure that no attacks against other states or institutions, which would infringe on international law, are organized or carried out from its territory.\nIn addition, the non-intervention principle (UN Charter, Article 2(7)) can be brought to fruition: an intense damage to Internet functionality in another state (e.g. by cyber-attacks) could constitute an intervention, although attribution problems will regularly arise. Only some of the attacks originating from the territory of a state represent an ‘intervention’ in terms of international law, because most attacks will be attributable to non-governmental protagonists or to protagonists whose association with governmental agencies cannot be proven.\n Ibid. no. 3.\n WSIS, Tunis Agenda for the Information Society, WSIS-05/TUNIS/DOC/6 (Rev. 1)-G (18 November 2005) no. 31.\n GGE Report (2015), n. 11 above, para. 26.\n Samantha Besson, ‘Sovereignty’ in Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), MPEPIL (2011) para. 1.\n Sven-Hendrik Schulze, Cyber-‘War’, Testfall der Staatenverantwortlichkeit (Tübingen: Mohr, 2015).\n See GGE Report (2015), n. 11 above: ‘the indication that an ICT activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or the ICT infrastructure of a State may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that State. The Group noted that the accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated’ (ibid. para. 28(f)).\nMatthias C.

In the context of the Internet, this Article could only be applied to especially serious cases of cyber-attacks with substantial kinetic effects.\nThe principle of peaceful settlement of disputes is relevant to cybersecurity insofar as any state has the duty, in the event of an incident, to first determine the facts and to collect evidence for attribution of a breach of international law to a particular state. Even if this succeeds, peaceful means of dispute settlement should first be sought.\nThe principle of the protection of human rights is a fundamental principle of international law that is also relevant to cybersecurity. What is problematic under international law are attempts by a state to enforce cybersecurity through an excessive control of the Internet (such as setting up and using surveillance capabilities or government screening of all Internet communication).\nThe principle of good neighbourliness (UN Charter, Article 74), or ‘no harm’ principle, can be considered as a global principle in the Internet era. Originally only relevant in terms of the relationship with adjacent states, the principle has been gradually extended.^[64]^ In the Corfu Channel case, the International Court of Justice described the principle as ‘every state’s obligation not to knowingly allow its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states’.^[65]^ The ‘no harm’ principle has its roots in the Trail Smelter^[66]^ and Lake Lanoux^[67]^ cases. It was formulated in Principle 21 of the Stockholm Declaration (1972)^[68]^ and Principle 2 of the Rio Declaration (1992):^[69]^ signatory states are committed ‘to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction’. This can easily be applied to other areas in analogy to the environment.\nThe obligation to prevent cross-border damage has crystallized into customary law. Contractual confirmation can be found in Article 194(2) of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea^[70]^ and Article 20(1) of the ASEAN Agreement on the Conservation of Nature and\nMatthias C. Kettemann and Martin Müller - 9781035308514\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/03/2025 03:25:18PM\nvia University College London (UCL)\nResearch handbook on human rights and digital technology\nNatural Resources (1985). Most recently, the ICJ confirmed in the Nuclear Weapons case that the threat to the environment is ‘no abstraction but represents the living space, the quality of life and the very health of human beings, including generations unborn’. In accordance with the ‘no harm’ principle, no state may utilize its dominion in such a manner that would cause damage to other states. In the preventive dimension of the ‘no harm’ principle, a state must take measures to prevent such hazards. Among other things, a commitment to an appropriate infrastructure, the development of emergency plans and the establishment of an international crisis cooperation structure (and culture) can be construed from this.\nThe precautionary principle (‘due diligence’) is of special importance for cybersecurity. First, the due diligence principle entails information and consultation obligations. In the scientific world, it is controversial as to what extent the precautionary principle has a ‘due diligence’ dimension or whether the precautionary obligations of states are covered in practice by the ‘no harm’ principle. The principle of due diligence was also applied in the field of combating terrorism and the financing of terrorism.\n## 4.4 Shift Towards Due Diligence\nWith some justification, normative principles for the regulation of cybersecurity can therefore be derived from the principle of due diligence. As a result, it is the responsibility of states, inter alia, ensuing from this principle, to prevent cyber-attacks originating from their own territory and to (proactively) establish a legal system that ensures and fosters cybersecurity. This can be fulfilled, for instance, by ‘passing stringent criminal laws, conducting vigorous investigations, prosecuting attackers, and, during the investigation and prosecution, cooperating with the victim-states of cyberattacks that originated from within their borders’.\nIn its preventive dimension, the due diligence principle helps to identify the obligations of states with regard to cybersecurity, particularly with regard to cybercrime, global cooperation and establishment of capacities. Cybersecurity due diligence was described as part of customary international law, whereby particularly the following preventive duties have emerged as recognized obligations under international law:\n- that governments and other stakeholders bolster cybersecurity and develop cybersecurity strategies to protect crucial infrastructures;\nMatthias C. Kettemann and Martin Müller - 9781035308514\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/03/2025 03:25:18PM\nvia University College London (UCL)\n'This is not a drill' 123\n- that states (and other relevant stakeholders) work together more closely in the fight against cybercrime and cyberterrorism, and that they ratify conventions such as the Convention on Cybercrime of the Council of Europe;\n- that states conclude treaties promoting cooperation between their police authorities; and\n- that states establish confidence-building measures and increase the level of information sharing, both generally as well as (and especially) in the event of cybersecurity-related incidents.\nConfidence-building measures are more extensive than obligations under international law ensuing from the duty of cooperation. They are relevant to the evolution of legal norms, however, insofar as they indicate the direction of how obligations under international law are developing.\n# 5. EMBRACING CYBERSECURITY NORMS IN INTERNATIONAL LAW\nAny attempt to embrace cybersecurity in international law must be preceded by the recognition of the significance of the multi-stakeholder approach in the normative development of international Internet law. Since the process of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) began, with just a few exceptions, states have been committing to the integration of all stakeholders in the normative processes relevant to Internet regulation. The multi-stakeholder approach is put into practice in the development and application of instruments and processes\nTechnologies'; 57/239 of 20 December 2002 on the 'Creation of a Global Culture of Cybersecurity' and 58/199 of 23 December 2003 on 'The Creation of a Global Culture of Cybersecurity and the Protection of Critical Information Infrastructures'; 53/70 of 4 December 1998, 54/49 of 1 December 1999, 55/28 of 20 November 2000, 56/19 of 29 November 2001, 57/53 of 22 November 2002, 58/32 of 8 December 2003, 59/61 of 3 December 2004, 60/45 of 8 December 2005, 61/54 of 6 December 2006, 62/17 of 5 December 2007 and 63/37 of 2 December 2008 on 'Developments with respect to Information Technologies in the Context of International Security').\n See UNODC, Resolution 22/8 on 'Promoting Technical Assistance and Capacity Building to Strengthen National Measures and International Cooperation Against Cybercrime', UNODC/ CCPCJ/2013/RES/22/8, para. 4.\n See GGE Report (2013), n. 10 above, para. 22.\n Ibid. para. 22.\n Ibid. para. 26 et seq.\n Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, Decision No. 1202, 'OSCE Confidence-Building Measures to Reduce the Risks of Conflict Stemming from the Use of Information and Communication Technologies', PC.DEC/1202 (10 March 2016).\n See Katharina Ziolkowski, 'Confidence Building Measures for Cyberspace' in Katharina Ziolkowski (ed.), *Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy* (Tallinn: NATO CCD COE Publications, 2013) 533–64.\n See Matthias C.

They can only offer the opportunity for states (or other stakeholders) to accomplish preparatory work relevant to the normative process. Jointly discussing 'norms' can be useful, because common values will be expressed already in the process of discussion[85] and the positions taken by participating states serve as indications of their attitudes toward an international juridification of cybersecurity.\nA promising approach for embracing binding cybersecurity norms in international law in the long term is the negotiation and adoption of an international treaty. It remains the 'gold standard' of international law and is the most important authoritative source of law. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,[86] which entered into force on 4 November 2016, has shown that even today international treaties covering complex topics such as regulations relating to global public goods (for example, cybersecurity as a prerequisite for a well-functioning Internet) can be successfully concluded.\n# 6. SUMMARY\nIn the light of the importance of the Internet for states, business and society, cybersecurity – as a prerequisite for a reliably functioning and secure Internet – has become a global community interest which needs protection. The technologicalization and informationalization of many key infrastructure provision functions and of many industry control systems open up new vulnerabilities within states that can threaten, if an attack is substantial, international peace and security. Similarly, the increased use of mobile devices, Cloud computing and the use of social networks increases the vulnerability of citizens to acts of cybercrime.\nCybersecurity is a key functional condition for an era defined by information and communications technology. A secure Internet lies in the interest of each individual state and also collectively in the interest of all states of the world as a global community. Cybersecurity thus lies in the global common interest. It has a key security interest for which all the states of the world bear separate and common responsibility. This responsibility must be met through an application of the principles and processes of international law.\nInternational law is to be fully applied to the Internet, including with regard to regulating cybersecurity. Customary international law and the general principles of international law particularly restrict (and define) national Internet policy. Consequently, each state has protection obligations vis-à-vis the international community – to avert threats to the stability, integrity and functionality of the Internet – which can be derived from customary international law. At the same time, states may not restrict freedom on the Internet without limitation under the\nMatthias C.

The global, cross-border Internet traffic may not be adversely affected or in any way destabilized by states due to national legislation and policy.\nIn addition to post-incident information and communication requirements, preventive obligations also arise from the due diligence principle and the tenets of good neighbourliness and can in part only be met in cooperation with nongovernmental stakeholders. This binding cooperation principle of customary international law provides mandatory guidance to states in their development of strategies for promoting cybersecurity. But what complicates the situation is that in responding to cybersecurity threats, states are often fully dependent on private entities and their security experts.\nThe May 2017 WannaCry Ransomware attack, for example, shows how vulnerabilities are caused by a number of factors, including companies who fail to provide updates or no longer service vulnerabilities, affected companies that have slow patch cycles, secret services that stockpile vulnerabilities, and states that do not force essential service providers (like healthcare companies) to ensure that their systems are stable and secure.\nAs the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence concluded with regard to the WannaCry Ransomware attacks:\nCampaigns like WannaCry should remind decision-makers of the importance of baseline cyber security, since in this case the victims could have prevented the spread of ransomware by fairly simple security measures.^[87]^\nBe it baseline cybersecurity or more advanced forms that are necessary for states to implement in order to meet their obligations under international law: the debate on how best to ensure a stable and resilient Internet for all is far from over – and it is international law that provides the impetus, frame and objective of the debate.\nThe normative frame of cybersecurity and the real-world application of it are not yet stable enough to ensure convincingly that honest mistakes, serious crimes and international cyber-attacks are effectively stopped. This should worry us. As Dutch Ruppersberger, a long-time Democratic US Congressman from Maryland, was quoted in 2013 by Rolling Stone magazine as saying: ‘People ask me all the time, “What keeps you up at night?” And I say, “Spicy Mexican food, weapons of mass destruction, and cyber attacks”’.^[88]^ Changing one’s diet might help with the first issue, arms reduction and arms control regimes with the second, and an international law-based global cybersecurity regime with the third: less chili then, and a more nuanced normative order of cybersecurity with clear commitments for each stakeholder.\nMatthias C.

Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill.’ This emergency alert was sent out to thousands of Hawaiians on 13 January 2018, at 8:08 a.m. local time. Luckily, it turned out to be not a drill, but rather the result of human error. An employee, it appeared, had pushed the wrong button (twice). The reactions on social media and in real life – the media was full of stories of scared Hawaiians hiding in garages – tells us a lot about our times both in terms of international security (ballistic missiles threats were a Cold War staple) and in terms of cybersecurity: Human errors can cause real damages – and humans are an integral part of cybersecurity.\nThis was the example on how cybersecurity issues are interlinked to general security issues from the first edition. Fast forward 5 years later, a similar example has occurred: During the attack by Hamas terrorists against Israel in October 2023, a hacktivist group named ‘AnonGhost’ managed to exploit flaws in the app ‘Red Alert’, which is used among others in Israel as a missile alert service. Similar to the false alarm sent out to Hawaiians, the hackers warned users of an upcoming nuclear attack. Dissimilar, however, this time there was no human error, but an attempt by malicious actors to influence an ongoing conflict.\nBe it online or offline, be it in the kinetic world or in cyberspace, we need norms – and have always needed them. ‘In the long march of mankind from the cave to the computer’, as Malcolm N.

Political and legal approaches to preventing cyberwar and cybercrime such as the negotiations on a UN Cybercrime Convention have attracted considerable attention internationally. This study shows that the Internet is critical infrastructure in itself and also functionally essential for other critical infrastructure. The UN General Assembly, in Resolution 64/211 of 21 December 2009, promoted the creation of a global culture of cybersecurity and expressed concerns in light of growing threats to the reliable functioning of the Internet (technically: ‘of critical information infrastructures and to the integrity of the information carried over those’). These affect ‘domestic, national and international welfare’. The Resolution affirms that states are obliged to deal systematically with these threats and coordinate both with national stakeholders and internationally with the goal of facilitating the achievement of cybersecurity.\nThe 2013 Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) report underlined that applying norms derived from ‘existing international law relevant to the use of ICTs by States is an essential measure to reduce risks to international peace, security and stability’. The Charter of the United Nations is applicable to the whole gamut of socio-economic activity on the Internet and thus ‘essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment’. Applying international law to the Internet lies in the common interest and safeguarding the Internet as such also lies in the common interest because a stable, secure and functional Internet is essential for international security. Building on this consensus, the 2015 report of the GGE again confirmed that international law, the UN Charter and\n Malcolm N.

Common criminals continue to misuse the Internet both for online variants of common scams and for Internet-specific (technology-based) attacks. The size of monetary loss is difficult to evaluate but an often-quoted estimate (e.g. by the European Commission) by Cybersecurity Ventures expects losses of around US$ 8 trillion for the year 2023 worldwide. This threat requires international cooperation. At the same time, some criminal misuses of the Internet are not direct threats to the Internet’s integrity, as criminal networks rely on the Internet to conduct their activities. But other attacks, including disruptive attacks or others not linked to monetary gain (such as attacks to cause social unrest in the introductory Israel example) can amount to substantial threats to cybersecurity and the Internet’s functionality.\nDifferent levels of Internet security awareness and capabilities globally matter to all states because of the interconnectedness of ICTs and the networked nature of the Internet. ‘These vulnerabilities are amplified’, the UN’s Group of Governmental Experts on IT and Security complained in 2013, ‘by disparities in national law, regulations and practices related to the use of ICTs’. Only international cooperation in the protection of the Internet can help meet these challenges. The role of the Internet’s integrity in contributing to international security and the threats posed by international cybercrime are further reasons why ensuring cybersecurity and protecting the integrity of the Internet lies in the common interest.\nThis chapter examines the protection of cybersecurity under international law and develops a future-oriented approach to increasing cybersecurity through international law. After outlining my concept of cybersecurity (2) and explaining why protecting cybersecurity lies in the common interest of all states (3), I will outline which international legal norms protect cybersecurity (4). After that, I will identify approaches to better protect cybersecurity in international law (5).

TOWARDS A COMPREHENSIVE CONCEPT OF CYBERSECURITY\nCybersecurity is defined very broadly by some states and covers risks and threats such as cyberwarfare, cyberterrorism, cybercrime and cyber-espionage. There is no doubt that cybersecurity is a crucial part of national, domestic, security, foreign and defence policy. As a central theme of Internet policy, cybersecurity is closely linked with the stability, robustness, resilience and functionality of the Internet. Cybersecurity can be threatened by cybercrime and cyberterrorism, but also by a lack of legal and technical cooperation between states and a lack of preventive measures, such as developing crisis intervention centres and teams, as well as transnational crisis communication structures for cyber incidents.\nThe major 2017 WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks, for example, were the first world-wide felt examples of how vulnerabilities are caused by a number of factors, including software companies who fail to provide updates or no longer service vulnerabilities, affected companies that have slow patch cycles, secret services that stockpile vulnerabilities, and states that do not force essential service providers (like healthcare companies) to ensure that their systems are stable and secure. These issues remain, even if so-called ‘Zero-day vulnerabilities’ occur and are exploited more often.\nFostering and ensuring cybersecurity are a prerequisite for the stability of national economic processes and the international business and financial system, for transnational communication flows and for the functioning of energy grids, the enforcement of human rights, and the performance of national, regional and international defence infrastructures. Ultimately, cybersecurity is fundamental to the full realization of all human rights.\nIt is too often the case that (cyber)security is contrasted with (Internet) freedom and the two concepts are played against each other to the detriment of both. This view misses the point.\n See Myriam Dunn Cavelty and Camino Kavanagh, Chapter 5. They differentiate between two notions of cybersecurity: a technical information security approach and a national security-focused approach. Our use of the concept encompasses elements from both conceptions.\n More states have Cybersecurity Strategies now.

The Cybersecurity Strategy for Germany defines cybersecurity as ‘IT security of the networked or network-capable information technology systems in cyberspace’. IT security is understood to be ensuring the ‘IT security is [...] the state in which the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and availability of information and IT are protected by appropriate measures.’ This definition is very technology-oriented and too short-sighted in light of how cybersecurity is practically perceived by business and society. The security on the Internet and of the Internet cannot simply be equated with the security of systems and data. To view cybersecurity correctly, it must be regarded holistically. Each meaningful cybersecurity concept should be comprehensive and value-based: a commitment to a stable, secure, resilient, fully functional, open and free Internet and its protection against state and private attacks of any kind.\n## 3. PROTECTING CYBERSECURITY LIES IN THE COMMON INTEREST OF ALL STATES\n## 3.1 Cybersecurity and the Common Interest\nIn 1998, experts working on behalf of the UNESCO posed the question whether the ‘United Nations General Assembly [could] affirm the principle of regarding cyberspace as “the common heritage of humanity”’ and thus safeguard it. They failed to answer the question, which was well enough because it was the wrong one. It is not ‘cyberspace’ we should concern ourselves with, but rather the Internet itself; and rather than using the concept of common heritage of mankind, which presupposes a certain historical stability the Internet does not have, we rather need to establish why protecting the Internet lies in the global common interest.\nDuring the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), which the United Nations convened in 2003 and 2005 to establish a normative trajectory for the Internet, states affirmed their common desire and commitment to build an information society that is ‘people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented’ and in which individuals, communities and peoples can:\nMatthias C. Kettemann and Martin Müller - 9781035308514\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/03/2025 03:25:18PM\nvia University College London (UCL)\n'This is not a drill'\nachieve their full potential in promoting their sustainable development and improving their quality of life premised on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and respecting fully and upholding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nWe have here a first clear answer to the question about what ‘vision’ the international community pursues regarding the impact of the Internet.\nClearly, achieving world peace and international security (as enshrined in the UN Charter), ensuring human development (as codified in the Millennium Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals) and respecting, protecting and implementing human rights (as normatively ordered in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)) are in the global common interest. Different normative orders within international law contribute towards achieving these common interests. By establishing finalities for a normative order, such as WSIS has done for Internet governance, the normative development of that order is anchored in the finality of ensuring the common interest, lying in peace, security and development. Creating a people-centred, development-oriented information society is thus part of the broader normative commitment in international law to protecting the common interest of ensuring world peace, international security and development.\nWe have thus established that there is a global common interest in ensuring a people-centred and development-oriented information society. But is protecting cybersecurity and thus the Internet’s integrity essential for reaching these goals? UN Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression, Frank La Rue, in a groundbreaking report on the impact of the Internet on freedom of expression, described the Internet as a ‘catalyst for individuals to exercise their right to freedom of opinion and expression’. Freedom of expression on the Internet itself is a ‘facilitator of the realisation of a range of other human rights’. The multiple challenges that the Internet brings for human rights notwithstanding, the absence of the Internet (or of an Internet without cybersecurity) would seriously challenge the realization of human rights. There are important corollary rights that are premised upon exercising free speech on the Internet. These include the freedom of assembly and association online, the right to (digital) education and the right of access to digital knowledge. From all these rights we can also derive a right to access to online information and communication, which is crucial for human development. Similar arguments have been voiced by courts and international organizations.\n WSIS, Geneva Declaration of Principles, WSIS-03/GENEVA/DOC/4-E (12 December 2003) para. 1.\n F.

It is similarly a facilitator for human security.\nIn the same vein, the 2013 report of the UN GGE determined that the application of norms derived from existing international law is ‘essential’ to minimize risks to world peace and international security and stability. Viewed in the context of information technology challenges, cybersecurity is now one aspect of ‘world peace’. When analysing the protection of cybersecurity under international law, the GGE report from 2015, and reiterated in 2021, which was adopted in consensus by a representative group of governmental experts, is very helpful, stating, inter alia, that the international community aspires to regulate the Internet in a peaceful manner ‘for the common good of mankind’.\n## 3.2 Ensuing International Legal Duties\nProtecting cybersecurity is a common interest of all states. This community interest is not an aggregate of the individual sets of interests; rather, it lies at their intersection. If a protected interest is part of the community interest, this entails consequences relevant to international law. States are therefore responsible to the international community with regard to cybersecurity according to their judicial authority over critical infrastructures pertinent to it.\nTo the extent that a state controls Critical Internet Resources (CIRs), it has to exercise this jurisdiction mindful of threats to cybersecurity and especially the security of these CIRs in a manner that ensures the common interest. To the extent that national politics (and policies) can impact the Internet negatively, a state has to refrain from their formulation and implementation. A state’s sovereignty is reduced because of the limits the protection of the Internet as a common interest lays upon him. The United States, as former delegated manager of the CIRs, therefore only had ‘custodial sovereignty’. This implied that the United States had to enter into consultations with other states with regard to the management of CIRs and make sure that the management was transparent and accountable, ideally to the international community\n Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, A/68/98 (24 June 2013) para. 16.\n Ibid.\n GGE Report (2015), n. 11 above.\n Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, A/76/135 (14 July 2021) ('GGE Report (2021)') para. 5, 71(e).\n Members: Belarus, Brazil, China, Colombia, Egypt, Estonia, France, Germany, Ghana, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Russian Federation, Spain, United Kingdom and United States.\n For documentation of the reports of individual member states, see the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, www.un.org/disarmament/topics/informationsecurity.\n See W.

All other states, insofar as they can endanger the Internet’s stability, security and functionality, are pre-empted from doing so. In assessing whether politics may impact the Internet negatively, it makes sense to suggest the precautionary principle as a guide to decision-making.\nA second consequence is that humankind – that is all actors making up the international community, and not only states – have a legitimate interest in making sure that all other actors protect the Internet (or at least do not actively harm it). Though sovereignty-oriented states have suggested exclusive sovereignty over national Internet segments, the character of the Internet, as protected by international law as a common interest, limits their sovereignty. The 2005 Tunis Agenda, though valuable in its description of the normative goals of the information society, still lays down that ‘policy authority for internet-related public policy issues’ is a ‘sovereign right of States’. This needs to be qualified in light of a common interest approach to protecting the Internet in that the states’ policy authority is no longer an exclusively sovereign right, but part and parcel of their sovereignty, to be exercised in the common interest. What sovereignty they have over Internet-related resources has to be understood in light of changing circumstances and the importance of the pursuance of common interests. As far as international law extends to non-state actors, these are also under obligation to support the pursuance, by state actors, of the global interest in safeguarding the Internet’s integrity. This means, for example, that there is an international law-based duty, via the Ruggie Principles, for companies to respect human rights and rights of victims of business-related abuses and their right to access to remedies.\n NTIA, NTIA Finds IANA Stewardship Transition Proposal Meets Criteria to Complete Privatization (9 June 2016), available at www.ntia.doc.gov/press-release/2016/iana-stewardship-transition-proposal-meets-criteria-complete-privatization.\n ICANN IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG), Proposal to Transition the Stewardship of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Functions from the US Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to the Global Multistakeholder Community (March 2016), available at www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/iana-stewardship-transition-proposal-10mar16-en.pdf; and ICANN CCWG Accountability, Supplemental Final Proposal on Work Stream 1 Recommendations (February 2016), available at www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/ccwg-accountability-supp-proposal-work-stream-1-recs-23 feb16-en.pdf.\n See the work of the Council of Europe’s Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (MC-S-CI), www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/media/MC-S-CI/default_en.asp, especially its report International and Multi-stakeholder Co-operation on Cross-border Internet (2010).\n See International Code of Conduct for Information Security, Annex to the letter dated 12 September 2011 from the Permanent Representatives of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, A/66/359 (14 September 2011).\n WSIS, Tunis Agenda (2005) para. 35.\n See Report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, J.

To that end, the protection of the integrity of the Internet and the guarantee of cybersecurity as a common interest are essential.\n## 4. CYBERSECURITY AND INTERNATIONAL LAW\n## 4.1 International Law and the Internet\nInternational law is the only area of law with which global (public) goods can be managed and global public interest protected.49 The ubiquity of the technology underlying the Internet, which is not restricted by national borders, renders strictly single-state regulation largely ineffective. International law is needed to legitimately and effectively ensure cybersecurity in the common interest of all states. This is not a new insight.50 Without legitimate and effective protection of cybersecurity under international law, individuals and societies cannot develop to their full potential. A similar self-commitment to an international law-based Internet policy was presented by the European Commission in 2014.51\n\nMatthias C.

Individual norms from the UN Charter (e.g. the ban on aggression and intervention) are relevant to the international law of cybersecurity. However, there is no single treaty that is primarily concerned with the regulation of the Internet and the key topic of cybersecurity. Although treaties provide (legal) certainty (especially in the eyes of powerful states or states relying on traditional sovereignty concepts), bilateral cybersecurity treaties usually do not live up to the complexity of the issue due to the universality of the Internet, while multilateral treaties can only be attained through lengthy negotiation processes with an uncertain outcome. There is still no treaty on cybersecurity, though. Binding international law on cybersecurity can therefore only be derived to date from customary international law and the principles of international law.\n## 4.3 Cybersecurity and Customary International Law\nIn the Tunis Agenda, adopted at the UN World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), and in the Tunis Commitment (2005) (building on the Geneva documents of 2003), the signatory states of the world committed themselves to a:\npeople-centered, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society, premised on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, international law and multilateralism, and respecting fully and upholding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n The scope of this study does not allow for going into detail on all applicable principles of international law.

Of particular importance for protecting cybersecurity by means of international law is the commitment to international law and the significance of the Internet as a – stable and secure – worldwide institution.\nFor one thing, the international body of law pertaining to cybersecurity provides protection based on human rights. Communicators, recipients and the contents of communications are protected by Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), parts of which are based on customary law. Along with these state obligations based on individual human rights (prohibiting states from interfering with certain communicative rights), positive obligations related to Internet infrastructure can also be derived from the state obligations to provide protection and assurance pertaining to information- and communication-related rights. States are therefore obliged to ensure the sustainability and security of the networks in order to allow individuals to realize their human rights.\nParticularly relevant to ensuring and promoting cybersecurity are the following principles of international law, some of which have been translated into treaty law in the UN Charter, are protected under customary international law or are recognized as part of the general principles of international law: sovereign equality, the ban on aggression and intervention, peaceful settlement of disputes, the protection of human rights, the cooperation principle (which draws on the principle of good neighbourliness (‘no harm’) and the precautionary principle (‘due diligence’)).\nThe principle of sovereign equality (UN Charter, Article 2(1)) is a key principle of international law. As a ‘pivotal principle’ it is also of special importance for cybersecurity. Each state has jurisdiction and power over its territory and over the ICT infrastructure located there; this also means, however, that it bears a responsibility to ensure that no attacks against other states or institutions, which would infringe on international law, are organized or carried out from its territory.\nIn addition, the non-intervention principle (UN Charter, Article 2(7)) can be brought to fruition: an intense damage to Internet functionality in another state (e.g. by cyber-attacks) could constitute an intervention, although attribution problems will regularly arise. Only some of the attacks originating from the territory of a state represent an ‘intervention’ in terms of international law, because most attacks will be attributable to non-governmental protagonists or to protagonists whose association with governmental agencies cannot be proven.\n Ibid. no. 3.\n WSIS, Tunis Agenda for the Information Society, WSIS-05/TUNIS/DOC/6 (Rev. 1)-G (18 November 2005) no. 31.\n GGE Report (2015), n. 11 above, para. 26.\n Samantha Besson, ‘Sovereignty’ in Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), MPEPIL (2011) para. 1.\n Sven-Hendrik Schulze, Cyber-‘War’, Testfall der Staatenverantwortlichkeit (Tübingen: Mohr, 2015).\n See GGE Report (2015), n. 11 above: ‘the indication that an ICT activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or the ICT infrastructure of a State may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that State. The Group noted that the accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated’ (ibid. para. 28(f)).\nMatthias C.

In the context of the Internet, this Article could only be applied to especially serious cases of cyber-attacks with substantial kinetic effects.\nThe principle of peaceful settlement of disputes is relevant to cybersecurity insofar as any state has the duty, in the event of an incident, to first determine the facts and to collect evidence for attribution of a breach of international law to a particular state. Even if this succeeds, peaceful means of dispute settlement should first be sought.\nThe principle of the protection of human rights is a fundamental principle of international law that is also relevant to cybersecurity. What is problematic under international law are attempts by a state to enforce cybersecurity through an excessive control of the Internet (such as setting up and using surveillance capabilities or government screening of all Internet communication).\nThe principle of good neighbourliness (UN Charter, Article 74), or ‘no harm’ principle, can be considered as a global principle in the Internet era. Originally only relevant in terms of the relationship with adjacent states, the principle has been gradually extended.^[64]^ In the Corfu Channel case, the International Court of Justice described the principle as ‘every state’s obligation not to knowingly allow its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states’.^[65]^ The ‘no harm’ principle has its roots in the Trail Smelter^[66]^ and Lake Lanoux^[67]^ cases. It was formulated in Principle 21 of the Stockholm Declaration (1972)^[68]^ and Principle 2 of the Rio Declaration (1992):^[69]^ signatory states are committed ‘to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction’. This can easily be applied to other areas in analogy to the environment.\nThe obligation to prevent cross-border damage has crystallized into customary law. Contractual confirmation can be found in Article 194(2) of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea^[70]^ and Article 20(1) of the ASEAN Agreement on the Conservation of Nature and\nMatthias C. Kettemann and Martin Müller - 9781035308514\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/03/2025 03:25:18PM\nvia University College London (UCL)\nResearch handbook on human rights and digital technology\nNatural Resources (1985). Most recently, the ICJ confirmed in the Nuclear Weapons case that the threat to the environment is ‘no abstraction but represents the living space, the quality of life and the very health of human beings, including generations unborn’. In accordance with the ‘no harm’ principle, no state may utilize its dominion in such a manner that would cause damage to other states. In the preventive dimension of the ‘no harm’ principle, a state must take measures to prevent such hazards. Among other things, a commitment to an appropriate infrastructure, the development of emergency plans and the establishment of an international crisis cooperation structure (and culture) can be construed from this.\nThe precautionary principle (‘due diligence’) is of special importance for cybersecurity. First, the due diligence principle entails information and consultation obligations. In the scientific world, it is controversial as to what extent the precautionary principle has a ‘due diligence’ dimension or whether the precautionary obligations of states are covered in practice by the ‘no harm’ principle. The principle of due diligence was also applied in the field of combating terrorism and the financing of terrorism.\n## 4.4 Shift Towards Due Diligence\nWith some justification, normative principles for the regulation of cybersecurity can therefore be derived from the principle of due diligence. As a result, it is the responsibility of states, inter alia, ensuing from this principle, to prevent cyber-attacks originating from their own territory and to (proactively) establish a legal system that ensures and fosters cybersecurity. This can be fulfilled, for instance, by ‘passing stringent criminal laws, conducting vigorous investigations, prosecuting attackers, and, during the investigation and prosecution, cooperating with the victim-states of cyberattacks that originated from within their borders’.\nIn its preventive dimension, the due diligence principle helps to identify the obligations of states with regard to cybersecurity, particularly with regard to cybercrime, global cooperation and establishment of capacities. Cybersecurity due diligence was described as part of customary international law, whereby particularly the following preventive duties have emerged as recognized obligations under international law:\n- that governments and other stakeholders bolster cybersecurity and develop cybersecurity strategies to protect crucial infrastructures;\nMatthias C. Kettemann and Martin Müller - 9781035308514\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/03/2025 03:25:18PM\nvia University College London (UCL)\n'This is not a drill' 123\n- that states (and other relevant stakeholders) work together more closely in the fight against cybercrime and cyberterrorism, and that they ratify conventions such as the Convention on Cybercrime of the Council of Europe;\n- that states conclude treaties promoting cooperation between their police authorities; and\n- that states establish confidence-building measures and increase the level of information sharing, both generally as well as (and especially) in the event of cybersecurity-related incidents.\nConfidence-building measures are more extensive than obligations under international law ensuing from the duty of cooperation. They are relevant to the evolution of legal norms, however, insofar as they indicate the direction of how obligations under international law are developing.\n# 5. EMBRACING CYBERSECURITY NORMS IN INTERNATIONAL LAW\nAny attempt to embrace cybersecurity in international law must be preceded by the recognition of the significance of the multi-stakeholder approach in the normative development of international Internet law. Since the process of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) began, with just a few exceptions, states have been committing to the integration of all stakeholders in the normative processes relevant to Internet regulation. The multi-stakeholder approach is put into practice in the development and application of instruments and processes\nTechnologies'; 57/239 of 20 December 2002 on the 'Creation of a Global Culture of Cybersecurity' and 58/199 of 23 December 2003 on 'The Creation of a Global Culture of Cybersecurity and the Protection of Critical Information Infrastructures'; 53/70 of 4 December 1998, 54/49 of 1 December 1999, 55/28 of 20 November 2000, 56/19 of 29 November 2001, 57/53 of 22 November 2002, 58/32 of 8 December 2003, 59/61 of 3 December 2004, 60/45 of 8 December 2005, 61/54 of 6 December 2006, 62/17 of 5 December 2007 and 63/37 of 2 December 2008 on 'Developments with respect to Information Technologies in the Context of International Security').\n See UNODC, Resolution 22/8 on 'Promoting Technical Assistance and Capacity Building to Strengthen National Measures and International Cooperation Against Cybercrime', UNODC/ CCPCJ/2013/RES/22/8, para. 4.\n See GGE Report (2013), n. 10 above, para. 22.\n Ibid. para. 22.\n Ibid. para. 26 et seq.\n Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, Decision No. 1202, 'OSCE Confidence-Building Measures to Reduce the Risks of Conflict Stemming from the Use of Information and Communication Technologies', PC.DEC/1202 (10 March 2016).\n See Katharina Ziolkowski, 'Confidence Building Measures for Cyberspace' in Katharina Ziolkowski (ed.), *Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy* (Tallinn: NATO CCD COE Publications, 2013) 533–64.\n See Matthias C.

They can only offer the opportunity for states (or other stakeholders) to accomplish preparatory work relevant to the normative process. Jointly discussing 'norms' can be useful, because common values will be expressed already in the process of discussion[85] and the positions taken by participating states serve as indications of their attitudes toward an international juridification of cybersecurity.\nA promising approach for embracing binding cybersecurity norms in international law in the long term is the negotiation and adoption of an international treaty. It remains the 'gold standard' of international law and is the most important authoritative source of law. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,[86] which entered into force on 4 November 2016, has shown that even today international treaties covering complex topics such as regulations relating to global public goods (for example, cybersecurity as a prerequisite for a well-functioning Internet) can be successfully concluded.\n# 6. SUMMARY\nIn the light of the importance of the Internet for states, business and society, cybersecurity – as a prerequisite for a reliably functioning and secure Internet – has become a global community interest which needs protection. The technologicalization and informationalization of many key infrastructure provision functions and of many industry control systems open up new vulnerabilities within states that can threaten, if an attack is substantial, international peace and security. Similarly, the increased use of mobile devices, Cloud computing and the use of social networks increases the vulnerability of citizens to acts of cybercrime.\nCybersecurity is a key functional condition for an era defined by information and communications technology. A secure Internet lies in the interest of each individual state and also collectively in the interest of all states of the world as a global community. Cybersecurity thus lies in the global common interest. It has a key security interest for which all the states of the world bear separate and common responsibility. This responsibility must be met through an application of the principles and processes of international law.\nInternational law is to be fully applied to the Internet, including with regard to regulating cybersecurity. Customary international law and the general principles of international law particularly restrict (and define) national Internet policy. Consequently, each state has protection obligations vis-à-vis the international community – to avert threats to the stability, integrity and functionality of the Internet – which can be derived from customary international law. At the same time, states may not restrict freedom on the Internet without limitation under the\nMatthias C.

The global, cross-border Internet traffic may not be adversely affected or in any way destabilized by states due to national legislation and policy.\nIn addition to post-incident information and communication requirements, preventive obligations also arise from the due diligence principle and the tenets of good neighbourliness and can in part only be met in cooperation with nongovernmental stakeholders. This binding cooperation principle of customary international law provides mandatory guidance to states in their development of strategies for promoting cybersecurity. But what complicates the situation is that in responding to cybersecurity threats, states are often fully dependent on private entities and their security experts.\nThe May 2017 WannaCry Ransomware attack, for example, shows how vulnerabilities are caused by a number of factors, including companies who fail to provide updates or no longer service vulnerabilities, affected companies that have slow patch cycles, secret services that stockpile vulnerabilities, and states that do not force essential service providers (like healthcare companies) to ensure that their systems are stable and secure.\nAs the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence concluded with regard to the WannaCry Ransomware attacks:\nCampaigns like WannaCry should remind decision-makers of the importance of baseline cyber security, since in this case the victims could have prevented the spread of ransomware by fairly simple security measures.^[87]^\nBe it baseline cybersecurity or more advanced forms that are necessary for states to implement in order to meet their obligations under international law: the debate on how best to ensure a stable and resilient Internet for all is far from over – and it is international law that provides the impetus, frame and objective of the debate.\nThe normative frame of cybersecurity and the real-world application of it are not yet stable enough to ensure convincingly that honest mistakes, serious crimes and international cyber-attacks are effectively stopped. This should worry us. As Dutch Ruppersberger, a long-time Democratic US Congressman from Maryland, was quoted in 2013 by Rolling Stone magazine as saying: ‘People ask me all the time, “What keeps you up at night?” And I say, “Spicy Mexican food, weapons of mass destruction, and cyber attacks”’.^[88]^ Changing one’s diet might help with the first issue, arms reduction and arms control regimes with the second, and an international law-based global cybersecurity regime with the third: less chili then, and a more nuanced normative order of cybersecurity with clear commitments for each stakeholder.\nMatthias C.

INTRODUCTION\n‘Ballistic missile threat inbound to Hawaii. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill.’ This emergency alert was sent out to thousands of Hawaiians on 13 January 2018, at 8:08 a.m. local time.² Luckily, it turned out to be not a drill, but rather the result of human error. An employee, it appeared, had pushed the wrong button (twice). The reactions on social media and in real life – the media was full of stories of scared Hawaiians hiding in garages – tells us a lot about our times both in terms of international security (ballistic missiles threats were a Cold War staple) and in terms of cybersecurity: Human errors can cause real damages – and humans are an integral part of cybersecurity.\nThis was the example on how cybersecurity issues are interlinked to general security issues from the first edition. Fast forward 5 years later, a similar example has occurred: During the attack by Hamas terrorists against Israel in October 2023, a hacktivist group named ‘AnonGhost’ managed to exploit flaws in the app ‘Red Alert’, which is used among others in Israel as a missile alert service.³ Similar to the false alarm sent out to Hawaiians, the hackers warned users of an upcoming nuclear attack. Dissimilar, however, this time there was no human error, but an attempt by malicious actors to influence an ongoing conflict.\nBe it online or offline,⁴ be it in the kinetic world or in cyberspace, we need norms – and have always needed them. ‘In the long march of mankind from the cave to the computer’, as Malcolm N. Shaw puts it in his introduction to international law, ‘a central role has always\n¹ Prof. Dr. Matthias C. Kettemann, LL.M.

Political and legal approaches to preventing cyberwar⁶ and cybercrime⁷ such as the negotiations on a UN Cybercrime Convention⁸ have attracted considerable attention internationally. This study shows that the Internet is critical infrastructure in itself and also functionally essential for other critical infrastructure. The UN General Assembly, in Resolution 64/211 of 21 December 2009, promoted the creation of a global culture of cybersecurity⁹ and expressed concerns in light of growing threats to the reliable functioning of the Internet (technically: ‘of critical information infrastructures and to the integrity of the information carried over those’). These affect ‘domestic, national and international welfare’. The Resolution affirms that states are obliged to deal systematically with these threats and coordinate both with national stakeholders and internationally with the goal of facilitating the achievement of cybersecurity.\nThe 2013 Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) report underlined that applying norms derived from ‘existing international law relevant to the use of ICTs by States is an essential measure to reduce risks to international peace, security and stability’. The Charter of the United Nations is applicable to the whole gamut of socio-economic activity on the Internet and thus ‘essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment’.¹⁰ Applying international law to the Internet lies in the common interest and safeguarding the Internet as such also lies in the common interest because a stable, secure and functional Internet is essential for international security. Building on this consensus, the 2015¹¹ report of the GGE again confirmed that international law, the UN Charter and\n⁵ Malcolm N.

Common criminals continue to misuse the Internet both for online variants of common scams and for Internet-specific (technology-based) attacks. The size of monetary loss is difficult to evaluate but an often-quoted estimate (e.g. by the European Commission)¹⁵ by Cybersecurity Ventures expects losses of around US$ 8 trillion for the year 2023 worldwide.¹⁶ This threat requires international cooperation. At the same time, some criminal misuses of the Internet are not direct threats to the Internet’s integrity, as criminal networks rely on the Internet to conduct their activities. But other attacks, including disruptive attacks or others not linked to monetary gain (such as attacks to cause social unrest in the introductory Israel example) can amount to substantial threats to cybersecurity and the Internet’s functionality.\nDifferent levels of Internet security awareness and capabilities globally matter to all states because of the interconnectedness of ICTs and the networked nature of the Internet. ‘These vulnerabilities are amplified’, the UN’s Group of Governmental Experts on IT and Security complained in 2013, ‘by disparities in national law, regulations and practices related to the use of ICTs’.¹⁷ Only international cooperation in the protection of the Internet can help meet these challenges. The role of the Internet’s integrity in contributing to international security and the threats posed by international cybercrime are further reasons why ensuring cybersecurity and protecting the integrity of the Internet lies in the common interest.\nThis chapter examines the protection of cybersecurity under international law and develops a future-oriented approach to increasing cybersecurity through international law. After outlining my concept of cybersecurity (2) and explaining why protecting cybersecurity lies in the common interest of all states (3), I will outline which international legal norms protect cybersecurity (4). After that, I will identify approaches to better protect cybersecurity in international law (5).

TOWARDS A COMPREHENSIVE CONCEPT OF CYBERSECURITY\nCybersecurity is defined very broadly by some states and covers risks and threats such as cyberwarfare, cyberterrorism, cybercrime and cyber-espionage.¹⁸ There is no doubt that cybersecurity is a crucial part of national, domestic, security, foreign and defence policy.¹⁹ As a central theme of Internet policy,²⁰ cybersecurity is closely linked with the stability, robustness, resilience and functionality of the Internet.²¹ Cybersecurity can be threatened by cybercrime and cyberterrorism, but also by a lack of legal and technical cooperation between states and a lack of preventive measures, such as developing crisis intervention centres and teams, as well as transnational crisis communication structures for cyber incidents.\nThe major 2017 WannaCry²² and NotPetya²³ ransomware attacks, for example, were the first world-wide felt examples of how vulnerabilities are caused by a number of factors, including software companies who fail to provide updates or no longer service vulnerabilities, affected companies that have slow patch cycles, secret services that stockpile vulnerabilities, and states that do not force essential service providers (like healthcare companies) to ensure that their systems are stable and secure.²⁴ These issues remain, even if so-called ‘Zero-day vulnerabilities’ occur and are exploited more often.²⁵\nFostering and ensuring cybersecurity are a prerequisite for the stability of national economic processes and the international business and financial system, for transnational communication flows and for the functioning of energy grids, the enforcement of human rights, and the performance of national, regional and international defence infrastructures. Ultimately, cybersecurity is fundamental to the full realization of all human rights.\nIt is too often the case that (cyber)security is contrasted with (Internet) freedom and the two concepts are played against each other to the detriment of both. This view misses the point.\n¹⁸ See Myriam Dunn Cavelty and Camino Kavanagh, Chapter 5. They differentiate between two notions of cybersecurity: a technical information security approach and a national security-focused approach. Our use of the concept encompasses elements from both conceptions.\n¹⁹ More states have Cybersecurity Strategies now.

The Cybersecurity Strategy for Germany defines cybersecurity as ‘IT security of the networked or network-capable information technology systems in cyberspace’. IT security is understood to be ensuring the ‘IT security is [...] the state in which the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and availability of information and IT are protected by appropriate measures.’²⁷ This definition is very technology-oriented and too short-sighted in light of how cybersecurity is practically perceived by business and society. The security on the Internet and of the Internet cannot simply be equated with the security of systems and data. To view cybersecurity correctly, it must be regarded holistically. Each meaningful cybersecurity concept should be comprehensive and value-based: a commitment to a stable, secure, resilient, fully functional, open and free Internet and its protection against state and private attacks of any kind.²⁸\n## 3. PROTECTING CYBERSECURITY LIES IN THE COMMON INTEREST OF ALL STATES\n## 3.1 Cybersecurity and the Common Interest\nIn 1998, experts working on behalf of the UNESCO posed the question whether the ‘United Nations General Assembly [could] affirm the principle of regarding cyberspace as “the common heritage of humanity”’²⁹ and thus safeguard it. They failed to answer the question, which was well enough because it was the wrong one. It is not ‘cyberspace’ we should concern ourselves with, but rather the Internet itself; and rather than using the concept of common heritage of mankind, which presupposes a certain historical stability the Internet does not have, we rather need to establish why protecting the Internet lies in the global common interest.\nDuring the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), which the United Nations convened in 2003 and 2005 to establish a normative trajectory for the Internet, states affirmed their common desire and commitment to build an information society that is ‘people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented’ and in which individuals, communities and peoples can:\nMatthias C. Kettemann and Martin Müller - 9781035308514\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/03/2025 03:25:18PM\nvia University College London (UCL)\n'This is not a drill'\nachieve their full potential in promoting their sustainable development and improving their quality of life premised on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and respecting fully and upholding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.³⁰\nWe have here a first clear answer to the question about what ‘vision’ the international community pursues regarding the impact of the Internet.\nClearly, achieving world peace and international security (as enshrined in the UN Charter), ensuring human development (as codified in the Millennium Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals) and respecting, protecting and implementing human rights (as normatively ordered in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)) are in the global common interest. Different normative orders within international law contribute towards achieving these common interests. By establishing finalities for a normative order, such as WSIS has done for Internet governance, the normative development of that order is anchored in the finality of ensuring the common interest, lying in peace, security and development. Creating a people-centred, development-oriented information society is thus part of the broader normative commitment in international law to protecting the common interest of ensuring world peace, international security and development.\nWe have thus established that there is a global common interest in ensuring a people-centred and development-oriented information society. But is protecting cybersecurity and thus the Internet’s integrity essential for reaching these goals? UN Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression, Frank La Rue, in a groundbreaking report on the impact of the Internet on freedom of expression, described the Internet as a ‘catalyst for individuals to exercise their right to freedom of opinion and expression’. Freedom of expression on the Internet itself is a ‘facilitator of the realisation of a range of other human rights’.³¹ The multiple challenges that the Internet brings for human rights notwithstanding,³² the absence of the Internet (or of an Internet without cybersecurity) would seriously challenge the realization of human rights. There are important corollary rights that are premised upon exercising free speech on the Internet. These include the freedom of assembly and association online, the right to (digital) education and the right of access to digital knowledge.³³ From all these rights we can also derive a right to access to online information and communication, which is crucial for human development. Similar arguments have been voiced by courts and international organizations.³⁴\n³⁰ WSIS, Geneva Declaration of Principles, WSIS-03/GENEVA/DOC/4-E (12 December 2003) para. 1.\n³¹ F.

It is similarly a facilitator for human security.\nIn the same vein, the 2013 report of the UN GGE determined that the application of norms derived from existing international law is ‘essential’ to minimize risks to world peace and international security and stability.³⁵ Viewed in the context of information technology challenges, cybersecurity is now one aspect of ‘world peace’.³⁶ When analysing the protection of cybersecurity under international law, the GGE report from 2015,³⁷ and reiterated in 2021,³⁸ which was adopted in consensus by a representative group of governmental experts, is very helpful,³⁹ stating, inter alia, that the international community aspires to regulate the Internet in a peaceful manner ‘for the common good of mankind’.\n## 3.2 Ensuing International Legal Duties\nProtecting cybersecurity is a common interest of all states. This community interest is not an aggregate of the individual sets of interests; rather, it lies at their intersection. If a protected interest is part of the community interest, this entails consequences relevant to international law. States are therefore responsible to the international community with regard to cybersecurity according to their judicial authority over critical infrastructures pertinent to it.⁴⁰\nTo the extent that a state controls Critical Internet Resources (CIRs), it has to exercise this jurisdiction mindful of threats to cybersecurity and especially the security of these CIRs in a manner that ensures the common interest. To the extent that national politics (and policies) can impact the Internet negatively, a state has to refrain from their formulation and implementation. A state’s sovereignty is reduced because of the limits the protection of the Internet as a common interest lays upon him. The United States, as former delegated manager of the CIRs, therefore only had ‘custodial sovereignty’.⁴¹ This implied that the United States had to enter into consultations with other states with regard to the management of CIRs and make sure that the management was transparent and accountable, ideally to the international community\n³⁵ Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, A/68/98 (24 June 2013) para. 16.\n³⁶ Ibid.\n³⁷ GGE Report (2015), n. 11 above.\n³⁸ Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, A/76/135 (14 July 2021) ('GGE Report (2021)') para. 5, 71(e).\n³⁹ Members: Belarus, Brazil, China, Colombia, Egypt, Estonia, France, Germany, Ghana, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Russian Federation, Spain, United Kingdom and United States.\n⁴⁰ For documentation of the reports of individual member states, see the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, www.un.org/disarmament/topics/informationsecurity.\n⁴¹ See W.

In assessing whether politics may impact the Internet negatively, it makes sense to suggest the precautionary principle as a guide to decision-making.⁴⁴\nA second consequence is that humankind – that is all actors making up the international community, and not only states – have a legitimate interest in making sure that all other actors protect the Internet (or at least do not actively harm it). Though sovereignty-oriented states⁴⁵ have suggested exclusive sovereignty over national Internet segments, the character of the Internet, as protected by international law as a common interest, limits their sovereignty. The 2005 Tunis Agenda, though valuable in its description of the normative goals of the information society, still lays down that ‘policy authority for internet-related public policy issues’ is a ‘sovereign right of States’.⁴⁶ This needs to be qualified in light of a common interest approach to protecting the Internet in that the states’ policy authority is no longer an exclusively sovereign right, but part and parcel of their sovereignty, to be exercised in the common interest. What sovereignty they have over Internet-related resources has to be understood in light of changing circumstances and the importance of the pursuance of common interests. As far as international law extends to non-state actors, these are also under obligation to support the pursuance, by state actors, of the global interest in safeguarding the Internet’s integrity. This means, for example, that there is an international law-based duty, via the Ruggie Principles,⁴⁷ for companies to respect human rights and rights of victims of business-related abuses and their right to access to remedies.\n⁴² NTIA, NTIA Finds IANA Stewardship Transition Proposal Meets Criteria to Complete Privatization (9 June 2016), available at www.ntia.doc.gov/press-release/2016/iana-stewardship-transition-proposal-meets-criteria-complete-privatization.\n⁴³ ICANN IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG), Proposal to Transition the Stewardship of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Functions from the US Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to the Global Multistakeholder Community (March 2016), available at www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/iana-stewardship-transition-proposal-10mar16-en.pdf; and ICANN CCWG Accountability, Supplemental Final Proposal on Work Stream 1 Recommendations (February 2016), available at www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/ccwg-accountability-supp-proposal-work-stream-1-recs-23 feb16-en.pdf.\n⁴⁴ See the work of the Council of Europe’s Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (MC-S-CI), www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/media/MC-S-CI/default_en.asp, especially its report International and Multi-stakeholder Co-operation on Cross-border Internet (2010).\n⁴⁵ See International Code of Conduct for Information Security, Annex to the letter dated 12 September 2011 from the Permanent Representatives of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, A/66/359 (14 September 2011).\n⁴⁶ WSIS, Tunis Agenda (2005) para. 35.\n⁴⁷ See Report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, J.

To that end, the protection of the integrity of the Internet and the guarantee of cybersecurity as a common interest are essential.\n## 4. CYBERSECURITY AND INTERNATIONAL LAW\n## 4.1 International Law and the Internet\nInternational law is the only area of law with which global (public) goods can be managed and global public interest protected.49 The ubiquity of the technology underlying the Internet, which is not restricted by national borders, renders strictly single-state regulation largely ineffective. International law is needed to legitimately and effectively ensure cybersecurity in the common interest of all states. This is not a new insight.50 Without legitimate and effective protection of cybersecurity under international law, individuals and societies cannot develop to their full potential. A similar self-commitment to an international law-based Internet policy was presented by the European Commission in 2014.51\n48 The question regarding its role: see B.

Although treaties provide (legal) certainty (especially in the eyes of powerful states or states relying on traditional sovereignty concepts),⁵⁴ bilateral cybersecurity treaties usually do not live up to the complexity of the issue due to the universality of the Internet, while multilateral treaties can only be attained through lengthy negotiation processes with an uncertain outcome.⁵⁵ There is still no treaty on cybersecurity, though.⁵⁶ Binding international law on cybersecurity can therefore only be derived to date from customary international law and the principles of international law.\n## 4.3 Cybersecurity and Customary International Law\nIn the Tunis Agenda, adopted at the UN World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), and in the Tunis Commitment (2005) (building on the Geneva documents of 2003), the signatory states of the world committed themselves to a:\npeople-centered, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society, premised on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, international law and multilateralism, and respecting fully and upholding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights⁵⁷\n⁵² The scope of this study does not allow for going into detail on all applicable principles of international law.

Communicators, recipients and the contents of communications are protected by Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), parts of which are based on customary law. Along with these state obligations based on individual human rights (prohibiting states from interfering with certain communicative rights), positive obligations related to Internet infrastructure can also be derived from the state obligations to provide protection and assurance pertaining to information- and communication-related rights. States are therefore obliged to ensure the sustainability and security of the networks in order to allow individuals to realize their human rights.\nParticularly relevant to ensuring and promoting cybersecurity are the following principles of international law,⁶⁰ some of which have been translated into treaty law in the UN Charter, are protected under customary international law or are recognized as part of the general principles of international law: sovereign equality, the ban on aggression and intervention, peaceful settlement of disputes, the protection of human rights, the cooperation principle (which draws on the principle of good neighbourliness (‘no harm’) and the precautionary principle (‘due diligence’)).\nThe principle of sovereign equality (UN Charter, Article 2(1)) is a key principle of international law. As a ‘pivotal principle’⁶¹ it is also of special importance for cybersecurity. Each state has jurisdiction and power over its territory and over the ICT infrastructure located there; this also means, however, that it bears a responsibility to ensure that no attacks against other states or institutions, which would infringe on international law, are organized or carried out from its territory.\nIn addition, the non-intervention principle (UN Charter, Article 2(7)) can be brought to fruition: an intense damage to Internet functionality in another state (e.g. by cyber-attacks) could constitute an intervention, although attribution problems will regularly arise.⁶² Only some of the attacks originating from the territory of a state represent an ‘intervention’ in terms of international law, because most attacks will be attributable to non-governmental protagonists or to protagonists whose association with governmental agencies cannot be proven.⁶³\n⁵⁸ Ibid. no. 3.\n⁵⁹ WSIS, Tunis Agenda for the Information Society, WSIS-05/TUNIS/DOC/6 (Rev. 1)-G (18 November 2005) no. 31.\n⁶⁰ GGE Report (2015), n. 11 above, para. 26.\n⁶¹ Samantha Besson, ‘Sovereignty’ in Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), MPEPIL (2011) para. 1.\n⁶² Sven-Hendrik Schulze, Cyber-‘War’, Testfall der Staatenverantwortlichkeit (Tübingen: Mohr, 2015).\n⁶³ See GGE Report (2015), n. 11 above: ‘the indication that an ICT activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or the ICT infrastructure of a State may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that State. The Group noted that the accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated’ (ibid. para. 28(f)).\nMatthias C. Kettemann and Martin Müller - 9781035308514\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/03/2025 03:25:18PM\nvia University College London (UCL)\n'This is not a drill'\nThe ban on aggression (UN Charter, Article 2(4)) prohibits states from using measures of power beyond simple ‘intervention’ (the former being stated in the non-intervention principle). In the context of the Internet, this Article could only be applied to especially serious cases of cyber-attacks with substantial kinetic effects.\nThe principle of peaceful settlement of disputes is relevant to cybersecurity insofar as any state has the duty, in the event of an incident, to first determine the facts and to collect evidence for attribution of a breach of international law to a particular state. Even if this succeeds, peaceful means of dispute settlement should first be sought.\nThe principle of the protection of human rights is a fundamental principle of international law that is also relevant to cybersecurity. What is problematic under international law are attempts by a state to enforce cybersecurity through an excessive control of the Internet (such as setting up and using surveillance capabilities or government screening of all Internet communication).\nThe principle of good neighbourliness (UN Charter, Article 74), or ‘no harm’ principle, can be considered as a global principle in the Internet era. Originally only relevant in terms of the relationship with adjacent states, the principle has been gradually extended.^^ In the Corfu Channel case, the International Court of Justice described the principle as ‘every state’s obligation not to knowingly allow its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states’.^^ The ‘no harm’ principle has its roots in the Trail Smelter^^ and Lake Lanoux^^ cases. It was formulated in Principle 21 of the Stockholm Declaration (1972)^^ and Principle 2 of the Rio Declaration (1992):^^ signatory states are committed ‘to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction’. This can easily be applied to other areas in analogy to the environment.\nThe obligation to prevent cross-border damage has crystallized into customary law. Contractual confirmation can be found in Article 194(2) of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea^^ and Article 20(1) of the ASEAN Agreement on the Conservation of Nature and\nMatthias C. Kettemann and Martin Müller - 9781035308514\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/03/2025 03:25:18PM\nvia University College London (UCL)\nResearch handbook on human rights and digital technology\nNatural Resources (1985). Most recently, the ICJ confirmed in the Nuclear Weapons case⁷¹ that the threat to the environment is ‘no abstraction but represents the living space, the quality of life and the very health of human beings, including generations unborn’. In accordance with the ‘no harm’ principle, no state may utilize its dominion in such a manner that would cause damage to other states. In the preventive dimension of the ‘no harm’ principle, a state must take measures to prevent such hazards. Among other things, a commitment to an appropriate infrastructure, the development of emergency plans and the establishment of an international crisis cooperation structure (and culture) can be construed from this.\nThe precautionary principle (‘due diligence’) is of special importance for cybersecurity. First, the due diligence principle entails information and consultation obligations.⁷² In the scientific world, it is controversial as to what extent the precautionary principle has a ‘due diligence’ dimension or whether the precautionary obligations of states are covered in practice by the ‘no harm’ principle. The principle of due diligence was also applied in the field of combating terrorism and the financing of terrorism.⁷³\n## 4.4 Shift Towards Due Diligence\nWith some justification, normative principles for the regulation of cybersecurity can therefore be derived from the principle of due diligence. As a result, it is the responsibility of states, inter alia, ensuing from this principle, to prevent cyber-attacks originating from their own territory and to (proactively) establish a legal system that ensures and fosters cybersecurity.⁷⁴ This can be fulfilled, for instance, by ‘passing stringent criminal laws, conducting vigorous investigations, prosecuting attackers, and, during the investigation and prosecution, cooperating with the victim-states of cyberattacks that originated from within their borders’.⁷⁵\nIn its preventive dimension, the due diligence principle helps to identify the obligations of states with regard to cybersecurity, particularly with regard to cybercrime, global cooperation and establishment of capacities. Cybersecurity due diligence was described as part of customary international law, whereby particularly the following preventive duties have emerged as recognized obligations under international law:\n- that governments and other stakeholders bolster cybersecurity and develop cybersecurity strategies to protect crucial infrastructures;⁷⁶\nMatthias C. Kettemann and Martin Müller - 9781035308514\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/03/2025 03:25:18PM\nvia University College London (UCL)\n'This is not a drill' 123\n- that states (and other relevant stakeholders) work together more closely in the fight against cybercrime and cyberterrorism,⁷⁷ and that they ratify conventions such as the Convention on Cybercrime of the Council of Europe;⁷⁸\n- that states conclude treaties promoting cooperation between their police authorities;⁷⁹ and\n- that states establish confidence-building measures and increase the level of information sharing, both generally as well as (and especially) in the event of cybersecurity-related incidents.⁸⁰\nConfidence-building measures are more extensive than obligations under international law ensuing from the duty of cooperation.⁸¹ They are relevant to the evolution of legal norms, however, insofar as they indicate the direction of how obligations under international law are developing.⁸²\n# 5. EMBRACING CYBERSECURITY NORMS IN INTERNATIONAL LAW\nAny attempt to embrace cybersecurity in international law must be preceded by the recognition of the significance of the multi-stakeholder approach in the normative development of international Internet law.⁸³ Since the process of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) began, with just a few exceptions, states have been committing to the integration of all stakeholders in the normative processes relevant to Internet regulation. The multi-stakeholder approach is put into practice in the development and application of instruments and processes\nTechnologies'; 57/239 of 20 December 2002 on the 'Creation of a Global Culture of Cybersecurity' and 58/199 of 23 December 2003 on 'The Creation of a Global Culture of Cybersecurity and the Protection of Critical Information Infrastructures'; 53/70 of 4 December 1998, 54/49 of 1 December 1999, 55/28 of 20 November 2000, 56/19 of 29 November 2001, 57/53 of 22 November 2002, 58/32 of 8 December 2003, 59/61 of 3 December 2004, 60/45 of 8 December 2005, 61/54 of 6 December 2006, 62/17 of 5 December 2007 and 63/37 of 2 December 2008 on 'Developments with respect to Information Technologies in the Context of International Security').\n⁷⁷ See UNODC, Resolution 22/8 on 'Promoting Technical Assistance and Capacity Building to Strengthen National Measures and International Cooperation Against Cybercrime', UNODC/ CCPCJ/2013/RES/22/8, para. 4.\n⁷⁸ See GGE Report (2013), n. 10 above, para. 22.\n⁷⁹ Ibid. para. 22.\n⁸⁰ Ibid. para. 26 et seq.\n⁸¹ Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, Decision No. 1202, 'OSCE Confidence-Building Measures to Reduce the Risks of Conflict Stemming from the Use of Information and Communication Technologies', PC.DEC/1202 (10 March 2016).\n⁸² See Katharina Ziolkowski, 'Confidence Building Measures for Cyberspace' in Katharina Ziolkowski (ed.), *Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy* (Tallinn: NATO CCD COE Publications, 2013) 533–64.\n⁸³ See Matthias C.

They can only offer the opportunity for states (or other stakeholders) to accomplish preparatory work relevant to the normative process. Jointly discussing 'norms' can be useful, because common values will be expressed already in the process of discussion and the positions taken by participating states serve as indications of their attitudes toward an international juridification of cybersecurity.\nA promising approach for embracing binding cybersecurity norms in international law in the long term is the negotiation and adoption of an international treaty. It remains the 'gold standard' of international law and is the most important authoritative source of law. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which entered into force on 4 November 2016, has shown that even today international treaties covering complex topics such as regulations relating to global public goods (for example, cybersecurity as a prerequisite for a well-functioning Internet) can be successfully concluded.\n# 6. SUMMARY\nIn the light of the importance of the Internet for states, business and society, cybersecurity – as a prerequisite for a reliably functioning and secure Internet – has become a global community interest which needs protection. The technologicalization and informationalization of many key infrastructure provision functions and of many industry control systems open up new vulnerabilities within states that can threaten, if an attack is substantial, international peace and security. Similarly, the increased use of mobile devices, Cloud computing and the use of social networks increases the vulnerability of citizens to acts of cybercrime.\nCybersecurity is a key functional condition for an era defined by information and communications technology. A secure Internet lies in the interest of each individual state and also collectively in the interest of all states of the world as a global community. Cybersecurity thus lies in the global common interest. It has a key security interest for which all the states of the world bear separate and common responsibility. This responsibility must be met through an application of the principles and processes of international law.\nInternational law is to be fully applied to the Internet, including with regard to regulating cybersecurity. Customary international law and the general principles of international law particularly restrict (and define) national Internet policy. Consequently, each state has protection obligations vis-à-vis the international community – to avert threats to the stability, integrity and functionality of the Internet – which can be derived from customary international law. At the same time, states may not restrict freedom on the Internet without limitation under the\nMatthias C.

The global, cross-border Internet traffic may not be adversely affected or in any way destabilized by states due to national legislation and policy.\nIn addition to post-incident information and communication requirements, preventive obligations also arise from the due diligence principle and the tenets of good neighbourliness and can in part only be met in cooperation with nongovernmental stakeholders. This binding cooperation principle of customary international law provides mandatory guidance to states in their development of strategies for promoting cybersecurity. But what complicates the situation is that in responding to cybersecurity threats, states are often fully dependent on private entities and their security experts.\nThe May 2017 WannaCry Ransomware attack, for example, shows how vulnerabilities are caused by a number of factors, including companies who fail to provide updates or no longer service vulnerabilities, affected companies that have slow patch cycles, secret services that stockpile vulnerabilities, and states that do not force essential service providers (like healthcare companies) to ensure that their systems are stable and secure.\nAs the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence concluded with regard to the WannaCry Ransomware attacks:\nCampaigns like WannaCry should remind decision-makers of the importance of baseline cyber security, since in this case the victims could have prevented the spread of ransomware by fairly simple security measures.^^\nBe it baseline cybersecurity or more advanced forms that are necessary for states to implement in order to meet their obligations under international law: the debate on how best to ensure a stable and resilient Internet for all is far from over – and it is international law that provides the impetus, frame and objective of the debate.\nThe normative frame of cybersecurity and the real-world application of it are not yet stable enough to ensure convincingly that honest mistakes, serious crimes and international cyber-attacks are effectively stopped. This should worry us. As Dutch Ruppersberger, a long-time Democratic US Congressman from Maryland, was quoted in 2013 by Rolling Stone magazine as saying: ‘People ask me all the time, “What keeps you up at night?” And I say, “Spicy Mexican food, weapons of mass destruction, and cyber attacks”’.^^ Changing one’s diet might help with the first issue, arms reduction and arms control regimes with the second, and an international law-based global cybersecurity regime with the third: less chili then, and a more nuanced normative order of cybersecurity with clear commitments for each stakeholder.\nMatthias C.

This is not a drill.’ This emergency alert was sent out to thousands of Hawaiians on 13 January 2018, at 8:08 a.m. local time.² Luckily, it turned out to be not a drill, but rather the result of human error. An employee, it appeared, had pushed the wrong button (twice). The reactions on social media and in real life – the media was full of stories of scared Hawaiians hiding in garages – tells us a lot about our times both in terms of international security (ballistic missiles threats were a Cold War staple) and in terms of cybersecurity: Human errors can cause real damages – and humans are an integral part of cybersecurity.\nThis was the example on how cybersecurity issues are interlinked to general security issues from the first edition. Fast forward 5 years later, a similar example has occurred: During the attack by Hamas terrorists against Israel in October 2023, a hacktivist group named ‘AnonGhost’ managed to exploit flaws in the app ‘Red Alert’, which is used among others in Israel as a missile alert service.³ Similar to the false alarm sent out to Hawaiians, the hackers warned users of an upcoming nuclear attack. Dissimilar, however, this time there was no human error, but an attempt by malicious actors to influence an ongoing conflict.\nBe it online or offline,⁴ be it in the kinetic world or in cyberspace, we need norms – and have always needed them. ‘In the long march of mankind from the cave to the computer’, as Malcolm N.

Political and legal approaches to preventing cyberwar⁶ and cybercrime⁷ such as the negotiations on a UN Cybercrime Convention⁸ have attracted considerable attention internationally. This study shows that the Internet is critical infrastructure in itself and also functionally essential for other critical infrastructure. The UN General Assembly, in Resolution 64/211 of 21 December 2009, promoted the creation of a global culture of cybersecurity⁹ and expressed concerns in light of growing threats to the reliable functioning of the Internet (technically: ‘of critical information infrastructures and to the integrity of the information carried over those’). These affect ‘domestic, national and international welfare’. The Resolution affirms that states are obliged to deal systematically with these threats and coordinate both with national stakeholders and internationally with the goal of facilitating the achievement of cybersecurity.\nThe 2013 Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) report underlined that applying norms derived from ‘existing international law relevant to the use of ICTs by States is an essential measure to reduce risks to international peace, security and stability’. The Charter of the United Nations is applicable to the whole gamut of socio-economic activity on the Internet and thus ‘essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment’.¹⁰ Applying international law to the Internet lies in the common interest and safeguarding the Internet as such also lies in the common interest because a stable, secure and functional Internet is essential for international security. Building on this consensus, the 2015¹¹ report of the GGE again confirmed that international law, the UN Charter and ⁵ Malcolm N.

Common criminals continue to misuse the Internet both for online variants of common scams and for Internet-specific (technology-based) attacks. The size of monetary loss is difficult to evaluate but an often-quoted estimate (e.g. by the European Commission)¹⁵ by Cybersecurity Ventures expects losses of around US$ 8 trillion for the year 2023 worldwide.¹⁶ This threat requires international cooperation. At the same time, some criminal misuses of the Internet are not direct threats to the Internet’s integrity, as criminal networks rely on the Internet to conduct their activities. But other attacks, including disruptive attacks or others not linked to monetary gain (such as attacks to cause social unrest in the introductory Israel example) can amount to substantial threats to cybersecurity and the Internet’s functionality.\nDifferent levels of Internet security awareness and capabilities globally matter to all states because of the interconnectedness of ICTs and the networked nature of the Internet. ‘These vulnerabilities are amplified’, the UN’s Group of Governmental Experts on IT and Security complained in 2013, ‘by disparities in national law, regulations and practices related to the use of ICTs’.¹⁷ Only international cooperation in the protection of the Internet can help meet these challenges. The role of the Internet’s integrity in contributing to international security and the threats posed by international cybercrime are further reasons why ensuring cybersecurity and protecting the integrity of the Internet lies in the common interest.\nThis chapter examines the protection of cybersecurity under international law and develops a future-oriented approach to increasing cybersecurity through international law. After outlining my concept of cybersecurity (2) and explaining why protecting cybersecurity lies in the common interest of all states (3), I will outline which international legal norms protect cybersecurity (4). After that, I will identify approaches to better protect cybersecurity in international law (5).

TOWARDS A COMPREHENSIVE CONCEPT OF CYBERSECURITY Cybersecurity is defined very broadly by some states and covers risks and threats such as cyberwarfare, cyberterrorism, cybercrime and cyber-espionage.¹⁸ There is no doubt that cybersecurity is a crucial part of national, domestic, security, foreign and defence policy.¹⁹ As a central theme of Internet policy,²⁰ cybersecurity is closely linked with the stability, robustness, resilience and functionality of the Internet.²¹ Cybersecurity can be threatened by cybercrime and cyberterrorism, but also by a lack of legal and technical cooperation between states and a lack of preventive measures, such as developing crisis intervention centres and teams, as well as transnational crisis communication structures for cyber incidents.\nThe major 2017 WannaCry²² and NotPetya²³ ransomware attacks, for example, were the first world-wide felt examples of how vulnerabilities are caused by a number of factors, including software companies who fail to provide updates or no longer service vulnerabilities, affected companies that have slow patch cycles, secret services that stockpile vulnerabilities, and states that do not force essential service providers (like healthcare companies) to ensure that their systems are stable and secure.²⁴ These issues remain, even if so-called ‘Zero-day vulnerabilities’ occur and are exploited more often.²⁵ Fostering and ensuring cybersecurity are a prerequisite for the stability of national economic processes and the international business and financial system, for transnational communication flows and for the functioning of energy grids, the enforcement of human rights, and the performance of national, regional and international defence infrastructures. Ultimately, cybersecurity is fundamental to the full realization of all human rights.\nIt is too often the case that (cyber)security is contrasted with (Internet) freedom and the two concepts are played against each other to the detriment of both. This view misses the point.\n¹⁸ See Myriam Dunn Cavelty and Camino Kavanagh, Chapter 5. They differentiate between two notions of cybersecurity: a technical information security approach and a national security-focused approach. Our use of the concept encompasses elements from both conceptions.\n¹⁹ More states have Cybersecurity Strategies now.

The Cybersecurity Strategy for Germany defines cybersecurity as ‘IT security of the networked or network-capable information technology systems in cyberspace’. IT security is understood to be ensuring the ‘IT security is [...] the state in which the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and availability of information and IT are protected by appropriate measures.’²⁷ This definition is very technology-oriented and too short-sighted in light of how cybersecurity is practically perceived by business and society. The security on the Internet and of the Internet cannot simply be equated with the security of systems and data. To view cybersecurity correctly, it must be regarded holistically. Each meaningful cybersecurity concept should be comprehensive and value-based: a commitment to a stable, secure, resilient, fully functional, open and free Internet and its protection against state and private attacks of any kind.²⁸ ## 3. PROTECTING CYBERSECURITY LIES IN THE COMMON INTEREST OF ALL STATES ## 3.1 Cybersecurity and the Common Interest In 1998, experts working on behalf of the UNESCO posed the question whether the ‘United Nations General Assembly [could] affirm the principle of regarding cyberspace as “the common heritage of humanity”’²⁹ and thus safeguard it. They failed to answer the question, which was well enough because it was the wrong one. It is not ‘cyberspace’ we should concern ourselves with, but rather the Internet itself; and rather than using the concept of common heritage of mankind, which presupposes a certain historical stability the Internet does not have, we rather need to establish why protecting the Internet lies in the global common interest.\nDuring the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), which the United Nations convened in 2003 and 2005 to establish a normative trajectory for the Internet, states affirmed their common desire and commitment to build an information society that is ‘people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented’ and in which individuals, communities and peoples can: Matthias C. Kettemann and Martin Müller - 9781035308514 Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/03/2025 03:25:18PM via University College London (UCL) 'This is not a drill' achieve their full potential in promoting their sustainable development and improving their quality of life premised on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and respecting fully and upholding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.³⁰ We have here a first clear answer to the question about what ‘vision’ the international community pursues regarding the impact of the Internet.\nClearly, achieving world peace and international security (as enshrined in the UN Charter), ensuring human development (as codified in the Millennium Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals) and respecting, protecting and implementing human rights (as normatively ordered in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)) are in the global common interest. Different normative orders within international law contribute towards achieving these common interests. By establishing finalities for a normative order, such as WSIS has done for Internet governance, the normative development of that order is anchored in the finality of ensuring the common interest, lying in peace, security and development. Creating a people-centred, development-oriented information society is thus part of the broader normative commitment in international law to protecting the common interest of ensuring world peace, international security and development.\nWe have thus established that there is a global common interest in ensuring a people-centred and development-oriented information society. But is protecting cybersecurity and thus the Internet’s integrity essential for reaching these goals? UN Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression, Frank La Rue, in a groundbreaking report on the impact of the Internet on freedom of expression, described the Internet as a ‘catalyst for individuals to exercise their right to freedom of opinion and expression’. Freedom of expression on the Internet itself is a ‘facilitator of the realisation of a range of other human rights’.³¹ The multiple challenges that the Internet brings for human rights notwithstanding,³² the absence of the Internet (or of an Internet without cybersecurity) would seriously challenge the realization of human rights. There are important corollary rights that are premised upon exercising free speech on the Internet. These include the freedom of assembly and association online, the right to (digital) education and the right of access to digital knowledge.³³ From all these rights we can also derive a right to access to online information and communication, which is crucial for human development. Similar arguments have been voiced by courts and international organizations.³⁴ ³⁰ WSIS, Geneva Declaration of Principles, WSIS-03/GENEVA/DOC/4-E (12 December 2003) para. 1.\n³¹ F.

It is similarly a facilitator for human security.\nIn the same vein, the 2013 report of the UN GGE determined that the application of norms derived from existing international law is ‘essential’ to minimize risks to world peace and international security and stability.³⁵ Viewed in the context of information technology challenges, cybersecurity is now one aspect of ‘world peace’.³⁶ When analysing the protection of cybersecurity under international law, the GGE report from 2015,³⁷ and reiterated in 2021,³⁸ which was adopted in consensus by a representative group of governmental experts, is very helpful,³⁹ stating, inter alia, that the international community aspires to regulate the Internet in a peaceful manner ‘for the common good of mankind’.\n## 3.2 Ensuing International Legal Duties Protecting cybersecurity is a common interest of all states. This community interest is not an aggregate of the individual sets of interests; rather, it lies at their intersection. If a protected interest is part of the community interest, this entails consequences relevant to international law. States are therefore responsible to the international community with regard to cybersecurity according to their judicial authority over critical infrastructures pertinent to it.⁴⁰ To the extent that a state controls Critical Internet Resources (CIRs), it has to exercise this jurisdiction mindful of threats to cybersecurity and especially the security of these CIRs in a manner that ensures the common interest. To the extent that national politics (and policies) can impact the Internet negatively, a state has to refrain from their formulation and implementation. A state’s sovereignty is reduced because of the limits the protection of the Internet as a common interest lays upon him. The United States, as former delegated manager of the CIRs, therefore only had ‘custodial sovereignty’.⁴¹ This implied that the United States had to enter into consultations with other states with regard to the management of CIRs and make sure that the management was transparent and accountable, ideally to the international community ³⁵ Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, A/68/98 (24 June 2013) para. 16.\n³⁶ Ibid.\n³⁷ GGE Report (2015), n. 11 above.\n³⁸ Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, A/76/135 (14 July 2021) ('GGE Report (2021)') para. 5, 71(e).\n³⁹ Members: Belarus, Brazil, China, Colombia, Egypt, Estonia, France, Germany, Ghana, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Russian Federation, Spain, United Kingdom and United States.\n⁴⁰ For documentation of the reports of individual member states, see the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, www.un.org/disarmament/topics/informationsecurity.\n⁴¹ See W.

In assessing whether politics may impact the Internet negatively, it makes sense to suggest the precautionary principle as a guide to decision-making.⁴⁴ A second consequence is that humankind – that is all actors making up the international community, and not only states – have a legitimate interest in making sure that all other actors protect the Internet (or at least do not actively harm it). Though sovereignty-oriented states⁴⁵ have suggested exclusive sovereignty over national Internet segments, the character of the Internet, as protected by international law as a common interest, limits their sovereignty. The 2005 Tunis Agenda, though valuable in its description of the normative goals of the information society, still lays down that ‘policy authority for internet-related public policy issues’ is a ‘sovereign right of States’.⁴⁶ This needs to be qualified in light of a common interest approach to protecting the Internet in that the states’ policy authority is no longer an exclusively sovereign right, but part and parcel of their sovereignty, to be exercised in the common interest. What sovereignty they have over Internet-related resources has to be understood in light of changing circumstances and the importance of the pursuance of common interests. As far as international law extends to non-state actors, these are also under obligation to support the pursuance, by state actors, of the global interest in safeguarding the Internet’s integrity. This means, for example, that there is an international law-based duty, via the Ruggie Principles,⁴⁷ for companies to respect human rights and rights of victims of business-related abuses and their right to access to remedies.\n⁴² NTIA, NTIA Finds IANA Stewardship Transition Proposal Meets Criteria to Complete Privatization (9 June 2016), available at www.ntia.doc.gov/press-release/2016/iana-stewardship-transition-proposal-meets-criteria-complete-privatization.\n⁴³ ICANN IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG), Proposal to Transition the Stewardship of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Functions from the US Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to the Global Multistakeholder Community, available at www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/iana-stewardship-transition-proposal-10mar16-en.pdf; and ICANN CCWG Accountability, Supplemental Final Proposal on Work Stream 1 Recommendations, available at www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/ccwg-accountability-supp-proposal-work-stream-1-recs-23 feb16-en.pdf.\n⁴⁴ See the work of the Council of Europe’s Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (MC-S-CI), www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/media/MC-S-CI/default_en.asp, especially its report International and Multi-stakeholder Co-operation on Cross-border Internet (2010).\n⁴⁵ See International Code of Conduct for Information Security, Annex to the letter dated 12 September 2011 from the Permanent Representatives of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, A/66/359 (14 September 2011).\n⁴⁶ WSIS, Tunis Agenda (2005) para. 35.\n⁴⁷ See Report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, J.

To that end, the protection of the integrity of the Internet and the guarantee of cybersecurity as a common interest are essential.\n## 4. CYBERSECURITY AND INTERNATIONAL LAW ## 4.1 International Law and the Internet International law is the only area of law with which global (public) goods can be managed and global public interest protected.49 The ubiquity of the technology underlying the Internet, which is not restricted by national borders, renders strictly single-state regulation largely ineffective. International law is needed to legitimately and effectively ensure cybersecurity in the common interest of all states. This is not a new insight.50 Without legitimate and effective protection of cybersecurity under international law, individuals and societies cannot develop to their full potential. A similar self-commitment to an international law-based Internet policy was presented by the European Commission in 2014.51 Matthias C.

Although treaties provide (legal) certainty (especially in the eyes of powerful states or states relying on traditional sovereignty concepts),⁵⁴ bilateral cybersecurity treaties usually do not live up to the complexity of the issue due to the universality of the Internet, while multilateral treaties can only be attained through lengthy negotiation processes with an uncertain outcome.⁵⁵ There is still no treaty on cybersecurity, though.⁵⁶ Binding international law on cybersecurity can therefore only be derived to date from customary international law and the principles of international law.\n## 4.3 Cybersecurity and Customary International Law In the Tunis Agenda, adopted at the UN World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), and in the Tunis Commitment (2005) (building on the Geneva documents of 2003), the signatory states of the world committed themselves to a: people-centered, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society, premised on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, international law and multilateralism, and respecting fully and upholding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights⁵⁷ ⁵² The scope of this study does not allow for going into detail on all applicable principles of international law.

Communicators, recipients and the contents of communications are protected by Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), parts of which are based on customary law. Along with these state obligations based on individual human rights (prohibiting states from interfering with certain communicative rights), positive obligations related to Internet infrastructure can also be derived from the state obligations to provide protection and assurance pertaining to information- and communication-related rights. States are therefore obliged to ensure the sustainability and security of the networks in order to allow individuals to realize their human rights.\nParticularly relevant to ensuring and promoting cybersecurity are the following principles of international law,⁶⁰ some of which have been translated into treaty law in the UN Charter, are protected under customary international law or are recognized as part of the general principles of international law: sovereign equality, the ban on aggression and intervention, peaceful settlement of disputes, the protection of human rights, the cooperation principle (which draws on the principle of good neighbourliness (‘no harm’) and the precautionary principle (‘due diligence’)).\nThe principle of sovereign equality (UN Charter, Article 2(1)) is a key principle of international law. As a ‘pivotal principle’⁶¹ it is also of special importance for cybersecurity. Each state has jurisdiction and power over its territory and over the ICT infrastructure located there; this also means, however, that it bears a responsibility to ensure that no attacks against other states or institutions, which would infringe on international law, are organized or carried out from its territory.\nIn addition, the non-intervention principle (UN Charter, Article 2(7)) can be brought to fruition: an intense damage to Internet functionality in another state (e.g. by cyber-attacks) could constitute an intervention, although attribution problems will regularly arise.⁶² Only some of the attacks originating from the territory of a state represent an ‘intervention’ in terms of international law, because most attacks will be attributable to non-governmental protagonists or to protagonists whose association with governmental agencies cannot be proven.⁶³ ⁵⁸ Ibid. no. 3.\n⁵⁹ WSIS, Tunis Agenda for the Information Society, WSIS-05/TUNIS/DOC/6 (Rev. 1)-G (18 November 2005) no. 31.\n⁶⁰ GGE Report (2015), n. 11 above, para. 26.\n⁶¹ Samantha Besson, ‘Sovereignty’ in Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), MPEPIL (2011) para. 1.\n⁶² Sven-Hendrik Schulze, Cyber-‘War’, Testfall der Staatenverantwortlichkeit (Tübingen: Mohr, 2015).\n⁶³ See GGE Report (2015), n. 11 above: ‘the indication that an ICT activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or the ICT infrastructure of a State may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that State. The Group noted that the accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated’ (ibid. para. 28(f)).\nMatthias C. Kettemann and Martin Müller - 9781035308514 Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/03/2025 03:25:18PM via University College London (UCL) 'This is not a drill' The ban on aggression (UN Charter, Article 2(4)) prohibits states from using measures of power beyond simple ‘intervention’ (the former being stated in the non-intervention principle). In the context of the Internet, this Article could only be applied to especially serious cases of cyber-attacks with substantial kinetic effects.\nThe principle of peaceful settlement of disputes is relevant to cybersecurity insofar as any state has the duty, in the event of an incident, to first determine the facts and to collect evidence for attribution of a breach of international law to a particular state. Even if this succeeds, peaceful means of dispute settlement should first be sought.\nThe principle of the protection of human rights is a fundamental principle of international law that is also relevant to cybersecurity. What is problematic under international law are attempts by a state to enforce cybersecurity through an excessive control of the Internet (such as setting up and using surveillance capabilities or government screening of all Internet communication).\nThe principle of good neighbourliness (UN Charter, Article 74), or ‘no harm’ principle, can be considered as a global principle in the Internet era. Originally only relevant in terms of the relationship with adjacent states, the principle has been gradually extended.^[64]^ In the Corfu Channel case, the International Court of Justice described the principle as ‘every state’s obligation not to knowingly allow its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states’.^[65]^ The ‘no harm’ principle has its roots in the Trail Smelter^[66]^ and Lake Lanoux^[67]^ cases. It was formulated in Principle 21 of the Stockholm Declaration (1972)^[68]^ and Principle 2 of the Rio Declaration (1992):^[69]^ signatory states are committed ‘to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction’. This can easily be applied to other areas in analogy to the environment.\nThe obligation to prevent cross-border damage has crystallized into customary law. Contractual confirmation can be found in Article 194(2) of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea^[70]^ and Article 20(1) of the ASEAN Agreement on the Conservation of Nature and Matthias C. Kettemann and Martin Müller - 9781035308514 Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/03/2025 03:25:18PM via University College London (UCL) Research handbook on human rights and digital technology Natural Resources (1985). Most recently, the ICJ confirmed in the Nuclear Weapons case⁷¹ that the threat to the environment is ‘no abstraction but represents the living space, the quality of life and the very health of human beings, including generations unborn’. In accordance with the ‘no harm’ principle, no state may utilize its dominion in such a manner that would cause damage to other states. In the preventive dimension of the ‘no harm’ principle, a state must take measures to prevent such hazards. Among other things, a commitment to an appropriate infrastructure, the development of emergency plans and the establishment of an international crisis cooperation structure (and culture) can be construed from this.\nThe precautionary principle (‘due diligence’) is of special importance for cybersecurity. First, the due diligence principle entails information and consultation obligations.⁷² In the scientific world, it is controversial as to what extent the precautionary principle has a ‘due diligence’ dimension or whether the precautionary obligations of states are covered in practice by the ‘no harm’ principle. The principle of due diligence was also applied in the field of combating terrorism and the financing of terrorism.⁷³ ## 4.4 Shift Towards Due Diligence With some justification, normative principles for the regulation of cybersecurity can therefore be derived from the principle of due diligence. As a result, it is the responsibility of states, inter alia, ensuing from this principle, to prevent cyber-attacks originating from their own territory and to (proactively) establish a legal system that ensures and fosters cybersecurity.⁷⁴ This can be fulfilled, for instance, by ‘passing stringent criminal laws, conducting vigorous investigations, prosecuting attackers, and, during the investigation and prosecution, cooperating with the victim-states of cyberattacks that originated from within their borders’.⁷⁵ In its preventive dimension, the due diligence principle helps to identify the obligations of states with regard to cybersecurity, particularly with regard to cybercrime, global cooperation and establishment of capacities. Cybersecurity due diligence was described as part of customary international law, whereby particularly the following preventive duties have emerged as recognized obligations under international law: - that governments and other stakeholders bolster cybersecurity and develop cybersecurity strategies to protect crucial infrastructures;⁷⁶ Matthias C.

They can only offer the opportunity for states (or other stakeholders) to accomplish preparatory work relevant to the normative process. Jointly discussing 'norms' can be useful, because common values will be expressed already in the process of discussion[85] and the positions taken by participating states serve as indications of their attitudes toward an international juridification of cybersecurity.\nA promising approach for embracing binding cybersecurity norms in international law in the long term is the negotiation and adoption of an international treaty. It remains the 'gold standard' of international law and is the most important authoritative source of law. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,[86] which entered into force on 4 November 2016, has shown that even today international treaties covering complex topics such as regulations relating to global public goods (for example, cybersecurity as a prerequisite for a well-functioning Internet) can be successfully concluded.\n# 6. SUMMARY In the light of the importance of the Internet for states, business and society, cybersecurity – as a prerequisite for a reliably functioning and secure Internet – has become a global community interest which needs protection. The technologicalization and informationalization of many key infrastructure provision functions and of many industry control systems open up new vulnerabilities within states that can threaten, if an attack is substantial, international peace and security. Similarly, the increased use of mobile devices, Cloud computing and the use of social networks increases the vulnerability of citizens to acts of cybercrime.\nCybersecurity is a key functional condition for an era defined by information and communications technology. A secure Internet lies in the interest of each individual state and also collectively in the interest of all states of the world as a global community. Cybersecurity thus lies in the global common interest. It has a key security interest for which all the states of the world bear separate and common responsibility. This responsibility must be met through an application of the principles and processes of international law.\nInternational law is to be fully applied to the Internet, including with regard to regulating cybersecurity. Customary international law and the general principles of international law particularly restrict (and define) national Internet policy. Consequently, each state has protection obligations vis-à-vis the international community – to avert threats to the stability, integrity and functionality of the Internet – which can be derived from customary international law. At the same time, states may not restrict freedom on the Internet without limitation under the Matthias C. Kettemann and Martin Müller - 9781035308514 Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/03/2025 03:25:18PM via University College London (UCL) 'This is not a drill' 125 guise of imposing ‘security’. The global, cross-border Internet traffic may not be adversely affected or in any way destabilized by states due to national legislation and policy.\nIn addition to post-incident information and communication requirements, preventive obligations also arise from the due diligence principle and the tenets of good neighbourliness and can in part only be met in cooperation with nongovernmental stakeholders. This binding cooperation principle of customary international law provides mandatory guidance to states in their development of strategies for promoting cybersecurity. But what complicates the situation is that in responding to cybersecurity threats, states are often fully dependent on private entities and their security experts.\nThe May 2017 WannaCry Ransomware attack, for example, shows how vulnerabilities are caused by a number of factors, including companies who fail to provide updates or no longer service vulnerabilities, affected companies that have slow patch cycles, secret services that stockpile vulnerabilities, and states that do not force essential service providers (like healthcare companies) to ensure that their systems are stable and secure.\nAs the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence concluded with regard to the WannaCry Ransomware attacks: Campaigns like WannaCry should remind decision-makers of the importance of baseline cyber security, since in this case the victims could have prevented the spread of ransomware by fairly simple security measures.^[87]^ Be it baseline cybersecurity or more advanced forms that are necessary for states to implement in order to meet their obligations under international law: the debate on how best to ensure a stable and resilient Internet for all is far from over – and it is international law that provides the impetus, frame and objective of the debate.\nThe normative frame of cybersecurity and the real-world application of it are not yet stable enough to ensure convincingly that honest mistakes, serious crimes and international cyber-attacks are effectively stopped. This should worry us. As Dutch Ruppersberger, a long-time Democratic US Congressman from Maryland, was quoted in 2013 by Rolling Stone magazine as saying: ‘People ask me all the time, “What keeps you up at night?” And I say, “Spicy Mexican food, weapons of mass destruction, and cyber attacks”’.^[88]^ Changing one’s diet might help with the first issue, arms reduction and arms control regimes with the second, and an international law-based global cybersecurity regime with the third: less chili then, and a more nuanced normative order of cybersecurity with clear commitments for each stakeholder.\nMatthias C.

TOWARDS A COMPREHENSIVE CONCEPT OF CYBERSECURITY\n\nCybersecurity is defined very broadly by some states and covers risks and threats such as cyberwarfare, cyberterrorism, cybercrime and cyber-espionage.¹⁸ There is no doubt that cybersecurity is a crucial part of national, domestic, security, foreign and defence policy.¹⁹ As a central theme of Internet policy,²⁰ cybersecurity is closely linked with the stability, robustness, resilience and functionality of the Internet.²¹ Cybersecurity can be threatened by cybercrime and cyberterrorism, but also by a lack of legal and technical cooperation between states and a lack of preventive measures, such as developing crisis intervention centres and teams, as well as transnational crisis communication structures for cyber incidents.\nThe major 2017 WannaCry²² and NotPetya²³ ransomware attacks, for example, were the first world-wide felt examples of how vulnerabilities are caused by a number of factors, including software companies who fail to provide updates or no longer service vulnerabilities, affected companies that have slow patch cycles, secret services that stockpile vulnerabilities, and states that do not force essential service providers (like healthcare companies) to ensure that their systems are stable and secure.²⁴ These issues remain, even if so-called ‘Zero-day vulnerabilities’ occur and are exploited more often.²⁵\nFostering and ensuring cybersecurity are a prerequisite for the stability of national economic processes and the international business and financial system, for transnational communication flows and for the functioning of energy grids, the enforcement of human rights, and the performance of national, regional and international defence infrastructures. Ultimately, cybersecurity is fundamental to the full realization of all human rights.\nIt is too often the case that (cyber)security is contrasted with (Internet) freedom and the two concepts are played against each other to the detriment of both. This view misses the point.\n¹⁸ See Myriam Dunn Cavelty and Camino Kavanagh, Chapter 5. They differentiate between two notions of cybersecurity: a technical information security approach and a national security-focused approach. Our use of the concept encompasses elements from both conceptions.\n¹⁹ More states have Cybersecurity Strategies now.

The Cybersecurity Strategy for Germany defines cybersecurity as ‘IT security of the networked or network-capable information technology systems in cyberspace’. IT security is understood to be ensuring the ‘IT security is [...] the state in which the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and availability of information and IT are protected by appropriate measures.’²⁷ This definition is very technology-oriented and too short-sighted in light of how cybersecurity is practically perceived by business and society. The security on the Internet and of the Internet cannot simply be equated with the security of systems and data. To view cybersecurity correctly, it must be regarded holistically. Each meaningful cybersecurity concept should be comprehensive and value-based: a commitment to a stable, secure, resilient, fully functional, open and free Internet and its protection against state and private attacks of any kind.²⁸\n\n---\n\n## # 5.

    "7. ‘This is not a drill’: international law and protection of cybersecurity\nMatthias C. Kettemann and Martin Müller¹\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\n‘Ballistic missile threat inbound to Hawaii. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill.’ This emergency alert was sent out to thousands of Hawaiians on 13 January 2018, at 8:08 a.m. local time.² Luckily, it turned out to be not a drill, but rather the result of human error. An employee, it appeared, had pushed the wrong button (twice). The reactions on social media and in real life – the media was full of stories of scared Hawaiians hiding in garages – tells us a lot about our times both in terms of international security (ballistic missiles threats were a Cold War staple) and in terms of cybersecurity: Human errors can cause real damages – and humans are an integral part of cybersecurity.\n\nThis was the example on how cybersecurity issues are interlinked to general security issues from the first edition. Fast forward 5 years later, a similar example has occurred: During the attack by Hamas terrorists against Israel in October 2023, a hacktivist group named ‘AnonGhost’ managed to exploit flaws in the app ‘Red Alert’, which is used among others in Israel as a missile alert service.³ Similar to the false alarm sent out to Hawaiians, the hackers warned users of an upcoming nuclear attack. Dissimilar, however, this time there was no human error, but an attempt by malicious actors to influence an ongoing conflict.\n\nBe it online or offline,⁴ be it in the kinetic world or in cyberspace, we need norms – and have always needed them. ‘In the long march of mankind from the cave to the computer’, as Malcolm N. Shaw puts it in his introduction to international law, ‘a central role has always\n\n¹ Prof. Dr. Matthias C. Kettemann, LL.M.

Political and legal approaches to preventing cyberwar⁶ and cybercrime⁷ such as the negotiations on a UN Cybercrime Convention⁸ have attracted considerable attention internationally. This study shows that the Internet is critical infrastructure in itself and also functionally essential for other critical infrastructure. The UN General Assembly, in Resolution 64/211 of 21 December 2009, promoted the creation of a global culture of cybersecurity⁹ and expressed concerns in light of growing threats to the reliable functioning of the Internet (technically: ‘of critical information infrastructures and to the integrity of the information carried over those’). These affect ‘domestic, national and international welfare’. The Resolution affirms that states are obliged to deal systematically with these threats and coordinate both with national stakeholders and internationally with the goal of facilitating the achievement of cybersecurity.\n\nThe 2013 Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) report underlined that applying norms derived from ‘existing international law relevant to the use of ICTs by States is an essential measure to reduce risks to international peace, security and stability’. The Charter of the United Nations is applicable to the whole gamut of socio-economic activity on the Internet and thus ‘essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment’.¹⁰ Applying international law to the Internet lies in the common interest and safeguarding the Internet as such also lies in the common interest because a stable, secure and functional Internet is essential for international security. Building on this consensus, the 2015¹¹ report of the GGE again confirmed that international law, the UN Charter and\n\n⁵ Malcolm N.

Common criminals continue to misuse the Internet both for online variants of common scams and for Internet-specific (technology-based) attacks. The size of monetary loss is difficult to evaluate but an often-quoted estimate (e.g. by the European Commission)¹⁵ by Cybersecurity Ventures expects losses of around US$ 8 trillion for the year 2023 worldwide.¹⁶ This threat requires international cooperation. At the same time, some criminal misuses of the Internet are not direct threats to the Internet’s integrity, as criminal networks rely on the Internet to conduct their activities. But other attacks, including disruptive attacks or others not linked to monetary gain (such as attacks to cause social unrest in the introductory Israel example) can amount to substantial threats to cybersecurity and the Internet’s functionality.\n\nDifferent levels of Internet security awareness and capabilities globally matter to all states because of the interconnectedness of ICTs and the networked nature of the Internet. ‘These vulnerabilities are amplified’, the UN’s Group of Governmental Experts on IT and Security complained in 2013, ‘by disparities in national law, regulations and practices related to the use of ICTs’.¹⁷ Only international cooperation in the protection of the Internet can help meet these challenges.

    "Research handbook on human rights and digital technology\n\nAs emphasized in the Cybersecurity Strategy for Germany from 2021, what matters is that ensuring both freedom and security are among the core duties of the state – offline and online:\n\nCitizens must always be able to use technology safely, freely and independently in the future.²⁶\n\nNational documents define cybersecurity differently. The Cybersecurity Strategy for Germany defines cybersecurity as ‘IT security of the networked or network-capable information technology systems in cyberspace’. IT security is understood to be ensuring the ‘IT security is [...] the state in which the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and availability of information and IT are protected by appropriate measures.’²⁷ This definition is very technology-oriented and too short-sighted in light of how cybersecurity is practically perceived by business and society. The security on the Internet and of the Internet cannot simply be equated with the security of systems and data. To view cybersecurity correctly, it must be regarded holistically. Each meaningful cybersecurity concept should be comprehensive and value-based: a commitment to a stable, secure, resilient, fully functional, open and free Internet and its protection against state and private attacks of any kind.²⁸\n\n## 3. PROTECTING CYBERSECURITY LIES IN THE COMMON INTEREST OF ALL STATES\n\n## 3.1 Cybersecurity and the Common Interest\n\nIn 1998, experts working on behalf of the UNESCO posed the question whether the ‘United Nations General Assembly [could] affirm the principle of regarding cyberspace as “the common heritage of humanity”’²⁹ and thus safeguard it. They failed to answer the question, which was well enough because it was the wrong one. It is not ‘cyberspace’ we should concern ourselves with, but rather the Internet itself; and rather than using the concept of common heritage of mankind, which presupposes a certain historical stability the Internet does not have, we rather need to establish why protecting the Internet lies in the global common interest.\n\nDuring the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), which the United Nations convened in 2003 and 2005 to establish a normative trajectory for the Internet, states affirmed their common desire and commitment to build an information society that is ‘people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented’ and in which individuals, communities and peoples can:\n\nMatthias C.

Different normative orders within international law contribute towards achieving these common interests. By establishing finalities for a normative order, such as WSIS has done for Internet governance, the normative development of that order is anchored in the finality of ensuring the common interest, lying in peace, security and development. Creating a people-centred, development-oriented information society is thus part of the broader normative commitment in international law to protecting the common interest of ensuring world peace, international security and development.\n\nWe have thus established that there is a global common interest in ensuring a people-centred and development-oriented information society. But is protecting cybersecurity and thus the Internet’s integrity essential for reaching these goals? UN Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression, Frank La Rue, in a groundbreaking report on the impact of the Internet on freedom of expression, described the Internet as a ‘catalyst for individuals to exercise their right to freedom of opinion and expression’. Freedom of expression on the Internet itself is a ‘facilitator of the realisation of a range of other human rights’.³¹ The multiple challenges that the Internet brings for human rights notwithstanding,³² the absence of the Internet (or of an Internet without cybersecurity) would seriously challenge the realization of human rights. There are important corollary rights that are premised upon exercising free speech on the Internet. These include the freedom of assembly and association online, the right to (digital) education and the right of access to digital knowledge.³³ From all these rights we can also derive a right to access to online information and communication, which is crucial for human development.

    "Research handbook on human rights and digital technology\n\nThe Internet introduces new threat vectors to human rights, but greatly enhances the potential of people to realize their human rights. It is similarly a facilitator for human security.\n\nIn the same vein, the 2013 report of the UN GGE determined that the application of norms derived from existing international law is ‘essential’ to minimize risks to world peace and international security and stability.³⁵ Viewed in the context of information technology challenges, cybersecurity is now one aspect of ‘world peace’.³⁶ When analysing the protection of cybersecurity under international law, the GGE report from 2015,³⁷ and reiterated in 2021,³⁸ which was adopted in consensus by a representative group of governmental experts, is very helpful,³⁹ stating, inter alia, that the international community aspires to regulate the Internet in a peaceful manner ‘for the common good of mankind’.\n\n## 3.2 Ensuing International Legal Duties\n\nProtecting cybersecurity is a common interest of all states. This community interest is not an aggregate of the individual sets of interests; rather, it lies at their intersection. If a protected interest is part of the community interest, this entails consequences relevant to international law. States are therefore responsible to the international community with regard to cybersecurity according to their judicial authority over critical infrastructures pertinent to it.⁴⁰\n\nTo the extent that a state controls Critical Internet Resources (CIRs), it has to exercise this jurisdiction mindful of threats to cybersecurity and especially the security of these CIRs in a manner that ensures the common interest. To the extent that national politics (and policies) can impact the Internet negatively, a state has to refrain from their formulation and implementation. A state’s sovereignty is reduced because of the limits the protection of the Internet as a common interest lays upon him. The United States, as former delegated manager of the CIRs, therefore only had ‘custodial sovereignty’.⁴¹ This implied that the United States had to enter into consultations with other states with regard to the management of CIRs and make sure that the management was transparent and accountable, ideally to the international community\n\n³⁵ Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, A/68/98 (24 June 2013) para. 16.\n³⁶ Ibid.\n³⁷ GGE Report (2015), n. 11 above.\n³⁸ Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, A/76/135 (14 July 2021) ('GGE Report (2021)') para. 5, 71(e).\n³⁹ Members: Belarus, Brazil, China, Colombia, Egypt, Estonia, France, Germany, Ghana, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Russian Federation, Spain, United Kingdom and United States.\n⁴⁰ For documentation of the reports of individual member states, see the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, www.un.org/disarmament/topics/informationsecurity.\n⁴¹ See W.

    "'This is not a drill'\n\nand now, after the transition,⁴² to the global multi-stakeholder community.⁴³ All other states, insofar as they can endanger the Internet’s stability, security and functionality, are pre-empted from doing so. In assessing whether politics may impact the Internet negatively, it makes sense to suggest the precautionary principle as a guide to decision-making.⁴⁴\n\nA second consequence is that humankind – that is all actors making up the international community, and not only states – have a legitimate interest in making sure that all other actors protect the Internet (or at least do not actively harm it). Though sovereignty-oriented states⁴⁵ have suggested exclusive sovereignty over national Internet segments, the character of the Internet, as protected by international law as a common interest, limits their sovereignty. The 2005 Tunis Agenda, though valuable in its description of the normative goals of the information society, still lays down that ‘policy authority for internet-related public policy issues’ is a ‘sovereign right of States’.⁴⁶ This needs to be qualified in light of a common interest approach to protecting the Internet in that the states’ policy authority is no longer an exclusively sovereign right, but part and parcel of their sovereignty, to be exercised in the common interest. What sovereignty they have over Internet-related resources has to be understood in light of changing circumstances and the importance of the pursuance of common interests. As far as international law extends to non-state actors, these are also under obligation to support the pursuance, by state actors, of the global interest in safeguarding the Internet’s integrity.

    "Research handbook on human rights and digital technology\n\nInternational law has arrived at a point in its development where pursuing the common interest, as Bardo Fassbender put it, is the only reasonable answer to its Sinnfrage.48 Ensuring a people-centric and development-oriented Internet is one of the key challenges for international law today.

International law is needed to legitimately and effectively ensure cybersecurity in the common interest of all states. This is not a new insight.50 Without legitimate and effective protection of cybersecurity under international law, individuals and societies cannot develop to their full potential.

Although treaties provide (legal) certainty (especially in the eyes of powerful states or states relying on traditional sovereignty concepts),⁵⁴ bilateral cybersecurity treaties usually do not live up to the complexity of the issue due to the universality of the Internet, while multilateral treaties can only be attained through lengthy negotiation processes with an uncertain outcome.⁵⁵ There is still no treaty on cybersecurity, though.⁵⁶ Binding international law on cybersecurity can therefore only be derived to date from customary international law and the principles of international law.\n\n## 4.3 Cybersecurity and Customary International Law\n\nIn the Tunis Agenda, adopted at the UN World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), and in the Tunis Commitment (2005) (building on the Geneva documents of 2003), the signatory states of the world committed themselves to a:\n\npeople-centered, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society, premised on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, international law and multilateralism, and respecting fully and upholding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights⁵⁷\n\n⁵² The scope of this study does not allow for going into detail on all applicable principles of international law.

Communicators, recipients and the contents of communications are protected by Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), parts of which are based on customary law. Along with these state obligations based on individual human rights (prohibiting states from interfering with certain communicative rights), positive obligations related to Internet infrastructure can also be derived from the state obligations to provide protection and assurance pertaining to information- and communication-related rights. States are therefore obliged to ensure the sustainability and security of the networks in order to allow individuals to realize their human rights.\n\nParticularly relevant to ensuring and promoting cybersecurity are the following principles of international law,⁶⁰ some of which have been translated into treaty law in the UN Charter, are protected under customary international law or are recognized as part of the general principles of international law: sovereign equality, the ban on aggression and intervention, peaceful settlement of disputes, the protection of human rights, the cooperation principle (which draws on the principle of good neighbourliness (‘no harm’) and the precautionary principle (‘due diligence’)).\n\nThe principle of sovereign equality (UN Charter, Article 2(1)) is a key principle of international law. As a ‘pivotal principle’⁶¹ it is also of special importance for cybersecurity. Each state has jurisdiction and power over its territory and over the ICT infrastructure located there; this also means, however, that it bears a responsibility to ensure that no attacks against other states or institutions, which would infringe on international law, are organized or carried out from its territory.\n\nIn addition, the non-intervention principle (UN Charter, Article 2(7)) can be brought to fruition: an intense damage to Internet functionality in another state (e.g. by cyber-attacks) could constitute an intervention, although attribution problems will regularly arise.⁶² Only some of the attacks originating from the territory of a state represent an ‘intervention’ in terms of international law, because most attacks will be attributable to non-governmental protagonists or to protagonists whose association with governmental agencies cannot be proven.⁶³\n\n⁵⁸ Ibid. no. 3.\n⁵⁹ WSIS, Tunis Agenda for the Information Society, WSIS-05/TUNIS/DOC/6 (Rev. 1)-G (18 November 2005) no. 31.\n⁶⁰ GGE Report (2015), n. 11 above, para. 26.\n⁶¹ Samantha Besson, ‘Sovereignty’ in Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), MPEPIL (2011) para. 1.\n⁶² Sven-Hendrik Schulze, Cyber-‘War’, Testfall der Staatenverantwortlichkeit (Tübingen: Mohr, 2015).\n⁶³ See GGE Report (2015), n. 11 above: ‘the indication that an ICT activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or the ICT infrastructure of a State may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that State.

    "'This is not a drill'\n\nThe ban on aggression (UN Charter, Article 2(4)) prohibits states from using measures of power beyond simple ‘intervention’ (the former being stated in the non-intervention principle). In the context of the Internet, this Article could only be applied to especially serious cases of cyber-attacks with substantial kinetic effects.\n\nThe principle of peaceful settlement of disputes is relevant to cybersecurity insofar as any state has the duty, in the event of an incident, to first determine the facts and to collect evidence for attribution of a breach of international law to a particular state. Even if this succeeds, peaceful means of dispute settlement should first be sought.\n\nThe principle of the protection of human rights is a fundamental principle of international law that is also relevant to cybersecurity. What is problematic under international law are attempts by a state to enforce cybersecurity through an excessive control of the Internet (such as setting up and using surveillance capabilities or government screening of all Internet communication).\n\nThe principle of good neighbourliness (UN Charter, Article 74), or ‘no harm’ principle, can be considered as a global principle in the Internet era. Originally only relevant in terms of the relationship with adjacent states, the principle has been gradually extended.^[64]^ In the Corfu Channel case, the International Court of Justice described the principle as ‘every state’s obligation not to knowingly allow its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states’.^[65]^ The ‘no harm’ principle has its roots in the Trail Smelter^[66]^ and Lake Lanoux^[67]^ cases. It was formulated in Principle 21 of the Stockholm Declaration (1972)^[68]^ and Principle 2 of the Rio Declaration (1992):^[69]^ signatory states are committed ‘to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction’. This can easily be applied to other areas in analogy to the environment.\n\nThe obligation to prevent cross-border damage has crystallized into customary law. Contractual confirmation can be found in Article 194(2) of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea^[70]^ and Article 20(1) of the ASEAN Agreement on the Conservation of Nature and\n\nMatthias C.

Most recently, the ICJ confirmed in the Nuclear Weapons case⁷¹ that the threat to the environment is ‘no abstraction but represents the living space, the quality of life and the very health of human beings, including generations unborn’. In accordance with the ‘no harm’ principle, no state may utilize its dominion in such a manner that would cause damage to other states. In the preventive dimension of the ‘no harm’ principle, a state must take measures to prevent such hazards. Among other things, a commitment to an appropriate infrastructure, the development of emergency plans and the establishment of an international crisis cooperation structure (and culture) can be construed from this.\n\nThe precautionary principle (‘due diligence’) is of special importance for cybersecurity. First, the due diligence principle entails information and consultation obligations.⁷² In the scientific world, it is controversial as to what extent the precautionary principle has a ‘due diligence’ dimension or whether the precautionary obligations of states are covered in practice by the ‘no harm’ principle. The principle of due diligence was also applied in the field of combating terrorism and the financing of terrorism.⁷³\n\n## 4.4 Shift Towards Due Diligence\n\nWith some justification, normative principles for the regulation of cybersecurity can therefore be derived from the principle of due diligence. As a result, it is the responsibility of states, inter alia, ensuing from this principle, to prevent cyber-attacks originating from their own territory and to (proactively) establish a legal system that ensures and fosters cybersecurity.⁷⁴ This can be fulfilled, for instance, by ‘passing stringent criminal laws, conducting vigorous investigations, prosecuting attackers, and, during the investigation and prosecution, cooperating with the victim-states of cyberattacks that originated from within their borders’.⁷⁵\n\nIn its preventive dimension, the due diligence principle helps to identify the obligations of states with regard to cybersecurity, particularly with regard to cybercrime, global cooperation and establishment of capacities. Cybersecurity due diligence was described as part of customary international law, whereby particularly the following preventive duties have emerged as recognized obligations under international law:\n\n- that governments and other stakeholders bolster cybersecurity and develop cybersecurity strategies to protect crucial infrastructures;⁷⁶\n\nMatthias C.

EMBRACING CYBERSECURITY NORMS IN INTERNATIONAL LAW\n\nAny attempt to embrace cybersecurity in international law must be preceded by the recognition of the significance of the multi-stakeholder approach in the normative development of international Internet law.⁸³ Since the process of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) began, with just a few exceptions, states have been committing to the integration of all stakeholders in the normative processes relevant to Internet regulation.

They can only offer the opportunity for states (or other stakeholders) to accomplish preparatory work relevant to the normative process. Jointly discussing 'norms' can be useful, because common values will be expressed already in the process of discussion[85] and the positions taken by participating states serve as indications of their attitudes toward an international juridification of cybersecurity.\n\nA promising approach for embracing binding cybersecurity norms in international law in the long term is the negotiation and adoption of an international treaty. It remains the 'gold standard' of international law and is the most important authoritative source of law. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,[86] which entered into force on 4 November 2016, has shown that even today international treaties covering complex topics such as regulations relating to global public goods (for example, cybersecurity as a prerequisite for a well-functioning Internet) can be successfully concluded.\n\n# 6. SUMMARY\n\nIn the light of the importance of the Internet for states, business and society, cybersecurity – as a prerequisite for a reliably functioning and secure Internet – has become a global community interest which needs protection. The technologicalization and informationalization of many key infrastructure provision functions and of many industry control systems open up new vulnerabilities within states that can threaten, if an attack is substantial, international peace and security. Similarly, the increased use of mobile devices, Cloud computing and the use of social networks increases the vulnerability of citizens to acts of cybercrime.\n\nCybersecurity is a key functional condition for an era defined by information and communications technology. A secure Internet lies in the interest of each individual state and also collectively in the interest of all states of the world as a global community. Cybersecurity thus lies in the global common interest. It has a key security interest for which all the states of the world bear separate and common responsibility. This responsibility must be met through an application of the principles and processes of international law.\n\nInternational law is to be fully applied to the Internet, including with regard to regulating cybersecurity. Customary international law and the general principles of international law particularly restrict (and define) national Internet policy. Consequently, each state has protection obligations vis-à-vis the international community – to avert threats to the stability, integrity and functionality of the Internet – which can be derived from customary international law. At the same time, states may not restrict freedom on the Internet without limitation under the\n\nMatthias C.
